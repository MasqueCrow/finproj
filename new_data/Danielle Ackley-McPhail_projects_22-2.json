[{"backer": "Danielle Ackley-McPhail", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "CORVID-19: A RavenCon Anthology\n2020 has been a challenging year for all of us. No one expected the world to come to a grinding halt. No one expected stores to run out of toilet paper, or the Tiger King to be a thing on Netflix, but here we are.\nAfter planning, prepping, and purchasing all of the supplies for our 2020 event, the pandemic hit. Everything started shutting down. Conventions and all in-person events were cancelled.  RavenCon led the way, putting our guests' safety above all else, and we were one of the first to cancel\u20143 weeks before the convention. We had spent eleven months purchasing supplies for an event that wasn\u2019t going to happen. \nAs a fan-run convention, we pride ourselves in being there for emerging artists, writers, and vendors. We may be small, but our heart is mighty.\nWe know the community is vital to many of you. Conventions are a way to meet with your friends, to make new friends and new connections. To boldly go where you haven't been before, and to come together as a family. We don't want this to end, but 2020 was certainly bent on it. This is where we need your help.\nMichael Pederson had an idea (a lot of RavenCon stories start with this sentence, by the way).  Why not make something everyone can enjoy? We are all home much more often now; what's better than reading a good book? So, we reached out to our past guests, and began collecting our \"tribute\" to 2020: CORVID-19, an anthology. Yes, you read that right. CORVID-19. An anthology themed around the corvidae family of birds\u2014ravens, crows, bluejays, magpies, etc.\nOur generous and talented author friends have donated their stories, now we need your help to get this published. You can also support the convention so we can thrive for years to come. \nWe have something for everyone! You can choose to be a major or minor character in a book! Maybe you want to be a Red Shirt and get killed off? We have that too. Want stickers? We have that. Want help with the story you're writing? We got you! Mad for music? We hear you. Take a look at the list of pledge levels and for ways to help support us. \nWe couldn't run RavenCon without you. We thank you for everything you have helped us with over the last 15 years, and we don't want this pandemic to take that away. \nThank you for sharing our project, for supporting us, and we look forward to seeing you when we can be face to face again. \nWhat exactly are the nineteen corvid-filled stories in this 210-page volume of awesomeness? Just look at what we\u2019ve got\u2026\n\u201cWindows to the Soul\u201d by Danielle Ackley-McPhail\n\u201cRaven\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d by Heather Ewings\n\u201cThe Cruelest Team Will Win\u201d by Mike Allen\n\u201cJenny\u201d by Debbie Manber Kupfer\n\u201cDaughter of the Birds\u201d by Maya Preisler\n\u201cKvetina and the Crows\u201d by Rhys Schrock\n\u201cCorvus Monitus\u201d by Cass Morris\n\u201cIf the Moon is Real\u201d by Samantha Bryant\n\u201cLife in a Moment\u201d by James Maxey\n\u201cCrows\u2019 Feet\u201d by Diana Bastine\n\u201cA Warning of Crows\u201d by Jennifer R.

Once we reach our first stretch goal of $4000, everyone who is getting the book will get a digital copy of The Second Wave. \nMy feathers are a flutter just thinking about this! Or maybe that\u2019s just a bad hamberder.)\n\n*Update! Our second stretch goal of $4500 wil get everyone who supported us at the $10 or more level will also be getting a limited-edition bookmark and button made exclusively for this kickstarter! \nCORVID-19 Button\n*Update!

Last year, to honor those halcyon days, I conceived of Thrilling Adventure Yarns and invited a ton of friends, old and new, to join me in this celebration.\nI then turned to you, the discerning reader, for support. I was stunned and gratified to not only meet my objective but far, far exceed it. We earned 248% of the goal, which allowed me to bring our readers a number of attractive and exciting options I would not have been able to provide otherwise.\nWe had fun producing the book, and our reviews and personal comments were almost all laudatory. The common question was, \u201cWhen is the next book?\u201d The answer is February. \nThe second common question was, \"When is the next Thrilling Adventures Kickstarter?\"\nThe answer is: NOW!\nAs part of Crazy 8 Press\u2019 10th-anniversary celebration, we will release a second volume, once more packed with all genres of pulp goodness, with several returning authors along with new ones. Several characters from our first volume will be making second appearances here, including Cannon Belle! Other Crazy 8 characters will also be appearing here, including a tale from the Crimson Keep and Angela Hardwicke, private detective!\nJoining me on this journey will be C8\u2019s Aaron Rosenberg, Michael Jan Friedman, Glenn Hauman, Mary Fan, Paul Kupperberg, and Russ Colchamiro.\nReturning will be David Mack, Paige Daniels, Will Murray, and Karissa Laurel.\nNew to this volume will be William Leisner, Danielle Ackley McPhail, Dayton Ward & Kevin Dilmore, Greg Cox, Heather E. Hutsell, Kelli Fitzpatrick, Michael A. Burstein, Richard White, Scott Pearson, and Sherri Cook Woosley.\nAnother Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished detective tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign.\nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns\u2014in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable artist Gary Carbon. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur Goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $6000, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la Carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package\u2014to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't. Just take any existing package of $25 and up, and add to it the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list. Then send us a message letting us know what additional reward or rewards you've qualified for. (International backers, there will be some additional postage; if you're interested in an add-on, shoot us a message and we'll figure it out.)\nGet listed as a patron on the acknowledgments page  $10.\nReceive a one-time mention as a character, street, company, etc.  $35.\nE-book package #1 $20.\nE-book package #2 $20.\nE-book package #3 $20.\nPackage #1 includes Lost Days by Michael Jan Friedman, Cats Triumphant by Jody Lynn Nye, The Wild Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Will Murray, Harbinger of Darkness by Richard C. White, and Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn by Day Al-Mohamed and Danielle Ackley-Mcphail.\nPackage #2 includes Transcendence and The Halfling's Court by Danielle Ackley McPhail, Flynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil, by Mary Fan, Altered States of the Union, edited by Glenn Hauman, In the Services of the Guild by Tina Closser, and \"Midnight Rider\" by David Mack.\nPackage #3 includes In My Shorts by Paul Kupperberg, Crackle and Fire by Russ Colchamiro, One Haunted Summer by Aaron Rosenberg, Eternal Wanderings by Danielle Ackley-McPhail, and \"Our Possible Pasts\" by David Mack\nFor $25 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition (after the option is unlocked, of course).\nStretch Goals!\nUNLOCKED! At $7000 we unlock \"the hardcover option,\" allowing any backer whose reward includes a paperback copy to upgrade to a handsome hardback version of Thrilling Adventure Yarns 2021 (see A La Carte menu above).\nUNLOCKED! At $7250, I will be able to include a story from Stuart Moore, an editor/writer with credits from St. Martin's Press, Vertigo Comics, Marvel Comics, and currently Ahoy! Comics. His previous prose works include collaborations with Stan Lee and several Marvel novels.\nAt $7500, I will be able to include a story from veteran comics writer Ron Marz, whose credits span from Witchblade to Green Lantern, from DC vs. Marvel to Batman/Aliens. His work speaks for itself and here he'll be making a rare prose appearance.\nAt $7750, I will be able to include a story from Jody Lynn Nye, the prolific author of over 40 books and more than 120 short stories, spanning genres. \n$8000, I will be able to include a story from the possibly even more prolific Jonathan Maberry, he of V-Wars and Joe Ledger fame. The multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author continues to write and edit across genres.\nAt $8500 we will upgrade those receiving one signature to three signatures from our illustrious cadre of authors. (See Risks and Challenges for options.)\nAt $9000 we can send everyone a digital art set of images, suitable for your digital wallpaper.\nAt $10,000, it will allow me to hire a cadre of talented artists to render a black and white illustration for each and every story in the collection. Last time, we had work from Mark Wheatley, Peter Krause, Jerry Ordway, Karl Kesel, and Tom Mandrake. We're already lining up several new names should we reach this level!\nAt $10,500 we will up our guarantee of three autographs per print edition to five autographs. (See Risks and Challenges for options.).\nAt $12,000 we will have a Kickstarter-exclusive cover from Richard Pace, who has illustrated for Vertigo and Marvel and has also co-written Dale Keown\u2019s Pitt and Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham and is the co-creator, with Mark Russell, of the hit indie AHOY Comics series Second Coming. Only backers will receive this exclusive edition in softcover and/or hardcover.\nWe'll be announcing other stretch goals as our campaign develops.

Butler & Joshua Palmatier (WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE).\nTHE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY:\nIn this follow-up to THE MODERN FAE'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY, we switch our attention to how the deities of old have managed to fit themselves into today's modern world! Is Narcissus an Instagram influencer? Is Coyote playing the stock market? Does Ra own a solar panel company? Was Dr. Ruth really Venus? How have the gods and goddesses managed to survive alongside cell phones and computers and social media influencers? We invite authors to explore how the immortals have changed with the times.\nEdited by Patricia Bray & Joshua Palmatier, THE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors (and the gods they may use) include:\nAlma Alexander (Freyja: Nordic),\nDavid Farland (Woden/Odin: German),\nTanya Huff (Hera: Greek),\nJuliet E. McKenna (Nemesis/Themis: Greek),\nPhyllis Irene Radford (Anshar/Tiamet: Babylonian),\nLaura Resnick (assorted),\nKari Sperring (Cigfa, Goewin, Gwydion: Welsh),\nJean Marie Ward (Dionysus: Greek), and\nEdward Willett (Ninkasi: Sumerian)\nDERELICT:\nNo one can resist the mystery of the abandoned ship--whether it's the ghost ship found afloat at sea in the Bermuda Triangle or the spaceship drifting in the depths of space a la the movie Alien. What happened to the crew? What horror forced them to abandon their vessel and flee\u2026or are they still on board, trapped or even all dead? In this anthology, we want authors to explore all of the possibilities when one runs across\u2026a DERELICT.\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, DERELICT will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each. Anchor authors include:\nJacey Bedford,\nAlex Bledsoe,\nGerald Brandt,\nJulie E. Czerneda,\nKate Elliott,\nJohn G. Hemry/Jack Campbell,\nD.B. Jackson,\nGini Koch,\nSharon Lee & Steve Miller, and\nKristine Smith\nWHEN WORLDS COLLIDE:\nThroughout history, different cultures have collided in different ways, whether it be the peaceful contact between Rome and Han China in the second century that established the Silk Road, or the more violent interactions between Europe and the Americas thirteen hundred years later. Such first contact stories have long been a staple of speculative fiction. The stories featured in WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE will continue this long tradition as the authors explore the myriad ways in which two cultures\u2014alien or fae, machine or human\u2014can clash. Will the colliding societies manage to peacefully coexist after they finally meet? Or will they embark instead on a path of mutual self-destruction? Find out\u2014WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE.\nEdited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include:\nS.C. Butler,\nEsther Friesner,\nAuston Habershaw,\nSteven Harper,\nNancy Holzner,\nHoward Andrew Jones,\nStephen Leigh,\nViolette Malan, and\nAlan Smale\nBackers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade paperback edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run.\nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition!\nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors.

The cover art for \u201cThe Modern Deity's Guide to Surviving Humanity\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter.\n\"The Modern Deity's Guide to Surviving Humanity\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nThe following is a Reward Level Rundown for most of the rewards where the backer will get all three of the three anthologies in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback format. There are a few reward levels not listed, such as those where the backer gets only one or two of the anthologies in either format, as well as a few special reward levels where the backer will get ALL of the currently-available backlist from Zombies Need Brains in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback--those three levels are ZNB Ebook Zombie, ZNB Kickstarter Zombie, and ZNB Ebook Kickstarter Zombie.\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2020.

Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 8 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch goals would include an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2021. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

I hope this gets you excited for what's coming next and that I'll see you all as backers when the time comes!

I'll be working on the cover art in the meantime, so that hopefully we'll be able to hand the anthologies off to the printer sometime in April. Finger crossed we get them back by June. Once I hand them over, it's more or less out of our hands and up to the printer's schedule."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "COVER ART!!!!", "update_content": "So I've got cover art to reveal for the WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and DERELICT anthologies!

You can get prints of the art at the Zombies Need Brains online store for $10 each, wallpapers are also available at $2 each (3 sizes), and of course you can preorder the Kickstarter edition and the ebooks for any of the three new anthologies as well.\n\nWe've narrowed the slush stories down and picked what we want to fill out the anthologies as well.

You have one week to download them before the link expires! So download them NOW, rather than later.

Remember, the three new anthologies won't go out until summer next year, so these surveys are more for those that got add-ons or special rewards that need to be shipped now rather than later (for holiday gifts or whatever).

They send out a couple messages, but if you haven't fixed the problem by a certain date, your pledge gets dropped.\nAlso wanted to remind everyone that if you included some extra money in your pledge for an add-on, you should send me a message NOW about what those add-ons were. Experience tells me that by the time all the money changes hands and I get around to sending out the surveys, most people have forgotten exactly what they'd planned on getting with that extra money.

This book has been long delayed due to health concerns and issues with the past publisher of the series. After long last, and thanks to the help of author Keith R.A. DeCandido, we bring you the final installment of this hard-core military science fiction novel where humanity fights for its very existence. (For those new to the series, books 1 and 2, ISSUE IN DOUBT and IN ALL DIRECTIONS, are available through the add-on section or via specific pledge reward levels.)\nIn addition, we also present a brand-new series by veteran Star-Trek author Christopher L. Bennett. ARACHNE'S CRIME--the first book in a planned duology set in in a universe of the author's original creation--sets out to explore deep space and ends up in a harrowing encounter with new races, in a twisted tale of blame and redemption where responsibility and motives are not as clear as they may seem.\nWon't you help us make these books a reality?\nThe primary goal for this campaign will fund the production of both books and the fulfillment of pledge rewards. The authors receive an equal share of 50% of the profits raised thereafter, with 50% invested in the press to meet promotional and operational needs.\nIf science fiction isn't your thing, you can still help support us. You can choose the IMPARTIAL OBSERVER reward level and pledge a sufficient amount to claim the book or books you would like from our Add-Ons section below.

He has written about US Marines in Vietnam (the Night Fighters series and three other novels), and the DemonTechseries about Marines in a fantasy world. The 18th Race trilogy is military science fiction.\nOther than military, he wrote a non-conventional vampire novel, The Hunt, and a mystery, Dead Man's Chest. He has also released a collection of short fiction and non-fiction from early in his writing career, Sherman's Shorts; the Beginnings.\nWith Dan Cragg he wrote the popular Starfist series and its spin-off series, Starfist: Force Recon\u2014all about Marines in the Twenty-fifth Century.; and a Star Wars novel, Jedi Trial. His books have been translated into Czech, Polish, German, and Japanese.\nAfter going to war as a U.S. Marine infantryman, and spending decades writing about young men at war, he's burnt out on the subject and has finally come home. Today he's writing short fiction, mostly steampunk, and farcical fantastic Westerns.\nHe lives in sunny South Florida, where he doesn't have to worry about hypothermia or snow-shoveling-induced heart attacks. He invites readers to visit his website, novelier.com.\nKeith R.A. DeCandido is a writer and editor of more than three decades' standing (though he usually does them sitting down). He is the author of more than 50 novels, more than 100 short stories, around 75 comic books, and more nonfiction than he is really willing to count. Included in those credits is fiction in the worlds of Star Trek, Alien, Farscape, Doctor Who, Andromeda, BattleTech, and many other science fiction milieus, as well as in universes of his own creation (such as the \"Precinct\" series of fantasy police procedurals, also published by the fine folks at eSpec).As an editor, he has worked with dozens of authors, among them Mike W. Barr, Alfred Bester, Margaret Wander Bonanno, Adam-Troy Castro, Peter David, Diane Duane, Harlan Ellison, Tony Isabella, Stan Lee, Tanith Lee, David Mack, David Michelinie, Andre Norton, Robert Silverberg, Dean Wesley Smith, S.P. Somtow, Harry Turtledove, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and Roger Zelazny. Having edited David Sherman's first two 18th Race books, Issue in Doubt and In All Directions, he is honored to assist him in finishing the trilogy by coauthoring To Hell and Regroup with him. Keith is also a martial artist (he got his third-degree black belt in karate in 2017), a musician (currently with the parody band Boogie Knights), and a baseball fan (having avidly followed the New York Yankees since 1976). Find out less about Keith as his cheerfully retro web site at DeCandido.net.\nChristopher L. Bennett is a lifelong resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, with a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in History from the University of Cincinnati. A fan of science and science fiction since age five, he has spent the past two decades selling original short fiction to magazines such as Analog Science Fiction and Fact (home of his \"Hub\" series of comedy adventures), BuzzyMag, and Galaxy's Edge. Since 2003, he has been one of Pocket Books' most prolific and popular authors of Star Trek tie-in fiction, including the epic Next Generation prequel The Buried Age, the Enterprise -- Rise of the Federation series, and the Original Series prequel The Captain's Oath. He has also written two Marvel Comics novels, X-Men: Watchers on the Walls and Spider-Man: Drowned in Thunder. His original novel Only Superhuman, perhaps the first hard science fiction superhero novel, was voted Library Journal's SF/Fantasy Debut of the Month for October 2012. He has three collections reprinting his original short fiction, Among the Wild Cybers: Tales Beyond the Superhuman from eSpec Books (containing an original Only Superhuman prequel novelette) and Hub Space: Tales from the Greater Galaxy and Crimes of the Hub from Mystique Press.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the books proposed in this campaign have already begun production.

She loves stories about brave princesses and spends a lot of time with her imaginary friend, Waldo. But one day her friend goes missing, and no one will believe her or take her growing concern seriously. Marymae can feel something is not right, and so decides she must go find him. But there\u2019s something odd happening in the Forest of Make-Believe; those that were noble are now hiding away, inky shadows snake through the trees, and a growing darkness threatens to engulf even the bravest heart.\nThis illustrated novelette is filled with colorful characters, whimsical and crazy situations, and a powerful theme of having hope - even when surrounded by despair. Marymae has the sweetness and straightforwardness that only a child could have - which makes for many touching and hilarious moments as she finds herself gallivanting through the ever darkening Make-Believe Forest. Enjoy the journey with her as she discovers how to be a light to inspire courage in those around her, and how to love even the most broken heart.\nIt's a book that will uplift and inspire you with touching moments, while it makes you laugh at the absurdities of little girls and pirates wielding chainsaws!\nWho will love Marymae and the Nightmare Man?\nAnyone who enjoys a good story!\nWhen writing Marymae, I wanted to capture that feeling of imagination and simplicity of childhood. Something that as adults we can get lost in, and enjoy the flow of the dramatic and the silly, to join the characters on their journey as they spring from one thing to the next. A refreshing light to illuminate the mundane every day.\nChildren and Parents!\nReading to your children has endless benefits:\nIt builds listening skills and imagination.\nReading comprehension.\nMakes reading fun and something they\u2019ll want to do.\nA wonderful time to bound.\nSo many wonderful things! Even if your child can already read, don\u2019t be afraid to read them books above their level. Good stories are meant to be shared, and there\u2019s no age restriction on a good story!\n\nWhat will the book look like?\nThe story runs about 11,500 words, will have a minimum of 10 illustrations, and be approximately 50 pages. It will be printed in 6x9, making it easy to store on your bookshelf.\nOne of the goals of this campaign is to provide the funding to commission more amazing art, which will increase the illustration and page count. See more details below.\n\nThe Stretch Goals:\nStretch Goal #1 $3,900 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 18 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS 1 bonus Art Print added to all Physical Perk tiers!\nStretch Goal #2 $5,200 - +7 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 25 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS every backer will receive a digital file with the concept art and character designs of: Marymae, Waldo, the Noble Pirates, and the Nightmare Man.\nStretch Goal #3: $6,600 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 33 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS all books will be upgraded and printed on Premium Paper\nStretch Goal #4 $7,900 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 41 pieces of art to enjoy!

When you look at stories\u2014and the way we talk about stories\u2014there\u2019s this sense that when a woman becomes a mother, she ceases to be the heroine. Instead, she\u2019s relegated to a supporting role for her children, who are now meant to be the center of her life and the only reason for her existence. There are exceptions, as there are in everything, but overall, we\u2019re left with the impression that once a woman becomes Mom, her tale ends. Mother figures also rarely figure into fiction the way father figures do. It\u2019s not often that the wise or experienced elder sought out by a young protagonist is a woman.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: A heroine doesn\u2019t stop being a heroine because a kid came into her life.\nSo I'm putting together this anthology to turn the spotlight on bad ass moms. This is inspired in part, of course, by my own bad ass mom, who emigrated from China to the U.S. fresh out of school, got her PhD in statistics, and named me after her personal heroine and another bad ass mom, Marie Curie (Mary and Marie are the same name in Chinese).\nSince moms and badassery come in infinite forms, I gave the contributing authors only one criterion: that their story be about a bad ass mother or mother figure. We\u2019ve got moms across the age and experience spectrum, from grandmas to new moms. We've got warrior moms and moms who are bad ass in a quieter way. We\u2019ve got biological moms, adoptive moms, and mom figures. A mom who runs a space colony, a hard-boiled detective mom, a witch mom, a coach who\u2019s a mom figure to her students\u2026 and much, much more.\nTo bring these stories to life, I've partnered with the Crazy 8 Press crew: Russ Colchamiro, Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman, Robert Greenberger, Glenn Hauman, Paul Kupperberg, and Aaron Rosenberg. \nI've also assembled a fantastic line-up of additional authors (some of whom are bad ass moms themselves!): Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Derek Tyler Attico, T. Eric Bakutis,  Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Heather E. Hutsell, Kris Katzen, Karissa Laurel, Khaalidah Muhammad-Ali, TJ Perkins, Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg, Joanna Schnurman, Hildy Silverman, and Denise Sutton.\nAnd who am I? Hi, I'm Mary Fan, author of sci-fi/fantasy books about intrepid heroines, including Stronger Than a Bronze Dragon, Artificial Absolutes, and Starswept. Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, Booklist, and Kirkus liked my books, so I guess I get to call myself \"critically acclaimed.\" I'm also the co-editor of the Brave New Girls anthology series about girls in STEM.\nOur awesome cover art is the work of Sean \"MunkyWrench\" Eddingfield (background art) and Streetlight Graphics (design and layout).\nThis a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package. Just take any existing package of $35 and up and add the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list.

If we reach this goal, every backer receiving a physical reward will get a BAD ASS MOMS bookmark and fridge magnet! We will add the following BAD ASS MOMS swag options to the rewards: mini poster of the cover, enamel pin, t-shirt, tote bag.

My back-up plans have back-up plans.\n\nI'm also very familiar with marketing and giveaways. Brave New Girls was the product of a crowd-funding campaign (meant for a single anthology, but we out-raised our goal and found a publishing model that meant we could publish several more).

This marks my 17th published novel and my 7th crowdfunding campaign. I'm thrilled that two books in the series have made the New York Times Bestsellers list, three of the books became USA Today bestsellers, and three have made it onto the Washington Post Hardcover bestseller list on multiple occasions. This campaign has become the third most-backed and fourth most-funded fiction Kickstarter of all time.\nWell, we are down to our last one hour of the Kickstarter, and Robin and I wanted to say . . .\nto all backers old and new.  Your support of our work is truly amazing and we appreciate the faith you have put into the series and us in making this our best Kickstarter yet.  \nAnd for anyone who might have missed this Kickstarter, we have your back!  You'll be able to join the fun through the manual add process of Kickstarter. Just use this link and we'll get you added.\nAnd keep your eyes open for updates from Kickstarter and emails from BackerKit as we start rolling out the rewards!  We'll keep you in the loop!\nWhat is the book about? Here's the marketing copy from the back cover:\nA DOOR OPENS. AN ARMY OF DRAGONS ADVANCE. AND THE FATE OF THE LIVING RESTS WITH THE DEAD.\nAfter obtaining the secret to creating dragons, the leader of the Fhrey has turned the tide of war once more--but gaining the advantage has come at a terrible price. While Imaly plots to overthrow the fane for transgressions against his people, a mystic and a keeper are the only hope for the Rhunes. Time is short, and the future of both races hangs in the balance. In this exciting conclusion to the Legends of the First Empire series, the Great War finally comes to a climactic end, and with it dawns a new era in the Age of Empyre.\nFor returning readers, recaps are available so you can be reminded about what has happened so far. \nWant to check out my writing style? Well, it's a bit tricky because this book opens in the middle of the story, and I didn't want to expose people to spoilers. So to help mitigate that, I took the sample chapter and redacted the names by doing substitutions. I should note that this sample hasn't yet gone through copyediting, but it should be in relatively good shape.  Another spoiler-free option would be to read from the start of the series, so I included a sample chapter to Age of Myth (the first book of the series) as well.\nAge of Myth Sample Chapter\nAge of Empyre redacted Sample Chapter\nThis project mirrors my other Kickstarters, but for new people, I'm summarizing some important aspects of what you'll receive.\nAll physical books come signed: a perk for ordering the books directly from me.\nAll ebooks are DRM-free, which means you can load them on any device: computer, smartphone, and tablet without any locking feature preventing you from moving it from place to place.\nFor backing this project, your name will be printed in the Acknowledgment Section so everyone will know that you are an awesome supporter of the project (you can, of course, opt-out if you choose)\nThe official release through the retail channels is May 5, 2020, but all levels with ebooks will receive the story in March.\nFor the levels that provide a physical book, we've bundled the ebook to ensure early access to the story. If you don't want to pay for the ebook (for instance you only want a physical copy), there will be a process for you to pre-order just the hardcover after the Kickstarter is over.\nAnyone receiving the physical book will also receive a matching signed bookmark. If you choose a reward level with multiple books, each of them will also have a matching bookmark.\nIf you are missing one or more of the previous ebooks, you can purchase some of them here (use DIGITAL DOUBLE TROUBLE, DIGITAL THREE BOOK NIGHT, or the \"add-on\" feature) to get copies of Age of Legend, Age of Death, or extra copies of Age of Empyre for a friend. Unfortunately, we can't make the other ebooks available (Age of Myth, Age of Swords, and Age of War) because the rights are owned by Penguin Random House, and only they can sell copies of those titles. So, you'll have to buy books #1 through #3 from your favorite ebook retailer.\nIf you are missing one or more of the prior hardcovers, this Kickstarter is the best way to get them. Not only will they be signed, but they are sold at a discount ($25 rather than $27 or $28). Also, we have significantly discounted the shipping costs for people located outside the US, and future purchases won't have the \"bulk shipping\" advantage that a Kickstarter provides.\nThe Legends of the First Empire series is a six-book epic fantasy, and the first three books have been released by Del Rey (a fantasy imprint of Penguin Random House) from 2016 - 2018. The remaining three titles have been self-published and released on an accelerated schedule (3 books in a 10-month span: Age of Legend - Jul 2019 | Age of Death - Feb 2020 | Age of Empyre - May 2020).  \nLike my best-selling Riyria novels, these books are also set in the fictional world of Elan, but the events occur 3,000 years in the past. It IS NOT necessary to know anything about the other stories, but for those who do read both, you'll learn the truth about a number of lies regarding various historical figures. \nAt the time of this Kickstarter launch, Age of Death hasn't officially \"hit the street,\" but here is some data regarding how readers have rated the books in the series on Amazon, Goodreads, and Audible.com.  I'm proud that only 2.2% have had poor ratings (1- and 2-star) and the vast majority (nearly 90%) have garnered 4- and 5-stars.\nIn case you are not familiar with the other books in the series, here is a bit about each.\nAge of Myth:  Since time immemorial, humans have worshipped the gods they call Fhrey, truly a race apart: invincible in battle, masters of magic, and seemingly immortal. But when a god falls to a human blade, the balance of power between men and those they thought were gods changes forever. Now, only a few stand between humankind and annihilation: Raithe, reluctant to embrace his destiny as the God Killer, Suri, a young seer burdened by signs of impending doom, and Persephone, who must overcome personal tragedy to lead her people. The Age of Myth is over; the time of rebellion has begun.\nAge of Swords:  Raithe, the God Killer, may have started the rebellion by killing a Fhrey, but long-standing enmities dividing the Rhune make it all but impossible to unite against a common foe. And even if the clans can join forces, how will they defeat an enemy whose magical prowess makes the Fhrey indistinguishable from gods? The answer lies in a faraway land populated by a reclusive and dour race. With time running out, Persephone leads a small band of misfits in a desperate search for aid, a quest that will take them into the darkest depths of Elan. There, an ancient adversary waits\u2014an enemy as surprising as it is deadly.\nAge of War:  The alliance of humans and renegade Fhrey is fragile\u2014and about to be tested as never before. Persephone keeps the human clans from turning on one another through her iron will and a compassionate heart while Nyphron, seeks to advance his own nefarious agenda. Old loyalties will be challenged while fresh conspiracies will threaten to undo all that Persephone has accomplished. In the darkest hour, when hope is all but lost, new heroes will rise . . . but at what terrible cost?\nAge of Legend: After years of warfare, humanity has gained the upper hand and has pushed the Fhrey to the edge of their homeland\u2014but no farther. Now comes the pivotal moment. Persephone\u2019s plan to use the stalemate to seek peace is destroyed by an unexpected betrayal that threatens to hand victory to the Fhrey and leaves a dear friend in peril. Humanity\u2019s only hope lies in the legend of a witch, a forgotten song, and a simple garden door.\nAge of Death: Winter blankets the land, and more than hope has died. Barred by the tower of Avempartha, the western army cannot invade the Fhrey homeland. So it must seek a way across the Nidwalden River before the fane obtains the secret of dragons. As time runs out for both humanity and the mystic Suri, the only chance for the living rests with the dead. Having made their fateful choice, can a handful of misfits do the impossible, or are they forever lost to an inescapable grave? As in Virgil's Aeneid, Dante's Divine Comedy, and Milton's Paradise Lost, the most epic tales transcend the world of the living. It's time to see what lies in Elan's Age of Death. \nOkay, so we've learned a bit about the book and the series, but what about me? Well, my name is Michael J. Sullivan, and I\u2019m a full-time novelist. To type those words is kind of surreal, as writing isn't a career that most can make a living at. I'm eternally grateful to all my readers who make it feasible to live a dream I never thought would be possible.\nLike many (too many), my road to authorship wasn't an easy one. I wrote in a variety of genres from 1979 to 1994, and after thirteen novels and more than a hundred rejections, I quit after vowing never to write creatively again. Well, never turned out to be a bit more than a decade, as I couldn't suppress the itch to write any longer. Over those years, a story had been growing in my head, and I decided to write it but with a condition: I wouldn't seek publication. I hoped that a few friends and my dyslexic daughter (who had always struggled with reading) would take a look, and that would be good enough for me.\nAfter reading the books, my wife made it her mission to make sure they saw the light of day. She willed them into existence, first with a small-press (who was well-intentioned but ultimately provided us no income nor any substantial readership), later through self-publishing (which worked much better), and eventually, she attracted the interest of Orbit (the fantasy imprint of a big-five publisher, Hachette Book Group). The rest, as they say, is history.\nIn the publishing business, I'm what's referred to as a \"hybrid\" because I've released books through traditional publishers as well as utilizing self-publishing.  If you want to learn why I do that, you can look at the Why Self-Publish section below.\nAll told, I've written 32 novels: 13 are sitting in a trunk never to see the light of day, 12 are released by a traditional publisher, 11 are currently or previously self-published,  1 is releasing soon, and 2 more are written (these are books in my next series, The Rise and the Fall). \nSome of my publishing accomplishments include:\nNew York Times Bestselling Author (twice)\nUSA Today Bestselling Author (3 times)\n3 books with multiple appearances on the Washington Post Hardcover Bestseller list\n2M+ English language books sold\n90+ foreign language contracts in 14 languages\n2,200+ days (6.0+ years) on the Amazon Top 100 Fantasy Author list\n8-time Goodreads Choice Award Nominee\n4 Earphone Award Wins and one Audie Award Nomination\nOne of the Top 50 most-followed authors on Goodreads\nNamed by io9 as one of the most successful self-published science fiction and fantasy authors\nNamed to more than 260 best-of or most-anticipated lists including those compiled by Library Journal, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Audible, and Goodreads.  \nThis handy chart provides a quick and easy way to determine what you receive at the various reward levels.  \nAs you can see, we offer a wide range of pledge levels from the low-level $5 to the comprehensive \"All In\" ($25 per book + $10 for ebook) which provides all six novels of the series as well as early access to the story via the ebook. For the multi-book levels, you'll be able to select which titles you desire for each book and you can even use it to buy multiple copies of the Age of Empyre book.\nBecause we will be using BackerKit to fulfill the project, this allows backers to customize their pledge to get exactly the items they are interested in. To receive these \"Add-ons\" you should do the following:\nSelect the reward level that covers the largest number of items you want to receive.\nSelect the \"Add-ons\" from the table below and note the cost of each.\nIncrease your pledge amount to include your pledge level plus the costs of the desired add-ons.\nWhen the Kickstarter is over you'll be able to \"distribute\" that excess money to the various desired add-ons.\nBelow is the list of add-ons available:\n\nIn addition, we'll also continue Robin's Tip Jar (as it was missed in recent Kickstarters, and people appreciated its return in the last Kickstarter. Some notes about a few of the add-ons.\nMontemorcey Bag - for the last Kickstarter, we offered this in black but the supplier has had problems keeping that color in stock. So, this time around we switched to a \"natural\" color with green handles (which we have never seen go out of stock). All other aspects of the bag will be the same. The size is 12\" x 13\" x 5\".\nSullifan Bag - One of the stretch goals was an alternate bag design and we decided to make a heraldic crest for \"Sullifans\" The design is a work in progress, but I wanted to show you the direction we are going. This crest features items from both series (the Tower of Avempartha and a Gilarabrwn. Then also images specific to Legends (Magda) and Riyria (Hadrian's swords, and Royce and Hadrian riding into Medford). Like the other tote bag, this will also be a \"natural\" color with green handles. All other aspects of the bag will be the same. The size is 12\" x 13\" x 5\".\n We suspect that many of the backers of this Kickstarter also backed the last one (and as such you already have a set of 5 bookmarks). So as to not kill a bunch of trees, and double up EVERYONE who buys a book on this Kickstarter) we are ONLY   adding the new bookmark (Age of Empyre) to the single book orders (multiple-book orders will have a bookmark that matches each book).  But if you missed getting the \"5-set bookmarks\" you can order a complete set separately. NOTE: Only the Age of Empyre bookmark will be signed.\nHere are some examples to help you figure out how to calculate various orders with \"Add-ons\" included. \nYou missed the Age of Death Kickstarter, so now want to get ebooks and hardcovers for both it and Age of Empyre.  You should choose the pledge level \"DOUBLE TROUBLE\" ($60) and add $10 (total of $70 + shipping) to get the Age of Death ebook.\nYou generally read ebooks but you like the design of the bookmarks and would like to get a set. Plus you also want the tote bag. If you are in Canada you would choose to make your pledge $10 (digital delight), $5 for the bookmarks, and $40 for the bag. That's a total of $55. If you also wanted the hardcover you would pledge $35 (Hardcore), $5 for the bookmarks, and $30 for the bag. That's a total of $70.\nYou live in the US, read ebooks, and you would like to get the tote bag. You would pledge $35 ($10 for the DIGITAL DELIGHT level) + $25 for the tote bag. \nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $100,000 - short story bundle (12 tales) (UNLOCKED) - So, I did a little analysis from one Kickstarter to another and discovered there was 29% carryover from HW to DoD, 32% from DoD to DoWD, 28% fro DoWD to AOL, and 39% from AoL to AoD. That means there is a good number of backers who haven't received various short stories. So I'm going to make the first goal a HUGE set every short I've written so far. Including: \n Riyria: The Thieves, The Viscount and the Witch, The Jester, Professional Integrity, The Ashmoore Affair\n Legends: Little Wren and the Big Forest, Pile of Bones\n Tales from Elan: Traditions\n Unrelated Shorts: The Game, Burning Alexandria, Autumn Mists\n Comic book Short: The Jester\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $119,338 or 3,103 backers  - the untold story (UNLOCKED)-  With the entire tale told, it's possible to talk about the series without fear of spoilers if we meet this level, Michael and Robin will produce a free ebook which will peel back some of the hidden gems of the Legends of the First Empire and delve into the decision making progress regarding how the story was told, and even discuss the road to publishing. Why such an odd reward level? Well those are the number needed to move this project from 7th to 6th (in most-funded) and from 4th to 3rd (in most-backed)\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $125,000 -  A second tote-bag design (UNLOCKED). If we reach this stretch goal we'll have Cory Freeman (the man that designed the Montemorcey label), design up a new image related to the world of Elan. When buying a tote bag you'll be able to decide which image you want. Or you can add it to your order and receive two different bags.\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - $155,367 -  Free Anthology: Heroes Wanted. Best Anthology winner on reddit /r/fantasy for 2019. 19 short stories by some of the best new voices in fantasy. Each is centered around heroes of all shapes and sizes, including a Royce and Hadrian short story (which is already included in Stretch Goal #1.\n Unfortunately, I'm not able to offer the audiobook as part of the Kickstarter (it's under license to Audible Studios, and only they can distribute it), but that doesn't mean you can't join the fun. You can back at either the SOUND ADVICE level (no ebook) or the DIGITAL DELIGHT level (includes ebook), and you'll still get exclusive bonus perks that only backers of the Kickstarter will receive. Oh, and the audiobook will be available on release day, so be sure to pre-order the audiobook now to receive it on May 5th.  \nWe have no desire to make a profit shipping the books, so we have priced our shipping fees at cost. That said, all the fees do add up. Here are some of the things the shipping costs cover: postage, insurance, packing material, fulfillment company picking and packing fees, and shipping the books to the fulfillment company.  Shipping is automatically added to your pledge and is based on your country. We've deeply discounted foreign postage rates so that the shipping for a single book is $7 - $9 regardless of your location.\nUS: $7 - $14\nCanada: $8 - $15\nMost foreign countries: $9 - $16\nNote: Some foreign countries have higher shipping, but we have applied discounts to keep this expensive as low as possible. \nNormally when buying directly from us, we ship via the USPS, and this is very expensive. But doing a Kickstarter allows us to consolidate a number of orders, send one large shipment, and utilize fulfillment partners in various overseas markets (like Canada and Europe). Shipping locally means that backers will not have to pay VAT, customs, or import fees (we'll absorb those costs), and it also helps to keep the overseas shipping costs down. Even with all those efforts, postage can drive up the cost to non-us backers, so we're taking some of our profits and using it to drive down the shipping costs further. Here are the discounts we have applied:\n1 book: $7 - $13\n2 books: $5 - $18\n3 books: $5 - $25\n4 books: $5 - $28\n5 books: $5 - $28\n6 books: $5 - $30\nIf you are outside the US and want to get hardcover copies, there will never be a better time than now.\n If you've read or listened to any of my books in the past, many of these names will be familiar to you as I've developed a finely tuned team that has been with me for years. It includes:\n Marc Simonetti (cover artist) - Marc has created 15 covers for my books (for both the US and foreign translations) and also has illustrated covers for some of the biggest names in the business including George R.R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss, Terry Pratchett, and dozens more.\n Tim Gerard Reynolds (audiobook narrator) - Tim has recorded 14 novels of mine, and he's also narrated books by Pierce Brown, Mark Lawrence, Larry Correia, Edward W. Robertson, Jonathan Renshaw, and Gail Z. Martin. He's won multiple Earphone Awards and has been nominated for several Audies.\n Laura Jorstad (copy editor) - works for multiple fantasy publishers (Del Rey, Ballantine Books, St. Martins, and Sterling Publishing just to name a few). She's edited books by David Gemmel, Naomi Novik, a number of the books in the Star Wars franchise, two New York Times Bestsellers from Steve Berry, and eight of my novels.\n Linda Branam (copy editor) - has been editing for 20+ years and has a passion for fiction. This is my seventh project with her.\n Shawn Speakman (publisher/distributor) - Shawn started up Grim Oak Press to help pay medical bills after beating cancer a second time. Generally, he's produced anthologies and premium hardcovers, and Age of Empyre will be the third time he's releasing a trade publication. Some of the authors Shawn has worked with include: Terry Brooks, Brandon Sanderson, Raymond E. Feist, Pierce Brown, Naomi Novik, Jacquelin Carey, Jim Butcher, Stephen R. Donaldson, Mark Lawrence, Janny Wurtz, Peter Orullian, and Barbara Hambly.\n BoxInBoxOut - is an order fulfillment company based in Madison Virginia. They've been shipping books ordered from our website for more than a year, and they expertly handled the shipping for our last Kickstarter Age of Legend. I've found them to be professional, conscientious, and hardworking. They've shipped more than 9,500 books for us and they make running a Kickstarter so much easier than when we used to do all the shipping ourselves.\nAs I mentioned, this will be my 7th crowdfunding campaign, and I'm proud to say they have all been a huge success. In fact, several of them rank on the top of the charts both in the number of backers and the funds raised.\nRanked #3, #4, #5, #7, and #9 of the most-backed fiction projects of all time.\nRanked #4, #5, #7, #9, and #13 when looking at the most-funded fiction projects. \nIf you want to check out what people have said about the past projects and explore our track record for delivery and service,  you can see them at the following links.\nAge of Death\nAge of Legend\n Age of Swords (Indiegogo)\nThe Disappearance of Winter's Daughter\nThe Death of Dulgath\nHollow World\nI think it's important that backers know where their hard-earned cash is going. The price of each component is shown below.\nWe set the goal of the Kickstarter at about half that amount, so if we end up \"just squeaking by, the costs of the hardcover will be split between the supporters and us. If past performance is any indication we should be able to clear that bar easily. \nSince 2011, most of my books have been traditionally published, and so you may be wondering why I'm self-publishing this title. There are a few reasons. The first has to do with audio rights. When we signed the original contract for the first three books in the Legends of the First Empire series, the rights included just ebook and print, which was good because the audiobook rights for the entire series had already been sold. When it came time to negotiate for the last three books, a change in corporate policy from Penguin Random House required audiobook rights as well, so for this reason, it became impossible for us to publish those books with Del Rey.\nBut aside from that, we've been self-publishing since 2009, and it's an approach we really enjoy. Age of Empyre will be my 12th indie novel (I released 6 books from 2009 - 2012 and another 6 from 2014 - 2020). Having done both self and traditional, I find producing the book myself is (a) easier (b) creates a better product (c) is more profitable and (d) offers me greater freedom. With all those advantages, it's little wonder why I'm going to be self-publishing all my titles from now on.\nNow, for all the good things about self-publishing, there are some downsides as well. First, it's the publisher that pays all the out-of-pocket expenses. Hopefully, the Kickstarter will help on that front. Second, traditionally-published advances ensure a certain amount of guaranteed income to the author.  With self-publishing, you could end up losing money, and again the Kickstarter helps with this. Third, self-published titles rarely make it onto shelves in bookstores and libraries.  To solve this last problem, I'm partnering with Shawn Speakman at Grim Oak Press who will be using his distribution contacts to get Age of Empyre into bookstores worldwide.  I had the same arrangement for Age of Legend and Age of Death, and so far it's been working wonderfully, but my contract with Shawn is quite unconventional. Basically, I'm assuming all the capital expenditures, and he'll take a cut of each copy sold through the retail chains. My hope is this will work well for both of us, and if so, then it may open a whole new business model for Shawn, someone who is already a publishing veteran and thinking outside the box. \nOkay, so that's why the book is self-published, but why do a Kickstarter? The obvious answer revolves around the high cost of a large print run, but as I already mentioned, we could take out a loan for that. But having done six other crowdfunding projects, I can honestly say that we love how this platform is democratizing the creation of art. It's an incredible experience to be part of a group who are all pulling for the success of a project and spreading their enthusiasm to others. Plus, getting the story in people's hands early can help build excitement before the books ship to the population at large. Also, Kickstarter provides a system for me to offer additional perks to the people who are financially backing my project. Without Kickstarter, getting people's names in the book, and providing bookmarks would be difficult or impossible.\nI also love the fact that Kickstarter removes middlemen. For instance, Amazon takes 55% off the top for any print books sold, and when you factor in the costs of the distribution partners that can mean 80% of the list price goes to others. Ebook margins are better. I only lose 30% with them, but that's still much more than doing a Kickstarter. Yes, Kickstarter is a middleman, but their fees (including BackerKit and credit card processing) are just 10%. That's a huge difference. So by running a Kickstarter, it ensures the highest percentage of your purchase comes directly to the person who created the book. \nWell, that's all I can think of for now. I'll be updating the FAQ's as the project continues and adding stretch goals if the project funds. If you have any questions, just drop me a line. I'd also like to take just a minute to thank those who have been reading my books over the last decade. It's because of you that I'm able to live my life-long dream, and it's something that I'm always grateful for. I'll keep writing, and hopefully, you'll continue reading.\n-- Michael & Robin Sullivan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGenerally, the most significant risks with novel projects are (a) will the author finish the book (b) can they write well and (c) can they handle the logistics of distribution?

In a world where what we see and experience is driven by want and immediacy, No Business Magazine encourages readers to slow down while exploring stories of artists and art-making. The No Biz Mag team is intentional in how we present these stories in our arts and culture publication, and we spend quality time conceptualizing every issue to make sure we\u2019re truly incorporating the people and their knowledge within the book.\n\nHow can we make interactions and \u201cconsumption\u201d of art and culture more meaningful? How can we move away from art conversations starting with \u2014 \u201cHow much is that piece?\u201d\nHOW IT CAME ABOUT\n\"No Business Magazine grew out of an earlier concept-based publication. It was a very special project, and now I get to revive it with good friend and highly talented designer, Hanna Peterson. About two years ago, my partner Eli Show (an artist) and I started a concept-heavy arts and culture publication (self published, often screen-printed in our basement) called Sound + Color and published three issues over the year, but things slowed down with a toddler in tow. I also realized that I wanted to use this collaborative project to work with another friend. Hanna is the absolute best!\" \u2014 Angela Zonunpari, No Business Magazine.\nINTENT\nWe have visited at length to see what form this publication could take and we've fulfilled a lot of those goals with our first issue, Identity. We\u2019re committed to making something good and memorable. We want to encourage people to slow down and interact with the printed matter, but also empower them to have more honest conversations about art and culture, outside of art events. \"No Business Magazine\" because we won\u2019t deal with the business side of art/culture, won\u2019t look at art as commodity, but we'll actively try to talk about concept, art practice, and an artist\u2019s work as is. We want to learn about the ideas behind bodies of work. Basically, we don\u2019t want art conversations to start with \u2014 how much is it? Yes, to make more art, artists have to sell work, but we want to dwell more on artists and the works they\u2019re making. We want to lift up the ideas behind art. So, no business, just broad themes we\u2019d visit with each issue.\nThe themes help us narrow down and zero in on artists, art practices and concepts we want to visit as No Business Magazine. Our curation of artists and concepts in each issue spans United States, and we are continuously working to connect with people from around the world as well. We can't exist or thrive in silos, and we whole-heartedly embrace intersectionality, hybridity, and fluidity in people, ideas, and practice.\nOur design, editorial guidelines and concept for No Business Magazine follow a similar path of how we approached Sound + Color. We\u2019re intentional in what we\u2019re doing, the people we\u2019re connecting with, and how we\u2019re presenting all of it in each issue of the publication. Our plan is to have a limited print run for each issue which will be distributed in conjunction with two other things we're working towards: artist open studios and curated house art shows. Our timelines are a little loose as compared to standard publications, as we depend on donations or grant funding. And also because we want to be truly intentional in what we produce \u2014 sort of like creating an art object. This is truly a labor of love.\nISSUE ONE: IDENTITY\nFor No Business Magazine, we developed an approach to make our scope wider (in relation to our last series of zines) \u2014 in artists and writers we connected with, art that we talked and wrote about, and geography. For our first issue, we decided to explore identity in various forms and concepts \u2014 how identity has formed art and art choices, how choices and art has impacted identity, or how an identity is formed and/or presented through concepts in art. We produced Identity, our first issue last June, with launch events in Omaha (NE) and Sioux Falls (SD) in conjunction to a curated art show and artist open studios. \nThe people featured in Identity touch on very different things, from photographing a Burmese refugee community in Zomi Town aka Tulsa, a popular American sport influencing art practices, exploring identity as an outsider, looking at hybrid identity through art, how fan fiction manifests itself in art, to finding community within a subculture. So, we decided to use these ideas to inspire our approach for designing the whole publication. Our intention with every issue is to make it an immersive and interactive experience for the reader, with a hope that it will lead to more nuanced conversations / interactions with art.\nFor our first issue, Identity, we used various printing methods and interactive printed materials alongside varying layouts to relate to the content, concept, and artist.\nOur first issue wouldn't have been possible without the energy, time, knowledge, and opportunity shared by Daniel Mung, Amelie Mancini, Paul Dressen, Marsha Mack, Lorraine Rubio, Brian Bieber, University Libraries at the University of South Dakota, Amy Jarding, Eli Show, Amanda Smith, and Amplify Arts. The launch of No Business Magazine and limited run of Identity was through grant funding from AIGA South Dakota and Sioux Falls Arts Council. \nISSUE TWO: POWER COLORS\n\"When I\u2019m looking at art, I think of it as a friendly and passionate conversation with the artist. It becomes a layered interaction. Art-making embodies so much of an artist\u2019s history, personality and aesthetic. And, as a viewer, we often project our experiences and understanding of things onto an artist\u2019s work.\" \u2014 Angela Zonunpari\nPower Colors is a tiny intersection of individual histories, perception, and manifestation of personalities. Our intention with the second issue of No Business Magazine is to present artists and works that push us to look beyond their surface value and survey how / why they find power within color.\nWe're pretty excited about our line-up for Power Colors, slated to go to print at the beginning of April 2020.  We're hoping to step it up a notch with artists we connect with and the final book we produce! With your support and encouragement, we'll be able to produce a wonderful and cherished art book that aims to add value to our art interactions.\nPEOPLE\nNo Business Magazine is a collaboration project between Angela Zonunpari and Hanna Peterson, with support from Amy Jarding and other artists across the country.\nAngela Zonunpari is an arts writer, based in Sioux Falls, SD.

That\u2019s about 1 out of every 145 U.S. citizens. Each of these prisoners has a network of friends and family members that all have one question on their minds; \u201cWhen my loved one gets out, what will prevent them from reoffending and going right back into jail again?\u201d Get Out for Good gives practical, biblical advice to address this question.\n\nScott Stroud, was incarcerated in 1991 for four years as the result of an armed robbery he committed at the age of twenty-one. While in prison he placed his trust in Jesus as his personal Lord and Savior. Since his release he has successfully stayed out of trouble with the law, owned his own business, and is currently an ordained pastor. This did not occur by accident, but rather was the result of certain practices he was taught by mentors after regaining his freedom. He now desires to share these practical steps with those who are facing release from incarceration. \n\nHe also writes to their families and friends regarding pitfalls they can avoid as they encourage their loved ones upon reentering society. Drawing from his ministry experience of working with hundreds of prisons, Scott knows that by implementing these simple practices into everyday life the chances for success on the outside increase exponentially. Additionally, each chapter contains discussion questions for group study. \nPlease support this critical project! One pastor tried to help his uncle get readjusted to society upon his release from prison and couldn't find any resources available online. He even went to two prisons and spoke with the chaplains there. They just stared at him blankly never having heard of such a book.

The moment the words were out of her mouth the title came tumbling out of mine: Gaslight & Grimm! At the same time, I already knew exactly which tale I myself wanted to tell. Growing up, I had a record album that played an audio version of Beauty and the Beast on one side and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves on the other. I wore out the side with Ali Baba...and oh, what a rich tale to tell, with so much potential for a steampunk spin.\nI wanted to do it right, though. I wanted to capture the culture and the storytelling traditions of the Middle East. This is why I made the best decision of my literary career: I asked my good friend Day Al-Mohamed to be my cultural consultant. In the end, she turned into my co-author.\nThe irony? Between us, Baba Ali grew so large that it turned into a novel, one that published two years before Gaslight & Grimm. \nThe original cover by Autumn Frederickson.\nUnfortunately, the publisher who published it had some management issues and ceased to be...which means so did Baba Ali, at least from a commercial standpoint. \neSpec Books wants to rectify that, reissuing the book through our Paper Phoenix Press imprint. Could you help us make that happen?\nCome, Best Beloved, and sit you by my feet. I shall tell you a tale such as sister Scheherazade could have scarce imagined\u2026\nIn the Nejd there is nothing at all\u2026except secrets. A band of thieves wishes such secrets to remain hidden.\nIn England, far from his desert home, Ali bin-Massoud serves as apprentice to the famed Charles Babbage. One night a mysterious box is delivered by a clockwork falcon and Ali\u2019s world is never the same again. Heartache, danger, and thieves mark his journey as Ali is summoned home at the death of his father.\nIt will take faith, knowledge, and yes, love to realize his destiny, and more than a little skill with steam-driven technology. Can he unravel the mystery of the puzzle box and the clockwork djinn before it is too late? An ancient legacy and Ali's very life depend on his success.\nHear you the tale of Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn.\n___________________________________________\nPraise for Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn:\n\u201cRich with steampunk, magic, and an enchanting setting, this story casts a spell and won\u2019t let go until the very last page!\u201d \u2014Maria V.

There was a time when traditional publishers would happily go out on a limb, trying shared-world anthologies and other innovative approaches to the literature. These days, they have to play the game much closer to the vest.\nHowever, you and I--and writers and readers all over the world--aren't bound by the same limitations. We can create, support, and enjoy science fiction that goes directly from creator to audience, taking all the chances that audience can handle.\nAnd in Pangaea, there's plenty to enjoy.\nOne Land\nAt least four times in Earth\u2019s history, the continents have come sliding together. Over millions of years, separate and distinct landmasses have crawled across the planet's surface on immense tectonic plates to form a single mass--a super-continent. Geologists have dubbed the most recent such formation Pangaea.\nOf course, Pangaea broke up a long time ago, and because it did, mankind developed in drastically different climes and circumstances. But what if we twenty-first century types were living in one of the super-continental periods--those characterized by \u201clid tectonics\u201d rather than \u201cplate tectonics?\u201d What would it be like if all of humanity was confined to a single landmass...and had been so confined for all of our recorded history?\nThat's the ever-so-tantalizing axis on which our Pangaea anthologies turn.\nIt's an exciting and original idea, one that deserves the best shared world-building talent available. So to explore this world on your behalf, we've harnessed the word-smithing abilities of some of science fiction's most inventive writers.\nThe Pangaea Publishing Model\nIn a traditional publishing arrangement, less than 10% of the proceeds from a book go to the author. Hard to believe, isn't it, considering the author is the one providing 100% of the insight and wit? The lion's share of the cover price goes to the book store and the publisher, to cover both their costs and their profits.\nIn the case of this anthology, all proceeds after production and distribution costs go to the writers whose work drew you to the book in the first place--which, after all, is how it should be. When you support Pangaea, you're supporting a new and infinitely more equitable publishing model. You're saying that writers should finally enjoy the fruits of their labor.\nIt's a subversive idea, no question about it. But we believe it's an idea whose time has come.\nWho's We?\nSome of the most respected writers in science fiction and fantasy today. Ilsa J. Bick. Michael A. Burstein. Russ Colchamiro. Peter David. Keith R.A. DeCandido. Kevin Dilmore. Mary Fan. Michael Jan Friedman. Robert Greenberger. Glenn Hauman. Paul Kupperberg. Ron Marz. Aaron Rosenberg. Lawrence M. Schoen. Geoffrey Thorne. Tiffany Trent. Marie Vibbert. Dayton Ward.\nNot just great writers, by the way. They're also people who love and respect their craft and their chosen genre. If you get a chance to speak with them, you'll hear the excitement in their voices as they talk about their contributions to the Pangaea series.\nA La Carte Menu\nRather than ask you to read every possible combination of reward components, here's a handy menu for add-ons. Remember, these are additions to the rewards you'll see on the right side of the web page. All you have to do, when you pledge, is send me a message as to which add-ons you'd like and I'll take care of the rest.\nFor $11 more, you can add an 8\" by 10\" suitable-for-framing print of the cover of Pangaea III, which I'll autograph at no additional charge. \nFor $15 more, you can become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the book's Acknowledgements page.\nFor $18 more, you can add one of our two author sampler packages of five e-books each, culled from the best work of the writers contributing to Pangaea III. ($36 more for both packages. Packages to be announced.)\nPACKAGE #1\nDragon Precinct By Keith R.A. DeCandido\nCabal and Other Unlikely Invocations of the Muse by Michael Jan Friedman\nToo Tall for Small by Aaron Rosenberg\nLove, Murder & Mayhem: Cosmic Tales of the Heart edited by Russ Colchamiro\nThe Camelot Papers by Peter David\n\nPACKAGE #2\nUnicorn Precinct by Keith R.A. DeCandido\nLost Days by Michael Jan Friedman\nIn My Shorts: Hitler's Bellhop and Other Stories by Paul Kupperberg \nFlynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil by Mary Fan \nDarkness of the Light by Peter David (Book 1 of 3 in Peter\u2019s Hidden Earth Chronicles) \nFor $20 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a second Pangaea III trade paperback to your reward at the $25 level or higher. Both books will be signed by at least three of our writers. \nFor $20 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of the original Pangaea anthology OR Pangaea II: The Rise of Dominjaron to your reward at the $25 level or higher. This book will be signed by at least three of our writers.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your Pangaea III trade paperback to a hardcover edition.\nFor an additional $20, you can add on a physical copy of one of my other Crazy 8 Press books: The Hammer and The Horn, The Seekers and The Sword, The Fortress and the Fire, Fight The Gods, Aztlan, I Am The Salamander, Lost Days, Cabal and Other Unlikely Invocations of The Muse, and Headless and Other Improbable Excitations of The Muse. Any two would be $40, three would be $60, four would be $80, etc. If you're outside the U.S., please add $23 to each book for postage. Of course, I'll be happy to sign these books at no additional charge.\nFor an additional $25, you can add on one of my bestselling hardcover Star Trek novels: The Valiant or Death In Winter. Together, they would be $50. If you're outside the U.S., please add $23 to each book for postage. Of course, I'll be happy to sign them for free. (These are limited to five of each title, so if you're interested don't wait too long.) \nFor $30 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of Altered States of the Union, Glenn Hauman's wild and wooly alternate history anthology. Positing a slew of Americas that might have been if history had taken a different turn here or there, it features the work of David Gerrold, Peter David, Keith R.A. DeCandido, yours truly, and many others.\nFor $22 more, you can name a business, a street, or a one-time bystander (phonetically, of course, since this is not our world)--and also become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the Acknowledgments page.\nFor $700 more, you or someone you love will receive a large print of an alternate cover to the anthology suitable for framing -- a one-of-a-kind, custom treat created with your input and signed by talented Brazilian painter Caio Cacau -- as well as smaller prints of the sketches that went into the development of the alternate cover. (No additional postage necessary within the U.S. Outside the U.S., add $50.)\nStretch Goals!\nAt $8,500, we add a fourth author signature to every copy of Pangaea III that we send out to our backers.\nAt $9,000, we send every backer from $8 on up a DRM-free e-copy of Tales of the Crimson Keep (the Newly Renovated Edition), a shared world anthology produced by the unlimited miscreants at Crazy 8 Press (a cadre to which I am proud to belong).\nAt $10,000, we send every backer from $8 on up a DRM-free e-copy of Fight The Gods, \"a contemporary fantasy with its roots sunk deep into the soil of Greek mythology.\"\nAt $11,000, we unlock an additional value: Caio Cacau, our cover artist, will provide a black-and-white illustration for each of our stories, to be included in every edition of the book.\nAt $12,000, every physical-reward backer from $25 up receives a 5\" by 8\" copy of one of Caio's black-and-white illustrations.\nAdditional stretch goals will be announced as we go along (It's more fun when we keep you in suspense)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done a bunch of these Kickstarter campaigns now and I've always sent out all the rewards I said I would.

We're now trying to stretch go further goals (like a FOURTH anthology if we hit $30K), but the open call for submissions to our three current anthologies of APOCALYPTIC, GALACTIC STEW, and MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK is now...well, open!!! Go to  https://jpskewedthrone.dreamwidth.org/499730.html   to read the fine print on how to submit your story and possibly end up in one of our anthologies, including contract terms, payment, timeline, etc.  Then write, revise, polish, and submit!\nThis project will fund THREE science fiction and fantasy anthologies, titled APOCALYPTIC, GALACTIC STEW, and MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK, containing approximately 14 all-original (no reprint) short stories each from established SF&F authors in the field and new voices found through an open call. The books will be edited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier (APOCALYPTIC), David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier (GALACTIC STEW), and Crystal Sarakas & Joshua Palmatier (MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK). \nAPOCALYPTIC:\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good apocalyptic story? They come in all kinds, from the straight up SF/horror of Stephen King\u2019s superflu in \u201cThe Stand\u201d and the zombie apocalypse in \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d to the quieter, more reflective tales of loss and survival in \u201cOn the Beach\u201d and \u201cChildhood\u2019s End.\u201d Tales that feature people struggling through the end of the world--or fighting to survive in what remains--are always compelling. What better way for readers to safely explore the extremes of the human condition without actually having to fight off the ravening hordes themselves? For this anthology, we\u2019ll be looking for unique takes on how the world ends, both during and after the apocalypse. So bring on your asteroids, your plagues, your solar flares! And ask yourself, would you survive the apocalypse? Would you even want to?  \nEdited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier, APOCALYPTIC will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include: \nStephen Blackmoore, \nJames Enge, \nNancy Holzner, \nTanya Huff, \nViolette Malan, \nSeanan McGuire, and \nS.M. Stirling\nGALACTIC STEW:\nFood is an essential part of life\u2014not just for energy and exotic flavors, but as a unifier during social events, a focal point for establishing culture, and shared experience to put people at ease. In GALACTIC STEW, readers will sit down at the communal table and sup upon stories centered on food.  Whether it\u2019s a tense treaty negotiation over a full course meal or a trap devised by the fae to chain you to their realm, these stories are certain to be delectable.  Come and savor these delicacies\u2026and hope the taste doesn\u2019t mask a deadly poison!\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, GALACTIC STEW will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each. Anchor authors include:\nRod Belcher, \nAndy Duncan, \nEsther Friesner, \nD.B. Jackson, \nHoward Andrew Jones, \nGini Koch, and \nLaura Resnick \nMY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK:\nWhen NASA's Opportunity rover sent its last message from Mars--loosely translated by scientists as \u201cmy battery is low and it is getting dark\u201d--many of us paused in a shared moment of sadness and gratitude, aimed at a robot left alone on a faraway planet. That moment inspired this anthology. We want stories about technology that has operated long past its time, but we want to give these lost spirits new life, whether it be rescue, a new purpose, a new beginning, or a simple homecoming. What happens to the robots and rovers and AIs and more after their original purpose has faded? What is the next chapter of their story?\nEdited by Crystal Sarakas & Joshua Palmatier, MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include:\nJacey Bedford, \nTroy Carrol Bucher, \nJohn Hartness, \nJos\u00e9 Pablo Iriarte,\nAlethea Kontis, \nStephen Leigh, \nMerc Fenn Wolfmoor, \nKari Sperring, and \nEdward Willett\nBackers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade paperback edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run. \nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition! \nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors.

And Zombies Need Brains is officially a \"qualifying market\" for the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA)!  With your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you!

The cover art for \u201cApocalyptic\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter. \n\"Apocalyptic\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nThe following is a Reward Level Rundown for most of the rewards where the backer will get all three of the three anthologies in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback format. There are a few reward levels not listed, such as those where the backer gets only one or two of the anthologies in either format, as well as a few special reward levels where the backer will get ALL of the currently-available backlist from Zombies Need Brains in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback--those three levels are ZNB Ebook Zombie, ZNB Kickstarter Zombie, and ZNB Ebook Kickstarter Zombie.\nKickstarter Reward Level Rundown\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2019. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of February 2020 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2020. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 8 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising. \nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far: \nStretch Goal: At $27,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"The Royal Scam\" by Gini Koch, the first installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Daughter of the Sands\" by Joshua Palmatier. \nStretch Goal: A FOURTH ANTHOLOGY!:  At $30,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FOURTH themed anthology, RAMMING THE RAMPARTS in ebook format. This anthology asks authors to explore these and other absurd, surrealistic alternate histories.  The inspiration comes from our current President's recent commentary on the Fourth of July, including the idea that our Army \"took over the airports\" during the Revolutionary War.  What if there had been airports during that war?  Absurd!  George Washington was not a fighter pilot!  There was no \"Battle at LaGuardia Baggage Claim\"!  And yet...  The anthology will contain 12 stories by Gerald Brandt, David B. Coe, Esther Friesner, Elektra Hammond, Nancy Holzner, Walter H. Hunt, Gini Koch, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Rhondi Salsitz, Steven H Silver, Alan Smale, and Harry Turtledove.  It will be edited by Joshua Palmatier.  Details about how to add the ebook version of this anthology to your reward level will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.  This anthology will NOT have an open call UNLESS we reach $35,000 in the Kickstarter.  It will NOT be produced in paperback UNLESS we reach $40,000 in the Kickstarter.  (See the later stretch goals.)\nStretch Goal: At $32,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"When Josie Comes Home\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the first installment of THE NEW WEST series AND every backer pledging $7 or more will receive the ebook \"An Alewife in Kish\" by Benjamin Tate (aka Joshua Palmatier).\nStretch Goal: At $35,000, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Three Card Monte\" by Gini Koch, the second installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.  In addition, we will do an OPEN CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS for the RAMMING THE RAMPARTS anthology for a minimum of four additional open slots (more than likely a few more), bringing the anthology up to a minimum of 16 stories.  Details about the open call will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.\nStretch Goal: At $37,500, every backer pledging $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Deacon's Ark\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the second installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $40,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology using the submissions from the open call, so each anthology will feature 15 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"A Bug's Life\" by Gini Koch, the third installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.  In addition, we will produce limited-edition Kickstarter paperback versions of RAMMING THE RAMPARTS.  Details about how to add this paperback version of the anthology to your reward level will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.\nStretch Goal: At $45,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.  \nStretch Goal: At $50,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FIFTH themed anthology, title and details to be announced as we approach the stretch goal. \nOther stretch goals will be added as the Kickstarter continues. \nAdd-ons are extra items that current backers can add to their current pledge level. These would include ZNB cover art prints, stuffed animals representing each of the ZNB editors, t-shirts and hats with the Zombies Need Brains LLC logo, etc. Add-ons can be added by backers at any reward level by simply clicking \u201cManage My Pledge\u201d and adding on the amount of the add-on to their initial pledge.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2020. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

You should be getting them within the next week or two, if you haven't gotten them already. A note about postage: I mailed them using media mail, which requires the postal worker to mark it media mail in some way. I try to watch if they're stamping it so they don't miss anyone, but sometimes one or two slips through unstamped as media. YOU SHOULD NOT GET THESE BOOKS POSTAGE DUE! If the post office says there's postage due, tell them it was media mail, that it contains books, and hopefully that resolves the issue.

Born from the mind\u2019s eye of, award-winning artist, Jeff Sturgeon. Last Cities of Earth is a stunning collection of tales and imagery. For years, Jeff envisioned entire cities floating above the clouds. At first, a single metropolis emerged. Then, over time, more and more massive structures seemingly rose into the sky. As Jeff revealed his vision to colleagues in 2014 of lofty, floating civilizations, six fateful words were uttered: \u201cJeff, why aren\u2019t you painting them?\u201d After decades bringing other creators\u2019 dreams from aether to reality, Jeff picked up his brush to breath life into this new world swirling in his imagination. For the next two years, paintings were exhibited. Other creators fell in love with Jeff\u2019s vision and found inspiration to create within his mythology of Last Cities of Earth. There is no end to the creativity sparked by Jeff\u2019s striking images. Short stories, novellas, coloring books, illustrations, schematics, novels, digital fusions of his paintings\u2026 The World, it seemed, was endless. \u201cThe beginning stages of the project consumed me,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cIn creating Last Cities of Earth - the paintings and their stories - I found that there was no clearing my mind after creating a single image. The world was too big and the stories, too many.  \nHelping Jeff to tell those tales, the anthology will include stories by Kevin J. Anderson, Brenda Cooper, David Gerrold, Jim Wright, Mike Resnick, Andrea Stewart, Jody Lynn Nye, Steve Perry, Raven Oak, J.A. Pitts, Cat Rambo, Peter J. Wacks, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Steven Lee Sears, and Todd Lockwood, with editing by Manny  Frishberg and Jennifer Brozek. \nOn March 15th of 2085, a shocked world listens as global news sources report that the world is on a timer. Increased seismic activity beneath Yellowstone National Park heralds a pending volcanic eruption. In less than a decade, mankind will be facing an extinction-level event...   \nThe soil humanity relied on for its crops, fossil fuels, manufacturing resources would be covered in ash. Sunlight would barely penetrate the lower altitudes and the life humanity drew from the earth would be extinguished. With a six-year timer ticking down, governments and corporations set aside their conflicts and worked together to equip major population centers with massive anti-grav engines.  \nThose with the means headed for space, settling on Luna Prime or the Mars colony. Nations and powers that couldn\u2019t reach space turned their eye toward genetic manipulation, with the idea that they could adapt the human form to make it better suited for surviving the coming eruption. The tentative peace negotiated for the sake of survival broke. Those who couldn\u2019t make it into the floating cities, or find a path to salvation, used the coming eruption to settle old scores. Mankind fell into chaos as the super volcano erupted. The early post-eruption decades of 2090-2134 are considered lost to history.  \nFor the next 80-plus years the cities sent out newly designed airships, designed to have a low technology footprint for easier field repairs. Rebuilding civilization with intercity commerce and shared discovery, was a long, painstaking process. In the 2250s, America reconnected to itself, then reached beyond its borders and established trade routes to Europe. Global culture was finally reestablished.  \nIt is now YE (Yellowstone Eruption) 210, the Gregorian 2300 AD, and global trade routes exist. The 'golden age' of Lost Earth echoes in the modern day as more and more cities become connected. But the technology is beginning to fail, and many cities have lost the knowledge to repair their own anti-grav engines. Ideological wars are resurfacing. Threats are abundant from both ground and sky. If colonies still exist in space, they are silent....  \n...Welcome to the new world. Will humanity survive?  \nNOTE: The following images represent the original Last Cities of Earth artwork by Jeff Sturgeon that will be available as rewards for those who back at the Art Aficionado Pledge Level, on a first-come basis.

They were partly right: she had grander plans than a world, though, she was already creating the universe of the Sholan Alliance, where Magic, Warriors, and Science all co-exist.\nShe began writing when she was eight because she couldn't find enough of the books she liked to read.  How difficult can it be to write them myself, she thought with all the confidence of a child.  After all, the libraries were full of books.  It must be easy.\nReal life took over as she entered college and began to work for the first time, but thanks to the constant nagging of two very good friends, one of whom is the sister of her editor, she finished a novel she'd started back in 1979. It was called Turning Point, and her friend's sister at DAW bought it. The Sholan Alliance Series is now nine novels long. She also has several short stories out in DAW anthologies, and one in Defending the Future series number IV, \"No Man's Land\" called \"Valkyries\".\n Jody Lynn Nye lists her main career activity as \u2018spoiling cats.\u2019 When not engaged upon this worthy occupation, she writes fantasy and science fiction books and short stories. \nHer newest books are Moon Tracks (Baen), a young adult hard science fiction novel, the second in collaboration with Dr. Travis S.

She also runs the two-day writers workshop at DragonCon. She and her husband are the fiction reviewers for Galaxy\u2019s Edge Magazine. In 2016, Jody joined the judging staff of the Writers of the Future contest, the world\u2019s largest science fiction and fantasy writing contest for new authors. \nJody lives in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, with her husband Bill Fawcett, a writer, game designer, military historian and book packager, and three feline overlords, Athena, Minx, and Marmalade.

Players can choose from all the beloved tropes of the genre. Will you be the Delinquent, the Elite, the Adorable, the Rep? Pick from 10 social roles to form your character's day-to-day life.\nNo one, though, is just their role. Everyone has a larger and more fraught destiny. Are you a Night Hunter, a Creature Summoner, an Alchemical Witch, a Secret Monster? 10 destiny playbooks await.\nThis is the playground where your Secret Monster can ask out the Reincarnated Soul to prom, while fighting on the moon for the fate of the universe. You can be an Apprentice Reaper trying to stay awake in class, or a runaway extraterrestrial princess who wants to make friends. You can even combine your powers in an ultimate showdown. Have you formed a giant pink skeletal unicorn summon, aglow with searing sparkles and wearing a jeweled crown of soul energy? Go you.\nThis game joins a constellation of great indie gaming options in the Powered by the Apocalypse family. Our small design team has enjoyed and drawn inspiration from Monsterhearts, Masks, Fellowship, and Monster of the Week, among others. \nWe have been inspired by more anime, manga and JRPGs than we can list, but a few are: Escaflowne, Digimon, Ressha Sentai ToQger, Little Witch Academia, Yu-Gi-Oh!, the Final Fantasy franchise, Sailor Moon, a lot of Gundam series, Ouran High School Host Club, My Hero Academia, Yu Yu Hakusho, Kill la Kill, and Cardcaptor Sakura.\n Here's some of the things that make Super Destiny High School Rumble!! fun:\nPlay your favorite anime type with moves like \"Proclaim your Feelings,\" \"Your Opponent is Me,\" and \"Believe in Yourself.\"\nFast character creation and rules-light play. It's an easy game to run and doesn't need a lot of prep time.\nMix and match your student and destiny playbooks for dozens of playable possibilities.\nYou and your fellow players create your world, starting with your classmates in homeroom, and expanding to the school, town, and beyond. Players make statements that become part of the truth of this world--\"We live on a floating island of skyscrapers,\" \"We're on a space station,\" \"Music creates magic,\" \"Powers are common\", or \"Powers are rare\", \"This is the afterlife\", \"This is Neo Okinawa,\" \"This is Verona Beach.\"\nForm Bonds with teammates and boost your own and others' abilities with the power of love, friendship, and teamwork.\nBalance student life with your super-powered secret identity.\nUnlock powerful limit breaks and expend them in extraordinary circumstances.\nCombine your team's powers to make an ultimate form and defeat evil. You get to describe what the combination looks like. Is it a giant robot? A special summon? An amazing mashup of your diverse power sets?\nFight villains in ascending tiers of power: minions, lieutenants (are there four god-generals? There could be!), and bosses.\nPlay in lots of different ways. You can all use different destiny playbooks, or you can decide to build an entire team of Mech Pilots or Transformation Warriors. You could be students at a magic school, or Otherworldy Royalty who use your powers openly in a multiverse crossroads station instead of having secret identities.\nWe are publishing Super Destiny High School Rumble!! in PDF and softcover Print on Demand versions, both fulfilled by DriveThruRPG, that trusty bastion of roleplaying game downloads. The book will have a color cover and black and white interior illustrations by Amanda Williams. It will contain sections for the students (the players) and the Principal (the DM) and have twenty playbooks, ten for student types and ten for destiny types. You will also get printable PDF versions of the playbooks, the homeroom seating chart, the Principal's cheat sheet, and a fill-in character sheet- everything you need to play the game. Except for a pair of six-sided dice. But what are the chances you have those?\nFor a preview of what the book will look like, head over to DriveThruRPG and download our free promo. It contains two sample playbooks to whet your appetite.\nHere's a mini-preview of two of the playbooks.\nCheck out Amanda Williams' awesome illustrations for the book! We'll be posting more art as the Kickstarter continues.\nOur design team is a found family of friends, gamers, and artists who have collaborated in past on two funded Kickstarters, a successful line of t-shirts, and a 16-year-old small geeky business called The Five Wits. You can find out more about us here!\nBesides the publishing end of things, we also sell nerdy tea blends and other treasures, and cosplay wigs!\nOur business takes us on long trips to and from conventions, and to visit out-of-state gaming friends. We constantly brainstorm new game and story ideas while driving. This project began in just such a way. We've been having the time of our lives playtesting it, and look forward to sharing it with more gamers. Thanks to all our playtesters so far!\nBesides the book itself, you can get rewards inspired by our playbooks, including hand-made one-of-a-kind creatures by Ruth Lampi, witchy gear, or cool hair. \nAll backers will have their names included in the digital thank-yous.\nShipping is not included and will be added to all reward tiers that involve a physical object.\nthe sorts of things you can expect as rewards from the tier \"Alchemical Witch\"\nthe sorts of things you can expect as rewards from the tier \"Creature Summoner\"\nThe art and layout for the book will be complete by the end of May, allowing the PDF to be up on DriveThruRPG by June 2019. The print on demand version will be ready by August 2019. We plan to have copies of it for sale at our booth at GenCon Indy 2019. Because one-third of the art is already done, the book is written, and we've done layout for six of the playbooks, we're confident that this is a reasonable timeline for the additional art and layout, plus the editing. \nOver half our funding goal goes toward the art (we love paying artists!), and the rest is for layout and for the cost of, and shipping for, the books we will be sending directly to backers in the wholesale reward tier and other tiers that involve additional physical objects.\nhandy chart of what the funds will be going towards\nGlad you asked! There sure are!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've funded the printing of two books in previous Kickstarter projects, so we're familiar with the process of editing, layout, and fulfillment. This project is a little larger than those were, but we're making fulfillment easier on ourselves by using DriveThruRPG's distribution channel for PDFs and for print on demand books. This will also make it possible to scale up easily no matter how many backers we get.\n\nThis is our first published game system, though we've been homebrewing all sorts of systems for years. We decided to use the template of Powered by the Apocalypse so that we can be confident we're building on a solid rule base. We've also been playtesting with many groups of varied backgrounds for the last half year.\n\nFor the wilder reward tiers, we have the fortune of being the same team working behind the scenes at The Five Wits, and having access to the costuming and apothecary supply chains that let us provide customized and magical reward options. We also have a daily shipping operation we can piggyback on, so backer fulfillment can dash along smoothly. The risks we are facing go hand in hand with the above. Our team doubles as the staff for a busy little traveling business, and rolling game design and distribution into our portfolio is no small feat. It is, however, one we have long been dreaming of and planning for. Our reputation is on the line to deliver, and we take that very seriously.

It was where some of the greatest writers of the 20th Century got their start and some of the most iconic characters made their debut, from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan and John Carter to Maxwell Grant's The Shadow to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. \nWithout the pulps, comic books may never have introduced the super-hero...and then where would we be today?\nThe pulp magazine era was bristling with brawny men and statuesque women globetrotting, and getting into and out of danger. Their exploits quickened the pulses of their readers, young and old alike. They gave rise to some of the most enduring heroes known the world 'round.\nTo honor and celebrate a bygone era, I have partnered with most of my Crazy 8 Press team. If you've loved Aaron Rosenberg's work on ReDeus or From this is Hell or Paul Kupperberg's super-hero comics and adventure stories or the intergalactic adventures from Mary Fan or the noirish stylings of Russ Colchamiro, then you know what you're in for. Aaron, Paul, Mary, the late Glenn Hauman, and Michael Jan Friedman are all signed on for the project. \nAdditionally, I have assembled a stellar line-up of other writers \u2013 Derek Tyler Attico, Jim & Becky Beard, Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Robert T. Jeschonek, Amy Lewanski, Karissa Laurel, and Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg \u2013 to produce new thrills and chills, spanning the traditional pulp realms of mystery, sword and sorcery, horror, science fiction, romance, and high adventure, in a volume appropriately titled...Thrilling Adventure Yarns!\nMeet Professor Ironheart! The Blue Mask! The Green Lady! Cannon Belle! And many more brand-new heroes that would have made pulp-era creators proud.\nAn Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished World War I aviator tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign. \nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns -- in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable British artist Alex Ronald. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $4,500, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package--to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't. Just take any existing package of $25 and up and add to it the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list. Then send us a message letting us know what additional reward or rewards you've qualified for. (International backers, there will be some additional postage; if you're interested in an add-on, shoot us a message and we'll figure it out.)\nGet listed as a patron on the acknowledgments page                                     10. \nReceive a one-time mention as a character, street, company, etc.             35.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #1                                                                                   20. \nCrazy 8 e-book package #2                                                                                   20.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #3                                                                                   20.\nPackage #1 includes Six Scarlet Scorpions (a Pat Savage novel) by Will Murray; No Small Bills by Aaron Rosenberg; In My Shorts (a short story collection) by Paul Kupperberg; Pulling Up Stakes by Peter David; ReDeus: Divine Tales, and The Fire Dragon by Mary Fan.\nPackage #2 includes The Camelot Papers by Peter David; Finders Keepers by Russ Colchamiro; Flynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil by Mary Fan; a collection of five short stories by Keith R.A. DeCandido; For This Is Hell by Aaron Rosenberg and Steve Saville, and Fight The Gods by Michael Jan Friedman.\nPackage #3 is a Crazy 8 Press Anthology pack that includes the entire Latchkeys series; ReDeus: Divine Lands; Love, Mayhem, and Murder; They Keep Killing Glenn, and Tales of the Crimson Keep.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition (after the option is unlocked, of course). \nStretch Goals!\n$5,000 will allow me to include stories from three long-time reader favorites: Keith R.A. DeCandido, Will Murray and Peter David.\nIn many ways, Will has been almost single-handedly keeping the pulps alive with his articles and short stories throughout the years. He's also been writing authorized novels featuring Doc Savage, Tarzan, and others. He knows his way around a good yarn.\nKeith is the award-winning author of more than fifty books, including some of the best Star Trek novels around. And his Dragon Precinct books have a cult following all their own.\nPeter is the famed Writer of Stuff whose pulp-inspired works include several Zorro stories. But really, we know and love him for his runs on The Incredible Hulk, Young Justice, and Star Trek. His original works range from science fiction to satirical vampire tales.\nNew! At $6,000, we unlock \"the hardcover option,\" allowing any backer whose reward includes a paperback copy on to upgrade to a handsome hardback version of Thrilling Adventure Yarns (see A La Carte menu above).\nNew! At $6500 we will upgrade those receiving one signature to three signatures from our illustrious cadre of authors.\n$7000 will allow me to hire a cadre of talented artists to render a black and white illustration for each and every story in the collection. \nAt $8,000 we can send everyone a digital art set of images, suitable for your digital wallpaper. \nNew! At $9000, we will send every backer a digital copy of Peter David's Sir Apropos of Nothing, his critically acclaimed humorous fantasy novel. It's the first in a series and the long-out-of-print second and third volumes will finally be available once more in the summer so now's a great time to get introduced to the series.\nNew! At $10,000 we will up our guarantee of three autographs per print edition to five autographs.\nWe'll be announcing other stretch goals as our campaign develops. We don't want to give away all our secrets!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript is nearly complete already, with 90% of the stories in and more than half of them already edited.

Awkwardly, of course, because this is me we're talking about. But then I said, \"No! If I become a publisher, I'll never have any time to write.\"\nShortly after that, I established the Realm Makers Conference, because that definitely hasn't cut into my writing time. But it's been worth every hour of planning, traveling, and instituting of plans B, C, and D, because Realm Makers has become so much more than an annual writers conference. We're a modern-day tribe, in the best sense of the word.\nAnd where writers gather, ideas for books grow. In 2016, we partnered with Brimstone Fiction to publish our first anthology of fantasy and science fiction, entitled Realmscapes. \nToday, we're stepping up our game to bring to you our first PAID anthology, RealmScapes: Heroes of the Realm. \nWith the assistance of editor Danielle Ackley-McPhail, we're looking forward to bringing you a collection of some of the best fantasy and sci-fi by authors of faith. RealmScapes: Heroes of the Realm will feature stories from established, bestselling authors from every corner of the genre.\nOur core book will feature stories from L. Jagi Lamplighter, Wayne Thomas Batson, Kathy Tyers, James Chambers, Steve Rzasa, Paul Regnier, and Jeffrey Lyman.Your pledges fund every detail of this anthology's production, since there's a huge investment of time and skill that make books a reality. A fully-funded campaign will pay for the anthology's flashy cover art by Kirk DouPonce, the skill and precision of our editor, Danielle Ackley McPhail, market-rate compensation to each author for their fine words, book formatting and layout, and the initial print run of the books, among other administrative costs associated with publishing. (They are small, but many, like a legion of goblins that creeps up on you and overwhelms you, even though you've got a massive sword and plate armor.)\nEspecially for our first 50 backers: You'll receive a digital, DRM-free ebook of Danielle's Yesterday's Dreams, (in addition to the perks that come with whatever backer level you choose) because early adopters are the people who make tomorrow's dreams come true! \nSo grab your cloak, your blaster, and a cup of coffee, and join us for the adventure of building the second Realmscapes anthology, Heroes of the Realm.

Since September 2000, we have been publishing new issues every Monday, including fiction, poetry, reviews, essays, and interviews. In 2017, we published almost 1,000,000 words over 51 issues, all paid to our contributors, and all paid for by you, our supporters.\nWe're entirely funded by voluntary contributions. We pay all our contributors fair market rates for their work, but our (frankly enormous) volunteer editorial team does it out of love.\nWhy support Strange Horizons?\nBecause we believe that in the twenty-first century, speculative fiction must be an open, global tradition. For over fifteen years, we have showcased work that challenges us and delights us, by new and established writers from diverse backgrounds and with diverse concerns. \nBecause we have a record of finding and supporting exciting new voices in SF: writers who got their start in Strange Horizons include N. K. Jemisin (\"The You Train,\" from 2007), Justine Larbalestier (\"The Cruel Brother,\" from 2001), Ken Liu (\"The Algorithms for Love,\" from 2004), Nnedi Okorafor (\"The Palm Tree Bandit,\" from 2000), John Scalzi (\"Alien Animal Encounters,\" from 2001) and, in more recent years, G. V. Anderson (\"Das Steingesch\u00f6pf\", from 2016).\nBecause we're a multiple Hugo-shortlisted magazine (for six consecutive years!) and we've published stories that have been shortlisted for or won Hugo, Nebula, James Tiptree Jr., Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy Awards.\nWhat We Need\nWhat we need to raise:\nWe need $13,000 to fund the basic running costs of the magazine for 1 year\nAt $14,500 we'll run a special issue packed with international SFF \nAt $16,000 we'll run a special issue focused on web comics \nAt $21,000 we'll be able to \ud83c\udf89 pay our staff \ud83c\udf89for the first time in our history\nIf we hit $23,000 we'll unlock the first stretch goal \nAnd at $25,000 we'll unlock the second secret goal!\nWhat You Get\nWhat do you get out of this?\nIf you donate $25 you get access to all of 2018's Strange Horizons ebooks \nIf you donate $40 you get the above and digital wallpaper of our 2018 artwork for your computer/phone/device.\nIf you donate $50 you get the above and a mug, t-shirt or tote bag branded with the Strange Horizons logo\nIf you donate $75 you don't have to choose!

The books will be edited by Patricia Bray & S.C. Butler (PORTALS), David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier (TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED), and Steven H Silver & Joshua Palmatier (ALTERNATE PEACE).\nUnlike the first two Kickstarters run by Zombies Need Brains, we are NOT using the Kickstarter to help set up and solidify the small press. Backers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will still be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run.\nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition! Help the small press Zombies Need Brains LLC expand! ZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors. Check out our current offerings: \nTemporally Out of Order \nAlien Artifacts \nWere- \nSubmerged \nAll Hail Our Robot Conquerors! \nThe Death of All Things\nGuilds & Glaives\nSecond Round: A Return to the Ur-Bar\nThe Razor's Edge\nat https://squareup.com/market/zombies-need-brains-llc. You can also find them online at Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble; they are available in trade paperback format as well as on almost all ebook platforms (Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Scribd, etc.).\nWe offer professional pay rates and feature stellar cover art. As we did in our previous anthologies, we plan to include the very best stories we can find, spanning the gamut from bestselling authors to new, previously unpublished voices, including an open submission window if the Kickstarter is successful, where anyone can submit their stories featuring the current themes for a chance to be part of the anthologies. And Zombies Need Brains is officially a \"qualifying market\" for the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA)! With your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you! Consider backing our Kickstarter and then help spread the word. Just as Zombies Need Brains, we need your support to make this new small press a success. So what are the current projects? Here are the details:\nPORTALS:\nIn the blink of an eye, the familiar disappears as you step into the unknown. What new creatures will you meet? What strange planets will you explore? Will you find happiness, or doom? Open the pages of PORTALS, the newest anthology from the small press Zombies Need Brains, and you just might find out.\nFrom wardrobes to monoliths, wormholes to fairy rings, there is a rich tradition of stories in both science fiction and fantasy that explore what happens when--by accident or design--characters are transported from one world to another. Join fourteen of today\u2019s leading science fiction and fantasy authors as they offer fresh takes on this classic theme. Whether a routine trip or unexpected journey, each tale will explore new worlds of adventure, mystery, humor, and horror, with stories for every taste and fancy.\nEdited by S.C. Butler and Patricia Bray, PORTALS will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of up to 6,000 words each. It will include short stories by: \nJacey Bedford\nF. Brett Cox\nJames Enge \nEsther Friesner \nNancy Holzner \nGini Koch \nViolette Malan \nJaime Lee Moyer\nIan Tregillis\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nTEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED:\nIn our spam boxes today, we both received notices that our bank accounts required resolution, and the content of the spam contained the following sentence: \"We have noticed that you need to resolve important security issues on your account to prevent temporal deactivation.\" Of course, our immediate thought was of a new anthology called TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED!\nFor this follow-up to 2015\u2019s TEMPORALLY OUT OF ORDER, we are looking for stories that take a person, object, event, or phenomenon and somehow, during the course of the plot, \u201ctemporally deactivate\u201d it, whatever that may mean in the context of the story. \u201cTemporal deactivation\u201d should refer to something more than a simple death, malfunction, or termination, and instead should touch in some way on issues of time \u2014 its flow, distortion, dislocation, etc.\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, it will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of up to 6000 words each. It will include short stories by:\nC.S. Friedman \nFaith Hunter \nD.B. Jackson\nGini Koch \nStephen Leigh \nMisty Massey \nJenna Rhodes \nEdmund R. Schubert\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nALTERNATE PEACE:\nAll too often, alternate histories are based on a battle or assassination. We\u2019re looking for stories where change grew out of more peaceful activities\u2026science, business, and culture. Imagine a world in which the branch point from our own was caused by scientific endeavor, social change, natural forces, or other points of divergence which don\u2019t rely on military activity or violence.\nEdited by Steven H Silver & Joshua Palmatier, it will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of up to 6000 words each. It will include short stories by: \nD.B. Jackson \nStephen Leigh\nIan R. MacLeod\nKristine Kathryn Rusch\nKari Sperring\nHarry Turtledove \nRick Wilber\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nThe images that will be used to design the cover art are commissioned pieces created by Justin Adams of Varia Studios. The cover art for \u201cPortals\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter.\n\"Portals\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2018. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of February 2019 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2019. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 6 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far:\nStretch Goal: BOOKMARKS! At $27,500, every backer pledged at $20 or more will receive a free promotional bookmark for PORTALS, TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED, and ALTERNATE PEACE.\nStretch Goal: At $30,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology that is really a THREE-PART STORY cut up into three sections, each section written by the editors of the appropriate anthology (see Update #15 for more details), so each anthology will feature 15 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"The Royal Scam\" by Gini Koch, the first installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $32,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"When Josie Comes Home\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the first installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $35,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Three Card Monte\" by Gini Koch, the second installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $37,500, every backer pleding $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Deacon's Ark\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the second installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $40,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology using the submissions from the open call, so each anthology will feature 16 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"A Bug's Life\" by Gini Koch, the third installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $45,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.\nStretch Goal: At $50,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FOURTH themed anthology, title to be announced as we approach the stretch goal.\nOther stretch goals will be added as the Kickstarter continues.\nAdd-ons are extra items that current backers can add to their current pledge level.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2019. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

(And for those of you who Kickstarted Mermaid Precinct, that is still in progress, and should be done in the next few weeks, with the book itself ready some time after that. You'll be seeing more in-progress chapters this week.)\nOne of those stories I did via Kickstarter, entitled \"Gan Brightblade vs. Mitos the Mighty.\" The response to that story -- which didn't actually include any members of the Cliff's End Castle Guard -- was strong enough that I've wanted to write some more stories that look at the greater world of Flingaria beyond Cliff's End and the cops who maintain law and order therein.\nTo that end, I've written a story called \"The Fall of Iaron.\" It tells a story of the history of Flingaria, in particular a battle that took place in Iaron, one of the other human city-states that's is allied with Cliff's End under the rule of King Marcus and Queen Marta. \n\"The Fall of Iaron\" is about history, about storytelling, about political machinations, and about what makes a hero and what makes a tyrant and what makes a villain. I'm quite pleased with it, and I hope you'll enjoy it, too.\nThe story is already written, and the only changes still to be made to it are the names of up to ten of characters in the story who will be renamed based on who pledges at the $65 level. Aside from that -- and adding the acknowledgments to include all you kind folks who pledge -- the story is done and edited, so as soon as the project is funded, I can start sending out the main reward, to wit, the story itself. The eBooks should also go out in relatively short order as well.\nIf you just want the story itself, it's only two bucks, but there are other nifty rewards at higher levels, including swag, me reading the story, other books of mine, and a new one, offering my editorial services! I've been a professional editor for almost thirty years now, and I'm offering editing of either your short fiction (20,000 words or less) or your novel (100,000 words or less) at a lower rate than my usual.\nSo please, fund this project, and get a nifty new story in this fun universe I've created.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe story's already written, so the risks are minimal.

The best of games capture the tried elements of 40 years of fantasy roleplaying evolution: balance, flow of play, a smooth learning curve, and system that well-serves setting.\nIn 2007, Metal, Magic and Lore was introduced, with its powerful system with emphasis on realism and grit with speed of play. MML developed a loyal, passionate following that has stayed with it ever since. And NOW based both on the desires of those players and critics of the game, we are proud to integrate a number of upgraded improvements, and introduce the  Metal, Magic, and Lore Revised Edition.\nAre You One Of Us?\nFollowing the traditions of Tolkien, Howard, Brooks, and Abercrombie, in Metal, Magic and Lore nearly any literary character can be brought to life due to its class-less, level-less character system. Here you\u2019ll find Men, Dwarves, Elves, and others locked in struggle against adversaries common and fantastic. MML is for a particular kind of fantasy gamer: a lover of fantasy, but also a lover of the rich experience of simulation and realism; mature role-playing at its best.\nNew to the game? Eight reasons to try it -\nThis is traditional fantasy, a time of Men, Dwarves and Elves. There are 3 other offshoot races, which do not deviate far from these classic archetypes which shaped the very origins of the genre! \nCharacters are created by allocating Attribute points to nine attributes. Secondary attributes are calculated from these, so all of them are important; Min/Maxing has been proven to be nearly impossible within the MML architecture. Characters are class-less and level-less, and are created by selecting skills as negotiated by the player and GM to form the character composite. The revised addition adds clarity and definition to this to make it easier to start, as well as some pre-assembled templates. Characters get better by improving skills, making them more effective at interaction, better at attacking and defending, and casting spells.  \nSkill checks are a percentile-system based. Roll dice under the percentage for success. All task attempts in the game are given by the same universal formula: combat, magic and social interaction are all resolved as a combination of skill and the difficulty of the task attempted. GMs add/subtract modifiers as per situation. Characters skills are developed only by them being used, and all types of skills are needed for survival!\nEconomics in the game are dramatic as seen with character Social Class - the Commoner, the Merchant Class and the Lesser Noble, akin to the castes of Medieval Europe at about the 12th century, so coin and provisions are key to adventure. Travel is part of the adventure, as is the countryside and rumors that it contains.\nCombat is deadly. Initiative matters because striking first can mean not being attacked. Character A attacks, character B defends, then a position is chosen on the body, over which there may or may not be armor. And well, with a sword against no armor - you can imagine what happens. Hit Points are location based and never increase (only by a point or two in the advanced rules).  Characters become no tougher in the game, just harder to hit while they hit others better.\nMagic has lower power than many other fantasy games, but is as effective due to the game setting. Regardless of the type of magic, a point pool system is used to determine amounts of spells. The method of casting uses the same percentile system as is described above. Players do find this approach refreshing, though in the revised edition we will be correcting some scaling errors and rounding out the magic so that it better reflects the lore of the game as is intended.\nBeasts are creatures foul and feisty, but there are not many. We look to publish about 50. Beasts are tied to the ecology, which will be portrayed in future regional atlases. Most current fans and gamers have not gotten through using even 20 in a multi-session campaign. Orcs, Ogres, Goblins, Giants, and many traditional archetypes is what you will see here.\nIf you like mature storytelling, literary fantasy which can easily mimic any HBO episode of Game of Thrones, the idea that it only takes 7 or 8 orcs to present an experienced set of characters with a problem, then you will probably want to try Metal, Magic and Lore.\nPledge Levels\nEach Pledge Level includes all rewards of any of lower dollar value, so your collection will accumulate with your pledge!

Colonists must depend on their grit and ingenuity.  \nWhen a garbled message is received by unconventional means, warning of an alien attack, many on Morrow think it a joke, or spotty communication. No one can believe what they are hearing.  \nThere is no time to reconsider as flashes light up across the planet\u2019s horizon. Not even knowing they aren\u2019t alone in the universe, humanity falls victim to first contact and very few on Morrow are left alive, somehow overlooked by an alien force bent on their destruction.

The reason I'm contacting you at the moment is because I want to bring somebody else's Kickstarter to your attention.\nYou see, my company used to own a time travel roleplaying game and I wrote a number of adventures for it. I've also written a number of time travel tales in my time, so I couldn't help but be intrigued when I ran across Singular Irregularity, a Kickstarter for an anthology about time travel gone terribly wrong. Better yet, I knew some of the authors from other projects. But, best of all, when I contacted Kimber Grey, she gave me a chance to join the project, adding my story \"Standing Still\" to the temporal mix. And ... since I used to run those time travel adventures I wrote for the Timemaster Roleplaying Game at conventions, she added a pledge level whereby I will run one of my old time travel adventures for the backer of that reward and five of their friends.

To add one of the below onto your current pledge, just click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button at the top right of the page, click in the \"Pledge Amount\" box, and change the pledge amount to reflect the addition of the amount of the add-on you want. \nExample: if your current pledge amount is $10, and you want to add a $5 add-on, you would click into the \"Pledge Amount\" box and change the pledge amount to $15. At the end of the Kickstarter, we'll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for.

Through the ages, we\u2019ve given various forms to our fears. Vampires. Werewolves. Zombies. MONSTERS!\nBut are we really afraid of the monsters, or of ourselves\u2026?\nSilence in the Library Publishing is excited to bring you our latest anthology, MONSTERS!, a collection of short fiction about things that creep, crawl, bite, go bump in the night, and make us wonder \u201cHey, who turned out the lights?\u201d\nInside the pages of MONSTERS!, you'll find stories from authors including Aaron Allston, Michael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Addie J. King, Aaron Rosenberg, Janine K. Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many more.\nWhile you\u2019ll find plenty of traditional horror stories in this anthology, you\u2019ll also find that many of our authors decided to approach the genre in a different manner. \nA Greek hero faces the brute strength of a cyclops with only his wit - but is he really a hero, and is the cyclops really a brute?\nA demon who can only curse people if doing so will make them happy. If his nature is to curse, how can he solve his dilemma?\nYou'll find stories like these and more in the pages of MONSTERS! We've used this anthology to ask some intriguing questions.\nWhat would the traditional horror story look like told from the monster\u2019s point of view? What is the relationship between monster and victim? Is the monster really the monster, and is the victim really the victim? \nAs part of this Kickstarter, you'll also be able to purchase the companion anthology, Soothe The Savage Beast, featuring stories by Beth Revis, Carrie Ryan, Michael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Janine K. Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many of the other authors in MONSTERS!\nOf course, the stories in this anthology are amazing, but no Silence in the Library anthology would be complete without illustrations.

We can\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t get eaten, but at least you\u2019ll see what\u2019s eating you.\nFor those of you who just have to have the extra protection, we\u2019ll also be offering necklaces of garlic cloves handmade by author Janine K. Spendlove. They\u2019re 83% guaranteed to ward off vampires, and come in wooden presentation boxes.\nWe're also offering a necklace of garlic cloves that's 96% guaranteed to ward off vampires. It's exactly like the one that's 83% effective, but costs more. Why would you spend the extra money? We don't know. Why are you buying a necklace to ward off vampires in the first place?\nFinally, we\u2019ll be offering MONSTERS! zombie targets for those of you who want to practice your zombie killing skills.

(here you have to imagine big infomercial graphics, because that's what we did when we wrote it) We'll also be adding stories and authors to the anthology as we reach stretch goals. Our stretch goal authors include: Maggie Allen, John Hartness, Gail Z. Martin, Cary G. Osborne, Beth Revis, Samantha Rich, and Tamsin Silver.\nBUT THERE'S EVEN MORE! (okay, maybe that was a bit excessive, but we couldn't resist) As we reach certain stretch goals, backers will get free digital downloads of amazing novels and short stories from our MONSTERS! authors.\nSilence in the Library was founded by a group of authors based on the notion that it is important to make the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work.\nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce the anthology\u2026to print the book, pay the authors and artists, and to fulfill your rewards. There is no profit built into this for the publisher. As part of our model, the authors share with the publisher in any profit from the sale of books. That includes sales through Kickstarter. We're not out to get wealthy on the back of this book, but just to make enough money that it is financially viable for us to continue to put out great projects like this. It is more important to us that this book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nWe also want to ensure that readers have a voice in the publishing process. Ultimately, readers make all of this possible, and we feel that you should have a say in what gets published and what doesn't. Kickstarter provides the platform that makes this possible.\nSo, take a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the MONSTERS! experience.\nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAs with all of our projects, we've lined up some really great stretch goals that are free to backers. So, after you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live. Please join the team.\nThe way the add-ons will work is that you choose the level at which you wish to contribute, add the price of what you want from the list below, and contribute that amount (or, if you've already contributed, just add the amount from the list below to your current contribution). When the Kickstarter is complete, we will look at each of your selected contribution levels and the amount you have contributed, and if you have contributed more than the selected level we will contact you to find out which of the add-ons you would like.\n$5 - The eBook of Soothe the Savage Beast\n$10 \u2013 The MONSTERS! keychain flashlight\n$15 - A signed 8x10 print of an illustration of your choice from the MONSTERS! anthology (if you're an international backer, please add $3 for shipping)\n$15 - Upgrade your trade paperback copy of MONSTERS! to a hardcover copy.\n$15 - A trade paperback copy of Soothe the Savage Beast (If you've backed at an electronic reward-only level, please add $5 for shipping.

Our goal is to bring this wonderful work of literature to life in an edition beautifully illustrated by award-winning artist Janet Lee, with a cover by award-winning artist Jean Masetti.\nWe\u2019re incredibly excited to have Janet on board for this project, and she\u2019s been turning out some amazing illustrations for this book.

We think you'll agree with us that Jean has managed to capture the spirit of the book wonderfully.\nBut there\u2019s more! As we reach stretch goals, we\u2019ll be adding full-color, full-page illustrations and black and white partial page illustrations to the book, until we\u2019ve reached a total of twenty-four full-page illustrations and thirty partial page illustrations.\nEveryone working on this project has a passion for Pride and Prejudice, and we want to produce a beautiful book that\u2019s going to be accessible to as wide an audience as possible.

The cost of production is high, but the result is a true masterpiece whose price is many multiples lower than the original.\nThis will be a truly fine binding, with handsewn headbands, gilt inner dentelles, leather joints inside, formed headcaps, corner mitered and filled, and more.

Scott has been writing stories since he was a kid. We launched Sea Urchins at The [Myrtle Beach] Sun News in 2001. Scott planted the idea for a comic strip by sending me a copy of Hogan\u2019s Alley Magazine and disappearing for a few months. By the time he'd resurfaced, I'd talked to my editors (thanks Denny, Trisha, and Mike) about about the possibility of a comic strip and a vague notion of its premise. I promised the strip if the writer, Scott, could commit to it. When Scott returned, we set sail.\nAbout Sea Urchins\nThe Sea Urchins story as told by Rudy the Red, from Book One\nHalf obscure early 1900s comic strips, half Popeye, half Little Rascals, and half Scott and Jason, Sea Urchins is a comic done in the classic adventure comics style.\n\"Olie Unrun always wanted to live a life at sea. Instead, he worked at his dad's fish-oil factory and began the life of a family man. One day, something in Olie snapped and he built a ship in his yard... then he relocated his house to the deck of that ship and christened the whole shebang \"The Banana Moon.\" All Olie had to do was wait for the right storm to lift his house to the sea.\"\nNow adrift, the Unruns piece together each day through a host of uncommon creatures and comic calamities.\nSea Urchins Book One is the first in a series of books collecting the comic-strip adventures of Olie and Ali Unrun, their children: Cuss, Sherfew, Ella, and Darla. \n\nA Sea Ape watercolor\nSea Urchins also appeared in Penn State's Blue newspaper, and was one of Hogan's Alley's top 25 undiscovered gems. Plan 9 Publishing printed the first Sea Urchins comic strip collection in 2003. Though the print edition sold out long ago, Book One is now available for Kindle.\nSea Urchins Book One\nAbout the Campaign\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to provide us with the means to bring you Book Two, In The Shadow of the Sea Apes. Book Two digs deeper into the Unrun family mythos by introducing the Nauticles, the Eel-Riders, and an adventure focusing on the Sea Apes.\nStretch goals\nEvery $500 increment will unlock a surprise digital goal.\nEvery $1000 increment will unlock official swag for everyone donating $50 or more.\n$3,850 prints the book, allows for a small advertising budget\n$5,000 stretch goal = book plus full color ebook\n$10,000 stretch = full color print book two\n$15,000 stretch = full color print book two and black and white book three\n$20,000 stretch = full color print book two, black and white books one and three\n$30,000 stretch = full color print books one, two, and three\nThe Sea Urchins launch from The Sun News, and Book One in print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe didn't need a Kickstarter for Book One, because the Sea Urchins book series was being published by Plan 9 Publishing. Plan 9 went out of business in 2004. \n\nSea Urchins Book Two is a low-risk venture. The content and design is complete. We might run into problems at press (if they reverse the pages, etc). \n\nFulfillment is a challenge, as we will be handling that ourselves. But that is a challenge we\u2019re willing to risk, because our goal is to keep the Unrun family afloat! What\u2019s life without taking risks, anyways? If we didn\u2019t think Sea Urchins was something special, we\u2019d be drawing comics with talking animals and teenagers.\n\nWe will be using Kickstarter funding to print the book, to fund advertising, and to help with distribution.\n\nIf any delays occur, backers can expect honest updates.

Over millions of years, separate and distinct landmasses have crawled  across the planet's surface on immense tectonic plates to form a single mass--a super-continent. Geologists have dubbed the most recent such formation Pangaea.\nOf course, Pangaea broke up a long time ago, and because it did, mankind developed in drastically different climes and circumstances. But what if we twenty-first century types were living in one of the super-continental periods--those characterized by \u201clid tectonics\u201d rather than \u201cplate tectonics?\u201d What would it be like if all of humanity was confined to a single landmass...and had been so confined for all of our recorded history?\nThat's the ever-so-tantalizing axis on which our Pangaea anthology turns.\nIt's an exciting and original idea, one that deserves the best world-building talent available. So to explore this world on your behalf, we've harnessed the word-smithing abilities of some of science fiction's most inventive writers.\nThe Pangaea Publishing Model\nIn a traditional publishing arrangement, less than 10% of the proceeds from a book go to the author. Hard to believe, isn't it, considering the author is the one providing 100% of the insight and wit? The lion's share of the cover price goes to the book store and the publisher, to cover both their costs and their profits.\nIn the case of this anthology, all proceeds after production and distribution costs go to the writers whose work drew you to the book in the first place--which, after all, is how it should be. When you support Pangaea, you're supporting a new and infinitely more equitable publishing model. You're saying that writers should finally enjoy the fruits of their labor. \nIt's a subversive idea, no question about it. But we believe it's an idea whose time has come.\nWho's We?\nSome of the most respected writers in science fiction and fantasy today. Michael Burstein. Adam-Troy Castro. Russ Colchamiro. Peter David. Michael Jan Friedman. Robert Greenberger. Glenn Hauman. Paul Kupperberg. Kelly Meding. Aaron Rosenberg. Lawrence M. Schoen. Geoffrey Thorne. Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore.\nNot just great writers, by the way. They're also people who love and respect their craft and their chosen genre. If you get a chance to speak with them (and you can at some of the higher reward levels), you'll hear the excitement in their voices as they talk about their contributions to Pangaea.\nThey have signed up for the book no matter what. And others have agreed to come aboard if we hit some of our stretch goals--which, of course, is all the more reason to hit them!\nA La Carte Menu\nRather than ask you to read every possible combination of reward components, here's a handy menu for add-ons. Remember, these are additions to the rewards you'll see on the right side of the web page. All you have to do, when you pledge, is send me a message as to which add-ons you'd like and I'll take care of the rest.\nFor $15 more, you can become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the Acknowledgements page.\nFor $15 more, you can add a second Pangaea trade paperback to your reward at the $25 level or greater. Both books will be signed by three or more of our writers.\nFor $18 more, you can add on one of our author sampler packages of five e-books each. Check out Update #18 for details!\nFor $20 more (plus international shipping of $20 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of Pangaea to the $13 reward level.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition (after the option is unlocked, of course).\nFor $25 more, you can add a copy of the Modala Imperative comic book trade paperback to the $25 reward level. It will be signed (inside or outside, your choice) by writers Peter David and Michael Jan Friedman, and by editor Bob Greenberger. The Modala Imperative is a landmark artifact in the annals of Star Trek lore, featuring the first-ever crossover between the Original Trek characters and those of the Next Generation. U.S. postage is included. Outside the U.S. add an additional $10 for postage ($35 total).\nFor $35 more, you can name a business, a street, or a one-time bystander (phonetically, of course, since this is not our world)--and also become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the Acknowledgements page.\nFor $50 more, you can enjoy a half-hour Skype session with Michael Jan Friedman, Paul Kupperberg, Kelly Meding, Aaron Rosenberg, or Lawrence M. Schoen. These are very limited and available only on a first-come, first-served basis.\nFor $700 more, you or someone you love will receive a large print of an alternate cover to the anthology suitable for framing -- a one-of-a-kind treat specially created for you and signed by talented Brazilian painter Caio Cacau -- as well as smaller prints of the sketches that went into the development of the alternate cover. (No additional postage within the U.S. Outside the U.S., $50.)\nStretch Goals! \nAt $8,500, we unlock \"the hardcover option,\" allowing any backer from $25 on to upgrade to a handsome hardback version of Pangaea (see A La Carte menu above).\nAt $9,000, we send all our backers from $8 on up an e-pub version of Tales Of The Crimson Keep, a fantasy anthology featuring the talents of all seven Crazy 8 Press authors--Russ Colchamiro, Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman, Robert Greenberger, Glenn Hauman, Paul Kupperberg, and Aaron Rosenberg.\nAt $12,000, we send all our backers from $8 on up an e-pub version of Geoffrey Thorne's marvelously offbeat urban fantasy novel, Winter of The Wild Hunt.\nAt $14,000, we add a story to the anthology by an as-yet-unrevealed science fiction writer!\nAt $15,000, we unlock another added value: a guest artist will provide a black-and-white illustration for each of our stories, to be included in every edition of the book.\nAt $16,000, each backer from $25 on up will receive a set of prints of the black-and-white illustrations described above.\nAdditional stretch goals will be announced as we go along (It's more fun when we keep you in suspense)!  \nThe Ground Floor\nOur collective intention is to make this anthology the first of many in the world of Pangaea. We want to make it the kind of place to which you'll return time and again, glimpsing some new and intriguing aspect each time.\nSo sit back. Close your eyes. Feel the sun of Pangaea on your face. Feel the wind of Pangaea in your hair. Hear the voices of Pangaea calling.\nAnd dream...\nOur Writers\nRuss Colchamiro\nRuss Colchamiro is the author of the rollicking space adventure Crossline, the hilarious scifi backpacking comedy Finders Keepers, and the outrageous sequel, Genius de Milo, all with Crazy 8 Press.\nRuss lives in West Orange, NJ, with his wife, two children, and crazy dog, Simon, who may in fact be an alien himself.

This has been an incredible ride, but funding is just the first step and now we\u2019re rolling up our sleeves for the next stage in building the first Cosmakerspace. All of you made this possible!\nYOU CAN STILL HELP!\nTo find out how we are progressing and how to get involved visit our website at www.studiocosplay.org\n If you would still like to contribute to the cause so we can provide the stretch goals that did not fund, you can send contributions through our website or here:\n If you have items you wish to donate, and/or wish to volunteer to support the studio, you may also email us at: ContactUs@StudioCosplay.org\nTo become a Sponsor please email us at: Sponsors@StudioCosplay.org \n \u201cThis is a great campaign that, I believe, is truly focused on the spirit of the cosplay and DIY communities.\u201d - Brian McLaughlin, for GeekDad\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to be able to create your first cosplay costume, or enhance your skills with top-of-the-line tools and materials; and to be able to talk and have fun with likeminded cosplayers while building your next project?\u201d -Medieval Dragon, for World of Warcraft News and BlizzPlanet\n\u201cCosplay is a specific kind of making and needs a specific kind of space. By building it and creating community around it, I can\u2019t wait to see the next level of cosplay emerge.\u201d -Samantha Cook, for GeekMom\nStudio Cosplay is changing the world of cosplay and makerspaces by creating the first ever community-operated workspace designed specifically for cosplayers!  The \"Cosmakerspace\" will be a place where costumers have access to the right tools and equipment and can exchange ideas while collaborating on projects.   We will host on-site instructional classes and hands-on workshops for members to expand their skills. We welcome cosplayers, costume designers, LARPers, photographers, artists, and anyone interested in learning about costuming.  \n\nA community space like this is needed because creating a costume in a confined space is frustrating. It can smother your creativity and cause you to make mistakes or force you to cope with taking out an elaborate element of your costume or prop because you just don't have the resources to bring your imagination to life. In DC, like most metropolitan areas, space is at a premium. Most people don\u2019t have the luxury of garages or workshops in their homes.\nA Makerspace is a community-operated workspace where people with interests in computers, machining, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialize and collaborate.  \nUnlike other Makerspaces, we cater to costumers.  Our Cosmakerspace will have multiple stations specifically for designing and constructing costumes, fabricating armor, and creating props. These stations will include sewing, painting, fabricating, wig styling, and 3D printing. Studio Cosplay will offer all levels of classes for students to improve their costuming skills. We will have a green screen for taking pictures of finished costumes or for meeting up with photographers for photoshoots. Studio Cosplay is creating an environment to make cosplayers' lives easier.\n                                                                                                                                        EXTRA REWARD!! \nWe are overwhelmed with gratitude for the support we\u2019ve received for this project so far! As an extra thank you, we\u2019re sending all of our wonderful backers a sticker of our mascot, Notion, when we fund!      \nWe have established ourselves as a 501(c)(3) Non-profit organization, Studio Cosplay Inc, to administer the workshop. Our $24,000 Kickstarter goal directly funds start-up costs and operating expenses for one year. Most of this will go to rent, utilities, and deposits for a 1000+ square foot studio in the Washington, DC Metro area. The remaining funds will go towards purchasing equipment and paying Kickstarter fees. To meet the needs of interested cosplayers and to fund subsequent years of operation the organization will offer multiple cosmakerspace membership tiers. For pricing and membership information please visit our website.\nWe've toured spaces of various size and location from Falls Church, VA to Rockville, MD.  Where we end up will be determined by this Kickstarter. Our ideal location will be Metro accessible, inside the DC I-495 Beltway, and large enough to house all our stations and classes comfortably.\npotential search locations\nWith funding you could work on your cosplay projects in a space like this!\nWith this Kickstarter, we have budgeted for basic supplies: safety equipment, sewing machines, a dress form, a serger, a ventilated paint area, wig stands, basic fabricating tools (including heat guns and a Dremel set), one 3D printer and a basic photography set up (including a green screen). We would like to do so much more and hope that with stretch goals and donations we will be able to get many of the additional items we need.\nWe hope our cosmakerspace will serve as a sustainable model that can expand to more areas. The cosplay community is global, so even if you are not from the DC area please help us to succeed and reach your local community.\n Thank you\nThank you to the awesome businesses in the geek and gamer communities that have helped us create this Kickstarter.

The last week has been very exciting and were preparing an official announcement that we had finally found a fantastic spot with plenty of space, good ventilation, heat & AC, abundant parking, a pleasant walk to the Metro station, with very affordable rent!  Unfortunately, we received word this week that at the last minute the landlord gave the space to an existing tenant who happened to raise their hand for more space during our lease-signing process, so we lost the opportunity.  It's been an extremely disappointing setback for us, but only a setback.  We may not be able to sign paperwork and start building out the workshop as early as we originally planned but we are still doing everything we humanly can to open this cosplay makerspace before the end of the summer.  Despite the disheartening blow our team dived right back into the location search and came up with an even longer list of candidates than we had found in the last few months.  The market looks to be picking up and we continue to focus our daily efforts on securing the best spot possible for the community.  This is happening!  :)\n\nWe can still use your help.  First, don't stop believin'!  Crowdfunding is hard and you all not only made this campaign successful but you blew our funding goal out of the water!  That in itself has opened possibilities for Studio Cosplay's future location that we wouldn't have otherwise had access to.  Finding the right commercial space is hard too, but we have no doubt it will present itself soon.  Feel free to keep sending us leads -- even if we can't respond to each and every note we absolutely appreciate any information we receive and we look into each tip -- whether it be warehouse space you work near, heard about, or a \"For Lease\" sign you saw while driving by something.  The only places we would really have difficulty occupying would be medical offices that can't allow materials like the ones cosplayers might use, business offices in office complexes that probably wouldn't want us modifying the space for ventilation, or tiny retail places with low ceilings.  But we're certainly willing to be creative with a variety of spaces!  Another area where we can still use help is getting the workshop prepped once we sign a lease.  Many have offered to pitch in and we will definitely need to hit the ground running to make our August grand opening, so please keep an eye out for Volunteer Opportunities and Calls for Action.\n\nThank you all for your patience and for believing in us.  We are very eager to open our doors so local cosplayers can finally have the space they need to make epic costume and prop projects!  Together we are doing this!\n\nEasy way to stay in touch!

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

I do this out of my home and cover all costs out of my own pocket, and love every minute of it!\nTalk of the Tavern is your at-home, interactive, weekly GeekCon. All blended with wit, sarcasm and a pub-like atmosphere. It is done in the style of the great offenders, such as; Lenny Bruce, Wanda Sykes, Sam Kinnison, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Redd Foxx , George Carlin, Chris Rock, Lisa Lampenelli and others. If you are easily offended, you will find we will keep you busy without even trying.\nI have gathered an amazing group of people from diverse ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds to laugh and talk about fun topics or serious issues. We laugh a lot and include our live listeners in the conversation via a Facebook event page, Twitter, or even email.\nWe have covered topics ranging from silly and comedic (such as conspiracies, cryptozoology, Fairy NaughTEA Parties, \"Stress relief\", etc) to serious and hard hitting, (such as Feminism, Gay Lesbian and Transgendered people in our community, racism, as well as the psychology and sociology of human nature), all with a drink in our hands.\nTalk of the Tavern is a community oriented show. We have supported countless authors, artists, artisans, musicians\u2026 the list goes on. Now, we need your help. Listener support is invaluable, and it doesn't matter how much you can give, just that we all work together to continue to get the show we all deserve. I want to continue to revolutionize modern radio and how we interact and communicate with each other, creating community and camaraderie.\nSo, take a look around and choose one of the awesome reward levels, or just contribute a flat amount. I can\u2019t do this without great people, people like you. And it wouldn't be worth doing without you. And most of all\u2026 thank you. Thank you for your support, and for sharing this Kickstarter campaign with others.\nPreviously I had a great setup with high speed internet. I moved and now I don't. That is the short version. I spent the last 6 months \"borrowing\" internet from very gracious friends (mostly just one, thank you and I love you dearly) who would have me over, feed me, let me sit on my computer in their living room for five hours and run the show. Now, I need a permanent solution. My new home only has satellite internet, which comes with up to a twenty second delay when on Skype, and that is without video or running constant streams to my radio station servers.\nI am going to train my co-hosts, Ed Summers and Daphne Dewell, to run the technical and software side of things. And to get a decent signal so I can join in the show without the delay, I am going to get a signal booster installed in my home.\nThe money are seeking is enough to get the hardware and software my co-hosts need to efficiently run the technical side of the show, replace worn equipment of my own, get a zBoost TRIO Xtreme REACH for my home studio, cover the fees associated with a Kickstarter campaign, the rewards offered, shipping, and other business costs such as the website, business cards (and other minor office supplies), and other annual fees.\n$10 - Just Slip Us the Tip: ...and we will toast to your good health on an upcoming episode of Talk of the Tavern. We will deliver this as soon as the live show is up and running, probably sometime in April.\n$25 - Say Cheese: We will send you an autographed 8\" x 10\" color photo of single Team Tavern member. You may choose from Travis Sivart, Kat Taylor of Katastrophe Labs, Kevin Crew, Matthew \"The Correllbow\" Correll, or Ed Summers. It will be inscribed personally to you, and you can display it in any room of your home or work. We will get these out as soon as the Kickstarter campaign funds, probably sometime in April. Note the shipping costs, especially if you are outside of the US.\n$50 - Book Nook: A DRM free digital copy of; Aetheric Elements: The Rise of a Steampunk Reality by Travis I. Sivart, Steampunk For Simpletons: A Fun Primer For Folks Who Aren't Sure What Steampunk Is All About by Travis I. Sivart and Wendy L. Callahan, and the Aetheric Artifacts bundle (4 books, the Chronos Clock, The Daemon Device, The Engima Engine, & The Gilded Gun) by Wendy L. Callahan, Mrs. Bumblebottom and the Chatterbots by Daphne Dewell, and The Completely Inappropriate Tales of Gandersnitch the Goblin by Robert Turk.  Plus more may be added along the way. We will deliver these via email soon after the Kickstarter campaign funds, probably sometime in April.\n***NOTE - We may add more eBooks to this package. If someone has already chosen this reward level we will not be able to change the reward description to the left. Instead we will note it in this description and in a Kickstarter Update to backers.\n$75 - Do You Hear Voices?: Get a 30 second or less voice recording of a single Team Tavern member. Your choices are Travis Sivart, Gabrielle Riel of Radio Riel (who will even help you refine the message), Gandersnitch the Goblin, Kevin Crew, Kat Taylor of Katastrophe Labs, or Matthew \"The Correllbow\" Correll of The State of the Nerd. It will be in mp3 format. This can be for voice mail message, ring tone, or promoting you! Messages are subject to approval.\n$100 - Bar Pack: You get two Talk of the Tavern Mug Shots (mug shaped shot glasses), a metal engraved Talk of the Tavern Flask, two Talk of the Tavern Bar Towels, and four Talk of the Tavern copper tags (can be used as a keychain, luggage tag, or whatever). We will get these out as soon as the Kickstarter campaign funds, probably sometime in April. Note the shipping costs, especially if you are outside of the US. \n$150 - Pick a Topic: (Limited to 40 rewards) You pick a topic for an episode, and we will discuss it for a show. Topics must be approved on a case by case basis and the date the topic airs will be subject to availability. We will plan these and place them on our calendar over the next year, fulfilling all topics by April of 2016.\n$250 - Co-Host the Show: (Limited to 25) We bring you on the show to hang out with us for a full episode. You must have access to Skype (with mic and headset), a Monday night free, and ready to have a good time. Dates are between April 2015 and April 2016 and subject to availability.\n$500 - Sponsor a Show: (Limited to 70) You get a 15 minute pre-recorded interview, and once per hour for that episode we will talk about your product or service for a minimum of a minute, (3 times total). Dates are subject to availability and will air between April 2015 and April 2016. The interview can be done via phone or Skype.\n$1,000 - All of the Above!: Just what it says, you get everything listed in any reward of lesser value than this one. It's a bargain, and only takes one click! All restrictions, including shipping costs, mentioned above apply here also.\n$10,000 - The Tavern Comes to You!: You get everything listed above, and I will fly anywhere in the US and do the show from your home or business, provided you have high speed internet available. All restrictions, including shipping costs, mentioned above apply here also. If you live outside the US, then add $2000 to this, and I will grab my passport!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks are minimal. I have ran this show for well over two years now, and all technical glitches are gone and done. I am now initiating my two co-hosts into the wonders of running the technical side. They are both very experienced and skilled at computers, recording, etc. I don't foresee any issues, but we usually don't, do we? \n\nWhen dealing with technology there are always risks of delays. To counter such possibilities I have a team of experienced and expert eggheads waiting in the wings. I call these folks... my friends. If by some chance there is a technical issue that cannot be fixed, then we will find another way to continue the show!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Travis I.

He lost his battle with cancer, but he did not go quietly and he will not be forgotten. His work is immortalized in over 40 novels or works of non-fiction, and at least as many collections, anthologies, and magazines. In fact, new works by CJ Henderson will publish for years to come thanks to his heroic efforts to finish and find homes for those projects as-yet unpublished at the time of his illness.\nCJ always did what he could to give other authors a boost. Encouraging them, mentoring them, sending opportunities their way. With that in mind those of us who called him friend feel there is no better tribute we can raise in his memory than an anthology filled with people he has helped over the years, writing stories inspired by CJ or his work.\nWe are running this campaign a little longer than usual, primarily because December 26th was CJ's birthday and we plan to celebrate that along with the landmarks we hit with this campaign.\nHe touched our hearts and now we share that with the world because he will not be forgotten. Will you help us share this amazing man with the world?\n CJ's collection of works is vast and varied. Everything from hard-boiled detectives to military science fiction. He's written comics for Marvel and flash fiction for the annual Boris Valejo calendars. He's know for writing pulp and writing Lovecraftian mythos. We wanted to capture some small cross-section of that scope of work.\nWith that in mind, the authors in this collection--Jean Rabe, James Chambers, Patrick Thomas, Greg Schauer, Leona Wisoker, John L. French, Jeff Young, David Boop, Robert M. Price, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, and CJ Henderson himself--have lent their own voices to CJ's worlds, sought to capture a glimmer of him through his beloved written word.\nThis collection is currently comprised of the following stories:\nWhat Tales He Knows by John L. French\nHenderson Rising by Patrick Thomas\nShadow of the Infinite by Leona Wisoker\nEvery Second of Every Day by James Chambers\nFinder by Jeff Young\nIn the Dying Light by Danielle Ackley-McPhail\nStar Lights by Jean Rabe\nScorn and Jealousy by CJ Henderson and David Boop\nDigging Doomsday by Robert M.

At the end of the Kickstarter we'll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for. \nPlease note, for each of the authors in this book this is a for-the-love anthology. Each has elected to not take payment for their stories, so as our thanks we have included their other works in the Add-Ons section of this campaign, along with titles from CJ's backlist. Please browse through and see if any of the titles catch your interest.

Her work is fueled equally by coffee and conviction. She often chooses reading material alphabetically rather than by subject or author, which has led her to read about aardvarks, birds, child-warriors, dragons, eggs, faeries, ghosts, horses, and many other random subjects.\nLeona's science-fantasy series, The Children of the Desert, is set in a world still struggling through a number of basic moral and developmental issues. The beliefs and strengths of each character are tested to the limit in the course of multiple intersecting story arcs. And, of course, there's a mysterious ancient race in the background that could destroy all life on earth if they get sufficiently annoyed. Anything less would just be boring.\nHer short stories have appeared in Futures: Fire to Fly, Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine, Galactic Creatures anthology, Sha'Da: Pawns anthology, and more. She has lived in Florida, Connecticut, Oregon, New Hampshire, Las Vegas, Alaska, California, and Virginia; has experienced the alternate realities of Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, New York, Long Island, and Italy; and believes that \"home is wherever my coffee cup is filled.\"\nShe lives in Virginia with an extraordinarily patient husband and two large dogs.\nJeff Young is a bookseller first and a writer second \u2013 although he wouldn\u2019t mind a reversal of fortune.

And so we set out to produce an anthology where women were involved in all aspects of the creative process, from the artists to the authors, the editors to the project managers. Women of all ages and races, abilities and physical attributes, unified by a love for art and literature.\nIn January 2014, we ran a Kickstarter that was successful beyond our wildest dreams. In just one month, the Athena's Daughters campaign raised $44,350 \u2014 521% of our initial goal. During that campaign we achieved stretch goals that not only funded a companion anthology, Apollo's Daughters (stories about women, but written by men), but also funded the production of a second volume... Athena's Daughters 2 which would have an open call for submissions from any woman who wished to be included. Silence in the Library Publishing immediately began the work of putting together this second collection full of stories about a diverse assortment of female protagonists, all written by women.\nSubmissions for this volume opened in June, and we were flooded with great stories. After a difficult deliberation, we accepted stories by: Tiffani Angus, Antha Ann Adkins, Sarah Brand, Elizabeth Bridges, Megan Chee, Liz Colter, Janice Croom, Ellen Goodlett, Emily Lavin Leverett, Alison J. McKenzie, Megan O'Russell, Tish Pahl, Carrie Ryan, Rori Shay, and Tess Tabak. We'll tell you more about each author below.\nBecause payment to authors, artists, editors, and layout professionals has already been completely covered by the previous Athena's Daughters Kickstarter, we can keep the initial goal very low\u2014enough to cover the costs of printing and shipping. This will allow us to set some really cool stretch goals at very low levels. \nAs we hit stretch goals we will be adding more stories (and more art!) to our anthology. Our stretch goal authors are Jordan Frederick, Lindsay Kitson, Nicole Givens Kurtz, Gerri Leen, Janine A. Southard, and JY Yang. Additionally, backers will receive extra stories and other free downloads as we hit these goals.\nThere is a whole team of us here at Silence in the Library that will be working to bring this anthology to life. Kelli Neier created the cover and will be doing the print and eBook layout, as well as managing the Kickstarter campaign. Ginger Breo has created all the internal art attached to each and every story. Autumn Frederickson will be doing a special cover for the print version of the book, if we hit her stretch goal.

We're proud to be partnering with the Silence in the Library team as they launch Athena's Daughters Vol. 2.\nHere's the description of the new project:\nBorn of the phenomenal success of last year's Athena's Daughters anthology Kickstarter, Athena's Daughters 2 is a collection of short speculative fiction by some of the industry's best up and coming authors.\nThe Athena's Daughters anthology series was envisioned as a platform by which creative women could showcase their incredible talents in a historically male-dominated genre. The result is a series of anthologies where women are involved in all aspects of the creative process, from the artists to the authors, the editors to the project managers. Women of all ages and races, abilities and physical attributes, unified by a love for art and literature.\nFor the second installment of the series, we issued an open submissions call, intent on populating the anthology with the best speculative fiction from up and coming women authors.

Goode is home from the war. Reportedly shattered by his experiences, he takes a night shift job at the local factory. It's no surprise that the girls there are smitten with the handsome young soldier, but as they start to leave their jobs--and no forwarding addresses--Rosie Ransom begins to suspect there's more to Johnny's homecoming than believed.\nWhen Johnny tries to turn a vampiric bite on her, Rosie kills him in self defense--and sees his soul, pure and uncorrupted, rise into the ether. Within hours, she's approached by handsome, dangerous Hank Turner, who believes her to be a Redeemer--a rare talent who can save a lost soul even after demonic possession has taken place. \nRosie, facing the loss of her factory job as men--and her fiance Rich Thompson--come home from the war, is eager for any future that grants her the independence she's come to cherish as a working woman. If there are monsters to slay, she'll embrace the opportunity. Because without Rosie's help, the scare started by Johnny may turn into a full-fledged nightmare...\nRead the first 3 chapters!\n***\nThe \u20ac8K initial goal is, frankly, a low-ball: it'll buy me enough time to write the novel, which is, of course, the whole point. It's not a get-rich scheme. :)\nConsequently, the initial stretch goals are ruthlessly pragmatic: they'll help to cover editing, copy editing, digital formatting and cover art. I'll lay them out below, but excitingly, I've already spoken with artist Lindsey Look, who has done the covers for Tim Pratt's Marla Mason novels. Lindsey is on board for doing the cover art, and her style is perfect for what I have in mind, so I'm VERY HOPEFUL that we'll reach the cover art stretch goal and I'll be able to hire Lindsey as the cover artist.\nRuthlessly Pragmatic Stretch Goals:\nat \u20ac9500, REDEEMER will undergo professional structural editing (hopefully by my former Del Rey editor Betsy Mitchell), which will make it a Much Better Book.\nat \u20ac10K, I'll be able to hire a copy editor who will save me frm embarrassing myself. And I swear I didn't type \"frm\" there on purpose, but I shall leave it for illustrative purposes. :)\nat \u20ac10.5K, I'll hire someone to do the conversions to DRM-free digital format, which will result in vastly superior quality than if I did it myself. :)\nat \u20ac12K, we get gorgeous Lindsey Look cover art!\nIf we reach that stretch goal, I will 1. make incoherent noises, and 2. post some less pragmatic goals. :)\n***\nSo the Redeemer Chronicles are an idea I had a while back, and I was surprised to discover that 1945 is a really difficult era to sell a book in. Apparently it's too recent to be Historical, too Historical to be Contemporary, and too Politically Fraught to be worth the risk.\nNaturally that just made me want to write REDEEMER all the more. I've written a lot of contemporary(urban) fantasy over the past decade, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little burned out on it (which is why you're not seeing a Walker Papers spinoff happening).\nBut setting the Redeemer Chronicles in a different era opens up a whole new aspect of the genre for me. For me, it's not just writing urban fantasy. It's world building in a whole different way: post-war America was a society undergoing massive upheaval politically, socially and emotionally. It's near enough to us, historically, that in a way we think we know it...but at the same time it's shocking how incredibly different things were.\nAnd really, that'd probably be enough, but of course, I'm a fantasy novelist, so I have to throw monsters in on top of it. So what I have here is--well, heck.\nIt is your grandmother's urban fantasy...!\n(Thanks due to J. Howard Miller, whose iconic \"We Can Do It!\" poster is in the public domain & has come to represent Rosie the Riveter to generations of Americans.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe perennial risk of being a parent of a school aged child is that schools are germ factories and I can't swear I wont be laid out from sickness at least once during the writing of REDEEMER. This is one of many reasons I'm not promising it'll be delivered to backers by March. :)\n\nBeyond that, and barring personal disasters, there's little doubt I'll deliver in a timely fashion; I have, after all, done this before, both in crowdfunding and in traditional publication.

Bingle. Frame Shop is a 42,000 word mystery thriller novella set in a writers' group. Unlike a traditional who-dunnit, Frame Shop mixes violence, humor, and occasional writing advice in a format that will keep mystery lovers, aspiring authors, and established writers turning the pages. Frame Shop will be made available in the digital format of your choice: Kindle (mobi) or Nook (epub).  Both DRM-free formats can, with a free app, also be read on any PC, iPad, Mac, smartphone, or phablet.\nYou can get Frame Shop alone or in combination with a number of different novels, stories, or packages by award-winning genre author, Donald J. Bingle.\nAbout Frame Shop\n(Minor spoilers in this section, so skip ahead to the next section if you don't want to know anything else about the plot.)\nHarold J. Ackerman thinks his latest cat mystery proves he is the best writer in the Pleasant Meadows Writers\u2019 Guild and Critiquing Society, not that the motley assortment of poets, poseurs, and wannabe writers in the PMWGCS provides much competition. But then Gantry Ellis, the NYT best-selling author of the Danger McAdams mystery thrillers, joins the group and wows everyone. Still, Harold hopes to leverage his connection to the famous author into a big break, agreeing to help his mentor with some crime research. But when Harold interviews a real-life hit man, he decides to keep the information and contact for himself. Soon, he\u2019s just not writing about crime, he\u2019s a co-conspirator, but he\u2019s such a hack writer, he can\u2019t even do that by himself. Instead, he submits his \"plots\" to the rest of the PMWGCS and its members unwittingly assist.\nCritiquing another writer can be murder, especially when he\u2019s working for a hit man.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from Frame Shop in which the hit man, Guy, is berating Harold (who he calls \u201cSweater Vest\u201d) for attending the funeral of one of Guy\u2019s victims:\n\u201cWhat if they figure out who you are and that you have no connection whatsoever to the deceased? What if they come to your door and want answers?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sweater Vest temporized, \u201cI guess I\u2019d just tell them ...\u201d\nGuy interrupted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say you\u2019d just tell them you read about the murder in the paper and wanted to express your condolences. Nobody crashes graveside services. They crash weddings and wakes, cuz that\u2019s where the free booze is. Besides, I may not know you all that well, but even I can tell that you\u2019re not the kind of guy who has a reputation for spontaneous expressions of sympathy to random strangers. If this was a Lifetime movie, you\u2019d get cast as the creepy dude who spends too much time watching kids at the park.\u201d\nGuy could see Sweater Vest\u2019s blood pressure was rising, too. The fellow\u2019s face was flushing red and his jaw was clenched tight for a few moments before he responded. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be insulting. I had ... I have ... a perfectly good reason to give should anyone ask me why I was at the funeral. It\u2019s the same reason I can give for being anywhere, anytime, watching anything from bums urinating on the subway platform to young women walking by in thin summer dresses.\n\"I\u2019m a writer. My job is to observe things, notice them, experience them, memorize them, and keep them in my mind\u2019s eye for later use. Everything, everywhere is grist for my mill and I grind my flour into a soft, smooth, silky silt. Characters, settings, emotions, storylines, places, things, clothing, arcane bits of description and poetry. A writer has an excuse for knowing everything from nuclear weapon yields to whether college girls typically wear thongs to avoid panty-lines on their tight, tight jeans when they\u2019re attending a kegger at the local frat. I can go anywhere on the excuse of gathering atmosphere. I can ask questions about a building\u2019s security system or untraceable poisons or what knots are best used for S&M bondage sessions without blinking because I can always say it\u2019s research for a book. I don\u2019t even have to produce the book it was for because I can always say I haven\u2019t written it yet.\u201d\nJesus, the kid was really wound tight.\nAbout the Author\nDonald J.

And she dreams she could walk again.\n\nTony is the big man on campus, even if he is a big fish in a very small, brackish pond with plenty of scum. He does whatever he pleases, whoever he pleases.

Sure, Dick's tough and he knows a few tricks to help him get out of a tight spot, even if his boss accuses him of over-reliance on an abundance of explosives. But he's also got a mortgage, a wife upset by his frequent absences on \"business\" trips, and an increasingly alienated teen-age son who spends way too much time playing in gaming worlds on the computer.\nWhen a mission to bust up an arms exchange in New Zealand goes spectacularly bad, Dick is forced to partner with an espionage neophyte to battle evil on multiple fronts, leading to a final confrontation that incorporates real-world conspiracy theories and cutting-edge technology.\nIn the end, Dick can save his partner, save his marriage, save his son, or save the world, but he can't do it all.\nForced Conversion (Five Star; 2004):\nForced Conversion, gripping near future military scifi.\nEveryone can have heaven, any heaven they want, but some people don\u2019t want to go.\n\"Visceral, bloody -- and one hell of a page turner! Bingle tackles the philosophical issues surrounding uploaded consciousness in a fresh, exciting way. This is the debut of a major novelist -- don't miss it.\" Robert J. Sawyer, Hugo and Nebula Award-Winning Author.\nMankind has largely retreated to the realms of virtual reality, where resources are unlimited and the problems of the real world--violence, conflict, sickness, and pain--can all be avoided. Unfortunately, those who stay behind in the real world pose the only risk to the immortality of those who have converted to virtual existence.\nDerek, a soldier in the Conversion Forces (ConFoes), seeks to enforce the Mandatory Conversion Act on the remaining mals (malcontent Luddites, gangbangers, and religious fanatics). He just wants to put in his time and join his family on one of the virtual worlds. But until then, he is forced to deal with his psychotic squad-mates, the increasingly brutal tactics of the ConFoes, and a mal ambush. And that's just the beginning of his journey.\nWhile most speculative and science fiction deals with worlds transformed by technological advance, Forced Conversion highlights the troubling and chaotic process of that transformation, itself. It combines the adrenaline-soaked action of military fiction with the extrapolation of current scientific trends of the best speculative fiction, while dealing with the moral and religious implications of both war and technology.\nIf large scale transcendence could occur, this novel explains how it would come about and what the real world would be like in the aftermath.\nWhen Moore\u2019s Law meets God\u2019s Law, the result is forced conversion.\nSays Ed Greenwood, Creator of The Forgotten Realms\u2122 and Author of the bestselling Elminster novels: \"I loved it! Many writers have explored hard-hitting and brutal possible futures for Earth, and told colorful tales of people trying to stay alive in them, but few have brought such imagined futures as vividly to life as Don Bingle -- and no other book I can think of examines how and why such a future might just happen as well as FORCED CONVERSION does -- or provides half the breath-catching twists and turns of Bingle's yarn. A 'good read' of the old school, coupled with all-too-plausible reasons for everything. A grim warning and a fast action adventure tale, all in one! Highly recommended!\"\nGREENSWORD (Five Star; 2009):\nGREENSWORD, a darkly humorous eco-thriller.\nThey\u2019re about to save the world; they just don\u2019t want to be caught doing it.\nZeke, Milo, and Brandon are struggling to keep their environmental protest group, GreensWord, alive. It impresses chicks and sure beats getting jobs as corporate serfs in the real world. But their chief benefactor, movie star Matthew Barrington, threatens to cut off funding unless they stop global warming before his Malibu beach house slides into the storm-tossed ocean. In their desperate effort to save the beach house and their organization, the GreensWord trio is willing to try almost anything. No plan is so illegal, so risky, or so stupid that they won't lend it an ear. But nothing is fast enough to stop global warming in time ... until they think of the unthinkable solution.\nAnd although they may be crazed fanatics, they've watched enough T.V. to think they know exactly what to do to foil any investigation of their noble crime. And if their drastic solution to global warming means they also take out the reigning internet tycoon and his monopolistic software company, that's just organic frosting on the vegan cake.\nOne person can make a difference in the world.\nOf course, three people with a plan to stop global warming overnight can make a big difference.\nGREENSWORD is a dark comedy about the environment, extremism, stupid criminals, and the lengths to which people will go to avoid getting a real job.\nSays USA Today Bestselling Author of the Warlands trilogy, Elizabeth A Vaughan: \"GREENSWORD is a darkly humorous, gripping thriller that combines environmental imperatives, terrorist activities, and sex in ways that still make me wake up in a cold sweat, months after reading the book, convinced that it could happen.\"\nWriter on Demand TM story collections:\nTales of Gamers and Gaming (Writer on Demand Vol. 1)\nTales of Gamers and Gaming includes three stories, one of novelette length:\n\"The Quest\" (approximately 8,000 words) tells the story of what happens when a group of MMORPG gamers get together in real life. \"Loser Takes All\" (approximately 5,000 words) tells the story of a man always looking for just one more world to conquer. \"Gaming Circle\" (approximately 4,100 words) explains what it is about our real lives that makes us want to game.\nTales of Humorous Horror (Writer on Demand Vol. 2)\nTales of Humorous Horror includes three stories:\n\"BunRabs\" (approximately 3,500 words) tells the story of the real truth behind the connection between Easter and bunnies, at least from a unique point of view. \"Hell to Pay\" (approximately 3,050 words) tells the story of the recording industry's ultimate solution for illiegal downloading of music. \"Cursory Review\" (approximately 4,200 words) shows that demons really don't find it that easy to create cursed objects.\nTales Out of Time (Writer on Demand Vol. 3)\nTales Out of Time includes three stories:\n\"Standing Still\" (approximately 4,600 words) tells the story of one man trying to help another deal with the reality in which he finds himself. \"Knowing She Would\" (approximately 3,600 words) tells the story of a girl visited repeatedly by those who need her help in their journeys. \"A Passion for Time Travel\" (approximately 3,900 words) deals with the problems of a company that sells vacations throughout time.\nGrim, Fair e-Tales (Writer on Demand Vol. 4)\nGrim, Fair e-Tales includes four dark or downbeat stories, two of which are set are fairs or carnivals:\n\"Suburban Legend\" (approximately 6,400 words) rips from the headlines and twists the classic tale of a suburban husband accused of murdering his beautiful wife. \"Artists Only\" (approximately 3,500 words) tells the tale of a little girl who goes unwillingly with her brother to the local traveling carnival, tires of the garish distractions, and becomes lost. . \"Stew\" (approximately 3,900 words) deals with a boy who decides it is right to go to war, but later regrets his decision. \"Grok\" (approximately 4,000 words) is a the story of the mud-man of the local Renaissance Faire.\nTales of an Altered Past Powered by Romance, Horror, and Steam (Writer on Demand Vol. 5)\nTales of an Altered Past Powered by Romance, Horror, and Steam includes four stories:\n\"Dashed Hopes\" (approximately 4,250 words) is a tale of invention, romance, and tragedy set in the coal fields of England. \"Rejecting the Anthropocene\" (approximately 2,400 words) is a cautionary tale about the dangers of ignoring science, no matter how unpopular it may be. \"Gentlemanly Horrors of Mine Alone\" (approximately 7,100 words) is a tale of love, gold and monsters.

Each of the stories in the chain begins with a scene set in The Wanderers' Club in London, where patrons take turns telling stories of their adventures and derring-do.

I've also written a number of time travel tales in my time, so I couldn't help but be intrigued when I ran across Singular Irregularity, a Kickstarter for an anthology about time travel gone terribly wrong. Better yet, I knew some of the authors from other projects. But, best of all, when I contacted Kimber Grey, she gave me a chance to join the project, adding my story \"Standing Still\" to the temporal mix."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "The 1, 2, 3s of Kickstarting", "update_content": "One\nFrame Shop was my first Kickstarter and it was successful in meeting its minimum funding goal thanks to your help.

There's a whole world of science fiction stories published in other languages. We never intended to stop with China, so we've added stretch goals (below) to help us get started on the other languages. The first goal funds at $12,500 and we're very close!\nChina has one of the largest science fiction reading populations in the world and has produced a significant body of work that has remained relatively unseen by English-speaking audiences. In recent years, a few stories and novels have made their way to English language publication, but we are unaware of any project to regularly feature Chinese works in a science fiction magazine.\nClarkesworld Magazine has always aspired to publish stories from a global pool. It's our opinion that different perspectives make the genre stronger. We've published authors from all over the world, but quality translations have been few and far between. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of writer/translators Ken Liu and John Chu, it's been our privilege to publish five. These stories include:\n\"The Fish of Lijiang\" by Chen Qiufan (2013 Science Fiction & Fantasy Translation Awards Winner)\n\"A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\" by Xia Jia (2013 Science Fiction & Fantasy Translation Awards Honorable Mention, 2012 Locus Recommended Reading List selection, and reprinted in The Year's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy, 2013 Edition, Rich Horton ed.)\n\"Grave of the Fireflies\" by Cheng Jingbo\n\"Pepe\" by Tang Fei\n\"Spring Festival: Happiness, Anger, Love, Sorrow, Joy\" by Xia Jia\nand we'd like to bring you even more.\nI've recently signed an agreement with Weixiang (Storycom International Culture Communication Co., Ltd.) to add a translated Chinese science fiction story to each issue of Clarkesworld. Each month, Storycom's team of experts will send us a list of stories they think would work well for us\u2014much like we use our slush pile to choose our current fiction offerings. I'll select one from that pile and then work with the author and translator to get the story ready for publication. Every story will appear in all editions of Clarkesworld\u2014our free online edition, podcast (audio fiction), ebook and digital subscriptions, print issues, and annual anthologies\u2014and provide these authors with significant English language exposure. (They'll be paid too.)\nWe believe that providing markets that actively publish translated fiction is good for readers, authors, translators, and the genre as a whole. Our past experience tells us this is something we are qualified to and should do.\nI'd like this feature to be a supplement to the existing fiction we're publishing at Clarkesworld. Our goal is to raise the funding we need to launch this feature for the first year: three stories in the first six months\u2014our ramp-up period\u2014and six stories in the following six months. This will provide us with the time we need to make this project self-sustaining through subscriptions and other avenues (such as advertising, ebooks, anthologies, Patreon, etc.) \n$5800 to be paid to authors at our standard pay rates for original fiction.\n$450 in increased costs related to creating the audio versions of these stories for our podcast.\nThe remaining amount covers the fees and overhead associated with this campaign (Kickstarter and Amazon fees, print reward costs).\nNote: Translation costs have already been covered.\nNeil Clarke (neil-clarke.com) is the Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of Clarkesworld Magazine. He\u2019s a current and three-time Hugo Nominee for Best Editor (Short Form).  In 2012, Neil suffered a near-fatal \u201cwidow-maker\u201d heart attack which led to the installation of a defibrillator and a new life as a cyborg. Inspired by these events, he edited Upgraded, an all-original anthology of cyborg stories scheduled for publication this month and fully-funded by a Kickstarter campaign. He currently lives in NJ with his wife and two sons. \nClarkesworld (clarkesworldmagazine.com) is a monthly science fiction and fantasy magazine first published in October 2006. Each issue contains interviews, thought-provoking articles and at least three pieces of original fiction. Our fiction is also available in ebook editions/subscriptions, audio podcasts, print issues, and in our annual print/ebook anthologies. We are a three-time winner of the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine, winner of the 2014 British Fantasy Award for Best Magazine, and a four-time World Fantasy Award nominee.

Stories acquired through this fund will be published on an irregular schedule as extra content in Clarkesworld Magazine starting in 2015 and continue until the budget is depleted. \nStretch Goal #2a: $15,000\nDigital anthology\nWe will publish a digital anthology featuring all the stories funded through this campaign (Chinese and Translation Fund fiction). If we reach this goal, the ebook will be added to ALL reward levels. (Money will used to pay authors, cover artist, Kickstarter fees, and ebook design.)\nStretch Goal #2b: $21,000\nPrint anthology\nWe will publish a print edition of the anthology in 2a. If we reach this goal the print edition will be added to all $40 and higher reward levels. Money will be used to pay authors, cover artist, Kickstarter fees, designer, shipping and printing. Note: Additional shipping will be required for international supporters to receive this book.\nStretch Goal #3: $21,000-23,500\nThe Clarkesworld Translation Fund: Non-Fiction \nThe translation fund will expand to include translated non-fiction content.\nAll ebook rewards will be provided in DRM-free EPUB and MOBI/KINDLE formats.\nAnyone contributing at the $10 or higher level in this campaign will be listed in the annual Clarkesworld Census as a citizen. This list is published in print and digital formats as an appendix in our annual anthology.\nOur plan is to launch this new feature in January 2015, which will be our supersized 100th issue. All reward tiers will receive this issue in digital format.\nSince we're giving you issue 100, we're starting all subscriptions rewards in February 2015, with issue 101. This way you'll get all the stories supported by this campaign.\nAll trade paperbacks will be accompanied by the digital edition.\nSigned books will be signed by Neil unless otherwise specified.\nShipping is included unless otherwise noted.

If Clarkesworld: Year Seven is published before this campaign ends, it will be added to the list of titles available as rewards.\nPrint and digital awards that are currently available will be delivered in late October.

Megan is a native of Upstate New York who now spends her time traveling the country as a professional actor with her husband and her trusty ukulele. Look for more books in The Tethering Series coming in 2015.\nAs in past projects, we like to give readers the option of buying a hardback copy of the book. We usually do this as a stretch goal, but with three different books being offered in this campaign, we have to make a slight change in how we measure the ability to offer a hardback option.\nAs the campaign progresses, we will track the \u201csales\u201d for each book and once a particular title reaches $5,000, we will be able to offer backers the option to upgrade their paperback to a hardback or to add a hardback as an add-on.\nThis may inspire a little friendly competition to see who can get their hardback option added first!\n$7,500 \u2013 ACHIEVED \u2013 All backers at $5 or more will receive a free digital download of Vincent Morrone\u2019s novel Vision of Shadows.\n$8,500 \u2013 ACHIEVED \u2013 All backers at $5 or more will receive a free digital download of Rori Shay's novel ELECTED. \n$9,500 \u2013 ACHIEVED \u2013 All backers at $5 or more will receive a free digital download of Megan O'Russell's short story \"At the Corner of the Garden Wall.\"\n$10,500 \u2013 ACHIEVED \u2013 All backers at $5 or more will receive a free digital download of Jean Rabe's short story \"Visage\" from the Athena's Daughters anthology.\n$11,500 \u2013 ACHIEVED \u2013 All backers at $5 or more will receive a free digital download of Megan O'Russell's short story \"Blood on Both Sides.\"\nSilence in the Library was founded by a group of authors based on the notion that it is important to make the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work.\nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce all three books\u2026to pay the authors, artists, and editors, and to pay for printing and shipping your rewards. As part of our model, the authors share equally with the publisher in any profit from the sale of books. This means that there is no built-in profit to us as the publisher. It is more important to us that these book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nWe also want to ensure that readers have a voice in the publishing process. Ultimately, readers make all of this possible, and we feel that you should have a say in what gets published and what doesn't. Kickstarter provides the platform that makes this possible.\nMany of you will have backed our past projects: Time Traveled Tales, A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination, War of the Seasons, Athena's Daughters, Icarus, ELECTED, and HEROES! If you have, you are aware of our dedication to fulfilling our projects on or ahead of schedule. We've worked through out some recent logistical kinks and are now even more prepared to meet our deadlines and exceed your expectations.\nQuick Explanation: Kickstarter doesn't really have an intuitive way to do add-ons, and the process can be confusing, so here's a quick explanation.\nTo add one of the below onto your current pledge, just click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button at the top right of the page, click in the \"Pledge Amount\" box, and change the pledge amount to reflect the addition of the amount of the add-on you want. Example: if your current pledge amount is $10, and you want to add a $5 add-on, you would click into the \"Pledge Amount\" box and change the pledge amount to $15. At the end of the Kickstarter, we'll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for.\nFor this particular Kickstarter campaign, add-ons are a way to customize your chosen backer level.\nExample: Say, you chose THE PAPER TETHER level, which gets you The Tethering ebook and paperback for $15. But maybe you also want an ebook version of Cloak. Solution: Increase your pledge to $20 total and send us a message that you want Cloak ebook in addition to The Tethering.\nAdd-ons also grant you access to some of the previous Silence in the Library releases if you haven't backed one of our past projects.\nEbooks\nNovels\nCloak by Timothy Zahn - $5\nThe Cauldron by Jean Rabe - $5\nThe Tethering by Megan O'Russell - $5\nELECTED by Rori Shay - $5\nVision of Shadows by Vincent Morrone - $5\nSerpent\u2019s Head by Bryan Young - $5\nOperation: Montauk by Bryan Young - $5\nA Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination by Bryan Young - $5\nWar of the Seasons: The Human by Janine K.

The pen is proven to be the world's best ergonomic designed pen, and they've worked hard to make it incredibly stylish and professional at the same time. If you're anything like us, finding the right pen is next to impossible. Well, here it is. You can visit their page by clicking on the image above.\nMy Audiobook Library\nAs you can imagine, as publishers we love books. But we also love audiobooks. We spend a lot of time on the road going to conventions and trade shows around the country, and there's nothing better for a long road trip than a good audiobook. The folks over at My Audiobook Library have a Kickstarter project going right now to expand their audiobook offering to 55,000 titles. By supporting this project, you help to foster selection and competition in the audiobook world, which can only be good for us as consumers. Right now, Amazon controls about 90% of the market. At 55,000, My Audiobook Library becomes a real contender, and can help to normalize pricing at a reasonable level. Please go take a look at this project by clicking on the image or title above. We've backed it, and feel that the long and short term rewards are well worth the money. \nLost Days by Michael Jan Friedman\nMany of you will know Michael Jan Friedman from his work as an author in the Star Trek universe. We, of course, love that work, but we're really excited about all of the stories he's been telling in his own universes. We backed the Kickstarter project for his book I am the Salamander, and are incredibly excited to find that he's back with another project for his new book Lost Days.

Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Jaym Gates, Addie J. King, Jean Rabe, Aaron Rosenberg, Janine Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many more. \nAs part of this Kickstarter, you'll also be able to purchase the companion anthology, A Hero By Any Other Name, featuring stories about sidekicks, off-beat superheroes, and hapless villains by Aaron Allston, Michael A. Stackpole, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Jean Rabe, Janine K. Spendlove, Bryan Young, and many of the other authors in HEROES! Several of the stories in these two anthologies are directly tied to each other.\nOne of the things that we're particularly happy about with respect to this anthology is its diversity. Diversity with respect to gender, ethnicity, age, body type, and life experience. The heroes in HEROES! come from all walks of life. Some have superpowers that make them something more, or less, than human, but others are facing a dangerous world with only their wits and willpower to aid them. We have some of the \"perfect\" comic book heroes, but most of our heroes would be considered flawed by those standards. They're past their physical prime, or seemingly too young for the task at hand, or not in perfect shape, or slightly bumbling, or have any number of other quirks. In other words, they're actual people.\nPlease, let us introduce you to just a few of them:\nKiara Bell is an African American woman in her late twenties who goes by \"Panthera\" when fighting crime. She wears black leather biker gear and rides a Suzuki motorcycle. Her superpower is her chitinous shell, so she is tough, not quick. She gives the impression of gentle strength and fearlessness.\nThunderbolt is a Caucasian male in his mid 20s. He has the ability to shoot incredibly destructive lightning bolts from his hands. His costume (dark blue motocross leathers with a bright orange lightning bolt logo on the chest) does not hide the fact that he is out of shape and slightly pudgy. He has serious body-image issues, and recurring problems with static cling.\nThe unnamed hero from \"By Blood of Fang and Song, We Call You\" by Jaym Gates is an old soldier turned rancher. She is of Hispanic/Native American background, moderate height, strongly built, gold eyes, black hair, dark skin. She lives in a post-apocalyptic world that\u2019s being eaten by monsters and she talks to dragons.\nShade is a twelve year old girl who lives in a swamp called the \"Shake\" by people who live there--she speaks in a somewhat bayou-ish dialect, and the story centers around her search for a man named \"the Caretaker,\" who is supposed to help residents in trouble.\nAs with all of our projects, one of our goals with HEROES! is to prove that there is no \"standard\" face to a protagonist (in this case, a hero), or an author of speculative fiction. Talent and strength know no race, sex, or other artificial boundary. \nWe want to both entertain you and engage you in the discussion of what it actually means to be a hero, and how that burden affects the person who carries it. \nEach of the stories in this anthology is beautifully illustrated by renowned artist Mark Dos Santos. Mark's popular Gotham Evening Post illustrations, which pay homage to the great Norman Rockwell, have been featured on Buzzfeed and io9. Published credits include issues of Grimm Fairy Tales from Zenescope Entertainment, Fall of Cthulhu: Godwar, Cthulhu Tales and Eureka: Dormant Gene for Boom Studios, a comic adaption of The Book of Five Rings for Smarter Comics, and a cover for Hack/Slash from Image Comics. Mark has also illustrated sketch cards for various card sets including, Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Hellboy Animated and Mars Attacks.\nIn addition to illustrating each story in HEROES!, we've developed a beautiful original art cover for the anthology. Created by artist Denis Loubet, best known for his work on computer and video games and pen & paper role-playing games, this cover captures the spirit and diversity of the characters found inside.\nThose of you who have backed past Silence in the Library projects will know that we produced custom \"challenge coins\" for the Time Traveled Tales Kickstarter. Those coins turned out so well, and were so successful, that we've decided to bring them back for the HEROES! Kickstarter. We'll start off with a single challenge coin featuring the HEROES! logo on one side and one of the characters from the book on the other side, and, if we reach the stretch goal, we'll expand that to a full run of 3 challenge coins featuring different characters. As with Time Traveled Tales, you will get to vote on which characters are on the coins. \nAt this point, you're probably asking yourself: \"Okay, self, this sounds great, but what's the entire list of authors?\"\nOr maybe not. But we think you're probably going to want it eventually, so here it is:\nAaron Allston - As many of you know, sadly, Aaron passed away a few months ago. He was incredibly important to all of us here at Silence in the Library. Aaron was instrumental in us getting our feet off the ground as a company, but he was also a dear friend and mentor. As much as we miss him, we are very happy to be able to say that he was able to complete a story for HEROES! before his passing. \nMichael A. Stackpole, Timothy Zahn, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Janine K. Spendlove, Patrick S. Tomlinson, Dylan Birtolo, Donald J. Bingle, Sheryl Nantus, Sarah Hans, Daniel Myers, Bradley P. Beaulieu, Jennifer Brozek, Gregory A. Wilson, Bryan Young, Addie J. King, Aaron Rosenberg, R.T. Kaelin, Jaym Gates, Steven Saus, Tracy Chowdhury, and Kelly Swails.\nBut wait, there's more!\nWe'll also be adding stories and authors to the anthology as we reach stretch goals. Our stretch goal authors include: Alan Dean Foster, Gail Z. Martin, Jean Rabe, Jim Bernheimer, Steven Jordan, Maggie Allen, Rori Shay, and Ron Garner.\nBUT THERE'S EVEN MORE!\nAs we reach certain stretch goals, backers will get free digital downloads of amazing novels and short stories from a variety of authors, some of them in HEROES!, and some not. Authors providing digital stretch goals include: New York Times bestselling author Carrie Ryan (author of The Forest of Hands and Teeth), New York Times bestselling author Michael A. Stackpole, bestselling author Gail Z. Martin, Jim Bernheimer, Donald J. Bingle, Dylan Birtolo, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Vincent Morrone, Megan O'Russell, Rori Shay, Janine K. Spendlove, and Bryan Young. With even more to come!\nSilence in the Library was founded by a group of authors based on the notion that it is important to make the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work. \nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce the anthology\u2026to print the book, pay the authors and artists, and to fulfill your rewards. There is no profit built into this for the publisher. As part of our model, the authors share equally with the publisher in any profit from the sale of books. This means that the publisher will get a share in any profits equal to the share of one author in the anthology. We're not out to get wealthy on the back of this book, but just to make enough money that it is financially viable for us to continue to put out great projects like this. It is more important to us that this book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nWe also want to ensure that readers have a voice in the publishing process. Ultimately, readers make all of this possible, and we feel that you should have a say in what gets published and what doesn't. Kickstarter provides the platform that makes this possible. \nMany of you will have backed our past projects: Time Traveled Tales, A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination, War of the Seasons, Athena's Daughters, Icarus, and Elected.\nAll of these projects have been launched since June of 2013, so in the last year or so.\nWe have sent out the last items (the signed copies of the print books) necessary to have fulfilled 100% of our obligations for Time Traveled Tales, Volume 1. We have completed fulfillment of War of the Seasons, both print and digital, aside from a couple of short stories that are currently being written by stretch goal authors. We have fulfilled print and digital rewards for A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination. Athena's Daughters is on track to be fulfilled ahead of schedule, and Icarus is on track to be fulfilled on schedule. We have fulfilled digital rewards for Elected, and expect to have print rewards fulfilled well ahead of schedule.\nThe reason we mention these things is to let you know that we are dedicated to fulfilling all of our projects on time, and early if at all possible.\nSo, take a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the HEROES! experience.\nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAs with all of our projects, we've lined up some really great stretch goals that are free to backers. So, after you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live.

We've actually managed to minimize them with this project by having the book ready to go before launching the Kickstarter. It is written, edited, and formatted, and the cover is complete. Mark Dos Santos is still working on the story illustrations, and adding stories will add some complexity, but not a great deal.\n\nThe biggest challenge for a publisher, other than getting the content in and formatted, is generally timely printing. We have solid relationships with our printers, and are generally able to get proofs back and books printed within 30 days of sending them the book, but there is always a chance that the printer will take longer than expected.

His is a graceful being with wings and incredible powers that he has no memory of how to use.\nJellinek is a four-foot hard-scrabble flamepetal prospector with tough red skin, a gruff disposition and general dislike of everyone around him, and a two-tailed lava-resistant creature called a \"solar\" as a companion.\nOn the day that their lives collide, everything about their world changes, and they discover that they have more in common than they can possibly imagine.\nTogether, Icarus and Jellinek will battle the tyranny of the Magisters, who have enslaved an entire people.\nGregory Wilson's story Icarus introduces us to the incredibly visual world of Vol, and the stunning array of characters and creatures who call it home. It takes us on an amazing journey in which Icarus and Jellinek fight for their lives and the freedom of a people while trying to unlock the mystery of Icarus's past. To Jellinek's surprise, Icarus's mystery becomes his own, as well.\nAnd it all started with a single piece of artwork.\nIllustration by Matt Slay for Time Traveled Tales\nYou see, Icarus started out as a novel. Gregory Wilson submitted the prologue of that novel to the Time Traveled Tales anthology. While another of Gregory's stories was ultimately used, Matt Slay drew the illustration you see above for Icarus. When Gregory saw it, he knew he had found an artist who could translate his book into a graphic novel in a way that would bring it to life.\nWe here at Silence in the Library agreed, and this project was born.\nThe Icarus graphic novel is planned as an 80-page, full-color book. In its pages, you'll be introduced to the stunning visuals and fantastic creatures of the world of Vol.\nYou'll experience the excitement as our two heroes face unimaginable dangers and delve into unfathomable mysteries.\nIf you're anything like us, Matt Slay's artwork will pull you into the story, and spit you out, gasping, at the end.\nYou'll get all of this if we reach our initial goal of $8000, but the book, and the project as a whole, gets even better as we reach our stretch goals. \nWe've brought on authors like Ed Greenwood, Gail Z. Martin, Michael A. Stackpole, Jean Rabe, Maxwell Alexander Drake, and Aaron Rosenberg to write short fiction that, if we reach their stretch goals, will be illustrated and added to the book as bonus stories. \nWe've also teamed with game designer Kris Siuda and his team to develop a 3D first-person RPG based on Icarus. While the full game will be developed and funded in a separate Kickstarter, there are several rewards related to it, like a concept art book, web playable companion level, and even the first module of the game, that we'll make available as we reach those stretch goals.\nWho Is Gregory A. Wilson?\nI'm an author of speculative fiction and a college professor; my first novel, a work of epic fantasy entitled The Third Sign, was published by Gale Cengage in 2009. I have two other novels, Icarus and Grayshade, in pre-publication, and have works of short fiction published in recent anthologies. I have three articles published in the SFWA Bulletin and am in the planning stages for a proposed anthology considering speculative fiction and politics, co-edited by two-time Hugo nominee John Helfers; a number of well-known authors are already on board. I am also the co-host (with fellow speculative fiction author Brad Beaulieu) of Speculate! The Podcast for Writers, Readers and Fans, a critically acclaimed show which discusses and interviews the creators of all sorts of speculative fiction. See and hear the details at www.speculatesf.com. Finally, I regularly read from my work and serve as a panelist at conferences across the country, and I am a member of Codex, the Writers' Symposium, and several other author groups on and offline. \nOn the teaching side, I am currently an Associate Professor of English at St. John's University in New York City, where I teach creative writing, science fiction and fantasy fiction along with various other courses in literature. I have published numerous articles and book chapters on a variety of academic subjects; my first academic book, The Problem in the Middle: Liminal Space and the Court Masque (Clemson University Press), was published in 2007. \nI live with my wife Clea, daughter Senavene \u2014 named at my wife's urging for a character in The Third Sign, for which I hope my daughter will forgive me \u2014 and dog Lilo in Riverdale, NY. My virtual home is www.gregoryawilson.com.\nIn keeping with Silence in the Library's goal of making authors and artists partners in the entire publishing process, I will be intimately involved in every step of this Kickstarter and in the fulfillment process. I'll also be giving you regular updates about the project over the course of the next 30 days.\nWho is Matt Slay?\nMatt Slay for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nBorn and raised in Maryland, Matt learned early that the best way to eat anything is with a mallet. Chesapeake folks understand this. His approaches to Art are not that far behind. Utilizing not only brushes, but quills, sponges, sandpaper, salt, razor blades, his fingernails, the souls of his enemies, and empty Tic-Tac boxes, Matt has a wonderful time sparing the general populace by working from his studio home somewhere on a mountain top in Virginia where he occasionally screams out of the third story window that he \u201cwas right\u201d and that \u201cnobody listened\u201d.\nMatt Slay for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nMatt Slay has been in production art for the better part of a decade having generated images for IDW\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Image Comics, The CBLDF, Upper Deck\u2019s \u201cMarvel Premiere\u201d, \u201cMarvel Beginnings series 2\u201d, and others; as well as Cryptozoic\u2019s Tarzan 100th Anniversary sets. \nMatt Slay for Time Traveled Tales\nMatt was the illustrator for Silence in the Library's popular Time Traveled Tales Anthology. He has also worked on \u201cCharnel House\u201d with Wes Huffor and Broken Voice Comics and produced countless designs for Record/Album covers, Logos, Book jackets as well as posters, patches and T-shirts for any number of companies. From time to time, he\u2019s been known to dabble in video game character design for companies such as Flamero on projects such \u201cNaystar: The Beginning\u201d and \u201cJourney Through Naystar\u201d. \nMatt Slay for Time Traveled Tales\nMatt studied Illustration and Design at VCU, The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, and completed his Bachelor\u2019s in Illustration at Radford University and later completed his Masters with endorsements in Art History and Art Psychology. He now puts that experience to use as a freelance illustrator bouncing back and forth between comics/comic books, advertising and marketing.\n\u2026And What About This Silence in the Library?\nSilence in the Library was founded by a group of authors based on the notion that it is important to make the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work. \nWe continue that tradition in this Kickstarter project. The initial funding goal we have set is exactly what is needed to produce the graphic novel\u2026to pay the artist, to print the book, and to fulfill your rewards. There is no profit built into this for the publisher. If we reach stretch goals, we will first make sure that our artists and authors are appropriately compensated and that our staff are paid. We expect to make a profit from this book from long term sales. It is more important to us that this book get made and that we are fair to our creative partners than that we worry about short-term gain.\nMany of you will have backed our past projects: Time Traveled Tales, A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination, War of the Seasons, and Athena's Daughters.\nAll of these projects have been launched since June of 2013, so in the last six months or so. \nWe've completed fulfillment on about 90% of Time Traveled Tales, having sent out all rewards except the signed copes of the book (the bulk of our rewards were eBook or unsigned copies). We expect to have those out in the next few weeks. We've also completed fulfillment of all electronic rewards for War of the Seasons, and expect to have print books and other physical rewards out in the next couple of weeks. We're on track to fulfill A Children's Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination on time. Athena's Daughters just finished a week ago, but the first of the digital stretch goal rewards just went out, and we expect to have the rest out in the next couple of weeks. We also expect to have that project fulfilled in the promised timeline.\nThe reason we mention these things is to let you know that we are dedicated to fulfilling all of our projects on time, and early if at all possible. We carefully planned our projects for the year to ensure that we could make our fulfillment deadlines. \nOversight and fulfillment on this project will be a joint venture between Greg Wilson and Silence in the Library. We feel that this cooperative work flow will allow us to bring you a quality product in a timely manner.\nSo, take a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the Icarus experience.\nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAfter you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live. Please be a part of the team, and travel with us on this incredible journey.\nWhat's the Deal with this 3d RPG?\nGame designer Kris Siuda has put together an amazing team of game developers including Ken Swails and artists Justin Bintz, Alex Bond, and Darren Geers. While we'll be doing a separate Kickstarter for the full-fledged video game, you'll be able to get some really cool elements of the game and related material as we reach stretch goals in this Kickstarter.\nAdd-Ons\n$5 - Add an eBook copy of the original Icarus novel on which the graphic novel is based.\n\n$20 - Add one print copy of the Icarus graphic novel.

We feel that readers have the right to demand everything, that they shouldn\u2019t have to settle for one or the other. \nAthena\u2019s Daughters was born of that mindset. While we love our male science fiction and fantasy authors, we wanted, in this project, to provide a platform by which our female authors, artists, graphic designers, and editors could showcase their incredible talents. \nTo that end, Athena\u2019s Daughters is a project conceived, developed, and driven by women. All of the authors in this anthology are women, as are the artists, the graphic designer, and the editor. \nIn this anthology you will find authors you know and love like Mary Robinette Kowal, Gail Z. Martin, Cleolinda Jones, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Jean Rabe, Sherwood Smith, Janine K. Spendlove, Vicki Johnson-Steger, Cynthia Ward, and Jean Marie Ward and new and exciting talents like Maggie Allen, Conley Lyons, Doris Stever, and C.A. (Christine) Verstraete. \nWe're incredibly excited to have an introduction to the anthology by retired astronaut and Space Shuttle Commander Pam Melroy.\nAthena\u2019s Daughters is a collection of diverse and engaging science fiction and fantasy stories (clocking in right around 100,000 words with more to come when we reach our stretch goals!) with one unifying theme: all of the protagonists are strong women that exhibit a wide range of physical attributes and abilities. And by strong we don't necessarily mean physical strength (though we have those characters too), but ALL kinds of strength. The strength to stand up for what you know is right, the strength to make an unpopular decision, the strength to be a calming voice in a contentious situation. ALL forms of strength. \nWhile many of these stories feature central characters who fit the prototypical \u2018hero\u2019 mold, that does not hold across the board. You\u2019ll be entertained by a whole cast of female protagonists from your traditional \u2018good guy\u2019 to the villain you just love to hate (or even hate to love). \nIllustration by Autumn Frederickson for Athena's Daughters\nSilence in the Library believes strongly in the concept of bringing the artistry back to publishing. To that end, every anthology we produce features illustrations for each and every story. When we are putting an anthology together, we search for the right artist for the project. \nThis anthology carries on that tradition. And we\u2019ve been lucky enough to find two amazing artists who will be providing the illustrations for the stories in Athena\u2019s Daughters. \nAutumn Frederickson has been creating fantasy worlds since childhood.   In addition to commissioned art and conventions, Autumn still continues to work on a personal body of illustrations that draws from numerous mythological and fairytale sources as well as her own brand of humor. \nCheck out some of her amazing artwork:\nIllustration by Autumn Frederickson for Athena's Daughters\nillustration by Autumn Frederickson for Athena's Daughters\nBest known for her covers for Janine K. Spendlove\u2019s War of the Seasons Trilogy, Betsy Waddell\u2019s work brings an ethereal beauty to the project that helps the reader more fully connect with the emotional heart of the stories.  \nAs you will see when you take a look at the reward levels, Betsy and Autumn have graciously offered their original art as rewards for this Kickstarter. By contributing at the appropriate level, you can own an original piece of one of our stories. \nIn addition to illustrating the stories, we are offering this work in trade paperback and, if we reach the stretch goal, limited hard cover editions. \nWe have also developed some really exciting stretch goals, as you will see below. In particular, if we reach the initial goal of $8,500, our cover will be a very attractive graphic design cover (as seen above). If, however, we reach the $13,000 stretch goal, we will have a beautiful original art cover created by artist Tietjen Alvarez. \nHeres a some sample of Tietjen\u2019s work: \nWe also have an amazing artist, Bright Copper Penny, who has created one of her popular \"Penny Blossoms\" exclusively for Athena's Daughters . These beautiful hair accessories are a wonderfully subtle way of letting your geek flag fly no matter the setting. \nThe authors who have contributed to Athena\u2019s Daughters and the staff at Silence in the Library Publishing believe strongly that any good project should contribute something to improving the human community. We are pleased to announce that a portion of every book sold will go to RAINN. RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) is the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization. \nIn this project Silence in the Library continues its dedication to making the creative drivers of the publishing industry, authors and artists, full partners both in the process of publishing and in the fiscal rewards. We want to ensure that our authors and artists make a decent living at their craft so that they will continue to enlighten us with their work. To that end, as the Kickstarter makes more above the initial goal, the authors and artists will make more. \nTake a look at the tiers to the right, and decide how you would best like to participate in the Athena\u2019s Daughters experience. \nIf there is a combination of things you would like that you don't see in the reward levels, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you.\nAfter you\u2019ve perused the tiers, look at our stretch goals to see what we can achieve with your support. We believe in this project, and we can produce it, but only you can make it live. Please be a part of the team, and travel with us on this incredible journey. \nUPDATE:\nWe've passed the $24,000 stretch goal, and that mean's we're producing a companion volume to Athena\u2019s Daughters titled Apollo\u2019s Daughters. This anthology features stories with female protagonists by some of the best male science fiction and fantasy authors in the business. We're really excited about the line-up of authors for this anthology. Aaron Allston, David Mack, John Jackson Miller, Michael A. Stackpole, Jim Bernheimer, Jamie Chambers, Ron Garner, Elias Pate, Aaron Rosenberg, Christopher Ruz, Neal Shaffer, Brian Shaw, Jon Skovron, Alan Smale, Jason Young, and Bryan Young have all signed on for the project. Artist Joe Corroney will create an original art cover of the anthology, and Brian Miller of Hi-Fi Color Design will provide the color. You can get Athena's Daughters bundled with the eBook or eBook and trade paperback of Apollo's Daughters at the $10, $45, and $60 levels, and the hard cover at the $75 level, or add it on to your existing reward level by adding $5 (eBook) $20 (eBook and trade paper back), or $35 (eBook and limited edition hard cover) to your pledge.\nThe introduction will be by Dr. John Mather, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work in confirming the Big Bang theory and NASA's Senior Project Scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope.\nSTRETCH GOALS: \nFIRST 100 BACKERS: *ACHIEVED* Okay, this one's not really a stretch goal.

In 2008, eighteen year old William Snell died in a single car accident. Will and Katie had a very special relationship, and both of them left a lasting imprint on the lives of everyone they touched.\nAs mentioned in the video, Will and Katie were very important to author Janine K. Spendlove, and their loss motivated her writing of War of the Seasons, Book 1: The Human. Driven by a desire to express her feelings of loss in a way that others could understand, Janine worked feverishly on the project until it\u2019s completion in 2011.\nThe result was a best-selling fantasy novel. The Human has all of the things that you expect from and love about fantasy: mythical creatures, adventure, magic, heroes, and villains. But it has something even more than that. It has heart.\nThe protagonist of The Human, Story, starts out as an angry teenager battered by the loss of loved ones. As is usually the case with this type of loss, in her anger she strikes out unreasonably against those who love her and want to help her. Through the course of an epic adventure in which Story finds herself thrust into a magical world she does not understand and wants to escape, and called upon to be the savior of that world, the reader gets to see her development from an angry, confused, lonely teenager to a human being who learns and grows from the loss she has experienced. \nStory is the type of strong character that all of us want to see in good fiction. Though she is young, her journey will appeal to youth and adults, men and women, boys and girls.\nThe War of the Seasons Trilogy brings us character development at it\u2019s finest. And it wraps that character development in a tale rich in adventure, magic, and a touch of romance.\nIn 2012, Janine Spendlove followed up The Human with the publication of War of the Seasons, Book 2: The Half-blood. \nThe second book in the series brings us a more mature and confident Story who has accepted and come to love the magical world of Ailionora. When evil threatens to destroy the life she has built and take the elf she has come to love, Story embarks on another exciting adventure. \nJanine has described The Half-Blood as her \"The Empire Strikes Back\", in that Story makes choices that reverberate through the rest of the trilogy, and she must ultimately deal with the consequences of those decisions.\nNow, Janine has completed the third and final book in the series, War of the Seasons, Book 3: The Hunter, and we\u2019re excited to be able to offer it in this Kickstarter. In The Hunter, Story must face an evil greater than any she's encountered before. As darkness looms over Ailionora, Story, her companions, and all of the races of Ailionora band together to fight for their very survival.\nBy day, Janine K. Spendlove is an officer and KC-130 pilot in the United States Marine Corps. The experience gained in her training and multiple combat tours shows through in the vivid combat scenes you will find throughout all three War of the Seasons books.\nEach of the novels in the War of the Seasons Trilogy has beautiful cover art by artist Betsy Waddell. There will be opportunities in the rewards section of this Kickstarter to have Betsy draw you as a mythical creature from the War of the Seasons. You could become an elf, a faerie, a dwarf, a gnome, a dryad, or a troll.\nMany of you have read the first and second books of the trilogy. Many of you have not read any of the books. That\u2019s okay! We have something for all of you. In the reward levels to the right, you\u2019ll find opportunities to get just the final book of the series, or all three books. For those of you who already have The Human, we also have an add-on for book two, The Halfblood, below. Please remember that at any level at which you get a print book, you also get the eBook version of that print book.\nBecause Will and Katie were so important to the creation of War of the Seasons, we wanted to do something to recognize them, the things they loved, and the impact they had on all of our lives. \nTo that end, we have created an exclusive Will and Katie patch that you will only be able to get at select reward levels as part of this Kickstarter. The patch features Will posing in Stormtrooper armor and Katie in Rebel uniform. We\u2019d like to thank talented artist Juan Jose Matamoros for developing the patch. As you can see below, it is pretty awesome, and captures the spirit of both Will and Katie: \nOur 501st and Rebel Legion friends out there who love to collect patches will already know the deal with these patches. For everyone else, this is a great chance to get into the excitement of patch collecting and to help keep alive the memory of Will and Katie. \nWill was an incredible artist, and a member of the 501st who loved wearing armor. A couple of years before his death, he created the poster you see below using a picture of himself in Stormtrooper armor. \nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will be offering a limited run of 11x17 prints of this poster created by Will. Of course, we expect that all of our 501st friends will love it, but we also think its appeal as art is more universal. \nAny funds from add-ons involving Will and Katie will be used in a responsible philanthropic manner, and will not be taken as profit from this project. \nTake a look at our stretch goals below. We have some amazing authors lined up to create short stories in the War of the Seasons universe. Authors you know and love, like Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston. Rising stars you'll recognize from multiple genres like Bryan Young. And writers you know from other venues, like Cleolinda Jones, Albin Johnson, and Maggie Allen. Artist Betsy Waddell is standing by to create illustrations for each of those stories. If we hit those stretch goals, everyone at the $5 and above level will receive electronic copies of all of the short stories at no additional cost. After the Kickstarter is over, we will bundle the stories together with some of Janine\u2019s short stories and publish them as a print anthology. \nThose of you who have contributed to our recent Kickstarters for Time Traveled Tales and A Children\u2019s Illustrated History of Presidential Assassination will know that we have a few general goals here at Silence in the Library. \nFirst, we want to bring to market books that we love and that perhaps might not make it to market through the standard publishing process. We like books that are quirky, that don\u2019t fit in an easily defined categories, but that entertain, edify and touch us in important ways. Janine K. Spendlove\u2019s War of the Seasons Trilogy easily fits that definition. Her exploration of the subject of loss and growth amid adventure and danger harkens back to some of the greatest works of the fantasy genre. \nSecond, we seek to make authors more fully partners in the publishing process. We want the original creative drivers who came up with the stories we love to be fully involved in the creative process all the way through to publication, and we want them to more evenly share in the financial rewards of their work. To that end, Janine K. Spendlove was intimately involved in the cover design for this book, as well as layout and editing processes. Further, she will be running this Kickstarter once it is launched. When you get an update, it will come from Janine. When you post a comment or ask a question, responses will come from Janine. And, Janine\u2019s contract with Silence in the Library ensures that she receives the lion\u2019s share of any profits made from the sale of her book. While it is important for Silence in the Library to make a profit to continue operation, it is equally important to make sure that good authors can make a living off of their work so that all of us can continue to enjoy it. \nThird, and finally, we want to continue to use Kickstarter as a funding platform for our projects because we believe that it gives you, the reader, the most direct control over the process possible. Publishing is a relationship between reader, author, and publisher. We believe that this relationship should be viewed by publishing companies as an equal partnership in which all parties get a say in the final product. Kickstarter allows us to make this type of relationship a reality. \nI know I\u2019ve said it before, but we\u2019re really excited about this project. We\u2019ve got a great trilogy of books, some really cool extras, and amazing authors lined up to write short stories that we want to read. We hope you\u2019ll join us in this journey, and help us bring these stories to life. \nSTRETCH GOALS\n$3500 - UNLOCKED - Each backer at or above $5 gets a free copy of the eBook of Bryan Young's Operation Montauk.

It's about people  and a love of what they enjoy. It is about every person that ever picked up a comic book, or watched a western or enjoyed a good yarn be it fantasy noir or sci-fi. It's about making people smile and making happy. Mead is a drink of legend and fantasy but real something you can experience and taste. \nWe already have a growing fan base up and down the east coast from bringing our samples to the Steampunk and SCI Fi/ Fantasy conventions. \nWe are one of the if not first themed meaderies. Our theme is a Steam Punk ascetic. \nWhat is mead?  \nIt has been described as nectar of the gods. It is the origin of the word Honeymoon, Simply it is honey and water fermented. It can be dry or sweet depending on your taste.\nWe specialize in two types of mead Methoglins (Herbal infused blends) and Melomels (fruit infused mead)\nOur Mead\nHere are some examples of what we have produced and will continue to produce. We will always look to expand our lines as we grow and have several new recipes that we will introduce as we grow. \nThis is early bottle of what would become Freya sent by a fan who wanted to introduce her friends to Mead.

Her description was \"This was effing delicious.\")  \nEarly label and Name.\nThe next one is our 21 a Ginger Cinnamon Blend\n21 Because you've waited long enough\nHere is our mead on display at a tasting we hosted. \n21 our Ginger Cinnamon, Freya a Chamomile blend, Black powder with a touch of Black Pepper and other spices.

That sets my mouth to water just thinking about it. \nThere are so many things you can cook using our mead many of the herbal blends work very well with many dishes. The Melomels can make excellent deserts and can compliment many types of meat. Yes you can even use it in vegetarian dishes. \nOne thing on our agenda is when we get to a certain point we are looking to produce a Kosher mead to expand it's cooking potential. \nWho are the Miracle Mead Men?\nJon,Jason, and Darkan are the face of the Miracle meadery those three strapping lads in the video. We travel around to spread the word about our mead at conventions, that go along with our Steampunk theme as well as other genres we like. \nMore then Mead a whole universe is what your helping build!\nWe have created a fictional universe to play in where we will be  featured in books, comics, song, and eventually video. \nOur fictionalized selves are a major plot twist in a new novel. \nThe Red Caps Queen by \n\u2014Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Award-winning author and editor of the Bad-Ass Faeries Anthologies\nWe have also been approached to help produce an Anthology of the fictionalized adventures of the Miracle Mead Men. \nWho Likes our Mead?\n Well lets take a look shall we? \nProfessor Phil Foglio\nYes the good professor and his lovely wife Kaja like our mead. \nSo much he did this for us \nDOT'S GOOT SCHTUFF!\nIt's a Sparky kind of thing!\nWhat this is for? \nWe are raising the funds for the home stretch covering all of the state and federal requirements to operate Meadery in our home state and more importantly having the ability to ship when all is said and done. \nWhat do you get? \nBesides all the great stuff to the right. \n* You get to be part of history, Mead is making a come back in a big way and our efforts and efforts of those like us will make it happen. \n* You are supporting small business making something that can grow and help employ people. \n * You get to help create something that hasn't been done this way before. \n* With your help we will raise awareness of the plight of the honey Bee and how seriousness the problems that can cause. \nOk I think this fits in this section here is the mock up of the Minion patch. \nOrignial Minion Patch\nThe Digital Wanted posters\nThis is a fine looking crew of Reprobates.\nThese will be full size 8.5 x 11 digital images. \nThe fantasy book we are currently in and part of our reward tiers\nby Danielle Ackley-Mcphail yes we are in it.\n\n\nStretch Goals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom the events we've hosted there is a huge demand already for our product.

We have taken this into account by making sure we have the proper legal help to minimize any delays from production to retail. We will also make sure that we have the ability to stock our mead so as soon as we have label approval we get the labels get them on the bottles and into the hands of people that love our product.
