The filament files have reduced overhangs so that apart from the knights, none of the pieces need supports. The resin pieces are all pre-supported and include solid versions for printing in transparent resin.\nNote - these are digital files for printing on your 3D printer, not physical chess pieces. If you want to buy printed pieces visit 3dprintedchess.com after the campaign ends where you will be able to purchase printed sets from the commercial backers.\nThe Latvian set. Printed in resin with satin-black finish and wood-filament PLA.\nFans of the Netflix show The Queen's Gambit may recognize this set - it appears in the final episode of the series where Elizabeth Harmon played against Vasily Borgov in Moscow.\nA Latvian set as seen in the final episode of The Queen's Gambit.\nThis striking, minimal design originated in Latvia and was popular throughout the Soviet Union around the 1930s. Its sleek lines still look modern by today's standard. The wide, flared bases make the pieces very stable and a pleasure to play with. An excellent set for rapid games as the pieces are sturdy and resistant to toppling over.\nThe Staunton Set. Printed in resin with high-gloss black and ivory finishes.\nThe Staunton design has been the international tournament standard since 1924, however it was designed in 1849 and has defined the look of modern chess sets since then. Before the Staunton design chess pieces typically looked like this:\nTypical early 19th century chess pieces.\nThe Staunton re-design made chess pieces more affordable and more durable, bringing chess to a larger audience. No chess collection is complete without a Staunton set. \nStaunton pieces printed in marble PLA filament.\nThe Zagreb set. Printed in red-copper and bamboo-wood PLA filament.\nThe Zagreb set is a variant of the famous Dubrovnik design which I sold in my previous Kickstarter. A distinctive feature of the Zagreb set is the alternate colored finials on the King, Queen and Bishop. The STL files have separate finials so that you can easily print in two different colors and glue the finials in place. If you don't have a resin printer then metallic filaments such as red copper or green bronze make excellent choices for your dark pieces.\nThis video shows how the Zagreb knight was sculpted:\n All of these pieces are made in Blender and are exported at high resolution so that your prints will be smooth and detailed.\nThe Ecliptic set. Printed in translucent resin and bamboo-wood PLA filament.\nThe Ecliptic set is an original design, created specially for this Kickstarter campaign. It takes inspiration from the 1987 video game R-Type:\nOne of R-Type's power-ups is an object called the bit, which consists of a sphere encased in a rotating hemisphere. This motif formed the basis of the pawn's design, and the hemispherical collar is repeated on the king, queen and bishop but with a taller head extending out from the collar.\nEcliptic set printed in transparent resin.\nThe Ecliptic pieces have been designed to form an elegant but also playable set, with instantly recognizable shapes and a modern, clean appearance. It is not an ornamental or decorative design, like many other 3D printed chess sets, rather it is meant to be played.\nThe pre-supported resin files let you start printing right away, but if you prefer to do your own supports, unsupported versions are also provided.\nThere are 139 STL files in total in the collection.\nTo complete your pieces you can add weights and then attach felt to the base. This video shows how it's done.\nResin pieces look great when painted and then given a coat of gloss varnish. This video shows how to paint your resin pieces as well as how to get perfectly clear transparent prints.\nThe \"Luxury Chess Collection - Early Backer\" and \"Luxury Chess Collection\" tiers are non-commercial tiers, meaning you can print sets for yourself or print sets to give away for free to your friends and family, however you cannot sell your prints.\nNote - none of the tiers allow you to sell the STL files. The files remain copyrighted and cannot be sold or redistributed.\nIf you wish to sell chess sets that you print then you can purchase the \"Commercial Tier - Early Backer\" or \"Commercial Tier\". The commercial tiers include the same STL files and grant you a license to sell your prints. Commercial backers will also be featured on 3dprintedchess.com - where customers looking to buy a 3D printed chess set can find vendors in their region. After the Kickstarter campaign ends commercial backers will be asked to provide a link to their store (such as an Etsy or eBay page) and a thumbnail image for their listing. Vendors will be grouped by region on the website so buyers can minimize their shipping costs by finding a local seller.\nAdvice for commercial backers.\n How much should I charge for a 3D printed chess set?\nI recommend that you charge no less than US$100 per set with filament pieces, and that you charge significantly more for sets with resin pieces (double or triple your price for filament-only sets). It is up to you to determine the exact price customers in your region will accept, and also your price will vary depending on the cost of materials and the number of printers you own (which can reduce your production time). You should also charge around $100 more if you are doing the weights and felts yourself.\nDo not try to compete on price with cheap, plastic molded chess sets. If a customer wants to spend less than $100 then politely suggest they should look at molded plastic sets instead of a 3D printed set.\n Why would someone spend over $100 on a 3D printed set when they can get hand-made wooden sets for around $200?\n3D printing offers two main advantages over cheap plastic and hand-made wooden sets:\n Rare sets. Nearly all cheap plastic sets are Staunton style. To get a Latvian or Zagreb set will typically cost over $300 and they are only available in a few varieties of wood. 3D printing brings rare sets into a reasonable price-range.\n Personalized sets. 3D printed sets can be customized to the buyer's requirements. Instead of being limited to the wood and felt choices offered by the stores, a 3D printed set can be made in a variety of colors, finishes and weights and can have any color felt base. This makes them great gifts because they can be tailored to the taste and preferences of the recipient. \nThese commercial licenses are perpetual and royalty-free, which means your license lasts forever, you only pay once and do not have to share a percentage of your sales.\nInstagram\nTake a look at my Instagram page to see some behind-the-scenes shots of the development and painting of these chess pieces.

No bandwidth limit - everyone will be able to download their files as soon as they become available.\n2. Online backups - you don't have to store all the files on your computer. If you only have a filament printer, you can delete the resin STL files. And if you get a resin printer later, the files will always be available from your Gumroad account.\n3.

We provide step-by-step, foolproof recipes that include variations and suggestions for dietary restrictions. Scroll down for a sample recipe card. \nSoutheast Asian cuisine is the original global cuisine. Centuries of immigration and spice trade has resulted in a rich and diverse culinary tradition, with dishes such as laksa and rendang voted as some of the world's most delicious foods (CNN Travel). We're helping you stock your Southeast Asian pantry so you can skip straight to cooking with spice kits blended to personal family recipes. \nHomiah supplier, Eastern Shan Region, Myanmar\nHomiah sources directly and fairly from local communities in Southeast Asia. We work with a collective of small producers and farmers in Malaysia and Burma, helping them earn fair compensation and move beyond long tail supply chains. We're particularly proud of our work creating new income streams for a collective of farms in the Shan State of Burma by enabling them to sell laphet (pickled tea leaves) outside their local region, something that would otherwise be impossible due to political instability.\nWe wanted to evoke the culture and art of Southeast Asia, alongside its amazing cuisine.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is risk-free and there is always a risk of delay. We've worked buffer into our timeline but as we are importing products from Southeast Asia into the US, there may be delays with paperwork, cargo shipping or clearing customs. In 2021, there have been serious shipping congestion and delays for shipments from Asia to the West, in particular through the Suez Canal. We see this as frustrating and challenging, but at the same time recognize that shipping goods across the world is an incredible human feat. We will work our hardest to be transparent and communicative during the various steps of the production and export process. \n\nMoreover, we source our Laphet (Burmese Pickled Tea Leaves) directly from the Eastern Shan region of Myanmar (Burma). As of Feb 1st, the country is undergoing civil unrest and instability. While the local farmers and producers have been incredibly cooperative, they are unable to guarantee that ongoing internet blackouts, strikes, and violence will not affect normal business operations and trade.

A percentage of profits from every CheatKard set that you back will plant a tree in one of the worlds forests.\n\nThe Creation Of CheatKard\nLittle did we realize that back in 2018 we had invented what would become CheatKard when we designed the first Nerdonic PCB business reference card,  created with an aim to give clients and customers a more relevant business card compared to generic paper cards so they could see a glimpse of the world behind Electrical engineering.\nMany clients and fellow tech nerds loved the idea, with friends of clients who were interested in tech asking to get a business card too, simply because they thought it was cool to have.\nImage: One of the first reference based Nerdonic business cards from 2018, some aspects of the card still lives on within CheatKard such as the pin pitch and trace gauges\nFrom there we experimented and decided to make it into a product. Shortly after the first designs we used our contacts in other fields from photographers, doctors and surgeons, scientists, designers, mechanics, and more to help us design useful CheatKards in a wide range of categories!\n\n\nMore To Come!\nWe\u2019re working hard to finalize our Cheat Kards for a huge range of other topics, Electrical Engineering is just the start!\nTeaming up with respected professionals in their respective fields allows us to ensure nothing but the most accurate and useful information on all of our cards. \nWe have already started developing add-on sets for Electrical Engineering including information on Radio Frequencies, PCB Antenna design, Certification help and more!\nAs well as that we also have many other CheatKards being developed and on their way including sets in Computing, Adobe, Photography, Science, Medical, 3D Printing, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, DIY and much more!\n\nAs a way of thanking pledgers for their support, we are currently offering a set of limited edition cheatkards, exclusively for Kickstarter backers. These limited edition cards are available in the classic Kickstarter green with gold plated accents, as a little nod to Kickstarter.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Rewards\n\n\nAdd-On Items\nCustom Text Engraving\nHave your CheatKard set custom engraved with a message or name of your choice on the back of the cover card!

Most of the mechanisms have already been designed and tested. However, due to the nature of 3d printing, individual results may vary. We are designing the mechanisms to work with any 3d printer but due to various individual slicer settings some post processing may be required after 3d printing. (This is not unusual for 3d printed objects) We highly recommend having your drill bits on hand, some sand paper, and your hot glue gun ready just in case a part does not print perfectly.

Let us tell you a bit about it...\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nWe think of the LumiCube as the ultimate Raspberry Pi kit. Perfect for beginners and enthusiasts alike. It takes the Raspberry Pi, a powerful mini computer, and combines it with a whole range of electronics and sensors, from a speaker to an accelerometer all in a 10cm cube - the perfect playground for your creations.\n\nWHAT CAN IT DO?\nMost of your day-to-day devices, like your phone, alarm clock, and voice activated home assistant all have the same basic electronic components. So we thought why not put them all together with a mini computer and make it completely programmable. That way you can build whatever you want, exactly the way you want it.\nWith so much at your fingertips, let your imagination take the lead.\n\nWHO IS IT FOR?\n\nLEVEL UP YOUR ROOM\nKeep updated with important events thanks to its built in WiFi. Unlike other tickers you can connect to any feed you want. Whether you're on Discord or Mastodon, or investing in the most niche of cryptocurrencies, get the updates you care about.\nOr if humans are your thing, use it to message your loved ones!\n\nMAKE SOMETHING INTERACTIVE\nIf you choose the Screen Add-on you can use light levels, hand gestures or buttons to control the cube. If you choose the Interactive Add-on you will also be able to make it react to movement or rotation, to give your projects an exciting interactive element.\n\nPERFECT FOR YOUR DESK\nWhether lit up, or just sitting quietly, the LumiCube is small enough to sit on your desk, and look great whilst doing it. Use it to notify you of important events, automate routine tasks, or help you focus by providing some background sounds.\n\nAWARE OF ITS ENVIRONMENT\nThe Interactive Add-on features an environmental sensor, so you can monitor your home or office environment. Plus it automatically records the values of all its sensors over time, so you can look back at the temperature, humidity and air pressure variations of your space.\n\nMAKE PROGRAMMING FUN AGAIN\nEvery part of the LumiCube is programmable, using our browser based coding environment. We\u2019ve worked hard to remove any complexity, so you can achieve real results with just a few lines of code. Sometimes modern technology can feel overwhelmingly complicated \u2013 with the LumiCube we set out to make programming fun again!\n\nWE GAVE IT TO SOME FRIENDS...\n... and despite some of them not knowing Python, within minutes they had it displaying an abusive message. Then they ran the rain animation and decided it was more fun to rain fire, so changed the colour to red. After that they modified the autumn tree scene, and changed the colours to white and grey for a winter tree, and made it drop leaves when it was shaken. During this time they also managed to Rickroll each other. So we think it's fair to say it's pretty easy and fun to get started.\nPLAY\n\n\nWELCOME TO INTERACTIVE CODING \nCoding for electronics used to be a mysterious process, but the LumiCube comes with a dashboard so you can see what matters all in one place, all to support your creative exploration.\nView the state of your cube in real-time \u2013 no more guessing, as you can see every value, and plot them on a graph.\n\nWANT TO LEARN PYTHON?\nYou don\u2019t have to be a Python expert to use the LumiCube \u2013 in fact we think it\u2019s a great way to learn. Unlike learning programming on a blank computer terminal, the LumiCube gives you some fun projects to play around with straight away. All of those built in apps are just code that you can modify and play around with. Plus we include a project booklet to introduce the basics of Python and guide you through some of the built in apps.\n\nNO CODING NEEDED: LOADS OF BUILT IN APPS\nJust select one and click run. You can still see the code and tweak it in any way you want.\n\nCOMMUNITY OF LUMICUBERS\nShare your projects with your friends, or take inspiration by running super cool projects by LumiCubers worldwide.\nCollaborate to make something beyond the reach of one person (unless you're the guy from StuffMadeHere!)\n\nSO MANY POSSIBILITIES\n The LumiCube has dozens of inputs and outputs, which can be combined in any way you want:\n\nWHAT WILL YOU CREATE?\nMaybe a musical cube that reacts to the beat?\n\nMORE THAN WE CAN FIT ON THIS PAGE\nAll our software is open source.\nREST end-points for all the electronics, so you can use any language you like from any machine!\n\nPRICING\nPlease note:\nThe LumiCube needs a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 to work. If you don't already own one select the Raspberry Pi Add-on.\nThere are 50 cubes with a 20% discount, and 150 with a 10% discount. So get them whilst you can!\n\nTIMELINE\nJune 2020 - Work on the first LumiCube prototype begins\nDecember 2020 - After dozens of prototypes and some serious development an Alpha version is completed\nMarch 2021 - Kickstarter campaign launches\nApril 2021 - Kickstarter campaign finishes\nMay 2021 - Case and electronics finalised\nJune 2021 - Manufacturing starts\nJuly 2021 - Software finalised\nAugust 2021 - Extra time for any manufacturing issues\nSeptember 2021 - LumiCube shipped to backers\n\n\nPLUG & PLAY ELECTRONICS\nOur journey began with creating plug-and-play electronics modules. We felt creating your own electronics projects was too frustrating. From cryptic datasheets, and fragile bread-boarding, to fruitless searching for drivers on the internet. \nSo we created a system of electronic modules that could be just plugged together, starting with modules for LEDs, buttons, screens and a range of sensors. We then thought: why not put it all together in a nice case? And so the LumiCube was born. The perfect platform for loads of interesting projects.\nFor us, the LumiCube is just the beginning. We hope to soon start selling the modules separately so that other people can just as easily create their own electronics projects. Want to add servo motors to your project? Just plug in the servo module. Want to detect distances? Plug in the distance sensor.\n\nOUR MISSION\nWe are two friends on a mission to bring the joy of tinkering with technology to as wide an audience as possible. We are developing an environment where anyone can create their own electronics and it's super simple to program. A system that is simple enough for teenagers to create the robots they always imagined, but advanced enough for researchers to use to automate lab work.\n Pros at work!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are two engineers who have over 20 years combined experience working in software and electronics. We haven't just created a prototype, we have gone to the effort of producing a close to finished product ahead of our Kickstarter campaign, to ensure there are no major engineering issues with the design.\n\nWhen it comes to physical products there are always risks, but we have gone out of our way to design the LumiCube so it can be easily manufactured. The case is laser cut acrylic meaning it is perfect for small scale batches or mass manufacturing runs. We could even do it ourselves if we need to. As for the electronics, we have been working with a manufacturer for over a year, and the designs are almost finalised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are fully committed to reuse. Our electronics are designed to be modular. This means if any component has an issue you can replace just that part, unlike most designs where all the electronics have to be scrapped. What\u2019s more you can even reuse each component in future kits or projects, as our entire system is plug-and-play.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Show your support", "descp": "Donate a \u00a31 to show your support - it really means a lot to us!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a385 or more", "title": "1 x Base Cube (5% off)", "descp": "A LumiCube with LEDs, a speaker and a microphone.

They squirm around as soon as water touches their fur, spiraling into a freak-out, barking and yelping until the entire bathroom is a mess. Most pet owners, in response, avoid bathing their dogs and cats as regularly as they would like to and as regularly as they know they should. Although this is far from ideal, it seems preferable to trying to work through the chaos that bath time entails.\nHere is the thing: it doesn't have to be that difficult. There is a way to make bathing simple, straightforward, and stress-free, eliminating the obstacles inherent to the process once and for all.\n After years of experience in cat parenting and grooming as well as general hygiene science, we have devoted ourselves to solving the challenges of your pet's bath time once and for all. \nBy the active ingredient, a mature Japanese technology widely used in the food and makeup industry, our pet grooming gloves can sanitize the skin and mucous membranes without any toxic ingredients and residuals.\nThat's right: HICC GROOM!\u2122 Pet Grooming Gloves are totally pet friendly and non-toxic. It takes effect right after you open it and can make an impact on health and hygiene in a strikingly short period of time.\nThis means that from here on out, you and your pet can look forward to the grooming process. Never again will you associate grooming with stress and frustration.

Just by a soft squeeze, the essence will be absorbed by gloves. Easy to carry, easy to use, clean your pets as you go!\nInstead of hiring someone else to wash and groom your furry friend, you can take charge of the entire process yourself. This means that rather than making bath time a chore or an errand, you can make it a bonding experience. Your cat or dog will be happy that you have chosen to do this yourself.\nRight now, we are turning to you for help raising the funds that we need to move HICC GROOM!\u2122 Pet Grooming Gloves into mass production. \nOur fundraising goal is $8,000, which will cover the costs of manufacturing our initial run of Pet Grooming Gloves.

However, this time we are presenting heart-warming, pleasant, and easy-to-assemble plywood models.\n\nBack in 2012, I started my way with inventing wooden mechanical construction sets. At first, my project was unique and the only one in the world. Then, some alternatives started to appear in different parts of the world. That was how I unexpectedly found a new niche for inventors. Now, such toys are produced by more than 10 companies around the world. After that, I went through some changes in my personal life and business. In 2017, I had to start over, and created metal mechanical models. It was not easy but thanks to your support on Kickstarter, I was able to develop this project. Today my Time for Machine team and I decided to go back to the basics and created a series of models called The iconic series. \nDenis Okhrimenko, the founder and \u0421\u0415\u041e of Time for Machine.\nInspired by sweet retro nostalgia, hippie romance, and pure technical simplicity, these construction sets became our chance to feel the soft touch of history. All the models are quite easy to assemble, perfect for every age. Every set contains plywood parts, additional colored plastic parts, manuals, and a piece of wax to make all the rotating parts move smoothly.\n\nOpen stretch goal:\nRadio-controlled tanks DSP-1 and DSP-2.\nMeet our tanks, a real miracle of military hardware! This radio-controlled fantasy tank is inspired by the very first models of tanks. It comes with 3 mini-figures of soldiers and a couple of details: obstacles and entourage elements. This model runs on 4 AA batteries. The control panel is on the special board in a plywood case. You don't have to solder the electronics, you just need to assemble the tank, inserting the board and connecting the wires.\n  This is a unique tracked vehicle made of plywood and inspired by diesel punk aesthetics. Both right and left tracks can move. This tank is almost omnipotent: it can overcome obstacles, turn around and move back and forth. That\u2019s entertainment!\n\nTank DSP-1\n\nTank DSP-2\n Video with Tanks:\nPLAY\n\n\nPLAY\n\nRewards with Tanks:\nWe want you to feel the heart and soul of these models, \nrevisiting your childhood with its joy and precious memories. This series is a perfect combination of both elegance of the good old days and today\u2019s minimalistic design. Laconic and stylish, every model is a great pleasure to admire. Trying to catch the vibe of the retro epoch we decided on a bold experiment with style, colors, and mechanics.\nLord of the Rails\nEvery time we travel by train, some elusive mystery hangs in the air. So this time we decided to give you a pinch of magic and create something extraordinary. Gracious and fabulous, our Lord of the Rails is destined for marvelous adventures. With this train, it\u2019s so easy to travel the world and the seven seas, chasing your crystal dreams.\nThe locomotive has an electric motor. 4 AA batteries are attached under the bottom. A small control board comes with the kit. This board contains an on/off switch and two pairs of LEDs which glow on the transparent acrylic body parts. The assembled model has a metal lever on top. This lever allows the train to move forward and backward. Also, the locomotive has a plywood switch with two speed modes: slow and fast. It moves the gear inside the mechanism and activates one of these modes. On the back and front parts of the locomotive, there is a convenient mechanism for automatic coupling with the car. You can fasten the carriage with just one move. To unhook it, you need to press the side wings on the hitch-mechanism.\nThe locomotive comes with one carriage with the same colored wheels and a small part of rails for a carriage and a locomotive.\nTo make the train move on a full-fledged railroad, you will need a complete set of rails, which we have prepared as a separate model. Nevertheless, the train can move perfectly well without these rails. For this purpose, on the lower part of the locomotive and the car there are special locks for wheel bogies. You can lock the rotating wheelsets squarely or in reverse and make the locomotive move forward or in a circle on the floor.\nPLAY\n\nLockBox\nOur LockBox was born to be a good home for your secrets and memories. It may become a real challenge for everyone who is hungry for your mysteries. With this model, all your private stories, precious, intimate, and fragile, will be in good hands, so now you can feel relieved and rely on it.\nThis wooden safe will bring life and vibrance to every interior, enchanting everyone with the radiant beauty of its details: red, yellow, or blue colors make this model just adorable.\nRaging Bull\nFilled with some wild beauty, our Raging Bull is a real legend in the world of sport cars. It\u2019s so tempting to put your fears aside, seize the day, and disappear into the night. Driving crazy fast, breaking the speed of light, you will always feel its passionate devotion. Together, you will be gorgeous and invincible.\nThis wooden cowboy definitely knows how to win a good fight without hurting not a hair on your head! And moreover, it\u2019s illegally handsome with its bright color accents: red, yellow, or blue.\nPolish Legend\nEmbodying luxury and refined taste, Polish Legend knows the deepest desires of every car-connoisseur. This car inspires you to take a risk and go for the adventure of your dreams looking for hippie romance and the peace of mind. With this construction set, you can forget about time and plunge into another world, full of beauty and perfection. We were trying to keep the details simple and minimalistic in order not to distract your attention from bright colorful accents.\nWatching its wheels move, discovering its mechanical secrets \u2014 this is all about good vibes and tranquility. This construction set is passionate and open-hearted, with its colorful plastic wheels and an opening hood and trunk. You can even put a Lego Minifigure on the passenger seat. For this purpose, we added special probes on the seats. This unexpected trick will make your car even more charming and revive the real Polish Legend.\n* Minifigures are not included.\nHot Rod\nThis car is brutal and charismatic, and danger is its middle name! Our Hot Rod really knows how to divide and conquer. Every part of this model is full of both elegance and glory. It may look like a rebel, bad to the bone but the truth is that deep inside it\u2019s kind, warm, and affectionate.\nThis model has a beautiful body and an amazing soul and comes with enjoyable red, yellow, or blue details. You can also put a Lego Minifigure on the passenger seat. For this purpose, we added special probes on the seats. This will add some personal identity and charisma to your car.\n* Minifigures are not included.\nDream Van\nAll the sweet dreams come to an end. Well, fortunately, our Dream Van won\u2019t disappear in the beams of the morning sun. Inspired by the Hippie Era, this car is light, airy, and carefree. Driving it is like listening to the music of freedom. This model is hard to resist and easy to assemble for every age. Laconic and stylish, Dream Van is full of retro nostalgia, playful colorful accents, and innocent tricks: cute plastic bands and springs.\nThe clockwork is hidden in the model\u2019s back luggage compartment so you can open it up and see the finest details of the mechanism. Also, Dream Van has colorful plastic wheels: red, green, or blue. This invasion of color will take your breath away! You can even put three Lego Minifigures* inside the car. For this purpose, we added special probes: one on the driving seat and two on passenger seats. With this Lego-team, your car will look like a party bus from the 60s.\n* Minifigures are not included.\nChoose your reward:\n\nMore technical information:\nThe prototypes of these machines were not very technically complicated. We can say that our kits are quite easy to assemble too. Inside you will find plywood parts as well as additional colored plastic parts, instructions and a piece of wax to lubricate the rotating parts for smooth glide.\nThe clockwork is arranged in the body of each toy. For example, Polish Legend has it hidden under the hood, and Dream Van\u2019s moving mechanism is mounted vertically in the back luggage compartment.\nThe wooden models have rack-and-pinion steering installed. Wheels can be turned and oriented in opposite directions so that the mechanical model will seamlessly turn during the race.\nChoosing the style of cars and the era of these models, we were nostalgic for the second half of the 20th century, the time of hippies and the heyday of local car manufacturing. It was a time of iconic cars for an entire generation.\nIt was a romantic time when design bureaus created cars to meet people's needs rather than to fight for market shares. People endorsed this approach and chose the vehicles as a means of expressing themselves and their ideas.\n\n\nAs a final touch, we added the possibility to put a mini-figure on the car seat. For this purpose, there are special elements on the plywood seat to secure the figurine. (Attention! Lego figure is not included)\n\nChoose your model and your colour from our wooden DIY kits.\nPlease help bring our creative project to life.\nWe promise that we will do everything in our power to execute this campaign to the best of our ability and on time.\nThe Team:\nWatch a short video about our friendly team of engineers, designers and programmers, who work to create different models from metal, plywood, and models with electronic components.\nPLAY\n\n\nWe are always looking forward to your reaction to our new developments, and we are very pleased when our designers bring you joy and you leave good feedback on websites. We try to improve new models and fix the defects of previous models that you found. Thanks to you, we've made adjustments to the instructions and changed some units and assembly methods in new developments. In all new models, the spring will be delivered in a ready-made closed drum for ease of assembly, and the same changes will be made in previous mechanisms.\nWe're introducing new components such as bearings, rubber and eco-leather parts, more durable packaging, and updated, more user-friendly instructions with multi-language translations. We are also creating electronic models, some of which will be presented this year. During development, we keep thinking about whether you will like it and whether you will enjoy it.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we realize the challenges associated with a Kickstarter campaign, we also possess all the necessary capabilities to produce and deliver our models.

The aim of this Kickstarter is to launch the Tiger Tanks Pack by Miniature Tanks Company. These tanks are for 1:100 (15mm) and 1:144 (12mm) wargaming scales. This Tiger Tanks Pack will eventually be one of a family of miniature collections from Miniature Tanks Company. This Kickstarter will help bring this vision to reality, help deliver these tanks to you, and help fund further miniature tanks and vehicles. \nThe goal of Miniature Tanks Company is to create a collection of World War Two miniature equipment at affordable prices so you can build your collections quicker. The products from Miniature Tanks Company are both in 1:100 (15mm) and 1:144 (12mm) scales specially produced for wargaming purposes. \nFor this Kickstarter I hope to introduce the entire range of Tiger tanks that were used during the war. Our miniature gaming models are 3D printed with fine detail on filament based printers that help keep material costs to a minimum. Our aim is to fill the void that was for so long a gap in the market where miniature tanks can be bought for affordable prices.\nThe Tiger 1 gave the German Army its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the 8.8 cm KwK 36 gun. The tank was given its nickname \"Tiger\" by Ferdinand Porsche, and the Roman numeral was added after the later Tiger 2 entered production.\nThe successor of Tiger 1, Tiger 2 sported the thick armor of Tiger 1 with the sloped armor of Panther. The Tiger 2 was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army and the Waffen-SS.\nThe pricing is simple, over on the right is different reward levels. You can choose your pledge level and that will determine how many tokens you get.\nEach tank that is 1:144 (12mm) scale will cost 2 tokens. Likewise, each tank that is 1:100 (15mm) scale will cost 4 tokens. It doesn't matter if you're ordering a Tiger 1 or a Tiger 2 or any of their variants, the scale determines the price... 2 tokens for the smaller scale 4 tokens for the larger scale. \nFor a limited time, exclusive to this Kickstarter, these tanks are offered at this cheap of a price. On top of that, the wholesale deals can't be found anywhere else. \nPrice is calculated based on printing time, filament used factoring in cost and markup, electricity used at 0.09 cents per kWh, print preparation and post processing labor cost time, and Kickstarters's fees.\nThe following shipping rates apply to all packages from the smallest orders to the largest. \nShipping prices in USD. All rewards include SHIPPING WITH TRACKING numbers.\nFind us on these sites or follow us by email.\nwww.miniaturetanks.com\n3D Printed in the USA With Filament That Was Made in the USA", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its own risks and challenges. The risk or challenge rather with this project is if there will be a large amount of orders the production lead times will naturally go up. However, if this was the case I expect to fix this delay by buying more printers to meet up with demand. \n\nI have chosen 3D printers because of the scalability and their ability to print anything so I can print any tank in the future. While this is my first Kickstarter, future ones will carry less challenges as I get my print farm established. Thank you for helping bring this project to life!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nWe use PLA filament by Push Plastic that is made in the USA. PLA is made from organic material and is the most commonly used filament for FDM printers. PLA is what\u2019s known as a bioplastic as it\u2019s a product of renewable organic material such as dextrose from sugarcane and cornstarch from maize. With this composition, PLA is environmentally safer. Unlike petroleum-based plastics, when PLA does decompose, it degrades to completely non-toxic products.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPLA comes in plastic spools thus so when we have used a spool up we discard the plastic spool in our local plastic recycling center. Also, when we remove supports and whatever other excess garbage we generate from production we discard this also in the recycling center. \n\nWe need electricity to power these printers obviously, but thankfully in Washington state where we are located, the electricity is the nations leading renewable source of electricity with four-fifths of the state's electricity generation originating from renewable energy.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Early Bird - 16 Tokens", "descp": "Your choice of any tank, all of one type or a few or more of each variant.

But that doesn't need to be the case. \n\nYou may be an army of one, but you can very easily protect yourself from a compromised account by employing a Solo V2 security key. \nSolo V2 Series USB-A & USB-C\n\nPortable\nTake Solo V2 with you. It fits on your key chain, providing you with additional security, wherever you go. \nEasy to Use\nNo need to install any software. You can use your V2 immediately. \n\nSolo V2 greatly reduces the risk of security breaches, as over 80% of all breaches are caused by passwords compromised through phishing email attacks. \nPreventing breaches can save the average corporation millions of dollars. Eliminating phishing can save you from major headaches and personal security concerns.\nSolo V2 is a complete redesign of our original FIDO2 security key. \nThe hardware is more physically robust\nNFC performance is increased and uses a brand new microcontroller by NXP with enhanced security features. \nThe firmware has been rewritten in Rust to be more modular/reusable by the community and to reduce the attack surface. \nOur goal with Solo V2 is to harden physical security of the device itself while providing all the protections that come with 2FA or passwordless login.\nTo use Solo V2, it's as easy as 1, 2, 3...\n\n1) Log onto the website you desire to register your Solo V2 on and go to security settings. \n2) Typically, there is an option for enabling 2FA. In that selection, there will be an option to add a security key. Click on that, and follow the instructions to register the key. \n3) Once registered, next time you log in to your account the interface will request you to insert the security key and touch the button to authenticate.\n\nFIDO2/WebAuthn are supported for two-factor authentication by all major applications including Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Okta, Duo and for passwordless login on Microsoft accounts and Windows Logon.\nWhy is V2 better?\n\n\u25cf Reversible connector for both USB-A and USB-C. Solo V2 will be providing the first ever reversible USB-A connector. This will enable inserting the key into a USB Port and being able to decide what side you want to face up. This fixes the problem of having a key be oriented with the LED light not facing the operator.\n\n\u25cf Touch Buttons. This a change from our original Solo key, which required a button to be depressed in order to activate. Depressing the button can cause physical stress and be awkward depending on where the key is inserted. The touch buttons remove the stress and allow for easier activation. \n\n\u25cf Industry leading NFC functionality. Innovative antenna design has resulted in Solo V2 crushing the the original Solo key with significant performance, improving on the range and field strength. \n\n\u25cf Robust construction. Solo V2 was designed to strengthen the weak points that naturally occurs at the base of the USB connector and the PCB. Creating a hard robust exterior shell that has a cavity for the circuitry to sit in has additionally created an opportunity to seal in the circuitry with an epoxy that protects the circuitry from the environment. Result: a very strong key that is water resistant. \n\n\u25cf Solo V2 supports firmware upgrade. One of the big challenges for security keys is that most devices are not updatable, causing the user to run the risk of their gear being superseded. With Solo V2, users and enterprise customers can commit to our authenticator knowing that they will have access and benefit from the improvements we make to the firmware down the road.\nOur Solo keys work seamlessly on many services including: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Github, and many more. \n\nBecause Solo supports the new FIDO2 standard, you get the strongest, most secure login with protection against phishing, account takeover, and other online attacks. And it's incredibly easy to use and consistent across all sites: when you login, after username and password, you plug Solo in your computer and just tap it to get access. Frankly, this is more convenient than typing OTP codes, besides being safer.\n\nEven if you only secure your email (Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail) all other sites that have email-based password recovery, or use Google Login (or Facebook Login) become more secure.\n\nLike it's predecessor, Solo V2 comes with a colored, sleek (and grippy!) silicone case, that you can match with your style, and even change to fit your mood. \n\nSolo V2 boasts:\n3 touch buttons\nFully reversible connectors \nMulti-color LED for login indications \nEpoxy encapsulated electronics. \nAlso, there's no battery... so it's always available and ready!\nAlways up-to-date\nWe believe that software must be up-to-date to be secure. Like laptops and mobile phones, security keys are adding more and more functionality, and therefore won't be exempt from bugs and vulnerabilities. Since our very first model, all of our keys support signed firmware updates. Each device can only update to the latest firmware that has been securely signed by SoloKeys.\nStrong NFC and Reversible USB\nSolo was the first security key on the market with NFC + USB-C. We redesigned the v2 series from the ground up, delivering greatly improved NFC performance. Also, both the USB-A and USB-C are reversible. That's right, the first reversible USB-A on the market.  Your Solo V2 USB-A will always be right side up!\nEarly prototype.\n\n\nRobust and Water-Resistant\nOne major requirement for v2 series was durability and we made one of the most robust keys on the market.\nComponents are assembled on a module, inserted in a cavity and sealed with a layer of epoxy. This makes the keys water proof and tamper resistant.\nTrusted authentication leader\nSoloKeys is the first company to implement U2F and FIDO2 in the open. Our hardware and firmware are open source, verifiable and FIDO2 certified.\n\nMade with a unique novel PCB construction that has been developed & perfected by SoloKeys.\nHard, robust exterior shell that collects inputs (USB, buttons, NFC).\nAn internal PCB that contains all the sensitive circuits and secure microcontroller.\nThe internal PCB is placed inside the external PCB & sealed shut using transparent epoxy.\n\nMaterials\n Matte Black Carbon Fiber FR4 encapsulation\n Transparent Epoxy encapsulation\n Gold Plated buttons and pads.\n High grade tensile Silicone cases \n\n\n\nOur manufacturing partners are a small family run business in the Emilia-Romagna region of North Italy.  This not only makes for great team getaways, but it also makes for a strong security story.\nOur team with a couple of the factory owners.  We're holding our very first Solo models created back in 2018.\nSince then, we've made a number of changes to the manufacturing process to bring you Solo V2.  Now, the circuitry is placed on a tiny PCB, called the module PCB.\nThese module PCBs are then placed into a second PCB called a cavity PCB.  This construction provides a much higher level of durability, flush profile, side capacitive touch buttons, and a strong NFC antenna.\nCustom made pogo pin jig used for pressing module PCBs into the cavity PCBs while in the oven.\nAfter everything is tested and programmed, the electronics cavity is permanently sealed with clear epoxy.  This provides durability, waterproofing, and tamper resistance for the keys.  Here is a demo of our glue dispensing being set up.\n\nEasy to deploy. Solo doesn't require any software installation, it works out of the box on most browsers, operating systems and devices. It works great with GSuite, Okta, Duo and anything that supports WebAuthn/FIDO2.\nEasy to use. It takes just one tap to authenticate. And we even made the USB-A plug reversible!\nProtects against phishing and account takeover. Google reported 0 successful phishing attacks since they deployed security keys for 2FA. Security keys are particularly affordable if you have a large number of contractors that you need to authenticate.\nRobust, water (and coffee) proof. We redesigned the hardware from the ground up to be incredibly robust and we sealed the components in epoxy to make it waterproof. Don't wash it, but don't worry about coffee spilling on it.\nSecure upgrade. Unlike any other FIDO2 security key in the market, Solo supports secure firmware upgrade. Firmware upgrade is NOT automatic, it requires explicit user action, and you can only upgrade to an officially released SoloKeys signed firmware, not an arbitrary one. In case of security bugs, the upgrade process is secure and much cheaper than physically replacing all your security keys.\nOpen source. Your security / SRE teams and in general all the nerds in your company are going to love it! Want to make a surprise? Let us know and we can make custom cases for your team (minimum quantity: 40 devices).\nPIV. For advanced authentication needs where WebAuthn does not cut it, an integral part of our strategy is the PIV (FIPS 201) companion app included with every key. Plug and play on Windows, easy OpenSC install on macOS and Linux.  Additionally, each device comes with both a P256 and Ed25519 attestation certificate, unique for the device, signed by our root CA during manufacture, and able to further attest PIV keys as generated on device.\nFor orders of 40 keys or more and for personalized cases please contact us at sales@solokeys.com.\nWe also sell a developer, non-locked version of our keys that is the same hardware, and can be updated/programmed with any firmware. We call it Solo Hacker.\nYou will be able to pre-order Solo Hacker from our website solokeys.com and we'll ask if you want a reprogrammable key in a survey at the end of the campaign. \nSolo Hacker - developer version sold separately at solokeys.com\n\n\u25cf Robust NFC performance (Near Field Communication). Antenna innovation leading to significantly better NFC performance than the original Solo Tap\n\u25cf RUST programming language\n\u25cf PIV(Personal Identification Verification) for advanced and enterprise use cases such as PKCS#11 (e.g. https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agentunlocks SSH(Secure shell) key use for older versions of OpenSSH that do not support FIDO keys natively)\n\u25cf PUF-based encrypted storage for all secret material - PUF(Physical Unclonable functions)\n\u25cf Secure boot with signed firmware upgrades in the field \n\u25cf Trussed\u2122 framework allowing easy extensibility with new apps (e.g., Gesellschaft f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH G\u00f6ttingen is working on an app to store keys for Wireguard VPN)\n\u25cf Device attestation certificates, ensuring authenticity of devices, usable as root of trust in PIV and other apps.\n\u25cf OTP(One Time Password) for legacy authentication\n\u25cf Robust and water resistant. Components placed in an external shell and sealed with a layer of epoxy.\n\nThe Fine Print\nInternational Backers\nWe will ship Solo worldwide. Please note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region.\nWe ship from the US and EU.\n\nEstimated Delivery\nWe estimate shipping Solo V2 by the end of June 2021.\nWe have one batch of Solo V2 ready so we estimate shipping to early adopters soon after the campaign ends.\nWhile we do not expect these to change, it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift. We will provide updates when/if the estimated shipment date changes. At any time up until your Solo has shipped, you may request a full refund by emailing support@solokeys.com.\n\nNeed help? We're here for you.\nIf you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign has closed, you can always reach us at support@solokeys.com.\n\nRisks and challenges\nSolo is ready to be manufactured, and we are ready to meet the estimated delivery times. We\u2019ve done our best to predict demand and define a solid production plan. Should we miss any of our projections, we\u2019ll let you know what's happening, why, and correct it as quickly as possible.\n\nSupply Chain Risk\nWe have already manufactured tens of thousands of security keys, and a few thousands Solo V2. We're confident that our factory can easily scale to hundreds of thousand units. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly resolve the issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter\n\nLaunch with the #1 Crowdfunding Agency today\nA special thank you to our partners & sponsors\nHear about us on our favorite podcast at the Microsoft Cloud Show, episode 394", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the uncertainty brought about by the pandemic, the shipping dates are estimates.

Apparently I like to design what my backers want so a queen piece for the dwarves will be available to purchase from Wargame Vault at the conclusion of this campaign. \nDwarven Queen\n\nThere has also been some demand for the magical tile designs from the 'Kings in Conflict' Kickstarter campaign, so that too will be available as an add on from Wargame Vault.  \nAll files were printed using fdm printers (an Up Box + and an Ender 3 Pro) and used rafts and supports. They were designed using 3ds Max and ZBrush and have been run through a repair tool.\n\nYou can try out a test sample of the dragon pawn here:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4746584 \n\nSome examples of printed and painted models.\n\n The chess pieces can be printed as one piece or as two pieces - a top and a base which push fit together. There is also an optional base cap that can be printed but needs to be glued on.\n\nThe chess board is comprised of three designs -  the corner, the side and the centre pieces. The chess tiles are slotted in on top of that.\nPLAY\n\nFor extra rigidity I've glued my board down to a piece of wood.\n\n\nFulfillment of 'Dwarves vs Dragons' will be completed through WargameVault. Each backer will receive copies via their account. Fulfillment will begin as soon as possible. This should hopefully be within 2 weeks of the project funding. A survey will be sent out shortly after the project has funded to gather email addresses associated with WargameVault accounts. Please note, this is the only way to gain these files. You will then have the files in your library so you can access them as often as you would like.

After getting preliminary pre-production, costume designs, make-up tests, props, sets completed. We are moving forward with the next steps in the production process. With the help of our supporters, we have enlarged the project to be a full-40-minute show (which is a network hour-long television show).\nSet in the near future, Renegades: Ominara is a backdoor pilot/proof of concept, where technology is abundant, space travel is an everyday occurrence, and alien humanoids live among us.\nAN ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFESSOR, NAMED STEINER, WANTS TO TAKE TECHNOLOGY TO THE NEXT STAGE OF EVOLUTION \u2013 THE MIND. HE HAS DEVELOPED A CHIP THAT WHEN IMPLANTED INTO THE BRAIN WOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH OTHER \u201cCHIPPED\u201d INDIVIDUALS. THUS ENABLING THE SHARING OF INFORMATION AND THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE BOTH SILENTLY AND INSTANTANEOUSLY.\nHE REQUIRED TEST SUBJECTS, HOWEVER. SPECIMENS THAT MATCHED THE NEURAL WAVE OUTPUT NEEDED TO APTLY TEST HIS TECHNOLOGY. SUCH TESTING HAD TO BE KEPT SECRET, SO STEINER WAS FORCED TO PICK THROUGH THE DREGS OF SOCIETY AND YET HE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO COME ACROSS TWO PEOPLE THAT MATCHED HIS NEEDS PERFECTLY. IF HE WAS SUCCESSFUL, NOT ONLY WOULD HIS ALREADY APT FORTUNE QUADRUPLE, BUT HE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE MINDS OF MILLIONS - UNLOCKING VALUABLE SECRETS. THAT WAS THE REAL PRIZE.\nOMINARA\nOminara is a Twenty-year-old girl who has grown up on the streets due to her family disappearing when she was six years old. After escaping from the orphanage, she teamed up with two other strays \u2013 Alex and Shane.\nWe also meet Ominara as an older woman. Her conflict with Steiner has gone on throughout their entire lives with neither besting the other. She becomes the queen of the galactic underworld. The costume pictured here is the one she will wear as a starship captain \u2013 an homage to the Mirror, Mirror episode.\nOminara Concept Art vs. Finalized Costume with Star Loren Lott\nPROFESSOR ANTON STEINER\nSteiner is a man with the ultimate plan. Gaining power not only through wealth and success but by establishing a backdoor into people\u2019s minds. He will be able to extract secrets that can be used in a variety of ways.\nWe also meet Steiner as an older man. Ominara has become his white whale. His pursuit has cost him dearly over the years to the point of obsession. Yet she continues to elude him. She has gained power in her own right.\n\nSHANE RALLENT\nShane is the youngest of the group, at a mere fifteen years old. Her parents\u2019 deaths were the cause of a car crash that Shane miraculously solely survived. Custody was awarded to her aunt and uncle, but after being abused, she fled to the streets where she met Alex and Ominara.\nThey instantly became her new family, and she is quick to show them affection. They taught her everything they know about living on the streets, but Shane still likes to be a kid at times, which sometimes gets them into more trouble than usual.\nALEX T'LORN\nAlex is a no-nonsense teenager. She\u2019s lived on the streets as long as she could remember. Her mother told her to wait outside of a convenience store and just never came back out. Apparently, she fled through a rear entrance. Essentially Leaving Alex not only homeless but with abandonment issues.\nShe met and teamed up with Ominara to do quick cons in order to get money for food. Eventually, they took on Shane as a third sister. Once on board their own ship, Alex takes on the second-in-command role.\n\n\nAdult Ominara will be played by Nichelle Nichols (Star Trek\u2019s Uhura). This will mark Nichelle\u2019s final performance before heading into retirement.\nThe younger version will be played by Loren Lott of Young & The Restless & American Idol Fame\n\nProf. Steiner will be played by Walter Koenig(Star Trek\u2019s Chekov). He will play alongside Nichelle for her final scene.\nHis younger version will be played by Johnny Jay Lee of Station 19 and NCIS: Los Angeles.\n\nShane is played by Chalet Lizette Brannan of the upcoming peter Pan, land of forever.\nThe costume pictured is for her position on the ship, keeping with the mirror, mirror homage. We are considering a possible alien look as well.\n\n\nAlex is played by Jackie R. Jacobson of Netflix\u2019s Malibu Rescue.\nThe costume pictured here is for her position on the ship, keeping with the mirror, mirror homage. We are considering a possible alien look as well. \n Reza is the current leader of the underworld. Dolling out jobs and making certain no one undermines his command, Reza is ruthless, but not heartless. After discovering Ominara and her friends, he took them under his wing and taught her how to make crime pay. Little does he know that Ominara's ambition is to take his throne.\nPlayed by Jason Faunt known as the Red Ranger in Power Rangers: Time Force, Mega Force, and Ninja Steel. \n From Star Trek: Voyager to Spaceballs to the newest season of American Horror Story and Supergirl, Tim Russ is no stranger to the screen. After directing Star Trek: Renegades and Renegades: TheRequiem, he steps back into the director's chair for this new installment featuring Nichelle Nichols in her final performance.\n Tobias is a well-respected member of the film and sci-fi community specifically. Ranging from completing the effects on Renegades to Blade of Honor to Nobility, Tobias and his team are top-notch talents who know how to deliver cinematic excitement.\nThis project will be Nichelle Nichols final performance before retirement. She will be acting alongside long-time friend and fellow star trek star, Walter Koenig (Chekov).\nNichelle was an innovator in aerospace recruitment, working with NASA for years to recruit women as well as people of color for Nasa\u2019s space programs, including Mae Jemison.\nThis project is an homage to her previous work.\nRenegades: Ominara will mark the third installment in the Renegades saga. It will also be a reimagining of the world with new characters, a new crew, and new villains.\nWith almost 10 million views, Renegades has garnered a tremendous fan base and we\u2019re excited to bring them the next installment.\nOminara & Steiner\n\n HOW TO INCREASE YOUR PLEDGE TO INCLUDE AN ADD-ON\n1.

READY?\nWe started out as makers and grew up with the community from the beginning. At first we printed with regular filaments and equipment. But not too long after, we exceeded the boundaries of existing materials: longer operating times, more technical filaments and higher quality expectations demanded the maximum from currently available 3D printer parts - especially the nozzles.\nBeing engineers by profession we went out to set a new standard for 3D printer nozzles:\n Manufactured according to automotive quality standards \nThe best possible industrial materials are used\nExtra hard military grade coating\nProudly made in Europe\nNEW STANDARD, MORE POSSIBILITIES.\nLeft: ZODIAC [CRB] series, Right: ZODIAC [PRO] series\nQUALITY FIRST\nAfter over a year of hard work, we were able to produce a first small batch of our ZODIAC nozzles. We used these samples to thoroughly evaluate and fine tune them for mass production. A test sell showed great customer feedback and demand for additional types. We now need your support to scale up our production and make these masterpieces available for everyone!\nUltra durable coating allows long service life\nPerfect extrusion for extraordinary printing results\nFlawless layers even with the most abrasive filaments\nCompatible with most common hotends\n\n TWO SERIES FOR THE WIN\nWe offer two different product series to respond specifically to your needs. Choose between our [CRB] and [PRO] series depending on your intended usage:\nZODIAC [CRB] SERIES 0.4mm\nThe ZODIAC [CRB] series has been developed to ensure superior performance and perfect processing of even the most demanding filaments. High-precision manufacturing processes ensure ideal material flows and avoid printing errors. The unique coating enables very high surface qualities and is extremely resistant to abrasion.\nZODIAC [PRO] SERIES 0.4mm\nIf you are a professional user or operate in an industrial environment, then ZODIAC [PRO] is the right series for you. In order to meet the extreme requirements for continuous professional use, we have improved our nozzle coating even further. Time-consuming tool changes and process errors are reduced to a minimum.\n\n EXTRAORDINARY PRINTING RESULTS\nWith ZODIAC nozzles you get outstanding printing results. Thanks to the precise geometry and the unique coating, prints of the highest quality are possible - on a regular base!\nWhat makes ZODIAC special. Right: Printed with ZODIAC [CRB] nozzle\nHi-Res Print with ZODIAC [CRB] Nozzle and PA6-CF\nLeft: Hi-Res print with ZODIAC [PRO] series and PA6-CF filament, Right: Prusa stock part\nLeft: FDM part with ZODIAC [PRO] series and PA6-CF, Right: Same part printed with industry level SLS printer.\nPrinted with ZODIAC [CRB] series nozzle and PLA\n\nNOZZLE COMPARISON\nThe unique ZODIAC coating is not only exceptionally resistant, but has also very low friction values. This ensures clean material application and avoids unappealing defects in the finished print. Especially highly filled and abrasive materials can be processed perfectly smooth.\nOur nozzles are made of high-quality tool steel and can be recycled without restriction.\nAll our products are developed on a scientific basis. For this purpose, we work closely with academic institutions to improve our nozzles on the basis of meaningful series of measurements.\nZODIAC nozzles have the lowest friction among all existing nozzles.\n\nREWARDS \nAfter successful financing of the campaign you will receive a questionnaire from us where you can choose from these 6 nozzle types with 0.4mm diameter hole:\n V6 (for E3D hotend familiy: e.g. Prusa printers)\n V6 Volcano (for E3D Volcano hotends)\n MK8 (for Creality printers) \n M200 (for Zortrax printers)\n V3 (for Raise 3D printers)\n BP1 (for new belt printer systems of Creality, iFactory and many more)\nIf you choose a package with more than one reward, you can also combine different nozzle types in one shipment. We will ask all supporters for the required nozzle format AFTER the campaign.\nWHICH NOZZLE IS COMPATIBLE WITH MY PRINTER?\nWe've prepared a selection guide to help you select the right nozzle type for your printer. If your printer isn't in the list and you're not sure which type you need, feel free to contact us. Please keep in mind, that we'll ask you AFTER the campaign for the desired type.\nLink to ZODIAC compatibility guide: CLICK HERE\nLink to ZODIAC datasheets: CLICK HERE\n\nOUR FOUNDING STORY \nMy whole working life I used to work in research & development departments for motor sport companies and the armor industry. In 2012 I got into contact with 3D printing and became really passionate about it. I grew up with the early community and their needs \u2013 of course their needs became mine as well.\nI wanted to use my previous knowledge to implement them in additive manufacturing processes. Growing up with high quality awareness and necessary experience in material science, I started to develop ZODIAC in 2018.

However, the Pi 4 can draw up to 3 Amps, which means it has to dissipate 15 watts of power. The heat has to be moved away.\nFrom the simplest passive heat sink, through elaborate fan blowers and even to an exotic water-cooled idea, many options are available. While not lacking imagination, all have a common denominator: it is virtually impossible to plug an add on card into the GPIO  expansion header.\nAll cooling solutions remove access to the GPIO pins\nThe Smart Fan\nThe Smart Fan is the most elegant, compact and inexpensive cooling solution for your Raspberry Pi.

Its own tiny 32 bit processor receives commands from Raspberry Pi through the I2C interface. A step-up power supply converts the 5 Volts provided by Raspberry Pi to 12 Volts, ensuring precise speed control. Using pulse width modulation, it powers the fan just enough to maintain a constant temperature of the Raspberry Pi processor.\nThe Smart Fan Block Diagram\nDrawing less than 100 milliamps from the 5 Volt supply, the Smart Fan is whisper quiet.

Recommended installation is on the bottom for cooling the Raspberry Pi (Smart Fan on the right side of the picture above) and on the top of PCB for cooling add-on cards (fan on the left side).\nThe Smart Fan comes with high quality brass mounting hardware - all you need to install it. \n What's in your kit\nThe Smart Fan and brass mounting hardware\nDIN-Rail Mounting\nThe optional DIN-Rail kit permits to install the Raspberry Pi on a DIN-Rail.

You can control it from any program using the built in command line system or from a Python script. A Node Red interface lets you set the processor temperature from the browser.

If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?\nAs a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay!\n\nAs I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined!\n\nI realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries. \n\nNow I want to share this book with everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries and The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.\nThere is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.\nVsevolod  Co-founder of The Book\n\nThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to the Summa Technologiae of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration.\n\nOn the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won\u2019t stop thinking of what you saw.\nThis section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you\u2019ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You\u2019ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don\u2019t need it anymore. We\u2019ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We\u2019ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We\u2019ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.\nThe whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there\u2019s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it\u2019s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we\u2019ll reveal the most original one.\nResearchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that\u2019s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes\nIn all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we\u2019ve agreed that killing people isn\u2019t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still\u2026.The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You\u2019ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you\u2019ll become immortal (for a while).\nThe home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don\u2019t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you\u2019ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You\u2019ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you\u2019ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won\u2019t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)\n\nIt\u2019s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you\u2019ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You\u2019ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer. (Which will literally be the best beer in the world since you\u2019ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization)\nLife is not only about surviving; it\u2019s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won\u2019t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You\u2019ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We\u2019ll tell you how to make a vibrator.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It\u2019s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don\u2019t forget to ask about their notation too. \n\nRituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?\nA Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You\u2019ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.\n\nPeople had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep\u2019s stomachs. And don\u2019t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won\u2019t be able to make your new world fully civilized. \nThe intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world\u2019s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn\u2019t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.\nIn one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries you\u2019ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.\nThis book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

The Ultimate Guide will be a hardcover book and will have stunning matt laminated cover.\nThe Ultimate Guide contains knowledge of humankind and it can\u2019t come to life without the help of people. We need the support of enthusiasts who believe in the unique future of the human mind.\n                                                   In the first place, the raised money will go to the illustrators because The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries forms a collection of great detailed pictures. The budget also includes the work of content editors and the book\u2019s printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe Book project is promoted by REPROJECT.\n\n\nFB agencies:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The first and most important thing was to assemble the team of professionals. We spent some time looking for illustrators whose drawing style would be convenient and could match with others\u2019 styles. It was a big deal to find writers for this project as soon as our expectations were rather high and we had a huge number of unsuccessful attempts before we could find writers who can perfectly complement their texts with the illustrations. We also searched out for many researches who support both our writers and illustrators with all the needed technical information. We managed to find experts in scientific, medical, technical and social fields who constantly advise us on what information the book should include to provide readers precise and workable instructions. All in all, we have 36 people in our team, about 10 side experts and this number is constantly growing. After that came the second step of our work which unfortunately took more time and turned out to be more complicated than we expected. We all had to get used to each other to stabilize and optimize the working process. The problem on the technical side was that we\u2019re an international team of nearly 40 people living in different countries all over the world. Time lag challenged our determination and commitment to work together on this amazing project. Finally, we won this fight but there were many others yet to come. Sometimes it was a hard time for us to learn to hear each other, we could meet every day and argue about many small and insignificant thing for hours. We still meet every day but now we can proudly say that our meetings are more productive than ever before. At last, making process is synchronized and we\u2019re actively working on the book.

However, this time we are presenting heart-warming, pleasant, and easy-to-assemble plywood models.\nBack in 2012, I started my way with inventing wooden mechanical construction sets. At first, my project was unique and the only one in the world. Then, some alternatives started to appear in different parts of the world. That was how I unexpectedly found a new niche for inventors. Now, such toys are produced by more than 10 companies around the world. After that, I went through some changes in my personal life and business. In 2017, I had to start over, and created metal mechanical models. It was not easy but thanks to your support on Kickstarter, I was able to develop this project. Today my Time for Machine team and I decided to go back to the basics and created a series of models called The iconic series. \nWe chose this name because plywood mechanical models became classics during these years. But how can we reinvent something that has already been invented by us? How can we make it better, more interesting and attractive? We decided to make these models light, simple and delicate. And for the first time, we added some unique colored elements, which they lacked so much. We created cool, safe, and easy-to-install colored springs. We have also added special fasteners for minifigures. Nobody has ever done this before, so we became pioneers once again and created something new and unique. Thank you for your support of our previous projects. We completed our last project really quickly: our backers received their packages in just a couple of months. We hope to complete this project promptly as well.\nDenis Okhrimenko, the founder and \u0421\u0415\u041e of Time for Machine.\nInspired by sweet retro nostalgia, hippie romance, and pure technical simplicity, these construction sets became our chance to feel the soft touch of history. All the models are quite easy to assemble, perfect for every age. Every set contains plywood parts, additional colored plastic parts, manuals, and a piece of wax to make all the rotating parts move smoothly.\nWe want you to feel the heart and soul of these models, revisiting your childhood with its joy and precious memories. This series is a perfect combination of both elegance of the good old days and today\u2019s minimalistic design. Laconic and stylish, every model is a great pleasure to admire. Trying to catch the vibe of the retro epoch we decided on a bold experiment with style, colors, and mechanics.\n\n Lord of the Rails \nEvery time we travel by train, some elusive mystery hangs in the air. So this time we decided to give you a pinch of magic and create something extraordinary. Gracious and fabulous, our Lord of the Rails is destined for marvelous adventures. With this train, it\u2019s so easy to travel the world and the seven seas, chasing your crystal dreams. \n\nThe locomotive has an electric motor. 4 AA batteries are attached under the bottom. A small control board comes with the kit. This board contains an on/off switch and two pairs of LEDs which glow on the transparent acrylic body parts. The assembled model has a metal lever on top. This lever allows the train to move forward and backward. Also, the locomotive has a plywood switch with two speed modes: slow and fast. It moves the gear inside the mechanism and activates one of these modes. On the back and front parts of the locomotive, there is a convenient mechanism for automatic coupling with the car. You can fasten the carriage with just one move. To unhook it, you need to press the side wings on the hitch-mechanism. \nThe locomotive comes with one carriage with the same colored wheels and a small part of rails for a carriage and a locomotive. To make the train move on a full-fledged railroad, you will need a complete set of rails, which we have prepared as a separate model. Nevertheless, the train can move perfectly well without these rails. For this purpose, on the lower part of the locomotive and the car, there are special locks for wheel bogies. You can lock the rotating wheelsets squarely or in reverse and make the locomotive move forward or in a circle on the floor.\n\nLockBox\nOur LockBox was born to be a good home for your secrets and memories. It may become a real challenge for everyone who is hungry for your mysteries. With this model, all your private stories, precious, intimate, and fragile, will be in good hands, so now you can feel relieved and rely on it.\nThis wooden safe will bring life and vibrance to every interior, enchanting everyone with the radiant beauty of its details: red, yellow, or blue colors make this model just adorable.\n\nRaging Bull\nFilled with some wild beauty, our Raging Bull is a real legend in the world of sport cars. It\u2019s so tempting to put your fears aside, seize the day, and disappear into the night. Driving crazy fast, breaking the speed of light, you will always feel its passionate devotion. Together, you will be gorgeous and invincible. \n\nThis wooden cowboy definitely knows how to win a good fight without hurting not a hair on your head! And moreover, it\u2019s illegally handsome with its bright color accents: red, yellow, or blue.\n\n\nPolish Legend\nEmbodying luxury and refined taste, Polish Legend knows the deepest desires of every car-connoisseur. This car inspires you to take a risk and go for the adventure of your dreams looking for hippie romance and the peace of mind. With this construction set, you can forget about time and plunge into another world, full of beauty and perfection. We were trying to keep the details simple and minimalistic in order not to distract your attention from bright colorful accents.\n\nWatching its wheels move, discovering its mechanical secrets \u2014 this is all about good vibes and tranquility. This construction set is passionate and open-hearted, with its colorful plastic wheels and an opening hood and trunk. You can even put a Lego Minifigure on the passenger seat. For this purpose, we added special probes on the seats. This unexpected trick will make your car even more charming and revive the real Polish Legend.\n\n * Minifigures are not included.\nHot Rod\nThis car is brutal and charismatic, and danger is its middle name! Our Hot Rod really knows how to divide and conquer. Every part of this model is full of both elegance and glory. It may look like a rebel, bad to the bone but the truth is that deep inside it\u2019s kind, warm, and affectionate.\nThis model has a beautiful body and an amazing soul and comes with enjoyable red, yellow, or blue details. You can also put a Lego Minifigure on the passenger seat. For this purpose, we added special probes on the seats. This will add some personal identity and charisma to your car.\n\n * Minifigures are not included.\nDream Van\nAll the sweet dreams come to an end. Well, fortunately, our Dream Van won\u2019t disappear in the beams of the morning sun. Inspired by the Hippie Era, this car is light, airy, and carefree. Driving it is like listening to the music of freedom. This model is hard to resist and easy to assemble for every age. Laconic and stylish, Dream Van is full of retro nostalgia, playful colorful accents, and innocent tricks: cute plastic bands and springs.\n\nThe clockwork is hidden in the model\u2019s back luggage compartment so you can open it up and see the finest details of the mechanism. Also, Dream Van has colorful plastic wheels: red, green, or blue. This invasion of color will take your breath away! You can even put three Lego Minifigures* inside the car. For this purpose, we added special probes: one on the driving seat and two on passenger seats. With this Lego-team, your car will look like a party bus from the 60s.\n\n\n* Minifigures are not included.\n\n\nMore technical information:\nThe prototypes of these machines were not very technically complicated. We can say that our kits are quite easy to assemble too. Inside you will find plywood parts as well as additional colored plastic parts, instructions and a piece of wax to lubricate the rotating parts for smooth glide.\nThe clockwork is arranged in the body of each toy. For example, Polish Legend has it hidden under the hood, and Dream Van\u2019s moving mechanism is mounted vertically in the back luggage compartment.\nThe wooden models have rack-and-pinion steering installed. Wheels can be turned and oriented in opposite directions so that the mechanical model will seamlessly turn during the race.\n\n Choosing the style of cars and the era of these models, we were nostalgic for the second half of the 20th century, the time of hippies and the heyday of local car manufacturing. It was a time of iconic cars for an entire generation. \nIt was a romantic time when design bureaus created cars to meet people's needs rather than to fight for market shares. People endorsed this approach and chose the vehicles as a means of expressing themselves and their ideas.\n As a final touch, we added the possibility to put a mini-figure on the car seat. For this purpose, there are special elements on the plywood seat to secure the figurine. (Attention. Lego figure is not included)\nChoose your model and your colour from our wooden DIY self-assembly kits.\nPlease help bring our creative project to life.\nWe promise that we will do everything in our power to execute this campaign to the best of our ability and on time.\nThe Team:\nWatch a short video about our friendly team of engineers, designers and programmers, who work to create different models from metal, plywood, and models with electronic components.\nPLAY\n\n\nWe are always looking forward to your reaction to our new developments, and we are very pleased when our designers bring you joy and you leave good feedback on websites. We try to improve new models and fix the defects of previous models that you found. Thanks to you, we've made adjustments to the instructions and changed some units and assembly methods in new developments. In all new models, the spring will be delivered in a ready-made closed drum for ease of assembly, and the same changes will be made in previous mechanisms.\nWe're introducing new components such as bearings, rubber, eco-leather parts, updated packaging, and updated, more user-friendly instructions with multi-language translations. We are also creating electronic models, some of which will be presented this year. During development, we keep thinking about whether you will like it and whether you will enjoy it.\n.

This is the only way to get copies of the Omnibus in your local comic shop! So let your favorite retailer know that they can get JON SABLE, FREELANCE Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus Volume 1 before anyone else!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nRETURN OF A CLASSIC FOR A NEW GENERATION\nMike Grell's JON SABLE, FREELANCE was a trailblazing comic book in the 1980s. \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE, the story of a former African hunter in the concrete jungle, was one of the earliest successes among independent comics of the 1980s.  A top seller, SABLE often saw higher sales and critical praise than Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Avengers, and many other mainstay titles. It was one of the comics of the era that helped redefine what the medium could achieve.\nAfter successful Kickstarter campaigns to revive Mike Grell\u2019s MAGGIE THE CAT and his collaboration with actor/writer Mark Ryan on THE PILGRIM, Grell\u2019s Masterstroke Studios imprint is giving one of his most popular creations a massive new release: JON SABLE, FREELANCE.\nIt is notable that SABLE has never gotten the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus treatment it deserves. IDW released a series of trade paperbacks in the early 2000s, and Comicmix published smaller sized paperback omnibus editions in the last decade. Masterstroke is upping the game by going for over-sized editions that will be definitive versions of the legendary series.\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nHERE'S THE PLAN:\nOver the next couple of years, Masterstroke Studios will be releasing JON SABLE, FREELANCE, the definitive omnibus collection in 5 volumes, with the final volume being launched in time for Mike Grell's 75th birthday in September of 2022.\n\nEach volume will consist of approximately 400 pages of content, including all of the issues, all of the covers, and heaps of bonus materials (some never before seen). These editions will be over-sized (think DC Absolute Editions), showing the pages bigger than they have ever been seen before. Each volume will have a dustjacket with new art by Mike Grell. Key issues will have commentary from Grell about the story and behind the scenes insights. And there will be lots of other goodies thrown in as well (including a companion book of original letters column pages, old house ads, and other rare bits and pieces from the history of JON SABLE, FREELANCE!)\n\nVOLUME 1 covers issues #1 - #13, completing the first major story arc of Sable, from his origins as an Olympic athlete, to his life and lose living with his family in Africa, to his personal death wish as a gun-for-hire upon his return to America. The first volume concludes with Sable's return to Vietnam to find a man missing in action.\n\nGrell's gritty, yet emotionally grounded tales are a slice of mid-1980s current events, politics and intrigue, blended with action and adventure. The entire series is a unique time capsule of an era, while also remaining relevant and fresh for a new generation. \n\nTHIS KICKSTARTER\nThis is where it all begins. This Kickstarter is to fund the creation and production of Volume 1 (and possibly Volume 2 if we cross $100K on this campaign) of the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus series.\nWe've spent months planning every detail of this campaign to make it as efficient and straightforward as possible.\n\nWe've set the price point at a comparable retail market price for other similar volumes rather than elevate the price point on Kickstarter, as so many projects do.  It is not uncommon to pay upwards of $30 for a single issue of a comic on Kickstarter (which is based on the cost of creation for writers and artists. Comics are not cheap to create and publish, no doubt about it). But since this material already exists, the costs are a bit lower for us. This means we can focus on making the presentation of the material the best it can be. We can also begin advance work on the next volumes, as we prepare to launch them in the coming months.\n\nWe see fans who contribute to projects get frustrated when they see the same books available months later for a fraction of what they pledged. And while these editions will be made widely available later on down the line, you will pay the same price to support it here that you would to buy it next year in your local comic shops and other retailers. AND... these editions will contain Kickstarter exclusive aspects that those others won't. These will be the first, and rarest versions of the omnibus set, guaranteed. \nA unique page of art in the front of the book will be exclusive to this Kickstarter, and some copies of this Kickstarter backed volume will come with an exclusive bookplate that will be signed and numbered. As well, the names of backers of this project will be listed in the back of the book, thanking them for their frontline support of Mike Grell's work. As well, some fans can get special recognition, including sketches of their likenesses being used for an exclusive trading card set! \nThere are many perks beyond just getting the book. You can get a limited number of original Grell commissioned sketches (some of them inside the book itself, making your copy all the more unique).\n\nThis is a massive project that we're breaking up over two years and five volumes, that, when complete, will be the final word on the original JON SABLE adventures.\nEarly bird pricing saves you even more. If you pledge in the first 48 hours, you end up saving an additional $25 on the book, which will retail for $100 down the road when offered for Local Comic Shops.\n\nWhat you get: \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE Masterstroke Edition Volume 1.\nThere are many other pledge levels that include sketches, other Masterstroke publications you may have missed, and a whole host of other unique opportunities to be backers at higher levels and get even more out of this amazing project!\nAs we surpass our funding goal, and unlock Stretch Goals, there are even more great surprises in store, from trading cards, a Sable poster, a feature length Mike Grell video interview, trading cards, art portfolio prints, and even a chance to get Volume 2 of the omnibus set at a discounted rate after we pass a certain funding goal.\nLots of cool things await! And this is just the beginning.\n\nEARLY BIRD BACKER BONUS!\nThe first 100 Backers will get an exclusive Sable art print by Mike Grell that will be exclusive to this campaign! A one of a kind (well, one of one hundred) piece, this will be a great bonus for fans!\n\n DID YOU MISS THE OTHER MASTERSTROKE KICKSTARTERS?\nFear not! You can catch up on everything Grell right here with this campaign.\nThat's right. You will be able to get Maggie The Cat, The Pilgrim, Jon Sable black and white bonus comic, Rules of The Hunt, The Mike Grell Sketchbook, The Legion of Super Heroes Sketchbook and Sketch Cards, and more!\nThere's a pledge level that catches you up, but we will also be announcing ways to add on individual items you may have missed along the way!\n\nSOME OTHER SURPRISES AWAIT\nWorking from original plates of the page art, Mike Grell will be able to go back into select issues and pages, and clean up some of the art, making it sharper, clearer, and better looking than ever before.\nWe're mindful of not altering the original art, but rather we are planning to lovingly improve the art, colors and pages where needed to make this the best looking, and most definitive version of Sable.\nIn future volumes of the set, there will new color added to some issues, as well as new artwork. (Keep reading...)\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nEach of the planned five volumes will clock in at around 400 pages. They will be larger than we\u2019ve ever seen SABLE, measuring approximately 8.5 by 12.25 inches (the same size as the DC Comics Absolute Edition releases) with glossy interior pages, rare materials (including never before seen artwork), all new covers, and dust jackets that will line up to form a complete image when placed in order on a shelf. Each volume will retail for $100.\n\nJON SABLE'S Back!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nThat's right! Mike Grell's classic is making a triumphant return in a deluxe hardcover format for the first time!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nThe original cover to JSF #1 from First Comics back in 1982!\nA gallery of original covers for the issues that will be contained within Volume 1\n This two page spread from Jon Sable, Freelance #1 has been lovingly preserved, while also increasing the quality from the original newsprint pages to a bright glossy finish! This is the best Sable has ever looked!\n The original cover to the SABEL novel from 2000. It has been revised and re-edited for an all new release, and you can get it digitally though this campaign!\n\n But it shouldn't scare you, the fans! It should excite you! Jon Sable's triumphant return will be a FAN driven publication! By the fans, for the fans! This is the ultimate presentation of JON SABLE!\nThis is how the original series stacks up. Now, imagine it bigger, bolder, brighter, and more badass than ever before! \n\n THE FUTURE\nWith 5 total volumes needed to collect the entire run of 56 original issues, 12 additional issues, and other bonus appearances (anyone remember Mike Grell's 5 page in \"Word Warriors\" literacy awareness comic in 1987? How about that 5 page Hero Initiative benefit comic in 2014? The black and white \"Rules Of The Hunt\" bonus comic from the \"Maggie The Cat\" Kickstarter? Yes, we will have it ALL!) of Jon Sable, each volume will be approximately 400 pages in length, with extensive bonuses.\n\nAstute fans will recall that late in the original run of JSF, Mike Grell left the art chores behind, bringing in a host of talented artists to draw the issues. They were all great artists in their own right, but it just wasn't the same without Grell at the pencil.\n\nWell, we're about to make an announcement that will blow the minds of fans:\nVolumes 4 and 5 of this omnibus series will feature issues of JSF, redrawn by Mike Grell himself!\nWe've got Stephen B Scott along to assist with finishes to Mike's pencils for some of the backgrounds and some of the issues. Mike will be fully drawing several of the key issues, and providing pencils for the rest. This will be like seeing 13 issues worth of JSF the way that they were meant to be, for the first time in over 30 years! This is a unique opportunity for Mike to go back and do those issues the way he envisioned them from the start!\nI'm excited just typing that. Honestly, as a fan (and editor for the project) I feel like we're going to discover a lost treasure of Mike Grell art! And I don't know of any other instances of artists reaching that far back and redrawing whole issues of comics.\n\nBut it all starts here, with Volume 1. We need to fund this project, and get the printing presses rolling on this set of omnibus editions. In many ways, this campaign will be the foundation upon which all future Mike Grell Masterstroke Studios projects will be built. So, we need you, the fans, now more than ever! The more successful this initial campaign is, the more poised for bringing you the absolute, ultimate, best SABLE possible.\nThis is the moment all Grell fans have been waiting for!\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $56,000! When we hit this goal, we will include an exclusive JON SABLE Omnibus collection bookmark, and an exclusive Kickstarter JON SABLE sketch card from Mike Grell!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $58,000!

So help us get funded, and we will reveal a new Stretch Goal each day over the next 5 days following hitting our funding goal!\n* Note: Stretch Goal rewards are only available to backers who pledge on physical levels, not digital.\n\nMILESTONE GOALS:\nBe sure and keep an eye out for bonus items being offered when we hit certain milestones along the way!

Full color art, pencils AND inks in one oversized edition!\nTo the Exceptional People who continue to support NEXUS\nFive years ago, Rude Dude Productions reintroduced something that the world of publishing had thought virtually extinct; the full-page Sunday newspaper adventure strip. For a while, I\u2019ve been asking, \u201cWhat happened to the American comic strip?\u201d Reduced almost microscopically by the 1970\u2019s, I\u2019ve wondered the same. So, with no one limiting us but ourselves, we began adapting the award-winning Nexus comic book into a Sunday newspaper strip. With over 100 individual strips drawn on 13\u201d x 19\u201d bristol, we printed these new Nexus adventures, four strips at a time, to the exact size of an actual newspaper. For subscribers, we mailed them directly to your front doors.\nThough the strips have been finished before we even began printing, the paper itself lasted only 7 issues. With the many strips that never saw print, we\u2019re happy to finally announce that the entirety of these Nexus strips will now be published in one massive collection, which we\u2019re offering in two ways:\n 1. As an oversized Deluxe Hardcover \n 2. And in the traditional-sized Trade Paperback \nThose of you who subscribed to the Nexus comic strip when they were released in 2016, hopefully saw something more than just an exciting read and old-style service. It was the return to something that people hadn\u2019t seen since the 1950\u2019s. For 60 years, everyone from Wall-Streeters to Dust-Bowlers looked forward to the Sunday comics section, and every newspaper stand in America and around the world carried it.\nWHY THE COMIC STRIP FORMAT?\nMike Allred's granddaughter reading the full size Nexus Comic Strip Newspaper!\nHow many of you miss the simple excitement from these bygone years, and wished it would return? As two creators that entered the comic field in 1981, publisher and artist Steve Rude, along with partner and Nexus creator Mike Baron, wanted to move our industry forward by returning to something that made the popularity of comics what it was. It was time for someone to revive the excitement of the Adventure strips, and we\u2019d begin by adapting it to our longtime creation Nexus. \nOther than a few tried and true strips of yesteryear, such as Prince Valiant and the Phantom, the full page format that comic strips once enjoyed doesn\u2019t exist. The syndicates that still own them have little interest in promoting anything old or new.\nFar Side creator, Gary Larson, when asked about the enjoyment people got from reading his zany strip, once told us, \"Well, it's not like the people who draw comic strips are curing cancer or anything.\"\nFor a long time, I thought about what Larson had said. Here\u2019s my conclusion:\nWhile everyone goes through their daily paces, dealing with everything life throws at us, there are still things, often during the briefest passing moments, that might still considered miraculous. Anything that might temporarily lift our spirits, help us forget life\u2019s trials, and give us a chance to dream again.  Along with that might be having something to look forward to.\nThe weekly comic strip adventures of Nexus is our humble offering to that belief. For those subscribers who wanted to know how the story finally ends, or to the many who have been reading it online at Patreon.com/steverude, these strips are now available.\nLook for the Nexus adventure strips now in deluxe hardcover and those always popular TPB\u2019s.\nInto the light and forward to the future,\nSteve Rude\nArtist and publisher\n=================================================================\nTo streamline the design process and give more interest to both versions, we have 2 different designers working on the Hardcover and Trade Paperback versions!  \nThey also have different contents with the Deluxe Hardcover being more of an ARTISTS EDITION and the Trade Paperback featuring extra stories.\n=================================================================\nWHAT'S INSIDE:\n DIGITAL AND PRINTED COPIES WILL HAVE THE SAME CONTENT\n\nNexus Origin and the Fully Painted Sundra Story are extras included for the TPB only.  We do not have them in the Deluxe as we were trying to keep the page count down.\n\n\n SHIPPING\nShipping will be calculated during checkout so we can better deal with added on items and customized packages.

Not only that, your family and friends will think you ordered a takeaway...my challenge to you is to cook and serve a restaurant and takeaway standard meal for friends or family, and wait for the compliments before breaking the news, that you made it!\n\nWhy and why now?\nGiven the world situation with restaurants closing and restrictions and no end in sight, more and more people are looking to cook interesting, fresh, new foods at home.\nRestaurant style curries are a hidden secret which many people would love to uncover and with home cooking on the rise - now is the time to to learn the secrets of your favourite curry...I for one have enjoyed the unexpected time I\u2019ve had to experiment and explore in more depth the great recipes I've learnt and cooked for over 30 years.\n\nAbout The Author\nBrought up in Yorkshire (north of England) and living in the Midlands (the birthplace of the Balti and the location of the famous Balti triangle) for several years, as well as training as a chef and running my own restaurants around the world, I have a unique insight into the passionate world of Indian restaurant cooking (know as BIR in the UK - British Indian Restaurant).\nLiving in Leeds, Bradford and Birmingham for over 25 years, I was naturally introduced to a plethora of different Indian restaurants from a young age. Bradford and Birmingham in particular has a large Asian community and naturally a vibrant Indian Restaurant scene to accompany...I\u2019ve been in them all; Michelin starred curry house, 5 star hotel Indian restaurants, right down to the rough and ready places where I\u2019ve eaten with the staff after hours at 3am.\nAs a trained chef you often get addicted to finding out everything you can about certain types of food, and also trying to get as close to the original as possible....for me this happened with curry, but unsurprisingly I first gravitated to old authentic Indian cookbooks, and whilst these are great and you feel like you may be understanding the traditional cooking techniques and flavors, this simply wasn\u2019t the type of curry I was experiencing in any of the curry houses around the world - these are something else...and it's this that now has my undivided attention, and is my current fanatical obsession...the Indian Restaurant Curry.\nI want to share this amazing food with all of you right now...\nWhat sets this book apart?\nIn short; simplicity, layout, nutritional information, and the recipes are crafted by a restaurant chef. All this means important factors regrading layers of flavour are as important as the look of the dish.\nEach dish has been developed over a long period of time and tested by cooks of all levels, from novices, students, all the way upto Indian Restaurant chefs which means I have been able to write and present each recipe in such a way that all levels can cook each dish easily and quickly.\n\nSimplicity\nThe recipe directions (method) are short and to the point (actually bullet points) and the ingredients are grouped together (i.e. dry spices, wet ingredients, etc) in such a way that as much as possible ingredients can be pre mixed or prepared so they are added to the cooking method in one step. For example, a dish which uses 12-15 dry spices in varying quantities, can be pre-measured and readied (Mise en place) in a container, ready to be added at the correct time, in one addition.\nLayout\nAll ingredients are in bold in the short method steps which means they can be navigated quickly and easily, even during the short cooking period. Each dish will also have a quick reference for heat, and a QR code if a video is available to accompany it. Also, to make it even easier for the reader, each recipe will have the quantities for 1, 2 and 4 people (many ingredients do not factor up so it\u2019s important to show how to cook for more people) - this is also unique to this BIR style book.\n\nNutritional\nEach recipe has diet and nutritional information, so people following a Keto, Vegan or vegetarian diet can see immediately which ones are suitable or how to adapt the recipe to suit them. No other BIR style Indian cookbook has this information.\n\nCrafted\nEach recipe is developed from a base recipe, which generally comes from traditional cookbooks (to gain knowledge of the original origins of each dish and the methods used), and then research follows the modernisation and adaptation of the dishes in the current restaurant setting. Once the ingredients and basic tastes are established, each recipe is remodelled using a chef\u2019s knowledge to maximise the subtleties and layers of the sauce, and then placed in the framework of the style of cooking. Next step is to simplify the dish to a point that makes cooking it, quick, easy, and enjoyable without compromising the taste and presentation of the final product. \n\nBook feel\nThe book will have beautiful full colour pictures for each dish, as well as using photos in the cooking steps to reassure the reader they are achieving the right results. The feel will be modern and premium. The best food photographers and cookbook designers will work their magic to form a beautiful feeling book.\nChapter Description/Outline\nAs the techniques for cooking restaurant style food will be new to most people (although actually very simple), the first 25% of the book will be dedicated to explaining about how to use the book, techniques and equipment - all of which will focus on simplicity so as not to confuse or overwhelm the reader and be accompanied by lots of beautiful instructional photos.\n\nForeword\nIntroduction\nWhy this style of cooking is fantastic, how its cheaper, fresher, and healthier than you think. A look inside a professional kitchen and what we can learn from it and use at home. History of Indian Restaurant style cooking and its history in the UK and around the world.\nHealth & Safety\nHow to safely cook, store and use the methods and ingredients. How to quickly chop and prepare different ingredients safely using things like graters or food processors rather than knives, just like the restaurants.\nEquipment\nWhat is needed, how to use it, what to buy (i.e. what is essential). From basic home oven to how to build and use a Tandoor oven in your own garden. Techniques for BBQ use and stove top cooking to achieve the restaurant quality and feel you crave.\nIngredients\nWhat to buy, where from and how to store and use. What ingredients go in each curry (to highlight how few ingredients are needed) for quick reference, plus restaurant hacks and shortcuts used in the industry.\nUsing this book\nHow to use \u2018mis en place\u2019, how to use each recipe, how and when to use the techniques, and explanation of the overall method used in all the recipes. The recipes will not have more than 10 steps (often less), all written in a short, to the point, easy to read (even during cooking) style.\nPre-prepared Ingredients\nYour house Garam Masala, base gravies, pastes, precooked meats and sauces\nStarters\n10-15 popular starters you would expect to find in Indian restaurants all around the world, made from scratch\neg.

We have been blown away by the tremendous amount of support for our project! We are making tons (literally) of our seasoning and offering all flavors at a discounted rate through Kickstarter ahead of our e-commerce website launch. If you are on the fence, now is the time to order! \nZack & Lauren at Co-Packer\n OUR LABELS ARE IN! \ud83d\ude0d\nAbout\nHi my name is Zack! Thank you for taking a few moments to check out my project and (hopefully!) supporting me. I am on a mission to bring seasonings made with the Datil Pepper to market. \nWhat is a Datil Pepper? A Datil Pepper is a very hot, but fruity pepper from Saint Augustine, Florida with an amazing flavor profile. There are countless hot sauces made from the Datil Pepper, but very few seasonings.\nDatil Peppers\nHow it all started\nSeveral years ago, I decided to start growing Datil Peppers in my backyard to experiment more with the peppers. Through the growing, harvesting, processing and dehydrating, I created dry datil pepper powder that was fantastic for mixing in with other spices.\nThe second part to this story came from my dad. My dad has been making this amazing Cajun shrimp dish for the past 20 years. I have taken his recipe and tweaked it over the years to make my own delicious version. One of the main ingredients in that dish is Cayenne Pepper which is there to add heat. One night while cooking, I decided to swap out the Cayenne Pepper with Datil Pepper. I was blown away by the flavor, it was so good! I kept working on the recipe, making small adjustments and working towards perfection.\nDatilgator Cajun Seasoning in pan cooking, ready to add shrimp.\nOnce I had a desirable recipe down, I realized it was quite time consuming pulling all of the ingredients together to make it every time. What started out as batches, turned into giving small bags of it to friends and family who were blown away with the excellent flavor but tempered and enjoyable heat. \nDatilgator Cajun Seasoning in a bottle for the first time.\nIt's a hit!\nUnder Florida's Cottage Food Law, I was able to make a small, but large enough batch to bottle and sell, using my home kitchen and extremely limited resources. IT WAS A HIT, we sold out before we delivered the first one, and people were already asking for more and sending us photos of all the things they love it on. It was a watershed moment for us, giving us the confirmation and confidence to move forward with the ultimate goal of bringing Datilgator to grocery stores, restaurants, and consumers.\nDatilgator Cajun Seasoning packaged and sold for the first time, December 2019.\nMoving Forward\nWith the success of Datilgator Cajun Seasoning, and the amount of work required to bring it to market, we decided to add additional flavors that have been in the works. The road taking Datilgator from a literal hobby and turning it into a business has been quite the challenge. There are many, many steps to become a food manufacturer. From signing a lease at a commercial kitchen, to getting a Food Safe Serv Certifcate, and all the additional permitting and licensing. Some of the requirements aren't required until you cross a certain threshold in sales, however, many retailers and restaurants require all of these steps to be completed before you can sell, so we are doing it all the right way, first. \nWe have completed many of the steps already, but we need YOUR help to seal the deal for us and put us over the top. We have some really amazing rewards for our backers and at a discount from our suggested retail as a thank you for supporting us.  \n\nRewards\nOur Kickstarter closes right before Thanksgiving (finishes 11/19/20) and our goal is to have all rewards delivered for the holiday season.\nSeasonings\nWe are offering all 6 of our seasonings, plus a seventh that is just Datil Pepper Powder. All of our seasonings come in a nice, large (8oz by volume), square, glass bottle. You can read more about them in the rewards section.\nDatilgator Seasoning Line Up + Datil Pepper Powder\nDatilgator VS. The Competition\nProducts\nTo make things interesting, we have added three additional, non-food products that we feel are a great fit with the Datilgator Seasoning line. See photos below and find more details in the reward section.\nHand made cutting board made from reclaimed standing Red Oak.\nTri-Blend soft fabric Datilgator T-Shirt\nDatilgator Kitchen Apron\nExtras\nAs an extra twist for local backers (Jacksonville/St. Augustine Florida) I am offering, as a reward, me coming to your home to cook some fantastic Datilgator recipes for your friends and family. I have happy hour and full dinner options available. More details in the rewards section.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStarting a food manufacturing company is hard, like really hard. As the saying goes, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it. The biggest risk is failing to meet our goal, and all of the legwork we have put in mapping out our plan comes to a screeching halt.\n \nOther risks include:\nOur suppliers not having all the ingredients we need.\nOur bottle, label, and cap suppliers being out of stock with those parts.\nAdditional costs that weren't accounted for or accurately accounted for.\nBringing the seasonings to scale, and manufacturing on a larger level than we ever have before.\n\nThe great news is I have created, launched, and successfully grown businesses before and I am well aware of how to functionally run a business. This includes proper planning, procedures, strategy and all the parts that come with being a successful business owner and entrepreneur.\n\nWe are confident with your help, we can make our dream of Datilgator come true!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you for supporting us!", "descp": "We'll appreciate you like crazy!\nAnd we'll send you a Thank You card!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "ONE Bottle of Datilgator Cajun Seasoning", "descp": "You get one large bottle of Datilgator Cajun Seasoning with this reward.

With an uncertain COVID-19 season ahead I like to offer a safe and fun way to participate in a global art project. Even though traveling is restricted, postcards allow our handwriting to travel physically. This campaign coincides with World Postcard Day on October 1st \ud83d\udcee\ud83c\udf0d\nIn four Kickstarter campaigns (1, 2, 3, 4) with the help of 837 Backers from 45 countries, I created a series of 29 typographic postcards. Now I like to add postcard #30 & 31, and hopefully we can set a new record and bring together backers from 50 countries. 50 countries = 10 extra copies of HOW ARE YOU cards for each backer(of 5\u20ac and more).\nParticipating is easy:\n1. Choose a reward & pledge.\n2. Leave a comment with the country, state your reward will ship to. \n3. If you like, share how you are!\nCurrently backers from 24 countries are supporting the campaign: \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9 \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0 \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfb \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf4 \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (see \u2192 S T R E T C H G O A L S below for more details)\nHere you see the complete set:  \n\ud83c\udf0d Global and Local  S T R E T C H G O A L S \nAfter you backed, leave a comment and let us know to which country your reward will ship, and if you like to: share how you are. \nThe more people from different countries back the project = the more cards all backers will receive! 50 countries = 10 extra copies of HOW ARE YOU Postcard/Sticker for all backers (of 5\u20ac or more).\nCurrently (31. Oct. 2020) backers from 24 countries are backing the campaign. Here in alphabetical order: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Latvia, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Puerto Rico, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA.\n\nFollowing up to Victoria's comment from the Typographic Postcard #27 Kickstarter (almost 4 years ago):\n\u2026I thought it would be only fair and encouraging to add a stretchgoal for US-Backers. \nKickstarter is a unique platform that enabled me to share my work with people all over the world. Although I say all over the world, but in past campaigns I noticed that about 40% of the pledges are coming from the US. On the other hand other areas are underrepresented. Past campaigns were backed from 2 African countries: Namibia and South Africa. Regarding the two most populous countries China and India, only few backers came from China and none from India. That is why I came up with L O C A L \u2014 S T R E T C H G O A L S: \n Join the project and pick a reward: \n\ud83d\udcee\ud83d\udcafComplete Set\nYou will receive the complete set of 31 Typographic Postcards, all Stretchgoal-extras, and one WISH YOU WERE HERE Poster (backside tells the story how the series came to life and pictures of all postcards.)\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO GET MORE THAN ONE SET OF CARDS? After the campaign ends you can add individual cards, additional sets etc.\n\ud83d\uddbc Typographic Object, HOW ARE YOU.\nYou will receive one HOW ARE YOU object, framed (17,5cm x 17,5cm) ready to hang. And all perks of the \"Complete Set\" reward. Each object is unique, set in actual used keyboard keys. Select one of the below:\nTypographic Object #0\nTypographic Object #1\nTypographic Object #2 (OREO Edition)\nTypographic Object #3 (A1243)\nThe keys of \u2191 Typographic Object #3 are entirely taken from used Apple A1243keyboards, which were introduced in 2007. On its back, one reads: Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China Model No. A1243.\nSome trivia: On the first day of January in 2002 the Euro currency was introduced. Around 1999 keyboard manufacturers started to print a \u20ac sign next to the E key. This makes it easy to spot the age of a European keyboard.\nTypographic Object #4 (black keys II)\nTypographic Object #5 (IBM Model M 1985)\nThe keys for Object #5 were taken from the legendary IBM Model M Series manufactured in the United Kingdom from 1984 and is still being manufacturing in Kentucky, USA. In PCWorld (Jul 8, 2008) Benj Edwards writes about the Model M: \u201cStung by the criticism, IBM assembled a ten-person task force to craft a new keyboard, according to David Bradley, a member of that task force and of the 5150\u2019s design team. Their resulting 101-key design, 1984\u2019s Model M, became the undisputed bellwether for the computer industry, with a layout that dominates desktops to this day. As we peek under the hood of this legend, you\u2019ll soon see why many consider the Model M to be the greatest keyboard of all time.\u201d\nTypographic Object #6\nTypographic Object #7\nTypographic Object #8 (Tetris)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nQuick Facts about Typographic Postcards:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n Size: 12cm x 17.5cm\n Material: 265gr cardboard or heavier.\nPrinted in Germany\n Printing: four color offset with different finishes (glossy UV sealing, matt laminate, glossy sticker)\nSome postcards have rounded corners.\n\"AUTOBAHN\" \"OFFLINE\" and \"I WAS HERE\" are stickers / postcards! The other cards are regular postcards.\nThe back of the cards are easy to write on with pen, biro, pencil, inkjet etc. The front works well with marker and typewriter:\nThe backside of a postcard is very important. Regular postcards have \"address - lines\", but I am not a fan of \"address - lines\". For me they are always too short, or missing a line. When it comes to world wide addresses one size does not fit all. I think everybody should be free to use the card horizontally, vertically or diagonally or upside down - right to left etc. So I leave as much space as possible for you to be creative.\nBut I put some tiny information on the back about the postcard. \nIMAGE\nHow will the funding be used?\nMost of the funding goes to the artist (\u224830%), then printing, packaging and shipping the cards, a bit to taxes (16% VAT + income taxes), a little bit to processing credit card payments (3%) and a tiny bit to Kickstarter for creating this awesome platform (5%).\nTimeframe\nAll the artwork work is done. I have already printed a test batch of Postcards:\nNow I just need to know how many postcards I should order for the final printrun, and how much shipping material. After the Kickstarter Campaign is over it takes about 14 days for the funding to arrive in my account. Then I will place the final order with the printer. Until it will arrives (about 7 days) I will prepare the shipping (printing shipping labels and order enough packaging material). It will take another 5 days to package everything and have it picked up by the postman. So 26 days after the campaign ends the rewards should be in transit to you!\n14 days processing payment / collecting addresses from backers\n7 days printing cards / preparing shipping (printing address labels)\n+/- 5 days packaging rewards\n\ud83d\udce6 Shipping \nAll Rewards ship with priority mail from Frankfurt am Main, Germany to any location in the world (including islands and outposts). Your reward will be carefully packaged in a protective and reusable envelop. From the last Typographic Postcard Campaigns I found these average shipping times:\nGermany: 1-2 days\nEurope: 2-7 days\nU.S.A. / Canada: 7-21 days\nAsia / Pacific / South America /Russia /Africa /Rest world: 7-28 days\nPlease keep in mind depending on lockdowns in different countries these times can be significantly longer (couple of weeks). \n\ud83d\udccdTracking: Framed object rewards include online tracking and insurance. Postcard rewards are send out with priority mail without tracking. Costs of tracking depend on the country you are're in and because of COVID-19 change from week to week. After the campaign ends, depending on the situation, you will have the opportunity to add online tracking to your reward.\nYou can read more about this the project's history on my website: haraldgeisler.com/postcards\n\u2192Kickstarter References \nIf you like to see my other typography Kickstarter projects check out this list:\nFonts:\n Sigmund Freud Typeface \u2022 a letter to your shrink 2013   \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/201030759/sigmund-freud-typeface-a-letter-to-your-shrink \n Albert Einstein Font 2015   \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1822548650/albert-einstein-font \n Martin Luther Font 2017   \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/martin-luther-handwriting-font-here-i-write \n\ud83d\ude2d Martin Luther King Font 2019 (\u2026did not reach funding goal)  \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/martin-luther-king-font \n 2020 Font Collection 2020   \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/2020-font-collection \nWriting Reenactment:\n Kickstarter Gold: Pen Pals\u2014Einstein & Freud 2017 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/kickstarter-gold-pen-palseinstein-and-freud-handwr \nTypographic Postcards:\n Typographic Postcards #14-26 2015 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/typographic-postcards \n Typographic Postcard #27 \"I WAS HERE\" 2016 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/typographic-postcards-and-sticker-27-i-was-here \n Typographic Postcard #28 \"WISH YOU WERE HERE\" 2018 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/typographic-postcard-28-wish-you-were-here  \n Typographic Postcard #29 \"OFFLINE\" 2019 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/offline \nTypographic Wall Calendar Series:\n Typographic Wall Calendar 2011 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2011-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2012 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2012-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2013 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2013-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2014 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2014-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2016 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/2016-typographic-wall-calendar \nCancel / Save / OK:\n Cancel / Save Notepad 2017 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/cancel-save-notepad  \n Cancel / OK Sticky Notes 2018 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/cancel-ok-sticky-notes \n\nThanks for reading, ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery artistic project bears risks.

We are looking for a delicate balance of mechanisms and lines, materials and shapes, ease of assembly and complexity of functions. And when we find this balance, we show you the new wonder of Time for Machine. So, models that were previously unbelievable for us, but are available for you today:\nLuxury Roadster\nInspired by the legendary Bentley Speed Six. Luxury sedan of its time, nicknamed \"Blue Train Coupe\u201d by the journalists, which was able to overtake the Blue Train (Le Train Bleu). The Blue Train Races were a series of record-breaking competitions between automobiles and trains in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It saw a number of motorists and their own or sponsored automobiles race against Le Train Bleu, a train that ran between Calais and the French Riviera.\nFor us, this model is also the pinnacle of what we are able to do at the moment. We have used rubber wheels for better traction. We have made inserts of high quality leatherette to highlight the historic character of the model. We have added the rich decor and new interesting features. There is a block with a spring and a handle for winding the mechanism on the side of the passenger seat on board the machine, in the drum of the spare wheel. In the opposite spare wheel on the driver's side there is a switch for autopilot steering. Due to this function, the machine can make wave-shaped turns while driving.\n The engine mechanism switch is under the footboard. On the opposite side of the door there is a switch, which turns on the reverse function. Inside the cabin there is another lever that frees the steering wheel if you turn off the autopilot mode. By activating this lever you can turn the front wheels using the steering wheel in the cab. \nThe model can travel more than 5 meters at full spring power. We also redesigned the spring block itself. In this model, the spring is supplied in a preassembled closed drum for easier assembly. You can open the doors, hoods, pip into the small luggage compartment at the rear of the car. Also in this car we used delicate decors and semi-transparent grilles on the radiator, wheels, headlights and interior for the first time.\nPLAY\n\nLuxury Roadster in action.\nPLAY\n\nStarbreeze Explorer\nInspired by the Space Shuttle era. Space Shuttle is a space program in which shuttles have made more than a hundred trips into space and made many breakthroughs in the exploration of space.\nThe model consists of several parts. The spacecraft has swinging flaps in the cargo bay and it docks to the accelerator unit. The accelerator unit has a winding mechanism and is wound up with a special key. Once the model is mounted on the stand, you can press the trigger lever and observe the slow spinning of the spacecraft. The shuttle makes several spins around its axis. \nThe base of the stand is engraved in the form of space center tracks and the edge of the stand is made in the form of Cape Canaveral shoreline. On the stand there is a place for storing the key, on which you can also install the spacecraft in an upright position. In this model, the spring is supplied in a preassembled closed drum for ease of assembly.\nThe space theme is perfectly matched with the shine of metal. This is a unique mechanical model from Time for Machine, which has no analogues in its design.\n\n\nPLAY\n\nStarbreeze Explorer in action. \nPLAY\n\nChrome Rider\nLike a real motorcycle, this unique model holds its balance only while riding thanks to the massive flywheel mounted in its heart. For us, such construction of the mechanism was a challenge, we spent a year developing this model, a year of trial and error until we achieved good results and reliability. \nWe mounted the flywheel and the rear wheel on bearings for smooth running. We also inserted rubber gaskets into the wheels for better grip. \nThe model keeps its balance thanks to the flywheel, but also has a free steering wheel like in a real motorcycle. The free steering wheel helps to keep your bike in balance, and if it is locked in place the bike can actually fall. Thanks to the massive flywheel, the model can travel more than 10 meters on two wheels.\nThe model has no spring and can be assembled quite easily. An excellent and unique gift for  motorcycles and mechanics lovers.\nPLAY\n\nChrome Rider in action. \nPLAY\n\nMedieval Hockey\nMedieval Hockey is our long-running design, but this model hasn't became a part of the series. We have thoroughly revised the size of the model, the format of the playing field, the mechanism of the figures, their uniforms and the way they are assembled. And now this model really brings joy and pleasure to the game. \nThere are two people playing. Each person has three players. The active goalkeeper, the defender and the forward. The task is to move a small black hockey puck on the field and score a goal.\n\nDespite the fact that the field is small and there are few players, scoring a goal is quite difficult. The game is well-balanced in terms of chances to win, so the fun goes on long enough. We have tested this statement many times. Hockey is called Medieval because it is actually medieval knights, playing a modern game, on some Greek field. This eclectic and non-standard game will attract the attention of anyone who sees this strange fun.\nHere is an example of a video where mom and daughter suddenly got so excited while playing Medieval Hockey, that it was impossible to get them off the game.\nPLAY\n\nMedieval Hockey in action. \nPLAY\n\nDelicate Casket\nDelicate Casket is a cute mechanical box for lovers of refined and unusual interior items. By pressing the wide Push key, the mechanism will be set in motion, the wheels will spin and the lid will open.\nIf there are enough items in the box, it will close smoothly under its own weight. We tested many versions of the mechanism and decor while creating the model. As a result, we received a delicate, sophisticated thing that can be given as a gift or put in your interior for long-term use and storage of your favorite things.\nPLAY\n\nDelicate Casket in action. \nPLAY\n\n\nChoose your reward\nComplimentary gifts:\nCute Double Decker and Tiny Sportcar. They are 9 cm long little and simple inertial models.\nCute Double Decker has a special pedal, which opens the roof of top deck. There is a space to place a thumb drive or something similar. Front wheels of Tiny Sportcar turn and there is also a lever which helps to move the top forward and backward.\nTiny models in action.\nPLAY\n\nThe Team\nPLAY\n\nWatch a short video about our friendly team of engineers, designers and programmers, who work to create different models from metal, plywood, and models with electronic components.\nWe are always looking forward to your reaction to our new developments, and we are very pleased when our designers bring you joy and you leave good feedback on websites. We try to improve new models and fix the defects of previous models that you found. Thanks to you, we've made adjustments to the instructions and changed some units and assembly methods in new developments. In all new models, the spring will be delivered in a ready-made closed drum for ease of assembly, and the same changes will be made in previous mechanisms.\nWe're introducing new components such as bearings, rubber, eco-leather parts, updated packaging, and updated, more user-friendly instructions with multi-language translations. We are also creating electronic models, some of which will be presented this year. During development, we keep thinking about whether you will like it and whether you will enjoy it.\nModels in action. \n\nPLAY\n\nMedia about us\n\nInteresting Engineering - facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2438658863028610\nhttps://www.facebook.com/timeformachine/posts/1268826756797364\n\nGeniale Technik  - facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/genialetechnik/posts/930643930728216\nPop mech https://www.popmech.ru/design/482551-samyy-krasivyy-konstruktor-v-mire-modeli-dlya-perfekcionista/\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\nWhile we realize the challenges associated with a Kickstarter campaign, we also possess all the necessary capabilities to produce and deliver our models.

After spending a lifetime hunting the resistance in San Francisco, jihadi militias in Iraq, and the pro-democracy underground in the former USSR, Masha has to confront the moral dimension of her life's work. \nYou see, her childhood best friend has grown up to be a Black Lives Matter activist in Oakland, and now the cyberweapons Masha developed for her private-sector \"security contractors\" are being used against the protesters in her hometown.\nLike the first two Little Brother books, Attack Surface isn't a mere technothriller: it describes in rigorous detail the real, shadowy world of automated authoritarianism: the tools used by autocrats and other powerful people to neutralize popular opposition movements, and the countermeasures that movements can use to defend themselves.\nIt features two afterwords: \nThe first is from Ron Diebert, founder of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, whose forensic efforts have outed countless state-sponsored cyberattacks on journalists, activists and civil society, from Chinese attacks on the Tibetan government in exile to the Saudi cyberattack that led to the grisly murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi;\nThe second is from Runa Sandvig, a cybersecurity expert and key contributor to the Tor Project; for many years, Runa was in charge of cybersecurity for the New York Times' newsroom, defending reporters from state-sponsored attacks.\nLike Little Brother and Homeland, Attack Surface is a guide to the digital risks of our networked world, a call to arms to build a better one, and a self-defense manual for the struggle that will necessitate.\nPublishers Weekly called it \"a high stakes and believable world keep the pages turning\" and Booklist said, \"Highly recommended for those interested in near-future sf with a politically aware bent.\" \n\nHere's how Macmillan describes the book:\nMost days, Masha Maximow was sure she'd chosen the winning side.\nIn her day job as a counterterrorism wizard for an transnational cybersecurity firm, she made the hacks that allowed repressive regimes to spy on dissidents, and manipulate their every move. The perks were fantastic, and the pay was obscene.\nJust for fun, and to piss off her masters, Masha sometimes used her mad skills to help those same troublemakers evade detection, if their cause was just. It was a dangerous game and a hell of a rush. But seriously self-destructive. And unsustainable.\nWhen her targets were strangers in faraway police states, it was easy to compartmentalize, to ignore the collateral damage of murder, rape, and torture. But when it hits close to home, and the hacks and exploits she\u2019s devised are directed at her friends and family--including boy wonder Marcus Yallow, her old crush and archrival, and his entourage of na\u00efve idealists--Masha realizes she has to choose.\nAnd whatever choice she makes, someone is going to get hurt.\nAbout me:\nAuthor photo by Jonathan Worth, CC BY, https://jonathanworth.org/\nI'm Cory Doctorow. I started selling science fiction stories when I was 17 years old, and today I've published more than 20 books: novels for adults and young adults, picture books for small children, middle-grades graphic novels, short story collections, essay collections, book-length nonfiction and more. I'm primarily published by Tor Books (US/Canada) and Head of Zeus (UK/Australia/NZ/India/South Africa). I've won lots of honors and had several New York Times bestsellers and this year, I was inducted into the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. \nFor about 20 years, I've worked with the Electronic Frontier Foundation in various activist capacities, and I helped found a similar UK organization called the Open Rights Group. I'm one of the owners of Boing Boing and helped edit the site for 19 years; these days, you can read my daily blogging at Pluralistic.net. I hold an honourary PhD in Computer Science from the UK's Open University, where I'm a visiting professor; I'm also a visiting professor of practice of Library Science at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) and a Research Affiliate at MIT's Media Lab. My journalism and columns have appeared in The Guardian, Popular Science, The New York Times, The Times of London, Publishers Weekly, Locus Magazine, Make Magazine, and many, many others.  \nIn 2008, I published Little Brother, my first-ever New York Times bestseller. In 2013, I published its sequel, Homeland, which was also a bestseller. Now, I'm returning to the world of Little Brother with Attack Surface, a standalone novel for adults.\nWhy I produce my own audiobooks (AKA \"Fuck Audible\")\n\nAudiobooks are awesome. I love 'em! Unfortunately, audiobooks are also a monopoly: Audible, Amazon's audiobook division, controls 90% of the market. What's more, Audible won't allow you to sell your audiobooks through their store unless you allow them to wrap your books in their DRM, which cannot be removed without committing a felony under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Every audiobook you buy from Audible is locked to Amazon's platform...forever. They can revoke access to the book (they've done this with Kindle ebooks, starting with -- I shit you not -- George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four... You can't make this stuff up!). \nI really hate DRM. A lot. It's kind of my thing. I'm even involved in a lawsuit to invalidate Section 1201 of the DMCA, the law that bans removing DRM. The idea that a company gets to decide how you use your property, after you buy it from them? Fuck that. That's not property. That's feudalism. I mean, at least with the original feudal system, the aristocrats were (despicable, eminently guillotinable) human beings. With DRM, the only \"people\" that get to truly own property are the transhuman immortal colony-organisms we call \"limited liability corporations\" for whom we are little more than an inconvenient form of gut-flora. \nWhich is why none of my audiobooks are available in Audible. Recall that Audible controls 90% of the market, which means that publishers would have to be crazy to buy my audio rights from me, since there's nowhere to sell the (incredibly expensive to produce) audiobooks when they're done.\nThe good news is that I get to retain my audiobook rights! That's pretty rare in publishing circles. And when life gives you SARS, well, you make sarsaparilla!\nThe Audiobook\nPreview the audiobook here:  Chapter 1: Two hours and 44 minutes for free! \nMaking an audiobook is expensive, but it's not difficult. Publishing is such an outsource-oriented business that you can hire exactly the same people to do exactly the same job in exactly the same studio that the audiobook would be made in if you'd sold your rights to a real publisher.\nWhat's more, you can do better than a real publisher would -- it's your show, so you can cast the voice actors, sit in on the production, and make something really incredible. Which is what I did.\nTo narrate, I hired Amber Benson - author (Echo Park Coven and more), actor (Tara on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and more) and all round excellent human being, who previously performed on the audiobook for my 2017 novel Walkaway. \nTo direct, I hired Cassandra de Cuir from Skyboat Media, who have produced many of my audiobooks with readers ranging from Tim Curry to Anne Hathaway.\nAnd for mastering, I hired John Taylor Williams, the engineer who masters my weekly podcast - a polymath musician, sound engineer, brewer, carpenter and all-round brilliant fellow.\nWe were originally scheduled to record in person in March, but, well, you know. The plague. Instead, we linked up by (ugh) Zoom: me in my home office, Cassandra at her home office, and Amber in the studio she'd luckily just built in her basement. Over the course of a week, we recorded the audiobook -- Amber reading, me texting notes to Cassandra, Cassandra directing, and all of us taking breaks when the helicopters started to hover over Amber's house. The dailies, taken from Amber's studio mic, went to John, who mastered them.\nNow we're ready to go, and that's where you come in.\nNormally, I'd just put the audiobook on my site when I was done and let the interest from the print book publicity drive sales for the audio. As expensive as it is to pay pro rates for acting and directing and mastering, the audiobooks eventually earn out and pay a modest profit. \nBut there's a pandemic on. Our family income is down by half (we're OK, but man, it's uggggly), and you're probably tightening your belt too. By preselling the audiobook on Kickstarter, I can generate some income up front and offer you a discount. The audiobook will sell for $25, but if you preorder now, you get it for $15 (or even cheaper in bundles with the other ebooks and audiobooks from the series). \nAll of the audiobooks and ebooks in this Kickstarter are unique in the world of commercial electronic publishing: not only are they sold without DRM, they are also free of any terms of service or license \"agreements.\" Here's the deal: you bought 'em, you own 'em. Whatever copyright permits you to do, you can do. Whatever copyright prohibits, you can't do. I don't expect you to read a sprawling garbage-novella of cod-legalese that confiscates your rights as a condition of doing business with me -- and neither should anyone else.\nWeek One Update \nIn which I reveal my true plan for this Kickstarter!\n Week Two Update\nA plague upon your book-tour!\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe audiobook is already recorded and mastered.

I thought about what I could do with them so they wouldn\u2019t go to waste, and I started by trying to make a sauce for my girlfriend. When she really enjoyed that, I made a larger batch.

For more than a decade, we\u2019ve been building a community and gathering knowledge in the pursuit of this dream. Through perseverance, and with the generous support of a small army of volunteers, students and sponsors, we were able to complete our flagship prototype mech in 2017. This mech was called Prosthesis: The Anti-Robot and its creation marked the dawn of the era of the sports mech.\nIt took more than 3 years of grueling field trials, equal parts engineering and pilot training, to get this machine to where it is today. And today,  we can proudly say we\u2019ve created a fully functional giant, all-terrain mech suit. \nA sport, however, requires more than just technology. True sport is born of the innate human drive to master a physical skill. With the technology now in place, we are in a unique position to be able to offer you, our future fans and athletes, the rare opportunity to strap in and pilot the mech yourself by joining our pioneering team as we embark on the next phase of our plan \u2014 creating the sport.\nWe call this the Alpha Mech Pilot Program (AMP). \nThrough this crowdfunding campaign, we are offering one-on-one mech pilot training, live mech demos and exclusive Alpha Mech Pilot merchandise. No matter which reward you choose, you will be playing a pivotal role in helping us take the next step towards creating a full-blown mech racing league, while taking your place in the history books as one of the Alpha Team members.\nTrue Exo-Skeletal Control \nProsthesis has no joysticks, no steering wheel, no foot pedals. Just 100% limb-for-limb pilot control. That\u2019s right. Prosthesis has no automation, no giros, no ability to walk or balance by itself. It relies solely on the pilot for all its movement. Your arm and leg movements are amplified to control the mech\u2019s four giant, steel legs, move for move. That\u2019s what makes it a sport.\nThis was not by accident. With the relentless and unchecked automation in nearly everything we do, Prosthesis reminds us that some of the most rewarding things in life are those that require effort, focus and training. This is the very essence of sport. Prosthesis is a celebration of the age-old pursuit of physical mastery and human skill, now brought to an entirely new level through advanced technology.\n Bring The Mech To You\nIf you can sign up 15 people or more in your city for the Alpha Mech Pilot Training reward, we\u2019ll take our mobile field trials operation on the road to any city in Canada and deliver an exclusive pilot training program at a location within a 100km radius of your city. The timing and exact location would be planned in conjunction with the pilots, taking into account weather and travel time.\nFor our brothers and sisters in the USA, we can\u2019t wait to come and share this experience with you as soon as travel restrictions allow. Drop us a line if you\u2019d like to talk about planning a deployment to your area for a demo or training, or both.\n$50,000 - More time\nIf we hit $50,000, we\u2019ll give everyone who\u2019s signed up for the Alpha Mech Pilot Training an additional 10 bonus minutes in the pilot\u2019s seat. That may be just the extra time you need to nail that move you\u2019ve been working to master.\n$100,000 - More Pilots\n$100,000 will enable us to upgrade our training infrastructure and expand our pilot training program \u2014 putting more pilots in the mech and accelerating the growth of the sport.\n$250,000 - More Mech\n$250,000 will allow us to substantially upgrade the mech power plant, pushing the envelope of performance even further. More power means more speed, bolder stunts, and more ability for pilots to push their skills to new levels.\n$500,000 - More Mech Action\nThis level of support will allow for  major power upgrades that will enable us to travel to more locations, explore new terrains, set up more exciting challenges, and push both the limits of the machine and the growing community of mech pilots. \n$3 Million - Mech 2.0\nThat\u2019s a lot of pilot training (a little more than 3 people a day for a year)! With this level of support, we can devote Prosthesis entirely to pilot training, including a dedicated support team, while continuing our journey as we work towards creating the next generation mech suit. We\u2019ve learned a lot from this prototype and the next mech will be lighter, faster, stronger \u2014 truly mind blowing.\nSolo Alpha Mech Pilot Training\nYour dreams of becoming a mech pilot start right here! And not just any mech pilot, one of the world\u2019s first mech pilots. This is a rare opportunity to participate in something that only happens a few times in a generation; the creation of an entirely new experience, made possible by the realization of an entirely new form of technology. Go down in history as a visionary pilot in the Alpha Mech Pilot Training Program.   \nWe teamed up with world-class athlete and former Team Canada National Champion skeleton racer turned pro-coach, Cassie Hawrysh, to help us better understand how people learn new skills, in our efforts to develop a pilot training program that will maximize every thrilling minute in the mech.\nYou\u2019ll be visiting our picturesque \u201cMech Ranch,\u201d nestled in the beautiful mountains of British Columbia, just an hour from downtown Vancouver! If you can\u2019t make it to BC, see our Stretch Goals above for how we might bring our training operation to you.\nPilots will have exclusive access to the mech and support team. They\u2019ll also receive one-on-one training from the creator of the mech and the undisputed, number one mech pilot in the world, Jonathan Tippett. The program includes a \u201cground school\u201d safety primer and at least one full hour of seat time. You\u2019ll be guided step-by-step through the drills and exercises developed by Jonathan and Cassie to help you learn how to earn your stripes as a mech pilot. Between training exercises, you\u2019ll get to chat with the team, hang out in the pilot\u2019s lounge, or chill by the river on the ranch #mechlife!\nBecoming an Alpha Mech Pilot is more than just a one-off experience. It means joining a club of like minded pioneers. You\u2019ll also receive lifetime access to our online Mech Pilot\u2019s Lounge where you can swap tips, tricks and stories, and keep in touch with the only other people on the planet who will fully understand the rush you\u2019ve experienced as a mech pilot.\nAll pilot trainees will receive a sticker, patch, t-shirt and hat in person at the time of training, so you\u2019ll be able to rock the apparel for all the sweet photos you\u2019ll have with the mech. You can also bring one item to crush with the mech using your new found pilot skills, at no extra charge (see Crush It! details below).\nSome restrictions apply, see disclaimer at bottom of Section 3 for more information.\n\nGroup Pilot Training\nMany things are better with friends, mech pilot training is one of them. With our group package, you and 3 friends will each receive the same one-on-one training as the solo pilot course, including a full hour of seat time each.The only difference is training will be staggered between you and your friends, giving you the opportunity to learn more (and laugh more) as you watch your friends experience having a 9,000lb, 200hp mech suit at their command. All attendees will receive the pilot training swag package and can bring one item each to crush with the mech, free of charge (see Crush It! details below).\nSome restrictions apply, see disclaimer at bottom of Section 3 for more information.\nThree Day Pilot Boot Camp\nLooking for more mech time than an introductory course can offer? Do you aspire to flip a car with a 9,000lb mech suit someday? Then Alpha Mech Pilot Boot Camp is the place for you! This is the pinnacle of the Alpha Mech Pilot program. By the end of this intensive, 3-day training program, you\u2019ll be amongst the top ranking mech pilots in the world. This is the only way to earn your \u201cMech Pilot\u2019s Licence,\u201d which only 5 other people on the planet currently possess. \nThis program has been carefully designed with the right balance of intensity and down time to help you absorb what you\u2019ve learned by getting a night's rest between training sessions \u2014 a proven formula for excellence. This is the same program that YouTube icon, James \u201cThe Hacksmith\u201d Hobson, described as \u201cThe best experience I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d You\u2019ll also receive the pilot merch package, as well as the much coveted Mech Pilot\u2019s Licence and the option to bring one item to crush, free of charge (see Crush It! details below).\nSome restrictions apply, see disclaimer at bottom of Section 3 for more information.\nProsthesis Demos\nRapid Structural Testing Service Add-On (a.k.a  Crush It!)\nHave you ever wanted a specific item of yours to be crushed by a giant 9,000lb mech? We can help. Few things are as satisfying as watching something be summarily flattened under the weight of a giant mech foot. If you bring a suitable object* to any of our Prosthesis Demo events, we will crush it under foot, film it, and post the video online for you to share with all your friends. $150 per item. Max 5 items per person, per event. Be sure to check out our Mech Mondays on Instagram for some past inspiration.\nProsthesis Live Demo Experience\nIf you think Prosthesis is impressive on your screen, you won\u2019t believe the feeling you get when you experience it first hand. There is nothing quite like feeling the ground shake as a 4m tall mech stomps around, live, in front of you. Seeing this machine stand up, casually walk over and flip a car is a surreal experience. We\u2019ll be returning to the scrap yard in Squamish British Columbia, where we learned to flip our very first car. They have a nearly endless supply of wrecks, slated for the crusher that we\u2019ll be able to have our way with.\nWith crowd restrictions, seating is limited to 30 people, which means everyone gets a front row seat. It also means you\u2019ll need to jump on this quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out!\nPrivate Demo\nWant a more intimate viewing experience? For $1,800 you and 7 friends can come to our private test site and see the mech up close and personal. You\u2019ll get a tour of our engineering operation and you\u2019ll be able to chat with FXB staff and test pilots.\nProsthesis Racing Team Gear\nFor those of you who want to help make this dream a reality, but may not be in a position to come and see a live show or participate in pilot training, we have lots of awesome swag for you to choose from. Repping genuine Alpha Mech Pilot merch will establish you as one of the early visionaries who brought mech sports to life.\n Limited Edition Mech Foot Print Tee\nFor those of you who want a truly unique item, look no further. We\u2019re going to try our hand at some DIY designs - mech style. We\u2019re going to do a limited run of shirts using the mech to stamp one-of-a-kind footprints on tee shirts. We\u2019ll film the process and give each shirt a unique number so you\u2019ll be able to point your friends to the exact moment your shirt was created. You\u2019ll also find yourself listed on our thank you video.\n----------------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimers \nProspective pilots must meet the following criteria:\nBe 18 years of age or older.\nBe between 5\u2019-4\u201d to 6\u20193\u201d in height.\nWeigh no more than 225lbs.\nHave a basic level of fitness (i.e. can you climb a 4m tall jungle gym and do 5 push-ups?)\n  Training and Demos:\nProsthesis and the Alpha Mech Pilot Program are currently located in Squamish, British Columbia, Canada. Our operation is fully mobile, notwithstanding travel restrictions. Backers are responsible for all travel, food and accommodation, but we can certainly help with recommendations (See the Risks & Challenges section for more information).\nIf you\u2019re unsure about which program is right for you, get in contact with us and we\u2019ll answer any questions you have about the experience.\n*Suitable Object for Crushing:\nMust be pre-cleared by the Prosthesis Team 48-hrs before scheduled crushing.\nMust be owned by the backer who brings it.\nMust fit inside a 1.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m volume.\nMust not contain any flammable, explosive, pressurize, toxic or banned substances.\nWe reserve the right to refuse to crush any item on the basis of safety, legality or general sketchiness.\nThe money raised from this campaign will be allocated in the following order:\nWhen new pilots get in the mech, something may break. We need funding to purchase spare parts to ensure minimal down time.\nWhat we\u2019ve learned so far is that learning to pilot a mech is a physically and mentally demanding experience. To ensure each pilot has the best opportunity to contribute valuable information, we will build out our infrastructure from an engineering R&D facility to something more hospitable.\nPilot comfort is important. Funding will allow us to make modifications to accommodate a wider range of physiques.\nWe\u2019ll build an off-mech interface for the ground school, so that pilots can feel the motions they\u2019ll be experiencing in the machine, while working to internalize some of the more unique motions that this particular 4 legged creature requires.\nWe\u2019ll work with world-class athletes and trainers to develop a prep course that ensures pilots will arrive as prepared as possible to maximize their time in the machine.\nWant to get involved in other ways?\nWant to get involved?\nWhat can I do?

Do you work for a lithium-ion battery supplier, we want to talk! Are you a kick-ass web-developer, an amazing illustrator, a 3D modelling master, or a ninja in some other discipline and you think could be useful (or actual ninja)? Get in touch and we'll find a way to work together. \nFurrion Exo-Bionics\u2122 was formed from a rich heritage of community and industry collaboration, reaching back nearly a decade prior to its formation in 2016. We are always looking to work with partners who share our values and our vision. Get in touch if you would like to learn more.\nPeople have been dreaming of building giant powered exo-suits for generations. Previously only depicted in Sci-Fi films and video games, this is the first time a fully operational exo-suit of this size and power - and with this level of speed and agility - has ever been realized. And this is just the proof of concept. \nWe are particularly excited by the fact that we have made this technology a reality in the form of a sports machine. Sport is the universal embodiment of the age old pursuit of physical mastery and a celebration of human skill. It is an affirmation of the value of striving for excellence and a positive way to harness the human competitive spirit for the betterment of all. \nBy combining cutting edge mech technology and the long running practice of sports and competition, we are expanding the scope of human experience, and creating a context where both technology and human skill can compound on the strength of each other.\nOur vision for mech racing is more than just mind blowing machines and world class athletes. It is a reminder that in a world increasingly dominated by automation and virtual experiences, there is still a place where humans are in control and our technology is simply there to help us reach new heights. \nPress\nCNET Interview\nBuzz Grows In US\nGuinness World Records 2020\nMaker Faire Bay Area\nAmazon re:MARS\nAlpha Leg Prototype (2:3 Scale)\nInitial Crowd Funding Campaign\nCompleted Mech - Furrion Exo-Bionics", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge in the short term will be limitations to travel.

With excitement from start to finish, this is going to be a project to remember. \nWalter & Nichelle in Renegades: The Requiem\nThe story will follow OMINARA, the queen of the galactic underworld as she recalls her past and the path she chose to become the woman she became.\nThis short film will lead into the Renegades reboot that will soon be a part of the AtomicTV original content lineup.\nAs the first test subject of the \"link,\" Ominara (Nichelle Nichols) was exposed to myriad experiments that could be construed as torture. All for the advancement of technology and the \"betterment\" of mankind. Anton Steiner (Walter Koenig) knew that Ominara's escape would cause problems for both himself and his company in the future, but he had no idea how much. \nEnjoy the behind the scene footage from our previous films: Star Trek: Renegades and Renegades: Requiem, including interviews with the cast, specifically Walter Koenig and director- Tim Russ.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nNichelle with son, Kyle and George Takei\n\n\nHOW TO INCREASE YOUR PLEDGE TO INCLUDE AN ADD-ON\n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s). (May not include shipping.)\n3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nOur ultimate goal is to produce and release a broadcast-quality short film at a percentage of the budget of the major broadcast networks. This was proven with the low production cost of the other Renegades episodes.\nBelow is a basic list of costs we will incur while making the episode:\n1. Pre-Production - Getting the script written, the sets designed and built, the budgets finalized, securing the permits, the rental of the studio space, the costumes designed and fabricated as well as the props, such as tricorders, phasers, computer screens, etc.\n2. Production - Paying the Cast and Crew, the cost of the Lights, Cameras, Grip equipment, Monitors, Food/Meals, Makeup/Prosthetics and Sound Equipment, etc.\n3. Post Production - Paying the Editing Team as well as the cost of the CGI Effects, Color Correction, Sound Mixing, and Musical Score. (For this Campaign, the CGI Effects will be marked as a Stretch Goal)\nDuring both Pre-production and production, we'll be bringing the Donors updates on our progress as well as behind the scenes pictures so you can experience this amazing process first-hand from start to finish. You'll become acquainted with the talented members of the Renegades team and see the cast do what they do best. \nWe have created an amazing team that will increase our production value. If all goes according to schedule, we hope to complete Renegades: Ominara by March of 2021.\nThe Renegades pilot was shot like a feature film with close to 700 effects shots. This film will have far fewer effects shots, but post-production will take some time nonetheless. Upon funding, we will immediately go into pre-production in the third quarter of 2020. \n Stretch Goals are only available to non-digital perks that include shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks in backing any company.

The United States Postal Service is under attack. Unfortunately, that and the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the absurd rates you see reflected in the campaign. \nTo our fans based in the USA: thousands of small businesses like ours depend on the Post Service everyday to stay in business.\nPlease consider signing this petition to save the United States Postal Service. \nSkies of Fire is a limited comic series by Vincenzo Ferriero and Ray Chou, with art by Pablo Peppino and Bryan Valenza. Skies was launched in 2014 and has remained 100% independent through crowdfunding and the support of our fans. For the first time ever we're publishing two issues in one year!\nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to print the seventh issue of Skies of Fire. Any additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of future editions of the series.\nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.\nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince. His actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.\nIn Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.\nIssue Three follows the pair as they recruit members for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead.\nIn Issue Four, the crew of the Zephyr comes together despite their differences.\nIssue Five follows the Zephyr as they embark into the Expanse.\nIssue Six finds the Zephyr in enemy territory deep in the heart of the storm. \nIn Issue Seven, the Zephyr attempts to complete the mission.\nThe creative minds behind Skies of Fire and Mythopoeia, Vincenzo Ferriero  and Ray Chou have been collaborating on creative projects since 2008 despite living 5,437 miles apart.\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art.\nBryan Valenza is a prolific artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects from top publishers in the industry. \n---------------------------------\nBorn in Barcelona, Cristian Docolomansky Cerda (C.D.C.) is an inker and letterer based in Chile. He's worked with several publishers such as Alterna Comics, IDW, and Ariete Producciones. You can find him here.\nGregory Shipp and I am a freelance fantasy and historical cartographer based in the UK. He is the cartographer of issue #7's codex document. \nThe majority of funds from this Kickstarter will go into covering the cost of printing issue #7 and fulfilling orders from this Kickstarter. Any remaining money will be put back into further production of Skies of Fire.\nSkies of Fire Book I is a 8x11\" clothbound hardcover with 120 pages including sequentials, codex documents, and variant covers.. The book features a new wraparound cover by Pablo de Bonis featuring the city of Monterey.\nLike our previous single issues, Skies of Fire #7  will be an 8x11 saddle-stitched floppy comic with 38 pages of interiors.\nThe Variant for Issue #7 features an original front and back cover oil painting of the First Battle of Ryder's Peak by award winning aviation artist Keith Burns. The preview image does not do the illustration one bit of justice! \nEach physical copy of Skies of Fire #7 will also include an 8x11 print of the artwork packed in.\nWe're debuting a new set of Desertlands Postcards from Dimitris Martinos! \nEach physical copy of Skies #7 will come with a random postcard similar in style to his previous set, the Lowlands War:\nWe Own The Sky Badge\nAdd-Ons can be purchased during the time of our post campaign surveys via our fulfillment partners at BackerKit.

We have a fairly well tread pipeline from production to publication at this point. The only risk is in delays - the book is completely finished, but we still need to print and ship them out. \n\nLast time around COVID19 slowed us down by an extra month. This time we'll try to close out the campaign once again within two months, which we've so far have managed in around three of our campaigns. The other ones have taken a little bit longer, but in general our arc is towards faster fulfillment and delivery rather than slower. \n\nThe United States Postal Service is under threat by the current administration. We have witnessed firsthand massive delays and rapidly fluctuating shipping rates in the last three months as a result. All signs point to this instability in this vital service increasing as we get closer to the elections in Fall. Thousands of small businesses like ours that depend on USPS for service are at risk. Please consider signing the petition to save our Postal Service linked at the beginning of the campaign and make sure to vote this upcoming November. \n\nAs always, we have a 100% satisfaction guaranteed policy with our backers.

As Covid-19 continues to disrupt and overwhelm global supply chains the 3D printing community has stepped in to fill the gaps with masks, face shields, swabs, ventilator parts, and more. The importance of local and on-demand manufacturing has never been more clear.\nFace Shields - model by 3DVERKSTAN\nImagine if every small business, college, hospital, or fortune 500 company had just one 3D printer? Of five of them? Just imagine the impact this would have. It\u2019s time for all industries to get involved with 3D printing. It\u2019s time to establish your own manufacturing plant. Your own print farm. Your own creative space. It\u2019s time for you to get the essential office machine.\nfrom Prototype to Production the F1 has you covered\nEssential Machine - Essential Accessories\nWe are proud to introduce our new F1 3D Printer and line of F-Series accessories. It's where high performance meets incredible value. We did our best to infuse the F1 with best-in-class safety, print quality, and reliability. It's also the most affordable industrial grade 3D printer we have ever built. We also did our best to design much needed accessories that work with nearly all 3D printers on the market today. \nNOTE: just to be clear, the F1 printer does not come with an F-BOX, F-PAC, or F-FLEX, these must be added to your pledge. See the FAQ.\n Note:  F1 printers do not include the F-BOX, F-PAC, or F-FLEX accessories, even though it's shown in the photo. The F1 reward tiers correctly list the items that are included with the F1. \n1. Safety\nWe take safety very seriously because we know where our F1 printers are going to end up: at hospitals, business offices, schools, research labs, shop floors, college dorm rooms, and of course, people's homes. We all know that 3D printers are run overnight, and sometimes for days on end. We also know that many users run their printers unattended. That's why we built a printer with unmatched safety features. \nAdvanced thermal runaway protection. What's thermal runaway? Basically, it's when your hot end keeps heating up and wont shut down until you cut the power. This can happen if your controller board fails, the temp sensor fails, the temp sensor gets dislodged from the heater block, or your firmware freezes and fails to reset. \nMost printers on the market today only rely on firmware to protect against thermal runaway. Software is not good enough. To make matters worse a lot of cheap printers didn't even enable these basic software protections, even though they are built into the firmware. In the vast majority of cases firmware protection works well at protecting you. However, no firmware is going to protect you if it crashes or if you experience a controller board or temp sensor failure.\nThe F1 solution. That's why the F1 incorporates redundant specialty electronic power cut-off circuits. These specialty circuits are completely independent from the firmware or other software controls. In other words, a bad transistor or crashed firmware is not going to prevent the specialty safety circuit from doing its job. The F1 also uses two temp sensors for added security. That's right, two temp inputs, and each input is run through it's own specialty circuit. If the circuit reads a temp higher than 325 C it will cut the power to your hot end. Please see the illustration below.\nBetter temp sensors, mounted better. The F1 uses PT100 temperature sensors made from Platinum, so they are extremely reliable. Furthermore, we designed our hot end to specifically prevent the temp sensors from dislodging during use. First, we use TWO temp sensors to add redundancy, as mentioned above. Second, we use multiple fastening points to retain the sensors. Third, our temp sensors are potted into metal cartridges, which allows us to attach them more securely. Finally, we engineered the cable management of the hot end wires to further prevent the sensors from coming loose.\nSpecial hot end heat break and heat sink. We also use a special Bi-Metallic heat break sourced from Slice Engineering to keep the heat in the heater block instead of migrating upward into the rest of the hot end assembly. Not only does this improve the printing process, it makes the hot end safer overall. Finally, we designed our own heat sink to bleed off any excess heat that rises from the heat break.\nThe filament drive and hot end mount uses UL approved flame retardant materials for an extra level of safety. The hot end heat sink and heat break were designed to bleed off the heat before it can rise and damage the other components on the print head.\nInsulated and guarded heater block. The stainless steel guard around the heater block helps reduce severe burning. It still gets very hot, so be careful!\nAll connectors are genuine MOLEX brand, not some cheap offshore knockoff found on many 3D printers. Moreover, we selected connectors that are rated to carry at least double the circuits required amperage. If that wasn't enough, we only use glow wire rated connector housings. This means that if you take a hot iron (the glow wire) and pushed it into the connector, the connector would just melt instead of burning up.\nSpecial Z rod guards protect your hair and fingers from getting pinched or wrapped up. Each Z Axis lead screw gets its own guard. This also keeps the lead screws cleaner and reduces maintenance.\nAdvanced firmware. The F1 uses a modular firmware by Repetier that includes the standard thermal runaway protections found in other firmwares, but it also includes a watchdog system that helps identify firmware crashes. If a crash is detected it resets the printer to rectify the situation. \n2. Print Quality\nHow do we achieve best-in-class print quality? We do it by getting rid of resonance, zero crossing moire patterns, ringing, z wobble, thermal banding, and other artifacts that show up in your prints. Oh, how did we do that? Now that's where it gets complicated! It involved engineering, proper selection of components, and lot's of testing. Here's a few examples.\nEngineering\nWe started by making the F1 frame and gantry system as strong and rigid as we could. The frame is then perfectly squared during assembly, and will stay that way for the life of the printer (unless you drop it off your desk onto a concrete floor!). Next, we engineered a simple but effective chassis dampening system using visco-elastic polymer because it has a very high dampening coefficient. It combines shock absorption, good memory, vibration isolation and vibration damping characteristics. Cheap rubber feet would have saved us a lot of money, but that's not what the F1 is about.\nNext, we designed the best filament drive and hot end we could. Our filament drive uses our special filament drive gears and gear reduction design for increased power and precision. The drive gears are hardened steel and the reduction gears are stainless steel, not plastic. The F1 hot end is all metal and carbon fiber ready. The key to making a high performance hot end that works with a large spectrum of filament types is to use a heat break that has the highest temp gradient you can find. \nPLAY\n\nAccuracy\n3D printing is about more than just creating \"perfect\" and pretty looking prints. Best-in-class print quality is also about parts that are accurate, and fit together. Parts that have sharp corners and no over extrusion. \nThe F1's firmware incorporates a hot end pressure balancing feature that reduces the extruder movement precisely as needed before the hot end reaches any portion of the part that slows down. This allows the pressure inside the hot end to release and do the extruding instead of the filament drive. It's clever and it works great. In fact, the F1 doesn't require any slicer tricks, like coasting or wiping (combing).\n Here is an example of the quality you can expect from your new F1. Most of these prints are just stunning, and big credit goes to the following designers: Fotis Mint, Clockspring3D, Wekster, Daniel Noree, 3Dprintlab, and Sid Naique. We'll have full credits and high res photos for these designers up on our website soon. \nPLAY\n\n This model by clockspring3d is a great example of what print-in-place looks like.\nPLAY\n\n This is varioshore filament from colorFabb. You can change the level of softness by changing the temperature. This part is all the same filament!\nOperator box by clockspring3d - just to show you that functional can also be clever and beautiful.\nLogo plate printed in I-Beam Blue Wax, a special filament for investment casting patterns. Top part is the titanium casting.\n\n 3. Reliability \nIt starts with engineering and ends with the selection of premium components and high quality manufacturing.\nBetter by design.\nWe all know that  hot ends jam for a variety of reasons. The cause is usually wet filament, improper retract settings, bad temp settings, poor quality filament (bad diameter tolerance or debris in the filament) and bad hot end engineering. Oh, leaving the hot end idle at full temp for a few hours is another great way to jam your hot end! If you're like us you're not perfect, that's why the F1 hot end can be changed in seconds. This makes it fast and easy to change nozzles too.\nAnother amazing RC airplane part from 3Dlabprint, printed in colorFabb LW PLA, half the weight of regular PLA.\nPremium Components\nLets take a close look at the 600 watt power supply built by Artesyn. The price of this key component is over $250. Heck, you can buy an entire offshore 3D printer for this price! So why do we use a premium power supply instead of one we can source offshore for 25 dollars, or less? Reliability and performance and safety. Our power supply incorporates PFC (power factor correction) which ensures that input voltage and current waveforms are as sinusoidal as possible. Besides, PFC is required by international regulations. Cheap power supplies don't use PFC  and are not as reliable. Our power supply carries a 2 year warranty and should run for many years under normal use. \nArtesyn LCM600 series power supplies\nAnother example is our Vanadium nozzles made by Slice Engineering. These high speed steel nozzles are alloyed with Vanadium (increases strength and hardness) and then hardened to 65 Rockwell C. They cost over 30 dollars and imported nozzles cost less than 2. You get what you pay for. Slice nozzles carry a lifetime warranty against abrasion, and cheap nozzles wont last one roll of carbon fiber filament. We want you to swap nozzles to change your extrusion widths, not because they're worn out.   \nVanadium nozzles we use on the F1\nControl your printer from any computer or web enabled device. Repetier Servo Pro comes with every F1 printer. It's the easiest and fastest way to run your printer.\nIs the F1 for you?\nWe built the F1 for every type of business, school, or organization. It's a true industrial grade printer, so this means it's perfect for work groups big and small. It's also ideal for print farms and maker spaces. The F1 is a high performance printer with advanced safety features. This means it's safe enough for hospitals, research labs, schools, offices, and of course, your home. \nSTACKER F1 FEATURES\n T-Slot Accessory Rail: Use the upper rail to mount your tool caddy, webcam, filament spool holders, etc\n Zero Maintenance V-Slot Wheels: ultra smooth, no noise linear motion\n Quad-Gear Filament Drive: powerful and flex filament ready\n Quick Change Hot Ends: swap nozzle sizes fast, all metal, 310C max temp\n Hardened Steel Nozzle: a must for abrasive filaments, made by Slice Engineering\n Dual Heater Blocks: faster and more even heat distribution for more even extrusion\n Redundant Electrical Cut-Off Circuits: These special circuits guard against thermal run-away of the hot end, the most critical part in any 3d printers.

First, they know what they're doing. They are also a print shop, so they know how to produce high quality prints. Second, they make their products in the USA, and they don't use cheap offshore components.  Again, it's not the cheapest way to make a 3D printer, just the best. The F1 comes with a single steel flex plate, a mag base, and one sheet each of the PEI and PC. The black sheet is genuine Garolite and works amazingly well for nylon, sold separately. The PEI sheet has easier part release for a wider range of materials, but doesn't hold has tight as the original PC sheet, especially when using PLA, PC, and PETG. \nAutodesk/Kickstarter FDM Test\nWe scored 28 out of 30. If you're getting a lot of stringing between the spires it probably  means that your filament needs to be dried (and/or your retract and esteps are incorrect). Here's how we scored it. Go here for more info on this test. \nDimensional Accuracy: Score of 5\nFine Flow Control: Score of 5\nFine Negative Features: Score of 4\nOverhangs: Score of 4\nBridging: Score of 5\nXY Resonance: Score of 2.5\nZ-axis alignment: Score of 2.5\nIt starts with a sketch\nStep one for any new product starts as an inspiration, filling of a need, and filling of a demand. And then we sketch the product, the market, the features, etc. In other words, we make more of a story board than a pure sketch. It gave us a road map before we started the CAD modelling stages. As soon as we started to generate CAD models we began to test.\nHere we're discussing the relationships between our key verticals and feature set. It's super important to understand what the market demand is so you can deliver on the final product. Below is the final CAD model we used for the printers you see in the video.\nWe usually begin by building discrete sub assemblies and important components, like the F1 Y axis (print bed) assembly shown below. The F1 uses a special 80mm wide extrusion for the Y axis, or moving print bed. This gives it rock solid stability so your prints come out accurate and looking fantastic.\nFirst prototype Y Axis for F1\n T\nThe frames are now complete. \nAnd then we keep adding more and more components until we're getting close to a finished prototype. We use advanced prototyping shops for metal, CNC, 3D printing (including a lot of prints on our own fleet of 3D printers), and fabrication. We like to have prototypes that VERY closely relate to the final product. This type of prototyping style costs more up front, but saves you a TON of headaches later when you're into production of your first units. It just helps eliminate the inevitable surprises!\nWe went through a number of filament drive iterations until we finally settled on design shown on the bottom of this photo. We're especially proud of our filament drive because it's just so reliable, and so strong, and so light. It integrates the following components into a single 3D printed production part.\nadjustable print head mounting bracket\nfilament out sensor bracket\nfan mount bracket\nABL sensor mount\nblower mount bracket\nhot end attachment bracket\nwire and cable management\n filament guide tube mount\nbelt guard\nNo matter what printer you own or what type of printing you do, we all want stronger, better looking, and more reliable 3D prints. It\u2019s why we spend our money on top quality printers, filament, and other performance upgrades like better nozzles.\nBut there is one performance upgrade that is better than all the rest combined. This upgrade is guaranteed to make your prints stronger and better looking, and this upgrade works on any 3D printer. And it\u2019s really affordable.\nIt\u2019s called dry filament!\nF-BOX mounted on a Prusa MK2\n No question about it, dry filament makes your prints stronger, better looking, and the printing process more reliable. The problem is that there is no easy and quick way to dry your filament, and keep it that way while you\u2019re printing. If there was we would all be doing it. The current ways of doing it are just not very convenient, compact, and effective.\nF-BOX can feed filament right from your desktop!\n The F-BOX works with ALL 3D printers (that use filament of course!). We already have designed custom mounting brackets for most popular printers. CAD files and STL modes will be available on our website by the time this product ships. Or, simply feed your filament from the desktop, as shown above. Use the PTFE guide tube that comes with every F-BOX.\nThe F-BOX works great on all printers, like this Creator.\nOr mount it to your CR10 with this custom printed bracket!\nThe F-BOX is super easy to load!\nNote, the F-BOX ships with TWO desiccant packs, not three. Extra desiccant packs will be available on our website soon.\nWHY WE NEED TO USE DRY FILAMENT\nNobody likes ugly prints with a poor surface finish, so for this reason alone you should be drying your filament, but there are two more important reasons.\nFirst, dry filament produces much stronger parts. You dry your filament to prevent polymer chain degradation, known as hydrolysis. Hydrolysis leads to really weak parts. The strength of your filament is derived from long chains of polymers. When humidity gets into your filament it acts like a knife, cutting up the long polymer chains into much shorter ones. \nOnce your filament is dry you need to keep it this way at all times, before, during, and after the printing process is complete. In other words, drying your filament is good, but if you don\u2019t dispense it from a dry box it will pick up new moisture in as little as 15 minutes. Also, don\u2019t expect your filament to be dry from the factory. It\u2019s not even close. Polyethylene bags are not impervious to air moisture. \nWhat size spools does it fit?\n      1 Kg spools and smaller\nBenefits\n Reduces jamming and stringing\n   Dramatically improves print quality and layer bond strength\n   Works with all filament, especially needed for ABS, PLA, PETG, PVA, Nylon,\n   Keeps your filament dry, clean, and safe\n   Helps reduce filament overrides\n   Stackable design saves space\n   Saves you time and money\n   Better first layer adhesion\n   Keeps you filament clean and dry\n  Features\nNote: the F-BOX comes with TWO desiccant packs, not three as shown in some photos.\nExclusive square thru hole allows you to mount the F-BOX directly to any 3D printer! (may require printing a new square post spool holder, STL files available on our website).\n      \u2022 Special seals keep out the moisture and dust.\n      \u2022 Four quick release latches ensure a tight seal\n      \u2022 Open lid design allows for fast filament spool changes\n      \u2022 High performance quick change desiccant cartridges.\n      \u2022 Color changing desiccant to let you know when a recharge is necessary\n      \u2022 See thru box design for easy identification of filament levels, color, type, etc\n      \u2022 Bowden tube fittings allow for closed loop dispensing and custom length tubes\n      \u2022 Stackable, nesting, interlocking design.\n      \u2022 Tightly sealed box to extend the life of your desiccant\n      \u2022 Recharge your desiccant over and over and over.\nThe design\n  We spent months perfecting the design of the F-BOX. There\u2019s a lot more to this product than meets the eye. Take the spool post, it snaps into the main housing and has two special seals to keep out the elements, while allowing your filament to effortlessly unspool. The lid has four latches to ensure a proper seal. The high quality fitting has dual o-rings to create a perfect seal. The feet allow the boxes to stack and nest. Finally, the exclusive square thru hole allows the F-BOX to be mounted directly on your printer.\nF-BOX early prototypes\nAs you can see our first model was, how should we say, a start?  It was a bit too big and clumsy. By model two we were off to the races and our final iteration proved to be everything we wanted. Along the way we went through MANY iterations of the feet, latches, and center post, not to mention the gasket types, sizes, etc. There is a lot more to this product than meets the eye.\nWe combined our F-BOX, F-PAC, and F-Flex into the Essential Accessory Kit.\nF-FLEX Part Removal Tool\nRemoving prints from the build plate is an essential aspect to 3D printing in general. Even with modern \u201cflex\u201d plates, like those on the F1 and many other printers, the preferred method is still the scraper, especially for smaller parts. \nThe problem with using a putty knife is the blade is too thick, the edge too dull, and the corners to sharp. We designed the F-FLEX to solve these problems. \nFirst, we designed the blade with just the right amount of flex. Second, we made the blade incredibly thin and sharp, very sharp. Third, we gave the blade special rounded edges to prevent it from digging into your build plate. Fourth, we fitted it with an ergonomic soft grip handle. Finally, a striking cap in the handle will allow you to \u201cknock-off\u201d your models.  \nWe can't stress this point enough, THIS BLADE IS EXTREMELY SHARP! So please be careful and do not let children use this product. Always keep your hands behind the blade in case your print suddenly breaks loose.  \nF-PAC High Performance Desiccant Pack\nWe know that most users store their opened spools of filament in big airtight containers, like these. It's simple, effective, and affordable. Just make sure you're using ones with foam gaskets for the best performance. It's surprising how long your filament will stay dry in these boxes if you use enough desiccant. That's why we designed the F-PAC.\nThe F-PAC holds a LOT of desiccant. About 2.5 lbs or 1130 grams.\n WHAT IS IT?\n      The F-PAC is a custom designed high capacity desiccant pack used for keeping your filament dry. Contains approximately 2.5 lbs (1130 grams) of desiccant.\nWHAT SIZE CONTAINER DOES IT FIT?\n      It fits virtually EVERY container on the market today. Use one F-PAC for 5 -10 gallon containers, and more for larger ones.The size of the F-PAC is about the same size as a spool of filament.\n\n WHAT DOES IT DO?\n      The F-PAC is a high performance molecular sieve. It absorbs moisture from the air.\nFEATURES\n      \u2022 High performance desiccant\n      \u2022 Color changing desiccant to let you know when a recharge is necessary, the orange color is NOT a hazardous substance (the blue desiccant contains cobalt, and is hazardous).\n      \u2022 Recharge your desiccant over and over and over, great value.\nMISCELLANEOUS\nWeight: 2.5lbs (1130 grams)\nShipping weight: 3 lbs\nBox material: Polycarbonate\nChemical Description Orange to Green Indicating Silica Gel\nFormula SiO2 + H2O + C25H30ClN3\nCAS (R Phrase Classification) 112926-00-8 amorphous silica 98.2%, activated coloring agent 0.2% max\nMaking a video during a pandemic\nWe thought long and hard about how we were going to keep everyone safe in our office. Of course the first thing we did was have everyone wear a mask during the entire shoot, except for some on camera work. \nLuke and John from TTPro doing their thing!\nWhy we chose Kickstarter?\nFor us this was an easy decision. First, this is our third campaign, so we have come to really value our backers on this platform. Second, Kickstarter is a fantastic platform to let the world know about your new ideas. Finally, most trade shows have been canceled for 2020 and this limited our reach. Getting early backers is so crucial to these types of products, because they take a huge amount of up front cash for molds and inventories. It's backers like you that really make a difference in the world. Without you a lot of products would simply never see the light of day, even from established companies.

If you want more than one reward tier, or more of the same reward tier, you have over-pledge instead.  So, for example, say you want TWO of a particular reward tier. If the reward tier is 40 bucks and you pledge 80 bucks our assumption is that you wanted TWO of the reward tier.  In other words, when you over-pledge we know you're looking for more product! Many of you have sent us messages outlining what you expect for your pledge. Regardless, if you over pledge we will assume it's for more product!

Hi, my name is Harald Geisler, I am a Typographer and Artist. With the 2020 Font Collection, I like to share with you my experimental designs about reading and writing for this season.\nI like to think about fonts like fashion. The way one dresses written language can be a personal statement. Think about how you dress up going to a party or when you're going to a first date. In the same way, you choose a font when you write a love letter and a different one when you invite your friends to a rad house party.\nThe struggle with new. Today I find that most \"new\" fonts are historical revivals honoring the past, for example, the x-th resurrection and hommage to a classic. \nMost of the time classics like Helvetica itself were revolutionary at their time. To stay in the image of clothing: if you pull it off right it can be fun to show off at the party in a 1950s suit. But what is the fitting font for your words this coming season?\nFashion x Fonts. This collection is about exploring possible futures of type design. And I would like this exploration to be fun. The designs of the 2020 Font collection are experimental, fun, pushing writing and readability to its limits.\n\"Of what use is readability if there is nothing to excite us to take notice of a text?\" (W. Weingart 1973)\nAs an artist, my work often starts with a daydream, in the 2020 font collection I like to work on 5 of these dreams:\n1. A font is a portrait of a person\n2. Sigmund Freud's handwriting has a nightmare\n3. Questioning the way we write with our hands\n4. A Miles Davis melody and Andy Warhol philosophy become a font\n5. Imagine your personal neutral font\n Can a font be a portrait of a person? Dimanche is Sunday in French. The idea for this font came from getting to know a Japanese dancer who worked in France. We met a couple of times and what remained was a lot of fun memories about movement and the wish to capture this unique character in the design of a typeface. It started with the idea of writing an M that would whimsically bend towards the end, seeing that made me smile and remember. Just like a portrait makes you think of a person, the font makes me think of this encounter. And I like to imagine that each letter carries some of that character and unique movement. The variations of each letter come from the same inspiration. Can you spot all the letter variations in the image? \nDo fonts dream? In 2013 I created a font that renders Sigmund Freud's handwriting here on \u2192Kickstarter. I spend two weeks at the Sigmund Freud Archive in Vienna to analyze the handwriting of the inventor of psychoanalysis. When it comes to creating a handwriting font it is all about understanding the character and patterns of a writer's movement. Now I like to create a dreamlike variation based on the character, movement, and patterns of Prof. Freud's hand. \n In cursive, all lowercase letters connect. What if\u2026 we'd live in a world where all words start with a lower case letter, followed by uppercase letters that are connected. The design explores how to transform the writing-movement for uppercase letters to write a seamless uppercase cursive. Here an early scene from the sketchbook:\nImagine Warhol and Davis had a font. \"So What\" is inspired by a trick from Andy Warhol and a song from Miles Davis. To create the font I locked myself in the studio listening to Davis' \"So What\" on repeat for 8 hours. What emerged was a concept for a font drawn in four angles, 8 variations, and an algo-rhythm programmed into the font that exchanges the letters as you type, creating a unique pattern for every word you type. Here are some scenes from the sketchbook: \nWarhol's trick goes like this:\nSometimes people let the same problem make them miserable for years when they could just say: So what.\n\u201cMy mother didn't love me.\" So what. \u201cMy husband won't ball me.\u201d So what. \u201cI\u2019m a success but I'm still alone.\" So what.\nI don't know how I made it through all the years before I learned how to do that trick. It took a long time for me to learn it, but once you do, you never forget.\nAndy Warhol,  \u2192The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, 1975\nStretchgoal:\nif the campaign reaches 5050, I will add one more font to the 2020 collection. \nI already used this uppercase typeface for my own T-Shirts, Posters, and Editorial design. And it has beautiful numbers:\n\u2192Status of the fonts\nSome of the fonts are already in use, some are close to finished, others are still on the drawing board. The delivery of the font collection is planned for September 2020. You will receive instructions and a link to download the fonts.\n\u2192Font Guide\nYou're new to the world of fonts and this is the first time you're buying a Font? This is going to be exciting! With the font-collection comes a helpful font guide covering the first steps to get you started. And if you have font questions along the way, I am happy to help you in person through Kickstarter or email. This is going to be fun!\nIf you like to try out installing a handwriting font, you can download the \u2192Martin Luther King handwriting font from my website for free. It includes detailed instructions on how to install and use fonts on your computer (PC, Windows, Mac, Linux) or mobile device (iPhone/iPad, Android).\n\u2192Technical Details\nAll fonts of the 2020 collection will be delivered in OpenType format with PostScript outlines. This format is a standard and widely supported by all common operating systems like PC, Mac, Linux, iOS (iPhone or iPad), Android etc. \nLanguage support \u2022 Every language has specific needs, for example in German two dots are placed over vowels (\u00e4,\u00f6,\u00fc) to indicate a modification. The Fonts of the 2020 collection are experimental fonts, which for example can mean that a font may only have uppercase letters. However, it is very important for me to support as many languages as possible \u2014 for example when you are from Denmark and like to write K\u00f8benhavn (Copenhagen). Now if the font does not support the letter \u00f8 it can not be used for that, which would be sad. So I try to support as many languages as possible.\nAll fonts are licensed for private (non-commercial) use.\nCommercial use: If you are planning to use the font commercially, for example in your design work or in any context that you could describe with \"at work\" or involves you doing something that you receive money for\u2026 please pledge for the commercial license.

Why must be holes on the sides?\nSlots should work as well...\nWhat\nSo I developed a new version of the GPIO Card Extended!

The focus has been on simplicity and quality to create a product that is easily manufactured and cost effective for the end user. It's fair to say we have exceeded all expectations. \nPLAY\n\nThe Respolab mask offers an advanced solution that is far more capable than other masks on the market. If you are wearing a mask for any period of time you are really going to notice the difference \nThe graphic above shows the inadequacies of some more common mask types, especially those with valves that allow the spread of viruses from asymptomatic users.\nWe have already undertaken significant real world testing to ensure the upmost comfort and practicality of product. \nStretch Goal \nIf we are able to hit an ambitious target of \u00a390,000 of funding from our awesome customers we will make an exciting range of colors available to you. We will reach out to you if we manage to achieve this goal and take your requests. We are working on some additional customization too and will look forward to sharing more details of these in due course. \nThe Respolab mask is available in a range of sizes. The mask has a soft sealing component, called an oronasal, This creates a comfortable seal to the face but it is important that the correct size is selected. A simple way to check this is to measure from the bridge of the nose to the understand of the chin, as shown in the graphic below. Needless to say, if the wrong size is selected we can replace your mask with the correct fit. \nWe are offering a range of reward packages all with 3 replaceable filter cartridges. Your product will be delivered in a box with a carry bag to keep you mask clean when its not being worn.\nWe have now introduced an option to purchase 10 filters with every mask ordered. These additional purchase options will be available on the perks list for you to select. Selecting this perk will automatically replace for original pledge. \nRespolab is also making available large batch orders at extra competitive prices. This can be purchased for yourself or offered as a charitable donation. Just let us know where you would like them sent. \nOver the last 10 weeks the team at Respolab have worked tirelessly to bring to market a face mask that sits between the low cost disposable face masks and heavy duty respirators. We have developed a patented filter system capable of capturing nano particles and blocking virus transmission. It\u2019s manufactured entirely in the UK to preempt potential supply chain issues and comes as a full face or half face solution. All at a price point below the cheapest disposable masks. \nOur project has been on track right from the start and we now have product in for certification with BSI, an independent test house in the UK. They will certify that our product is safe and conforms to the relevant standards before we start production of the required tooling. This process will take no more 14 days, at which point we can start producing the mask which will come out to you. We look forward to sharing video updates of the certification process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are at an advanced stage in the design process and are now investing in production tooling to validate our design. This has to be done prior to certification as in order to achieve CE conformity to EN1827 our mask must be made using production techniques. This is a costly process, so the impact of failing the testing is high. We may experience delays if we don't get certified first time. That said, we have done lots of simulation and have budget to re tool elements of the mask if required.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nRespolab's mask features an exchangeable filter. The body of the mask can be deconstructed and washed when the filter cartridge is being replaced. The cartridges themselves can be returned for recycling and at the end of life the mask can easily be deconstructed to its constituent parts and recycled.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur customers will be advised on how to recycle each part of the face mask. We have used common materials where possible. These can be easily separated and recycled with usual household waste.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a318 or more", "title": "Early Bird | 1 Mask & 3 filters", "descp": "July Delivery\nBe the first one to purchase the Respolab half mask and save \u00a37 before 1st of June.\nEach mask can be sterilized multiple times and reused with our replacable filters\nINCLUDES:\n- 1 \u00d7 FFP3 N99 RespoLab Half Mask\n- 3 \u00d7 Hepa Filters -

It's a one-way valve that allows exhaled air to escape through a clear pathway.  Without such a valve, moisture begins to build up inside a mask leading to increased heat, humidity, discomfort, and mask deterioration.  Adding a valve will also extend the usage of disposable N95 masks resulting in cost savings and decreased environmental impact due to less waste.\nPrinted in Canada with a mirror-like finish with FDM PLA\nHow does \u267b BREATHE V2 \u267b improve upon the traditional exhalation valve design?  A seamless removal and re-attachment feature!  This allows it to be re-used indefinitely across many masks (that do not already have a valve).  Traditional N95 masks with built-in exhalation valves do not have an easy means of removal without compromising the valve itself.  They are either sewn into the fabric, glued between fabric layers, or clipped very tightly such that removal may cause cracking/shattering of the valve.\nRetrofitted to a 3M N95 Mask\nRetrofitted to a McCORDICK N95 Mask\nSeamless attachment and removal\n\u267b BREATHE V2 \u267b saves money over time as users can purchase cheaper non-valve equipped masks, retrofit it, and use it for longer (like a traditional valve-equipped mask).  Users can stop throwing away masks after a few hours of usage and start saving money with the valve installed instead.\nMasks last longer with a valve which means less waste and more cost savings!\nOne of the biggest pieces of feedback we got from our first version is the lack of a filtration system during exhalation.  We've improved this by introducing a brass screen filter inserted into the valve.  The brass screen filter acts as a moisture droplet deterrent by catching saliva from exhaled breath.\nThe rear of the valve (facing towards the wearer)\nClose-up of the brass mesh filter\nHere are some government sponsored resesarch articles that discuss the usage of copper/brass and its anti-microbial properties:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067274/\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973\nAny obstacle between the wearer and the outside acts as an additional deterrent for moisture droplets.  While the brass screen filter does not filter microscopic particles, it is a first line defense against small moisture droplets (which is the main infection vector).  The valve cover is the last line of defense, by reducing the exhaled air area down significantly.  Note that both of these facilities will greatly reduce but not eliminate the risk as there is no filter that currently exists that can filter all microscopic particles WHILE providing exhalation relief (its an inverse relationship).\nHow is it attached or removed?\nThe user simply cuts a circular hole 3.5cm x 3.5cm on their mask and then rotate-clips on the \u267b BREATHE V2 \u267b valve.  The valve clips on as tight as any valve-equipped mask.  Now you have a respirator mask with an exhalation valve!\nAttaching the valve\nFor removal, the user just needs to rotate the valve clockwise and remove both pieces. \nRemoving the valve\nIt can fit most mask thicknesses ranging from 0.1 - 1.5mm.\nCan it be cleaned?\nYes, otherwise it wouldn't be re-usable!  A quick rinse in iso-propyl alcohol, or soap and water (with subsequent drying) is enough for it to be re-attached to a new mask!\nWashable for re-use!\nExpenses\nThe primary expenses for this project are:\n3D PLA printing filament spools\nTPE Gasket material\nBrass mesh filters\nShipping costs\nPacking supplies\nKeeping it simple\nThese will be manufactured in-house using our 3D printing fleet.  There will be no overseas sourcing and no packaging to keep things fast and simple (other than the mailer that it is shipped in).  Single \u267b BREATHE V2 \u267b valves will be shipped in small envelopes with individual plastic zip bags while larger quantity \u267b BREATHE V2 \u267b valves will be shipped in either larger padded envelopes or boxes.\nWe have priced each \u267b BREATHE V2 \u267b valve at $10 CAD (about $7.25 USD at current exchange rates) with the following shipping costs:\n$3 CAD for Canadian orders\n$4 CAD for US orders\n$5 CAD for International orders\nSome bundling discounts apply for shipping when purchasing multiple valves.  Kickstarter backers receive a large exclusive shipping discount as opposed to orders directly from our website.\nAll valves are dipped in iso-propyl alcohol prior to packaging to sterilize and clean them.  Though it's recommended that users clean them again just in case.\nSo, who are you?\nMy name is Stephen Co and I am a computer engineer by day and a kinetic artist by night.

It only takes a few seconds of your time.\nWhat about your existing project Pisces?\nThere will be NO impact to the Pisces Kinetic Lamp project.  That project is currently delayed due to logistics supply and manufacturing from China (due to the COVID-19 situation).  I will be piggy-backing my 3D printers to print the valves alongside the Pisces parts.

Written by acclaimed industrial designer Christopher Armstrong, this book is the by-product of over a decade of practical, hands-on experience honed directly in the field of advanced research & development. Relying on the latest scientific methods in STEM and cutting edge R&D (Research and Development) practices from around the world, it delivers a comprehensive understanding on the use of manual  \"old-school\" tools of the trade, as well as \"new-school\" state-of-the-art technologies; featuring real-world case studies by top industry professionals in all areas of design, engineering, and filmmaking today. \nAfter launching in late 2018, the book was met with critical acclaim within the industrial design industry, ranking as the #1 Industrial Design book and Top Design Books of All Time by BookAuthority, and was featured in Iron & Air, Urban Workshop, and The Entrepreneur Motivation Podcast.\nNow for 2020, we need your help get this momentous book printed as a hardcover! Not only will this hardcover book have a beautifully updated black & gold foil cover design, it will also include 80 new pages of content as an updated & expanded GOLD edition. This is an absolutely essential resource for anyone wanting to achieve professional quality prototype results, with content that's accessible for everyone from beginner all the way to advanced / professional industry-level. \n What is the Maker Movement?\nThe Maker Movement represents a dramatic shift towards the democratization of design, engineering,  education, jobs and manufacturing. Advancements in new technologies such as desktop 3d printing and CNC machining are now putting powerful tools that were once only available to large institutions like NASA in the hands of millions of creators worldwide. This rapid pace of disruption is creating a paradigm shift and playing-field leveler like no other in history, opening up many new opportunities for independent makers and entrepreneurs that were once thought to be unimaginable. As a result, this is leading to what's known as the small-batch or \"lean manufacturing\" revolution giving rise to the \"maker\" and maker culture \u2014 the repercussions of which are so monumental, in fact, that it's often been compared to the countercultural revolution that pervaded the West in the 1960's.\nPut simply \u2014 the Maker Movement is a collective group of empowered individuals who are becoming much less dependent on large manufacturers for the production of their goods and services. Add to that an increasing level of interest and investment into corporate R&D (Research and Development) programs that are leveraging the use of new technologies as a way of gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace. All of these combined factors have placed an emphasis on STEM and engineering educations or skill-sets as the path forward to success in this new era of uncertainty and globalization \u2014 with tens of thousands grade-schools worldwide now rushing to build their own Makerspace facilities (now becoming hot commodities) out of both a fear of missing out, and in an attempt to stay out in front of this lighting-fast pace of change in today's volatile jobs marketplace. \nThis movement is also responsible for placing less emphasis on formal degrees, and more focus on practical problem-solving capabilities \u2014 that can be demonstrated through real life, project-based portfolios instead (or simply put, provability of results as evidenced by real-life examples and / or case studies; no complicated math formulae or academic theory needed). If you've seen Kickstarter (or similar crowdfunding platform) campaigns raise millions, or tens of millions of dollars on a relatively simple, scratch-built functional prototype alone \u2014 you've witnessed the full power of the Maker Movement firsthand.\n\n Updated & Expanded GOLD Edition Sneak Peek\n NEW 80+ pages of expanded content (290 pages in total), including content suited for those serious about pursuing a successful career in R&D (research and development) or who are looking to profit from a prototype to launch on Kickstarter.

Because we are also the publisher on this title, we can assure that both quality and delivery will be accelerated, as we have eliminated the need to go through an intermediary to produce, market, and secure distribution of the book on our behalf. \nThe book is complete and ready to go to production once funds are released from Kickstarter. In order to publish the book, we need to get at least 300 collective book pledges or the equivalent funds from other backer levels.\nOnce the campaign ends and our factory has the order, the books will take approximately 9 weeks from initial production until delivery. Shipping accounts for 5 weeks of that time.\n Use of Funds\nBy backing this campaign, you will help to give us the resources needed to finance an initial production large enough to meet our manufacturer's minimum requirement. The goal of funding is to finance an initial production run of printed hardcover books, which will be distributed directly through www.themakersfieldguide.com and also through Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other major book retailers. An order must be placed that's a large enough satisfy the offset printer\u2019s requirements in order to set up the large metal plates (dyes) used in the offset printing process \u2014 which is industry-standard for full color photography books like this one. Once the books have been printed, they will be shipped to our regional location in Southern California, where they will be made available for sale throughout the USA and Canada, with possible plans of international distribution in the future depending on the level of demand from other territories outside of North America. \nThe higher the amount of total funding received also equates to a much larger printing quantity available for distribution, where the educational impact of the book will have the ability to spread across a much larger surface area both domestically and abroad.  \nStretch Goals: \n **Please see Updates #11/#12 & updates at top of project page. Made in the USA production will be possible above $32,000 in funding. USA production will also shorten the overall production and shipping timelines, allowing backer deliveries to be processed much faster (by at least 2-4 weeks). \n\nTiming \nMake no mistake \u2014 while the timing of this Kickstarter campaign is a little \"unique\" given the COVID-19 situation worldwide, the hardcover edition of this book has been a a plan of mine even before the outbreak. Because over 10 million workers have been displaced in the USA alone, this is a time for people who may be struggling to find a source of income. Therefore, the Maker Movement represents is one possible solution of empowering a new wave of entrepreneurs and independent creators to rise up, weather the storm, and to produce new products, innovations or solutions to important problems \u2014 in ways that have never been seen before (which, society will be the ultimate beneficiary of). \nOptimistically, more than a few groups of open-sourced, decentralized maker communities have made headlines recently, by showcasing to the world their ability to quickly and adaptively contribute innovative solutions to the recent PPE shortages experienced by hospitals. The implications of this type of cross-collaboration on a design & manufacturing front reach far beyond the current situation we are facing. See this fantastic editorial by the NY Times:  Coronavirus is Straining Hospitals. Here's How Innovators Are Helping. | NYT News. \nBillionaire Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban is one of the voices of optimism, and has even publicly stated recently that the next 10, 15, or 25 companies that go on to change the world will be starting during these challenging times. In his mind, and in the minds of many other prominent business & investing thought leaders, it is the spirit of entrepreneurial problem solving, innovation, and a dogged persistence that remain the fundamental economic drivers of a nation like America \u2014 and will all be key factors in our ability to come out of this pandemic stronger than ever. And, because of the quarantine measures being implemented in many locations, what better opportunity than ever to spend this time reading and learning something new!\n About Christopher\nChristopher Armstrong is an acclaimed industrial designer and product developer, having held senior leadership positions on multiple Advanced R&D / Special Projects teams.

Currently, the 9 week production + shipping timeline accounts for up to a few thousand units. However, if this blows way past these expectations (a welcomed problem), we will make all efforts to produce the orders in batched quantities, then mail them out as they are completed. We will make every effort to keep backers informed along at all steps along the way if any problems/delays were to arise.\n\nIn order to publish the book, we need to get at least 300 collective book pledges or the equivalent funds from other backer levels. Please note that there are a handful of countries that we are not able to ship to: Ascension; Bolivia; Falkland Islands; Republic of North Korea; and Somalia.

Importation procedures/speeds vary from country to country. For instance, there were about five different backers who had not received their shipments in the Netherlands. In some cases, packages have taken over after Asendia (the 3rd party tracking aggregator assigned to most packages by my fulfillment partner) shows they arrived in-country or were marked as 'delivered.' Unfortunately, Asendia does not provide real-time updates like a first party shipper would. If you still have not received your package, my suggestion is to follow up with your local shipping authorities directly. You can do this by contacting the largest regional shipper in your select country and see if they can track it down.

This is why USA orders have  been given priority over international backer orders.

It is manufactured by a reliable Taiwanese company, which has 15 years of experience of metal card production, as well as very advanced laser engraving techniques.\nA Full Periodic Table is Engraved\nThe Periodic Table of the Elements is probably the most significant piece of information in Chemistry. The table on the card includes all 118 elements with the most updated symbols and relative atomic masses.\nThe most updated information is gathered. For example, the revised relative atomic mass of Hafnium (from 178.49 to 178.486) has been taken into account (Source: https://iupac.org/standard-atomic-weight-of-hafnium-revised/).\nA Data Chart and a Unit Conversion Table are Engraved\nAt the back, there is a chart listing some common constants, with a unit conversion table below.\nRemarkable Quality\nTons of time had been spent on the design process to create a perfect card.\nThe SUS304 stainless steel card is extremely durable and corrosion-resistant. The metallic lustre of the card gives you an ultra-luxurious feel. All information is laser engraved (but not printed) on the card, meaning that all words, symbols and numbers will not fade nor wear off.\nThickness is enhanced to 0.6 mm (normally 0.3 mm for most metal cards) to ensure high rigidity.\nChallenging Manufacturing Process\nThe Periodic Table and data tables are very complicated, so it is very difficult and time-consuming to engrave them on a stainless steel card accurately and precisely. \nBut with our experienced manufacturer in Taiwan, all problems have been solved. The final product is awesome. All words and numbers are very clear.\nThe Card is Pocket-Sized\nDimensions of the card: 85.5 mm x 54 mm (same as a credit card). It can be easily fitted into your wallet!\nMade in Taiwan\nA local Taiwanese factory is chosen to produce the Chemistry Card. The production cost is pretty high, but the quality is excellent.\nA Handmade Card Sleeve is Included (Exclusively for Backers!)\nA handmade card sleeve will be included for each backer purchasing the card.\nThe sleeve is handmade by a local artist in Hong Kong. It is free for backers who buy a card now. After the campaign, it will be sold at HK$35 separately with the card.\nDiscounted Price and Free Worldwide Shipping for Backers\nA discounted price (HK$145 / card) is offered to all backers, with FREE worldwide delivery and a handmade card sleeve included. More discounted prices will be offered for larger orders. All cards and sleeves will be shipped via registered mail.\nFuture retail price will be HK$160 / card + shipping cost, excluding the card sleeve (retail price: HK$35).\nThis is a great chance for you to obtain an awesome card and a stunning handmade card sleeve, at a very discounted price.\nShipped in an \"Envirolope\"\nYour cards and sleeves will be shipped in a padded envelope called the \"Envirolope\", which is much more expensive than a traditional packaging bag, but is plastic-free and advocating sustainable forests.\nDetails and Specifications of the Card\nDimensions: 85.5 mm x 54 mm (with rounded corners)\nThickness: 0.6 mm \u00b1 0.03 mm\nMaterial: stainless steel (SUS304)\nColour of the card: black\nColour of the engraved information: silvery\nPlace of origin: Taiwan\nDetails and Specifications of the Card Sleeve\nNumber of card slot: one\nColour: grey\nExterior: cotton fabric\nInterior: synthetic fibre\nPlace of origin: Hong Kong\n  A Few Points to Note...\nIn the Periodic Table, only the symbol, atomic number and relative atomic mass of each element are engraved. The element names are not included because there is not enough space. Besides, while I have tried my best to search for the most updated data, science is changing every day so the information on your card may not be valid forever...\nI expect that the cards can be delivered to all backers by August 2020. Thank you very much!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIndeed, we have already produced some cards, as you may see in our photos. However, as we have only made a handful of them, their unit cost is very high. If we can raise a certain amount of fund, we can afford to produce the cards in bulk. As a result, the costs for material and manufacturing will be much lower, so we can sell the cards at a much more reasonable price. Therefore, we need your support!\nPlease follow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/minuteobjects\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/minuteobjects\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/minuteobjects\nWebsite: https://www.minuteobjects.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are numerous difficulties during the design and manufacturing process, but all of them have been solved. It is challenging to draw a small but clear Periodic Table, gather the most updated information, find the best manufacturer that can solve all technical problems... However, all issues have been perfectly overcome.\n\nThe only risk will be shipping. All orders will be sent from Hong Kong. Although the post offices here are still operating, registered airmail services are partly suspended due to the coronavirus, so it may take a longer time for your cards to arrive (depending on your location).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nUltra-high quality SUS304 stainless steel is chosen as the material of the cards. This material is very durable and corrosion-resistant.

I created Nexus with Steve Rude in 1981.\nNexus, the Cosmic Avenger, faces Gourmando, a vast, alien entity that consumes civilizations. Its herald Gnosis swoops the cosmos on a silver board seeding worlds to make them edible. While Gourmando threatens Nexus' home planet Ylum, Nexus is on Earth executing mass murderers. This is his job. Torn between his duties and the survival of his planet, Nexus must reach deep within himself to save Ylum. The novel is loosely based on a storyline I worked out with Steve Rude, which will be published next year by Dark Horse. The novel is different from the graphic novel, and covers Ylum and its colorful cast of characters in much greater depth. Years ago, Rude asked me what Nexus story I would most like to pursue. Nexus versus Galactus, I said. Marvel owns Galactus, so we created our own planet-devouring monster.\nI am a two-time Eisner and Inkpot winner, creator of Nexus and Badger. I have written Punisher, Flash, and Star Wars. Ten years ago I began writing novels. Kevin J.

Thanks to Sean Michael Robinson and The Waverly Press that wait is now over.\" \n- Dave Sim, 2020 \nEvery legend has a beginning\u2026\nIn December 1977, Deni Loubert published Cerebus No.1, Dave Sim's comic book that followed the adventures of a short-tempered, barbarian Aardvark. Originally conceived as a parody of Barry Windsor-Smith's masterfully illustrated Conan the Barbarian (which was a big hit for Marvel Comics in the 1970's), Sim quickly found his own voice as a storyteller and illustrator, abandoning the typical self-contained, single issue adventures in favor of elaborate story-arcs which would often span dozens of issues.  \nDave Sim at the Forest Heights College Comic Book Convention in Kitchener, Ontario, about a year before Cerebus No. 1 was published. Photo by Max Southall.\nThe dawn of the 1980's saw the popularity of Dave Sim's Cerebus explode, igniting a revolution among self-motivated artists and storytellers who were looking for ways to go it alone, outside of the corporate structure of the BIG TWO publishers at the time, Marvel and DC Comics. Dave Sim helped pave the way for countless other self-publishers of the day, including Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot, Jeff Smith's Bone, and Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil, to name a few... Along the way, Cerebus found its place as one of the most intelligently written, entertaining, and influential comic books of all time! Though the series ended in 2004 with issue No. 300 after more than 6,000 pages of story and art, Cerebus still enjoys an intense and loyal following to this day.  \nDue to popularity of Cerebus, original copies of the first issue now command thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for most collectors. \nThe original Cerebus No.1 was printed on newsprint paper and after 43 years, most of the few examples that have survived are typically found in lower grades. This new edition is presented with fully remastered art, prepared by master digital restoration artist Sean Michael Robinson, and will be printed on premium paper for stunning crystal clarity! We are working with one of the best printers in North America to ensure the highest quality reproduction!\nRED - 24 Page Standard Edition. The original 24 page comic as it was presented in 1977, with remastered art. It's like owning an original Cerebus No. 1, only cooler!\nGOLD - 48 Page Expanded Edition. The original 24 page story with remastered art + 24 pages of Cerebus Archive rarities! Limited to the number of advance orders we receive.\nPLATINUM - 48 Page Expanded Edition (Signed & Numbered). The original 24 page story with remastered art + 24 pages of Cerebus Archive rarities! Each PLATINUM copy is hand Signed & Numbered by Cerebus creator Dave Sim! Limited to the number of advance orders we receive. NOTE: Aardvark-Vanaheim \"Cerebus Archive\" patrons can specify their unique Cerebus Archive number for the Signed & Numbered platinum edition. \nPROOF EDITIONS - These are proof copies produced for final internal review by Dave Sim, Sean Michael Robinson and the Publisher. These final stage pre-production proofs that we are offering represent the culmination of all the work that went into developing the \"Expanded Cerebus\" No. 1. This is our way of sharing the experience of the final stage of production with Cerebus readers who will receive the exact same copies we will be reviewing before the book goes to press. \nRED (proof) - 24 Page standard Edition (50 Numbered Copies). The original 24 page story with remastered art, just like the original book as it was published in 1977, only better! NOTE: These 50 examples are the only 24 page \"Standard Edition\" remastered copies that will ever be offered with the original $1 cover price. The final production books will come with a $10 retail cover price! \nRED (proof) - 48 Page Expanded Edition (50 Numbered Copies). The original 24 page story with remastered art + 24 pages of Cerebus Archive rarities! NOTE: These 50 examples are the only 48 page \"Expanded Edition\" copies that will ever be offered with RED flames! \n If you are already a collector of Cerebus, this edition will rank with the crown jewels of your collection. If you are new to Cerebus, this is the perfect way to get introduced to this classic series, from the moment where it all began... \n MANY sincere thanks to everyone who has supported or will be supporting this project in it\u2019s final week.

The price of the first item includes any additional packing and shipping costs, with discounts on the 2nd item and up...

Our primary challenge is the COVID-19 virus which has the potential to slow down or delay manufacturing and delivery chains. As of the launch our printer and postal service remain open and we expect to remain on schedule but will send out regular updates during production. We have listed a much longer shipping window just in case there are printing and shipping disruptions. However, we plan to go to print in June and get all orders shipped in July so long as everything remains open. NOTE: Orders shipping outside of the United States may see extended shipping delays.

This book has been long delayed due to health concerns and issues with the past publisher of the series. After long last, and thanks to the help of author Keith R.A. DeCandido, we bring you the final installment of this hard-core military science fiction novel where humanity fights for its very existence. (For those new to the series, books 1 and 2, ISSUE IN DOUBT and IN ALL DIRECTIONS, are available through the add-on section or via specific pledge reward levels.)\nIn addition, we also present a brand-new series by veteran Star-Trek author Christopher L. Bennett. ARACHNE'S CRIME--the first book in a planned duology set in in a universe of the author's original creation--sets out to explore deep space and ends up in a harrowing encounter with new races, in a twisted tale of blame and redemption where responsibility and motives are not as clear as they may seem.\nWon't you help us make these books a reality?\nThe primary goal for this campaign will fund the production of both books and the fulfillment of pledge rewards. The authors receive an equal share of 50% of the profits raised thereafter, with 50% invested in the press to meet promotional and operational needs.\nIf science fiction isn't your thing, you can still help support us. You can choose the IMPARTIAL OBSERVER reward level and pledge a sufficient amount to claim the book or books you would like from our Add-Ons section below. There are plenty of fantasy and steampunk titles available, even a little bit of horror, if you're into zombies! If no...perhaps you could help us out by spreading the word!

He has written about US Marines in Vietnam (the Night Fighters series and three other novels), and the DemonTechseries about Marines in a fantasy world. The 18th Race trilogy is military science fiction.\nOther than military, he wrote a non-conventional vampire novel, The Hunt, and a mystery, Dead Man's Chest. He has also released a collection of short fiction and non-fiction from early in his writing career, Sherman's Shorts; the Beginnings.\nWith Dan Cragg he wrote the popular Starfist series and its spin-off series, Starfist: Force Recon\u2014all about Marines in the Twenty-fifth Century.; and a Star Wars novel, Jedi Trial. His books have been translated into Czech, Polish, German, and Japanese.\nAfter going to war as a U.S. Marine infantryman, and spending decades writing about young men at war, he's burnt out on the subject and has finally come home. Today he's writing short fiction, mostly steampunk, and farcical fantastic Westerns.\nHe lives in sunny South Florida, where he doesn't have to worry about hypothermia or snow-shoveling-induced heart attacks. He invites readers to visit his website, novelier.com.\nKeith R.A. DeCandido is a writer and editor of more than three decades' standing (though he usually does them sitting down). He is the author of more than 50 novels, more than 100 short stories, around 75 comic books, and more nonfiction than he is really willing to count. Included in those credits is fiction in the worlds of Star Trek, Alien, Farscape, Doctor Who, Andromeda, BattleTech, and many other science fiction milieus, as well as in universes of his own creation (such as the \"Precinct\" series of fantasy police procedurals, also published by the fine folks at eSpec).As an editor, he has worked with dozens of authors, among them Mike W. Barr, Alfred Bester, Margaret Wander Bonanno, Adam-Troy Castro, Peter David, Diane Duane, Harlan Ellison, Tony Isabella, Stan Lee, Tanith Lee, David Mack, David Michelinie, Andre Norton, Robert Silverberg, Dean Wesley Smith, S.P. Somtow, Harry Turtledove, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and Roger Zelazny. Having edited David Sherman's first two 18th Race books, Issue in Doubt and In All Directions, he is honored to assist him in finishing the trilogy by coauthoring To Hell and Regroup with him. Keith is also a martial artist (he got his third-degree black belt in karate in 2017), a musician (currently with the parody band Boogie Knights), and a baseball fan (having avidly followed the New York Yankees since 1976). Find out less about Keith as his cheerfully retro web site at DeCandido.net.\nChristopher L. Bennett is a lifelong resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, with a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in History from the University of Cincinnati. A fan of science and science fiction since age five, he has spent the past two decades selling original short fiction to magazines such as Analog Science Fiction and Fact (home of his \"Hub\" series of comedy adventures), BuzzyMag, and Galaxy's Edge. Since 2003, he has been one of Pocket Books' most prolific and popular authors of Star Trek tie-in fiction, including the epic Next Generation prequel The Buried Age, the Enterprise -- Rise of the Federation series, and the Original Series prequel The Captain's Oath. He has also written two Marvel Comics novels, X-Men: Watchers on the Walls and Spider-Man: Drowned in Thunder. His original novel Only Superhuman, perhaps the first hard science fiction superhero novel, was voted Library Journal's SF/Fantasy Debut of the Month for October 2012. He has three collections reprinting his original short fiction, Among the Wild Cybers: Tales Beyond the Superhuman from eSpec Books (containing an original Only Superhuman prequel novelette) and Hub Space: Tales from the Greater Galaxy and Crimes of the Hub from Mystique Press.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the books proposed in this campaign have already begun production.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!\nI am currently creating a set of printable 3D models (File format: STL).\nThis project will include a set of stackable Low Poly Animals that you will be able to pile vertically like a totem and make arrangements as you wish.\nThe Starter Pack will include:\nA Pedestal Piece,\nA Top Piece,\nThe 5 following animals : The Bear, The Fox, The Lynx, The Owl and The Wolf:\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nI am planning to play with these with my son. The goal of the game will be to try to pile the totem as high as possible without it falling of!\nAlso, for the 3D printing geeks, this is a nice way to finish the last bit of filament on a coil.\nI am motivated to create more and more of these models. I think we will be able to reach the original goal so let's get crazy and continue with some extra goals!\nThe Utility Pack will include: An Adapter/Spacer, a Suspension System and a Lamp System.\nThis will make the totem possibilities even more flexible. You will be able to pile the heads of the totem in all the cardinal directions instead of just 6 directions.\nIn addition, there will be a blank hexagonal segment (with no head on it). You will be able to paint symbols, runes or whatever you want on it.\nI will also add a version of the files with a suspension system in the back of the heads so you will be able to hang the totem on the wall as a decoration.\nPlus! There will now be a system to transform any totem head into a lamp or a night light for your kid. You will just need to print the model with a translucent material (Per example translucent PLA filament).\nPLAY\n\nStretch Goal: When we reach 200.00\u20ac = GOAL ACHIEVED!!

This is for both our past backers and new ones looking to participate in this new, exciting and unique project.  No one has ever tried to fund an original series before, and we are getting there!\nA note from the past: we have completed all the perks fulfillment possible for all our past campaigns up to this point. This represents several thousand  physical perks and many thousands of electronic ones (over 18,000). One of the most anticipated perks yet to come is the Redemption Psrts 1 and 2 DVD/Bluray combo packs (there are several different flavors of these.) These have been held up because the episodes need to be completed first. Who knew?! The great news is the first two episodes titled Redemption are nearly completed and will ship this summer! Combined they have over 1,900 visual effects. More than double any other sci-fi series out there. The campaign we are about to start is for completing the Forgiveness episodes (episodes 3 and 4), and that's where you come in. Your contribution to this upcoming campaign goes directly to the completion of the DVD/Blurays of the Forgiveness episodes. As soon as the COVID is over we will be shooting the remainder of episode 4, and the post has already been nearly completed on episode 3, so we should have episodes 3 and 4 shipped by the end of the year, if COVID allows."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Veteran Backers Special", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Get Your Star Trek Crate Now!

It features everything you need for creating high fidelity audio hardware devices. Just plug in a USB cable and start making sound! No soldering required. \nLet's teach computers how to sing!\nHere's a quick demo of where we're at today! In this video we show a generative synthesizer that was coded in C++, with a reverb send, and note trigger button. \nPLAY\n\nThe possibilities for Daisy are endless! Create ambient audio installations, sonify data from sensors, or even make an esoteric effects pedal, all with a single platform.\nAudio and MIDI\nDaisy features two channels of line level audio IO on-board, thanks to its high fidelity stereo audio codec(AKM) with up to 24-bit, 192kHz. Adding additional channels of audio is easy using standard digital audio protocols such as TDM, I2S, PDM, and S/PDIF which are broken out to the pin headers. \nThere is full support for USB MIDI IN and OUT through its onboard micro USB port and the USB pins on the header bank. It also features UART pins for connecting MIDI through 5 pin DIN, or TRS cables.\nCPU and Memory\nThe CPU is an STM32 ARM Cortex-M7 running at 480MHz, and features internal 32-bit floating point processing for optimized DSP instructions. There is 64MB of SDRAM on-board, which is enough for a 10 minute audio buffer. In addition, there is more than 8MB of flash memory for firmware, or permanent storage of audio files. \nUSB and Connectivity\nWith full OTG-support as host and device on the built-in micro USB port, along with additional pins for a second port, the Daisy can become any USB device your heart desires. Build an audio interface, MIDI controller, or sample player! On top of that, the built-in micro USB can also be used for powering, programming and debugging the Daisy.\nThere are 32 total GPIO pins which can be configured as standard GPIO or one of several alternate functions including 16-bit Analog to Digital Converters(x12), 12-bit Digital to Analog Converters(x2), SD Card interfaces, PWM outputs, and various serial protocols for connecting to external sensors and devices including SPI, UART, I2S, and I2C. \nIn addition to being powered through the onboard micro USB port, Daisy can be powered through a dedicated VIN pin on the header bank. It has an extremely wide input range of 4V to 17V and current consumption is low enough that you can even power it from a battery!\nEvaluation Platforms \nTo help you start making music immediately we've created several Daisy-Powered devices:\n Daisy Pod - Breakout Board\n Daisy Petal - Guitar Pedal\n Daisy Patch - Eurorack Module\n Daisy Field - Desktop Synthesizer\nAll four devices are available as rewards! Scroll to the Rewards section below to see product photos and details. \nExample Code\nThere will be example programs for each evaluation platform, and in each supported language. We will also be publishing full schematics and technical documents describing how the circuits work. Schematics will be released under a permissive open source license, allowing for modification, and reuse in personal and commercial projects.  \nTutorials and Learning Resources\nWe are working on video tutorials for everything from simple circuits and music theory, to DSP programming and PCB layout. We're striving to create a community of learning centered around hacking the Daisy to make fun and awesome audio projects!\nProgramming the Daisy is a breeze with support for a number of languages including Arduino, and Max/MSP Gen~. To get started, simply upload an example program over USB, and start tweaking!\nDocumentation, and examples will be hosted on our Github repository for easy download. All firmware that we develop will be released for free under a permissive open source license(MIT). Below are the languages and programming environments that will be supported:\nWe believe that music is an extremely powerful tool for teaching STEM education. Using the Daisy helps to connect the dots between various areas of learning:\nComputer Science - Using programming languages to translate a concept of a sound, into something that a computer can understand. \nTest Equipment - Using tools such as an Oscilloscope, Multimeter, and Spectrum Analyzer is helpful for verifying signal integrity, measuring voltage levels, and observing noise.\nElectrical Engineering - To connect Daisy to the outside world we need to use electrical circuits. Whether it's controlling a parameter with a knob, or running audio through speakers, we need to use wires and components to accomplish the task. \nMathematics - Generating and processing audio signals includes many types of mathematics from basic arithmetic, all the way to advanced calculus. \nHere are the rewards that we're offering when you back the Daisy!\nGet your very own \"I Teach Computers How To Sing\"bumper sticker and tell the world about your unique talent!

Over the course of the project, Daisy has seen many different forms. We have since gotten closer to our final product, and are well underway on the accompanying software.\nv1 (2017)- On the first version, the only thing we knew for sure was that we wanted to use an ARM processor, and have audio on-board. Given the limited power of the M4 processors at the time, and our lack of additional RAM, we planned for a new version with newer, more powerful technology right away.\nv2 (2018) - After about a year or so, the M7 processors began coming out, and we decided it was time to try one, alongside some 32MB of additional RAM. Despite a few hardware related issues that made troubleshooting difficult, we got most of the technologies working!\nv3 (2019) - Still undecided on a final form-factor, this is a larger-credit card sized version of the board that had both 40-pins of connectors, and on-board peripherals like SD Cards, USB, and Audio Jacks.\nv4 (2019-2020) - Well on our way to the final version, we decided that size would make this useful in many more places, and shrank everything down. The current Daisy alongside the Pod, are nearly identical to the v3, with the exception that the small form factor can be moved and embedded on even the smallest of projects.\nBut the journey from one prototype to the next wasn't always so smooth...\nSometimes, the first time you plug in a new prototype.....nothing happens, and that's worse than needing to use the fire extinguisher!\nWe are Electrosmith, a collective of musicians and makers dedicated to providing the parts, tools, and learning resources necessary for DIY music electronics. We were recently awarded \"Best Newcomer\" at NAMM 2020 (Sonic State). The products we sell range from breakout boards, to electronic components, to modular synthesizers.

In 1961 he became the first person to teach a computer how to sing when he programmed the song \"Daisy Bell\" on the IBM 7094. \nWhile a researcher at Bell Labs in the 1950s and 60s he created the family of MUSIC-N programming languages specifically designed for the creation of music. This laid the groundwork for modern audio programming environments such as Csound, Max/MSP, SuperCollider, etc. Today his legacy lives on not only through the music and instruments that he left behind, but the ones that he inspired others to create. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have learned a lot about electronics manufacturing and design with our existing products and have taken these lessons to mind when planning the Daisy project. We are currently performing pre-production small lot testing on the Daisy to ensure that the quality and reliability live up to our expectations. \n\nTo overcome potential supply chain delays we have been in talks with manufacturers and distributors from the very beginning to guarantee that we will have the right parts on hand, at the right time.\n\nIn addition, each of our products are assembled in our shop, right here in Southern California. We will be documenting each step of the manufacturing process so that you can be a part of the journey with us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe are using BGA chip packages wherever possible to guarantee the long term integrity of our solder joints. This type of package is known for being not only extremely reliable, but also being impervious to damage from the outside since there are no leads exposed.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nEvery PCB that is produced in our shop is 100% RoHS compliant. This means that the Daisy will conform to a lead free and mercury free manufacturing process.\nSustainable Distribution\nThere will be a minimal amount of packaging for the Daisy.

Since 2017, over 1000 creators have taken part so we felt it was time for us to join in with a small project offering limited editions of our extremely popular LokBuild surfaces.\nLimited Edition LokBuild, pre-sized and produced in custom colours to suit the specific printer\nLimited Edition LokBuild\nThese limited edition LokBuild surfaces are based on our original LokBuild 3D Print Build Surfaces. Since launching in 2017 LokBuild has became very popular and is now well known within the 3D printing community.\nWe will only manufacture 100 of each reward and they will be pre-sized and produced in custom colours to suit the specific printer. Each LokBuild will also feature a Limited Edition logo in silver.\nIf you are new to LokBuild, it is a great 3D printing surface for FDM 3D printers. The build surface is durable and stable, and can be easily attached to your existing print bed to help prevent model curling or warping.\nLokBuild is clean to use, long lasting and superior to other solutions such as kapton, films, tapes, sprays and adhesives.\nLokBuild is made from uniquely textured sheets that attach to your build plate easily with heat-resistant adhesive backing. You can also use LokBuild with many different types of filament without needing to change the printing surface.\nCustom fit to suit the Original Prusa MK3S\nLokBuild Features\nOptimal 3D Printing Surface\nImproves Model Adhesion\nReduces Warping\nEasier Nozzle Height Calibration\nDurable and Long Lasting\nProtect your Build Plate\nEasy Removal of Completed Prints\nOne Build Surface for most materials\nEasy to Install\n\nPrint Materials\nLokBuild works with ABS, PLA and many other filaments so you can switch between materials without the need to change the build surface between prints. When printing with PLA it is not necessary to use a heated bed so it can help save power and it is great for machines that do not feature a heated bed.\nAlthough LokBuild works well with ABS and PLA it also works with other more exotic materials. Here is a list of just some materials that have been successfully printed on LokBuild: ABS, PLA, HIPS, PET, colorFabb_XT, colorFabb nGen, colorFabb_HT, colorFabb XT-CF20 (carbon fibre), Woodfill, Bronzefill, Copperfill, Brassfill, Polymaker PC-Plus (polycarbonate), Polymaker PC-Max (polycarbonate), Polymaker PolyFlex, Ninjaflex.\nAs new materials are developed the scope of LokBuild is constantly increasing.\nLimited Edition LokBuild, pre-sized and produced in custom colours to suit the specific printer\nInstalling LokBuild\nIf you have ever used tape or films you will know that they are difficult to fit. LokBuild is more rigid and really easy to apply to your build plate. Also, it is almost impossible for air bubbles to get trapped beneath the LokBuild surface.\nFORGIVING NOZZLE HEIGHT CALIBRATION\nA common problem relating to some other similar solutions is the accuracy needed when setting the nozzle height from the bed. Too much distance and the print will peal away or warp easily. Too close and the print will be impossible to remove without damaging the print or build surface. However, LokBuild solves this problem. LokBuild is much more forgiving and does not require this level of accuracy making the calibration process much simpler and printing more enjoyable.\nTIP: When setting the nozzle height start further away from the bed than with other surfaces such as tapes. LokBuild works better without squashing the filament too much on the first layer.\nLokBuild can be fitted to flexible build plates (shown here on the Prusa MK3S)\nLimited Edition Rewards\nChoose a reward to suit your 3D printer. The Limited Edition LokBuild will be delivered pre-sized and in custom colours to suit the chosen machine.\nIf you don't see your printer listed, please send us a direct message as we might be able to add a reward for it if we get enough interest.\nReward (Main background colour)\n6\" (Black)\nEnder 2 (Black)\n8\" (Black)\nUltimaker (White)\nMakerGear (Black)\nPrusa MK3 (Orange)\nPrusa MK2 (Orange)\nEnder 3 & 5 (Black)\n12\" (Black)\nCR-10 & 10S (Black)\nLulzBot (Green)\nRaise3D (Red)\nNote that some reward sizes will fit other printers and we have listed them on the reward details when known. All LokBuild can be easily cut to suit the exact shape and size of other 3D printer build surfaces.\n\nMULTIPLE LOKBUILD\nIf you want more than one LokBuild simply multiply your pledge value by the number you would like to receive (we will contact you after the campaign to ensure you recieve the required reward).\nLimited Edition with silver LokBuild branding\nShare LokBuild with Friends\nIf you know someone who owns a 3D printer please share our campaign by clicking on the share buttons at the top of this page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have over 35 years manufacturing and design experience.

You usually get a simple but ugly plastic bin that looks like it came from a dollar store.  \nHere is what most people's litter box looks like:\nOur team is obsessed with design and cats. We just wanted a litter box that was simple, beautiful, and easy to clean. But nothing existed - so we designed one ourselves.  \nCove is a simple beautiful litter box that you don't need to hide.\nOther litter boxes are either cheap and flimsy OR huge and cost hundreds of dollars. \nCove is $99 and it's made by furniture designers - everything is high quality and we didn't skip out on any details. It's made with a thick, slightly textured, double-walled matte plastic.  It feels incredibly sturdy and is truly a beautiful object to have in your home.\nMany companies view a litter box as the equivalent to a trash can, so they put out the cheapest, ugliest product possible. We view it as something important that will be displayed in your home and we designed it using that assumption.\nOne thing we found during our research was that the litterbox tools are as important to user satisfaction as the box itself. Yet, most litterboxes include, as an afterthought, a cheap flimsy scoop that ends up just being tossed on the floor beside the box. Another common user frustration is the litter scatter caused by a cat\u2019s coming and going.\nSo we thought \u2013 why not engineer a litterbox with well-integrated tools that address the realities of maintaining a litterbox? The Cove includes a scoop, dustpan, and hand brush that fit perfectly into an accessible top compartment. \nIf your cat is an active digger or pees standing up, we have developed an add-on  that will extend the walls vertically. The add-on will be available to backers at a deep discount after our campaign ends.\nSketch of our new wall extender add-on. Photos to follow at end of campaign.\nAfter in depth user research, we discovered the most important feature of a litterbox is that it should be easy to clean. Yet many litterboxes have shapes and materials that don't align with this. Cove's shape is incredibly simple and open - there are no unnecessary bends or hard-to-get-to corners. For the material itself, we considered a variety of options, but ultimately landed on recycled plastic because it\u2019s durable and especially easy to clean.\n And Cove is the perfect size.\nThe dimensions of the box are 22\" x 16\" x 6\". The sizing will work for all except very large cats (i.e. Maine Coons or 20 pound+ cats).\nThe walls are 6\" high - this is the height our cat behaviorist recommended because it allows for all cats to get in and out safely while being able to view potential threats (very important for cats). If you need a higher wall, we are offering an optional add-on at the end of the campaign that will increase the wall height to 14\".\n Here is Cove beside a competitor litter box brand \"Giant (XL)\" and \"Large\" sizes. As you can see - the competitor's have a smaller base but slope outwards to appear larger. Cove actually holds more volume than their XL size, and our vertical walls are much better than sloping walls at preventing litter scatter from coming outside the box.\nCove's vertical walls are much better at preventing litter scatter than sloping walls.\nUpdate: if we hit 250k, we will be launching a \"Giant\" size for 20 pound + cats (and larger spaces). The standard cove is equivalent to most \"large\" litter boxes you will find in pet stores - so for most cats, our standard size is perfect.\n Fancy litter box designers want to replace the scoop, but doing so introduces new complications. So we decided to make scooping faster. Our scoop is sturdy, and engineered with angled slots to make litter sifting as fast and minimal as possible. The handle and grip feel great in your hands, and it all slides easily back into the box for safe keeping.\nThe last thing we want to do is create more plastic waste - so we're using recycled plastic to make Cove - it is completely toxin-free so it\u2019s good for our planet and our pets.\n Our design is made to be durable and long lasting. We chose plastic because it's easy to clean and lasts forever. It lasts so long, in fact, that we're using recycled plastics to build our litterbox. This is the only litterbox you'll ever need to purchase.\nBeing environmentally friendly is one of our core values. We're constantly working to create better designs that will last longer and have less impact by using eco-friendly materials. We participate in a carbon offset program where 100% of our emissions caused by transporting the product are offset by planting trees.\nWe've partnered with over 50 shelters across the US - if you ever need to get rid of your litter box, we'll happily pay to ship it to a shelter in need.  \n We\u2019re obsessed with cats and we feel we\u2019re the perfect team to launch this product. Over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve developed countless iterations with constant improvements \u2013 we\u2019ve explored a ton of options. Now we have the final product ready to go and we believe it\u2019s the most beautiful litterbox in the world. \nIf we're lucky enough to hit our stretch goal of 100k, we'll release 3 new colors: Sand, Seawash, and Salmon AND we'll offer an add-on shroud that can easily be added to Cove to extend the walls higher. If we hit our super stretch goal, we'll make a black Cove from 100% recycled ocean plastics AND we'll offer a GIANT version of Cove for those with larger cats (20 pounds +)\n Shroud add-on: design to be voted on next week by backers.\n We need your help Kickstarter \u2013 large scale production runs require us to pay for expensive tooling up front.

There are some subtleties we've needed to figure out in order to flat pack it which will greatly reduce shipping costs (i.e. will reduce overall cost we need to charge backers). We've been delaying sending out the survey until these details are finished so that we can charge the lowest possible cost for existing backers to add this item, and we can't do that until we know our costs.

All thanks to the previous Kickstarters and our pledge partners helping to keep CEREBUS going and in print!\nThat means we\u2019re getting closer to having the complete series digitally remastered, recreated, and restored for modern printing methods using high resolution scanning of the original artwork and negatives. But we\u2019re not quite there yet and still need your help!\nAre we able to keep going? It\u2019s definitely an interesting question. Everyone is trying to do much more with a lot less, and that includes trying to keep CEREBUS alive, despite the odds. The printings of the last few remastered trade paperbacks have been essentially at cost, which means this continues to be a fan funded \u2013 fan led enterprise. So to everyone who has previously contributed, THANK YOU! Anytime you see one of the beautifully and expertly remastered trades, full of rich and lavish detail never seen before, know that it happened because of your support, and that we\u2019ve only been able to keep going thanks to you!\nIn keeping with the last few Kickstarters, we\u2019re continuing to keep things As Simple As Possible with a VERY streamlined campaign, offering  1 - 4 portfolios of CEREBUS ARCHIVE NUMBER EIGHT: high quality prints of the 10 earliest pages in the CEREBUS ARCHIVE for WOMEN, signed and numbered on the front cover with an option for personalization, plus 4 pages of notes exclusive for this project by Dave Sim, for $100 US plus shipping (Diamond editions of CAN #1-5 are available to order from Diamond through your LCS). \nFeel free to post your comments and questions in the comments section!

He sees himself as perceiving prostitution accurately and society rationalizing its own MISperception of prostitution.  And I see the reverse, society appropriately revolted by prostitution and him rationalizing his addiction to it.\"\nREAD THE REST OF THIS COMMENTARY BY DAVE SIM IN THE NOTES WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITH EACH CEREBUS ARCHIVE NUMBER EIGHT PORTFOLIO!\nPLATE 2  issue 163 page 8, PLATE 10 issue 164 page 8\n\"To Astoria, she's just being informative.

All of my peers -- with a handful of notable exceptions -- convinced that my dissent from feminism wasn't a reasoned, fact-based worldview with which they disagreed.  It was something to freak out about both individually and to portray, publicly, as a toxic and pathological societal contagion.  It was something which required not only ignoring Dave Sim and ignoring what Dave Sim was saying.  It was something which required making Dave Sim, to whatever extent it was possible, cease to exist. As if the fact of my existence and the enunciation of my views was the core societal problem rather than the self-evident foundational flaws in feminism itself. And the complete unwillingness of feminists -- male and female -- to either address or acknowledge those flaws...\n...The value of Kipling, generally, and this poem, specifically, is to (if possible) mitigate and (if possible) completely prevent -- through literary inspiration alone -- anything less than an optimal situational outcome. The intent is the inculcation of excellence for those not in possession of it and the reinforcement of excellence within those who are. But, what's the bottom line on Kipling in our degraded feminist age? Imperialist! Racist! Colonialist! Oppressor! Through the application of feminism's absolutist inversions, Kipling as the embodiment of the champion of excellence is rendered, instead, as the living antithesis of excellence.

In 2016, we did our first Kickstarter campaign and found that many people were interested in improving the quality of their 3D prints. 310 backers with CA$41,747 helped us bring our project to life.  Since then the PrintDry products have found over 20,000 users in over 50 countries.  We are really grateful to all our backers.\nIn the past 3 years, our research and development efforts haven't stopped and we always want to offer the best solution to the 3D printing community. After launching the filament storage container and a vacuum version . We have revisited the original dryer design and updated it into the PrintDry Filament Dryer 2.0. \nAs many of us know from experience, a lot can go wrong with 3D printing. One of the most important factors is moisture buildup in the filament, which is a simple but often hard to identify issue that continues to plague many printing jobs.  If a quality print is desired, you can\u2019t ignore it.  \nNow, we would like to introduce our new product called the PrintDry Filament Dryer 2.0 which has many new features, such as large spool compatibility, a built-in timer, a digital display, and a modular design.  The PrintDry Filament Dryer 2.0 is the only dryer that can dry and feed large (2-5kg) filament spools with a 300mm (12\u201d) outside diameter (OD) .  It\u2019s the ultimate filament dryer you need for quality 3D printing!\n\n\nDigital Display\nPLAY\n\nEasily adjust the temperature with 5 presets (35\u00baC, 45\u00baC, 55\u00baC, 65\u00baC, and 75\u00baC).\nBuilt-in timer with a maximum time of 48 hours.\n Vertical Mounting \n Spool Adapter included\n2 metal shafts\n4 big spool adapters\n4 small spool adapters\nAccessories\n\n\nComparison\n\n\nShipping Contents\none dryer+ one vacuum container+ one pump\nOne dryer includes: 2 metal shafts; 4 big spool adapters; 4 small spool adapters\nReward Tiers\n\nTimeline\nInternational backer\nThe PrintDry filament dryer 2.0 will be shipped worldwide!

After making a modified version for many clients, I decided to make it an official version to help more people who have this requirement.\nWhat is my project?\nThis 3 axis gyroscope is perfect for FPV head tracking, robotics, movement control and more... It allows you to track the movement of the head or arm and convert it in analog signals outputs, exactly like a potentiometer. Like other versions of the mhpro.net's Gyroscopes, it can be configured as normal or reverse action mode. For Do It Yourself (DIY) home project lover who dreams of doing a movement tracking system himself. This system has been specially designed for DIY in electronics or robotics for all ages; people who want to explore electronics and want their own system, but are less comfortable with advanced programming of accelerometers. You can use one or more axes (X, Y, Z) independently. According to your needs.\nMy plan\nShortly, I want to offer a modified version of the Iota V2 with an optional board to act as  potentiometer (check the rewards section carrefully). If the campaign goes well, I want to create a new product (printed circuit board) that include all components. Obviously, I want it as tiny as possible. \nHere the presale version with piggyback optional board. Note it is only 25 mm x 25 mm of size\nHere is the theoretical final version that is 50 mm x 30 mm of size. (which may vary slightly)\nAnd now the final aspect of the board that still 50 mm by 30 mm of size\nTo be more technical\nThe gyroscope outputs analog signals: 0 to input power voltage (5-12 volts) or 0 - 3.3 volts. Your choice. And independently for each axis. When turning on, the X and Y axis will output 2,5 volts (in case of 5 volts input) and will tend to 0 volt if you rotate the gyroscope one way (-90 degree) and tend to 5 volts the other way (90 degrees). The Z axis will do the same but with +- 180 degrees of rotation.\nOther new features\nUnique connector for all wires. Easier to connect power and signals with this small pre wired connector. Included with the new version.\nI added an optional connection in case of you need a remote centering button.\n\nLimitation: The gyro outputs must be connected to the input ports of your hardware. They can not drive LEDs or others directly.\n                                              Download datasheet ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenges of this project is, of course, to produce it on time but also to do it in the smallest possible format considering that I add fixing holes so that it is easy to integrate into your project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 5 or more", "title": "Support contribution", "descp": "~$4 USD\nIt's a nice way of saying: Hey, it's a good idea!

We\u2019ll never share your data with third parties or make your use of our apps dependent on third party cloud services. So far we\u2019ve created some great apps including games, a compass, map, spirit level, QR code display and heart rate monitor (to name a few) and we have lots more to come.\nWe already have a great online community (our forum has over 35,000 posts!) and we\u2019re excited to see what apps you come up with!\nDroidScript support\nWe'll also be working with David from DroidScript to make sure that there's a nice, easy way for you to write Android phone apps in JavaScript that will talk to Bangle.js. While Bangle.js can work completely independently (and we'll have Gadgetbridge for notifications from your phone), DroidScript provides a fast, easy way to use your phone's internet connection to push data to Bangle.js in the background using the same JavaScript language.\nWho are we?\nI\u2019m Gordon Williams, the creator of Bangle.js. I\u2019m a software engineer who loves tinkering with hardware. 7 years ago I became frustrated with the steep learning curve required to create software for microcontrollers and started working on Espruino. I\u2019ve been working full-time on it since the end of the first Espruino KickStarter campaign in 2013. My work is Open Source and funded by sales of my Espruino devices and the support of the online community via Patreon.\nSince Espruino\u2019s first KickStarter campaign, I (with a bit of help from family and friends) have:\nShipped over 30,000 official Espruino devices\nDeveloped 5 further Espruino devices (including the wifi board, Pico, Puck.js, Pixl.js and the MDBT42Q breakout board)\nLaunched and successfully delivered two more KickStarter campaigns\nWritten over 11,000 forum posts\nProduced over 100 online tutorials and over 90 YouTube videos for Espruino\nFixed over 1500 GitHub issues for the Espruino project\nMade over 3700 GitHub commits in Espruino, and many more in other Espruino-related projects like the IDE.\n  Several others have provided a huge amount of help with Bangle.js: Nearform Research has done a lot of work on the AI, apps, documentation, testing and publicity for their Nodeconf EU conference, and Fanoush's work on nRF52-based smart bands was instrumental when figuring out how to replace Bangle.js's factory firmware.\nWhy Bangle.js?\nIt feels great to use things you\u2019ve made, but even if you are an experienced hardware designer it\u2019s difficult to make yourself a watch that is reliable and useful long term, let alone waterproof and affordable.There\u2019s some amazing hardware already out there, but it\u2019s usually crippled by bad software and isn't supported of upgraded.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to take a powerful, well-designed Smartwatch that already exists, completely reverse engineer it and replace all of its firmware with our Open Source software to really unlock its capabilities.\nWhy JavaScript?\nDeveloping software for embedded devices can be a real pain. You normally need wires attached to the device you\u2019re developing for, and you need to install and set up a complex toolchain. Anything more than a few lines of code can take a minute or more to compile and upload to the chip, and this applies to every change you make. Many tools don\u2019t even allow for debugging.\nBangle.js has none of those problems. The Espruino JavaScript interpreter allows you to upload code and debug wirelessly out of the box using just a Web Browser, with no need to install software on your computer.\nTensorflow Lite AI\nTensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers is built into  Bangle.js\u2019s firmware so you can run machine learning models wirelessly on your wrist! This allows you to detect gestures using the accelerometer. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous you can customise the data you collect and create or update machine learning models without even having to reboot your watch!\nSimply train and test your model on your PC with Tensorflow, then create a tflite model and upload it to your watch.\nOpen Source\nBangle.js uses the Open Source (MPLv2) Espruino JavaScript interpreter. All source code, tools and documentation are provided under an Open Source licence.\nWe\u2019re using an existing watch so we can\u2019t provide original schematics (we don\u2019t have any!), however the information we have gained from reverse engineering the watches will be made Open Source.\nWhat do you get?\nIf your reward contains a Bangle.js, you\u2019ll get a box containing:\nA Bangle.js Smartwatch\nA Magnetic USB charge cord\nGetting Started instructions\nDepending on which reward you chose, you may get other Espruino Bluetooth boards as well. These all run JavaScript, can communicate with Bangle.js, and are programmed with the Espruino Web IDE. From left to right:\n Espruino Puck.js - a small, self-contained Bluetooth button with 3 axis magnetometer\n Espruino MDBT42Q breakout board - a tiny, low power Bluetooth board that can run off a wide range of voltages and fit on a breadboard\n Espruino Pixl.js - a low power Bluetooth LCD with Arduino pinout\nMultiple Rewards?\nWant something that there isn't a reward for? You can select one reward and then pledge extra - for instance if you wanted two Bangle.js and a MDBT42 board (above), you could select the 'Hackers Edition' and pledge \u00a3117 (\u00a360 + \u00a310 + \u00a347), the cost of the Hackers edition with postage, plus a single Bangle.js.\nCurrent Status\nWe\u2019ve just purchased and programmed 400 watches for the attendees of the Nodeconf EU Conference running from 10th-13th November 2019, so we\u2019re confident in our ability to source and program the hardware. While the firmware is very capable right now (as shown in the video), there is still a lot that we\u2019re planning  to do:\nMore applications\nDocumentation, examples and tutorials\nAdding features to the firmware (pedometer, etc)\nPower usage profiling and improvements\nTesting and bug fixing\n  We\u2019re confident that we can get this done  and ship your rewards in time, as we have with our previous KickStarter campaigns. As with our other Espruino devices, Bangle.js will continue to receive software updates long after this campaign ends.\nProduction Timeline\nBecause we\u2019re using existing hardware, our timeline is a lot easier than it has been for previous products, but we\u2019re trying to set realistic deadlines with some wiggle room in case there\u2019s a delay in production at the factory.\n Now: further development of Bangle.js firmware, documentation and apps\n End of November: KickStarter finishes\n Mid December: funds clear, watches ordered, beta test watches programmed and shipped\n Early February: watches arrive\n February/March: watch programming, packing and shipping\n  THE PIXELMASTER\nThe Pixelmaster is a graphical representation of all the amazing support we receive during this KickStarter campaign. Every Bangle.js will have an \u2018About\u2019 screen built into the firmware, and everyone who buys a Bangle.js will get to choose the colour of 9 pixels on the screen from the 16 colour Mac palette:\n Backers who pledge additional support will get an extra pixel per \u00a31 pledged. But which pixels? You get to choose! Those with most pixels chose first, and if you have the same number of pixels as someone else, you get first dibs if you pledged first.\nStretch Goals\n\u00a340,000 (ACHIEVED): You can write simple code graphically right now, but if we reach this stretch goal we\u2019ll be extending our graphical editor with support for Graphics, Menus and Images. This will make it even easier to create good-looking apps without any coding knowledge.\n\u00a375,000 (ACHIEVED) : We\u2019ll add an online file system to the Espruino Web IDE so you don\u2019t need to save your apps or code you\u2019re working on to your computer. This means you\u2019ll be able to develop, access and save your apps easily from anywhere at any time.\n\u00a3100,000 (ACHIEVED) : Optimised graphics mode for games. Bangle.js already has an unbuffered 240x240x16 bit graphics mode, as well as a double-buffered 240x160x16 bit mode. With this stretch goal we'll be adding low-resolution 8 bit buffered graphics which will make it much easier to write full-colour, fast moving games (and other graphics).\nSmall Print\nWe pride ourselves on being open - not just with Open Source software, but about everything. Bangle.js is a pretty awesome piece of hardware, and is great value at this price, but there are a few things that aren\u2019t perfect. So that you\u2019re not disappointed, we think you ought to know that:\nWe\u2019re shipping from the UK - if you are not in Europe you may be liable to import taxes.\nThe touchscreen is two zone (not full touch)\nThe piezo speaker is pretty quiet\nThe heart rate monitor doesn\u2019t always read accurately when you\u2019re moving around\nWe\u2019ll be adding support for notifications from GadgetBridge on Android, but don\u2019t have any plans to support iOS.\nWeb Bluetooth works on Windows 10, Mac OS, Chromebook, Android and Linux. iOS requires a cheap paid app (WebBLE). While we have a native application for programming Bangle.js in Windows 8 and earlier, there is currently no Web Bluetooth support.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're trying hard to reduce risks as much as possible by sourcing existing hardware and then installing our software on it (this means we\u2019re not wholly reliant on the factory to source the watches). We've already purchased 400 watches and programmed them for Nodeconf EU, so we're confident in our supply chain and ability to program the watches.\n\nHowever that's not to say that things can't go wrong. In the process of getting this far we ported Espruino to 3 different watches from different manufacturers before we found a manufacturer and watch we were confident in. If everything goes seriously wrong and we have to port to another watch then we\u2019re confident that we can do that - the specs and look of the watch may change and there may be a month or two\u2019s delay but you will still receive watches that provide the same experience. This won\u2019t affect any beta-testing rewards.\n\nBrexit: This will only affect non-UK EU residents. At some point in the future it seems likely that the UK will exit the EU, and while it is likely we will only do so with a deal that allows free exchange of goods, there is a small chance that we will leave with \u2018no deal\u2019 on 31 January 2020. If this is the case, we\u2019ll foot the bill and will ensure that you get your goods without paying extra taxes.\n\nThe final issue worth mentioning is that while there is a great Espruino community, Gordon Williams is almost entirely responsible for the Bangle.js KickStarter campaign, and he and his wife are expecting a baby in mid-December! He will be taking paternity leave and working part-time over Christmas and New Year. We\u2019ve taken this into account in our timeline and believe that there\u2019s still enough time to deliver on our KickStarer commitments.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe\u2019ve deliberately chosen hardware for Bangle.js that is reliable and easy to maintain. The watch itself can be opened with 4 screws, and if the rechargeable battery fails it can be replaced. Nothing is glued shut on this device! Bangle.js is designed to function independently of other devices and services (if required), so whatever happens in the future you\u2019ll be able to turn on your Bangle.js and use it.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to long term support. The very first board we made from the first KickStarter campaign is still receiving updates 6 years later (and will benefit from the work we do on Bangle.js).

As it stands now, the procedure to swap nozzles includes, cooling the machine down, removing existing filament, and then removing the nozzle. This operation requires the use of a combination of 2 tools. The two tools are the crescent wrench to secure the heater block and the socket wrench to remove the nozzle.\nThe current removal procedure is cumbersome and can take up to 20 min. The Nozzle Removal Tool is essentially one tool in which the user will be able to remove nozzles by allowing the top housing to secure to the heater block and using the lower housing to remove the nozzle. Our goal is to turn this product into an everyday item Makers can use. This tool would reduce machine downtime and make changing nozzles safer and more accessible. Photos and illustrations below show the functionality and blueprint diagram of the apparatus.\nTechnical Information:\nThe Nozzle Removal consists of 6 components, not including the heater block, nozzle, and 1/4 inch socket.\nHeater Block Compatibility Dimensions: 48 mm (1.889 in) x 23 mm  (0.905 in) x 14 mm (0.55 in)\n Weight: 233.22 Grams (0.514 lbs)\nExpanded Length: 3.23 in (82 mm)\nCompressed Length: 2.57 in (65.27 mm)\nOverall Diameter: 1.25 in (31.75 mm)\nGripping area is composed of Material is 17-4 PH Stainless Steel.\n(shown above is an animation of the ZCatch universal tool acting on the heater block)\n(shown above is the component schematic on the left a section view of the tool is shown with the internal components and on the right side a complete picture of the apparatus) \n(The above illustration shows the dimensional compatibility of heater block within the Nozzle Removal Tool and the compact size of the tool)\n (This Video illustrates the current method, which combines a crescent wrench and socket wrench)\n  (Above video illustrates the functionality of The Universal Nozzle Removal Tool)\n CLICK HERE: 3DPRINTING.COM, 3DPRINT.COM, FABBALOO.COM\nQuality and Distribution:\nThe prototype is currently in the final stages of development. Final testing and material selection are critical before mass distribution. Additionally, we are in the process of looking into adding more functionality to our tool for future versions. A safety mechanism is being researched to prevent the user from over torque of the nozzle; this will cause damage to the heater block. Additional features such as ratcheting will allow for a more rapid removal the nozzle.\nManufacturing and distribution are a crucial aspect in the success of meeting your expectations. International Shipping costs for those is a priority. We will ensure product delivery at a reasonable price. If funding is met the distributing our product will follow our set schedule outlined below, and our goal is to grow the Nozzle Removal Tool in this direction using local machine shops as our Manufacturing supplier.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": "0 created \u00b7 0 backed"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "5$ Reward", "descp": "This is a memorable decal of our company along with our exclusive 3D printed souvenir coin.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Reward #1", "descp": "Nozzle Removal Tool with 9 PC Socket Set. & will receive a 3D printed ZCatch Coin.\nINCLUDES:\n3D Printed ZCatch Coin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["210 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Reward #2", "descp": "Nozzle Removal Tool with 9 PC Socket Set.

This is their second co-created comic after their debut creator-owned series Jupiter Jet, published in 2017 by Action Lab Comics. This graphic novel will feature art by illustrator Dez Pittman, colour art by Gehenna: Death Valley creator Becka Kinzie, and letters by Ghost Glyph Studio\u2019s Taylor Esposito, edited by Hope Nicholson (Angel Catbird, Moonshot) and will be published by the multi Eisner-nominated publisher Bedside Press (The Secret Loves of Geek Girls, Gothic Tales of Haunted Love). \n(If you're curious about Jason and Ashley's previous comic work, check out the IGN review!)\nWe successfully funded and reached our first stretch goal! Thank you! That means that not only is Science! happening, but it will be bigger and better. Check out the rewards section below to learn more about our next stretch goal!\nScience! is the story of Tamsin Kuhn Trakroo, a fourteen-year-old girl who is already the smartest Theoretical and Applied Physicist in any room. Yeah, she\u2019s that super smart! Tamsin has just started studying at The Prometheus Institute which is only the world's most famous and prestigious science school. The Institute is a futuristic wonderland filled with genius teachers (some who might not be of this world), and floating helper robots known as S.T.A.T.s.  \nOur main characters (from left to right) Tamsin, AJ, Sally, Garyn and Headmaster Laveran\nBut Tamsin is stressed, and if your dead father talked to you through your super-cool science glasses, you\u2019d be stressed out too. That's right, her father, the world-renowned Dr. Thomas Trakroo uploaded his consciousness before his death and now lives as a hologram stored in Tamsin's glasses.\nHer father claims that Lucan Laveran, headmaster of The Prometheus Institute, is his murderer, and is on a mission to destroy the Institute! But Lucan just offered Tamsin a really cool position as his assistant. He can\u2019t be a murderer, right? Can she trust her weird holographic Dad?  \nLaveran and Tamsin strolling the grounds of the Prometheus Institute.\nTamsin's really cute roommate, Garyn, is the only one that she can trust right now. However, Garyn\u2019s just discovered a dangerous energy source that could win her the Prometheus Institute Award for Superior Science, or it could tear a hole in the very space/time continuum!\nUsing all her skills, Tamsin will have to gather a group of super science friends to discover the secrets of Garyn's project. Confronting her ultimate goal: Will she destroy the school that her father claims terminated him or save it? (That's only if her rocket obsessed friend, AJ, doesn't burn it down first. )\nWill Tamsin let the pretty girl she has a crush on push the boundaries of astrophysics too far? Probably. Will she try to stop the man who her father says killed him? Maybe. In the ultimate school of science it\u2019s not your friends, your teachers, or your family that you can trust. You can only trust in SCIENCE! And it\u2019s time for Tamsin True to grow up.  \nThis comic was created when Inman had an idea for a science-adventure story in the vein of Star Trek: the Original Series, that would read like the school-based stories he and Robinson enjoyed growing up (s/o to Harry Potter!). Pittman was a last-minute addition to the team after she met Inman and Robinson at Wizard World Portland earlier in 2018 and the team clicked so well they knew they had to collaborate on something. This is a further amping up of the science fiction tropes in storytelling that Inman and Robinson began exploring in Jupiter Jet!\nBut did you know? The first 10 pages of Science! are already COMPLETE! Story, art, colors, letters and experiments are complete and ready to go! This means the story is \u215b complete and we are looking to fund the production and printing costs associated with creating the final 70 pages so that it can be a real-life book As Soon As Possible! Since this book is 100% creator-owned, there's no publisher financing. We, the creators, are responsible for all costs to make this SCIENCE! story come to life! Even our publisher, Bedside Press, isn't getting paid by this Kickstarter.\nOur goal is just enough to bridge the gap to make SCIENCE! a real physical book. With that in mind, if you\u2019ve enjoyed our previous comics work (Jupiter Jet, Captain Terrific stories in the IF Anthologies, Love is Love, The Red Shirt Diaries), please support our next step in the world of creator-owned comic books. SCIENCE! will become a reality with your support, we have some outstanding reward for you AND REMEMBER: you\u2019re only charged if we make our funding goal. As of right now, this Kickstarter is the only way you can purchase the book. So don't miss out on these amazing SCIENCE! adventures. \nNow check out some pages\u2026\nSCIENCE! - Page 4 & 5\n WHERE THE FUNDS WILL GO -  \nMoney earned will go to covering fees, production, postage, and printing of the collection. The writers aren't even being paid for this book. All Kickstarter funds are to support our artist, colorist, letterer and more! Any leftover money will be used to pay for new artwork that will be used in the series...maybe some back-ups by other creators? A variant cover? All money will go back into the book, period. The first goal of this campaign is to give our readers a high-quality product. \n Look, more art!  \nSTRETCH GOALS! Because our graphic novel is fully funded, we can add stretch goals! \n17k REACHED - Every backer at the $15 dollar level and up gets the digital download for the full graphic novel of Science!  Plus because we value and love our artist, Dez Pittman, we're going to pay her a higher page rate because she's worth it!\n20K REACHED - Every backer at the $18 dollar level and up with receive an official PROMETHEUS INSTITUTE ID Card! Show it off to your friends and use it to access the Science! Cafeteria. \nIf we hit 22K - we're going to add 10 pages to the story! So instead of 80 pages of SCIENCE adventures, you're going top get 90! More splash pages, more great moments and possibly some more robot diagrams.  \n THE GRAPHIC NOVEL! You can get SCIENCE! in both digital and physical softcover formats, with full color pages stuffed with gripping science adventures and facts for you to enjoy! All physical copies with come with signed bookplates. You slap them on the inside of your book and by the transitive property you got a signed book!\n EXCLUSIVE PRINTS!

We've thought about this and have decided to release the following shields during this campaign.\nUNLOCKED\nProto Shield - \u00a31\nPico Proto Shield\nThe proto shield is a compact prototyping board that stacks on top of the Pico and can be used to add custom circuitry to it.\nLED Matrix Shield - \u00a33\nA tiny shield that contains 24 (3x8) green 0603 LEDs that can be used to create patterns.\nLED Matrix Shield\nIt has 3 LED columns, each containing 8 rows of LEDs. Two 74HC595 shift registers are used to address the LEDs. One shift register is responsible for activating the rows, while the other activates the columns.\nD1 Mini Adapter - \u00a33\nA shield that lets you use the Pico with existing D1 Mini shields. At least 50 of these will have to be ordered or else we will not be able to manufacture these.\nD1 Mini Adapter Shield (design in progress)\nIt features a 3.3V linear regulator to power the shields and also contains 10 3.3/5V bi-directional level translators for interfacing. The analog line has not been level translated.\nLOCKED\nLiPo Shield & microSD Shield - \u00a37,000\nDC Motor Shield & Accelerometer Shield - \u00a39,000\n***The D1 mini adapter makes the Pico compatible with existing D1 mini shields. It consists of an onboard 3.3V regulator and 10 5V-3.3V bidirectional level translators allowing you to safely operate the shields. The analog pin (A0) has not been translated. This is a perfect solution if you already own the D1 mini shields. Here's a link to the D1 mini shield wiki for reference:\nhttps://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1_mini_shields\nHOW TO ORDER SHIELDS?\nPlease read the multi-pledge section below and get in touch with us to add shields to your existing pledge. Each shield is considered to be a single board for shiping purposes. If you've ordered 4 or more boards (Picos + Nanos + Shields), then you will qualify for combined shipping as mentioned in the shipping section below.\nMany of our backers have expressed interest in obtaining multiple boards. If you would like to do the same, then simply follow the steps below or get in touch with us directly - either through a private message or email (team@piksey.com).\nHere's what you need to do if you want to get more boards (pledge multiple times):\nSelect the suitable reward and pledge the corresponding amount which covers the total amount for the boards + shipping.\nSend us a message or email (team@piksey.com) and mention the number of boards you would like along with your pledge amount. We will check to make sure everything is correct and will give you a written confirmation. We will also make a note of this and adjust the available rewards accordingly.\nMany of you have already sent us a message/email and if you have received a response from us, then you do not need to do anything further.\nWe will also get in touch with all backers to confirm their pledge towards the end of the campaign. This will allow any final tweaks/modifications. \nThe new rewards do not include shipping charges, so please read the following and determine the applicable shipping amount or leave a comment if you need assistance.\n1. Count the total number of boards you would like to order.\n2. For 1-3 boards, shipping is \u00a31 for UK and \u00a34 for all other destinations.\n3. For 4 or more boards, shipping is \u00a32 for UK and \u00a36 for all other destinations.\n4. Please add the shipping amount to your pledge.\nWe will also get in touch with you closer to the end of the campaign to confirm your pledge.\nPiksey Pico\nPiksey Nano\nArduino Nano vs Piksey Pico & Nano\nComparison with a standard glass bottle crown (cap)\nThe Piksey Pico is really tiny compared to several other boards including the Raspberry Pi Zero and the Arduino Uno - which have been used for reference. \nComparison with popular boards and modules\nThere's no point in having a compact board with only a handful of I/O pins as that severely limits the capabilities and projects that it can be used in.\nThat's why the Piksey Pico and Nano have several user-accessible pins making them compatible with your existing Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano sketches.\nPiksey Pico - Pinout Top\nPiksey Pico - Pinout Bottom\nPiksey Nano - Pinout\nBattery operated GPS tracker with OLED display\nTemperature monitor with OLED display\n6 RGB LED strip using 1 data line\nWe at BitsNBlobs Electronics (BnBe), believe that the best way to learn electronics is to start working on projects.

We've already successfully tested the pre-production prototype as can be seen in the promotional video.\n\nWe will have one final iteration of the board which will incorporate any feedback that will be obtained through this campaign.

We've been shooting background footage with the plaintiffs for the past two years at home and in the courts. WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT NOW so we can document this fast-approaching history-making trial.\nOur Story\nYOUTH v GOV is the story of America\u2019s youth taking on the world\u2019s most powerful government. In 2015, 21 young plaintiffs, ages 8 to 19, filed suit against the U.S. government asserting a willful violation of their constitutional rights. YOUTH v GOV follows this legal battle as the government takes extraordinary measures to get the case dismissed. Legal experts call this case the \u201cmost important lawsuit on the planet,\" but it's more than just a legal battle.\nThe heart of this film lies in the young plaintiffs\u2019 personal stories as they find their footing as leaders and come to know their power as citizens in our democracy. YOUTH v GOV highlights and explores youth activism, government responsibility, our constitutional rights, and the importance of citizen democracy. It\u2019s about the hope and action that our youngest generation is bringing to the forefront as they realize the power in their experiences and voices. Their story will resonate with audiences of all ages with the unexpected result that we will all be learning from our youngest how to be active, engaged democratic citizens once again.\nOur Heroes\nThe 21 plaintiffs of Juliana v United State of America represent of a diverse sample of our American youth impacted by the climate crisis. They hail from 10 states, including Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Louisiana, and New York. They are activists, artists, musicians, and farmers. And they are each facing the effects of the climate crisis in their own unique ways. Here are a few of these brave youth...   \nKelsey Juliana is the named plaintiff on this landmark case: Juliana v the United States of America. No pressure. Kelsey is used to epic battles. She comes from a family of environmental activists who staunchly protected Pacific Northwest old-growth forests. But this is not her parents\u2019 fight \u2013 Kelsey launched this lawsuit on her own.\nKelsey, 21 - Eugene, Oregon\nLevi, 11, lives at the heart of climate change impacts on a barrier island in Florida. The sea turtles that Levi loves to watch are in decline, he can no longer swim in the sea due to toxins and bacteria, and sea level rise threatens to displace his family.\nLevi, 11, Indialantic, Florida\nThrough music and dance, Xiuhtezcatl Martinez empowers youth across the world to take part in environmental justice. His speeches at the UN and other notable venues have brought attention to the strength of the youth voice and their right to a sustainable future. Xiuhtezcatl\u2019s deep roots in the Aztec culture are an important part of his identity and his spiritual connection to the Earth.\nXiuhtezcatl, 18 - Boulder, Colorado\nJayden, 14, lives in a Louisiana community in the heart of the oil industry. As she works with her mother to resist the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, vast swaths of marshland continue to be devastated by tens of thousands of miles of oil pipelines. In 2016, her home flooded and as she said, \u201cThis morning I stepped out of my bed, and right into climate change.\u201d\nJayden, 14 - Rayne, Louisiana\nThe legal team and plaintiffs have given us exclusive access to tell their story and Director Christi Cooper has worked with many of the plaintiffs since 2011, earning the trust of not only the youth and their families, but also the legal team. This is not just a lawsuit or a documentary, but also an extended family that reaches across the country.\nLead Counsel Julia Olsen with some of the plaintiffs\nOur Motivation \nClimate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century. It is causing the displacement of millions of people worldwide and climate-induced food insecurity fuels more conflicts every day. Not only is our youngest generation most vulnerable, they will be disproportionately affected, especially those from disenfranchised and underrepresented communities. But this is not the typical climate change warning film. \nYOUTH v GOV is about the hope the youngest generation brings and the power of their voice. Throughout history, some of the most meaningful social changes were sparked by the actions of young people - from children coal miners in the early 1900\u2019s to the civil rights movement in the 1960's. Youth are once again rising up and demanding change, from gun reform to climate justice. \nOur Audience & Impact\nYOUTH v GOV is aimed at empowering more young citizens to take action. We want this film and movement to reach as many youth across the country as possible and you can join us with your support. \nYOUTH v GOV will speak not only to the adults in the room, but also to the over 70 million young people in the US under 18, who will be this nation\u2019s future leaders and primary voting population. We plan to screen YOUTH v GOV at film festivals, in theaters, and through a video-on-demand and/or broadcast platform to reach as many viewers as possible.\nThrough our community screenings and workshops, we will bring the film to youth-centered events, to the plaintiffs\u2019 hometowns, and to disenfranchised communities disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. These community screenings will provide our most important viewers with information to take actions, as well as opportunities for trainings, connections, and participation in direct local action.\nAt the Environmental Youth Forum/DOCLands Film Festival, 2018\nWe are already leading climate justice workshops with youth around the country using existing YOUTH v GOV footage. We will be working with non-profit and social justice partners, such as Rock the Vote, to create as much on-the-ground impact as possible with YOUTH v GOV.\nOur Budget \nOur budget includes four years (2016-2019) of documentary production to cover the plaintiff\u2019s stories from filing the lawsuit, through the full trial starting October 29, 2019, up to post-trial interviews with the plaintiffs and key witnesses in early 2019. The budget also includes plus post-production taking place from Fall 2018 to Fall 2019.\nOur minimum raise for this Kickstarter of $30,000 is set to get us to the trial only, and is just a small fraction of our full film budget. We are hoping to raise much more than that during this crowdfund and you can help us reach our stretch goals by sharing the project widely. \nWe believe in the power of grassroots organizing and that every voice matters. That\u2019s why your pledged support is appreciated and valuable whether you can contribute $5 or $1,000. We want to gather and inspire as many engaged supporters as possible for YOUTH v GOV and the stories of these incredible youth. \n*Note on Carbon-Friendly Filmmaking: Because we care deeply about the climate crisis and are cognizant of our impacts while filmmaking, we prefer to work with a small production crew to reduce costs and our carbon footprint. We are always actively working to find a balance between nimble, efficient, low-carbon production, while also making sure we cover key events to properly tell this story. We are also seeking additional funders to cover the cost of a full carbon offset for the production.\nOur Film Team\nWhy YOU Should Join Us! \nYOUTH v GOV is an opportunity for you to support a positive story about the good guys. This is a story that will have real impact on the ground for the younger generations who are inheriting our mess.\nContributing to YOUTH v GOV is about more than giving money. It\u2019s about participating and taking action. It\u2019s about supporting our youth and supporting those most affected by the climate crisis. And it\u2019s about standing up for our constitutional rights.\nCome be a part of our extended family, and join us in doing our part for climate justice. YOUTH v GOV has become about so much more than a documentary; and the lawsuit is about so much more than a legal battle. Our future is a constitutional right. \nYou can also follow us online via: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And sign up for our mailing list! We are also looking for ambassadors to help spread the word about this project. Please let us know if you\u2019re interested! \nOur Kickstarter Rewards \nWe\u2019ve actively tried to balance our desire to thank you for your pledge with a reward, while also seeking to limit our carbon footprint on this project. The Kickstarter reward we\u2019re mailing to every supporter who contributes $25 or more is a pocket copy of the United States Constitution. Our constitutional rights are at the heart of this film and paramount to every citizen. We want you all to have a copy in your pocket! \nWe're also grateful to so many of the YOUTH v GOV plaintiffs who have offered to share their music, writing, and artwork with us so that we may offer it you as a Kickstarter reward. We are in awe every day at the talent, passion, and generosity of these youth. Please support these plaintiffs' creative passion and artworks by joining us at YOUTH v GOV FILM.\nIn the end, the greatest reward of YOUTH v GOV is the empowerment of these youth as they seek support for a national climate recovery plan based on the best available science.\nLast, But Not Least... \nTHANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND THESE INCREDIBLE YOUTH! \nPhotos courtesy of Robin Loznak. \nSpecial thanks to Andrew Tumason with Woven Talon for generously allowing us to use his music for our Kickstarter campaign.

Forget diplomacy\u2014humanity\u2019s presence in space is focused solely on seizing exoplants and extracting their resources. The ships of the Coalition are interstellar company towns, run by indifferent AIs and designed to keep their crews in constant debt. Inequality is rampant\u2014if you\u2019re wearing a red crew shirt, life sucks: you\u2019re overworked in hazardous conditions while under constant surveillance and living on top of one another. And you have to pay for your own health care. And the whole time, the smirking officers are telling you the only reason you\u2019re not enjoying the good life is because you\u2019ve chosen to stay poor. So, nothing at all like the world today.\nAfter surviving fifteen years in a red shirt, Webb is nearly burned out. She joined up like any starry-eyed kid did: to get her own ship. But that\u2019s never going to happen\u2014not now that the officers loathe her for being the crew\u2019s elected (and powerless) representative, even as she\u2019s trying to break out of the enlisted ranks herself. But rank has little to do with leadership, and hers will be put to the test when the starship Independence collides saucer-first with with a threat they\u2019re completely unprepared for: aliens that don\u2019t look like us.* When the ship\u2019s social order breaks down from a truly alien threat, it\u2019s falls to Webb to save the crew, the ship\u2014and herself.\n*You can have sex with most aliens.

It\u2019s the first colony established since KLARA was retired almost 40 years ago but It\u2019s not an officially sanctioned colony. As the colony grows and becomes more comfortable, they send out a team to explore their new home world. What they find is more than unexpected. This story is illustrated by John Le and 5 pages of preview art can be seen below.\nStory 2 - The story of Nella, the young mother from Issue 1. This is what happened to her between being rescued from Edoran and her being found living on the outskirts of P\u2019Baali with her baby.\nStory 3 - Sori Val is a Tromi Veri woman seeking revenge for the death of her husband and child who died due to faulty life support equipment in their settlement. Sori spends the next two years in mourning before experiencing a revengeful awakening. She tracks down the manufacturer of the equipment and then goes after the CEO of the company whom she now holds responsible for their death. Her \"death trip\" takes to her Kui-Xing to confront none other than Garrett, the man Jamitch would kill for his own personal revenge in issue 1.\nStory 4 - A woman who works on a merchant vessel falls in love with a colonial settler. Their love is forbidden and must be kept secret. As we learned from issue 2, deserting your colony will result in death and maybe a run in with Varlo Das. They hatch and enact a plan to smuggle the man off world with the goal of making a home for themselves on the outpost world of Edoran. Will the couple succeed or simply become another paycheque for Varlo Das?\nStory 5 - Archaeologists travel to the barrens of Kui-Xing. They are looking for the remnants of the original generation ships that brought humans from earth. It's been centuries since they arrived on Kui-Xing and records of the ships landing landing locations are non-existent. What they find will rewrite human history in Cayrels Ring. \nStory 6 -  Manda Pery lost her baby during childbirth under mysterious circumstances. Pery and her husband were not allowed to see their deceased child, he was simply gone. More than a decade later she meets another woman with an eerily similar story. This leads her on the hunt for other women who experienced the same loss.

Could you survive? Maybe. But could you, acting alone and stranded at any point period in Earth's history, reinvent our modern world from scratch? Probably not.\nNot unless you took this book and bandana back in time with you, that is.\nLook how pretty!\nOver the course of the past few years, I've collected all the science, engineering, mathematics, art, music, philosophy, facts, and figures you'd need for even the most clueless time traveler to build a civilization from the ground up, and I've put it all into this book / extremely fashionable accessory. Your new world will be one in which humanity matured quickly and efficiently, instead of doing what we did (which, to be specific, was spending 200,000 years stumbling around without language, thinking disease was caused by weird smells, and living completely oblivious to the fact that tying a rock to a string would unlock navigating the entire world). It's a deeply researched guide and ridiculously funny history of the key technologies and innovations that made each stage of human civilization possible (from writing and farming to buttons and birth control), and it will make you smarter, more competent, and completely prepared to thrive \u2013 at any point in history.\nAnd if you don't have room for a whole book in your temporal carry-on, you can still carry the highlights with your new attractively-designed and information-dense time travel bandana - enough to create a technological civilization from first principles. It's chock full of civilization-building information that's great to keep around in your back pocket...or wrapped around the top of your head. \nAnd if you want some beautiful art to show off the time periods you'll visit... keep reading for the postcard stretch goal. :)\nTell me about this book.\nHappy to! It measures 6x9, and it's a really attractive hardcover, and inside are 464 pages of text and pictures, illustrated by the amazing Lucy Bellwood. The premise of the book is just like in the video above: in the future time travel is being practiced routinely, and this is a guide meant for the passengers in those time machines - in this case the FC3000\u2122 - to consult should anything go wrong. It's a time machine repair guide, but then it turns out time machines are the most complicated machines humans have ever made, and there's no user serviceable parts inside, and it's actually easier to explain how to rebuild civilization from scratch in any period of Earth's history! So that's what this book does, promising that instead of going back to the future... you can now bring the future back to you.\nHere's the table of contents, showing off the sort of things you can find in this book!\nThis is a non-fiction work of popular science wrapped in a delightful fictional candy coating.\nAll the information in the book is real, and despite the fact that time travel isn't real (YET?? SO FAR AS WE KNOW??), it is a sincere, honest, funny, and deeply-researched attempt to prepare you for the eventuality of being stranded in the past.\nThe time-travel conceit keeps things light, and lets me work in lots of jokes so that the book isn't a dry list of facts and figures: instead it's as exciting - and funny - as a really good time travel novel. Imagine if the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was real, but focused entirely on time travel - it might look something like this. The book begins with a flowchart that lets you determine what period in history you're stranded in, all the way back to the Big Bang. In the middle, the book does things like explain how to forge iron while also reinventing art and philosophy. By the end, you are actually for-real prepared to rebuild civilization, all on your own.\nHere's what some people are saying about advance copies I gave them!\n\"A dazzling piece of work that's also genuinely hilarious.\" - Elan Mastai: All Our Wrong Todays\n\"Such a cool book. It's essential reading for anyone who needs to duplicate an industrial civilization quickly\" - Randall Munroe: xkcd, What If?\n\"Technically, we are all time travelers and we are all trapped. So, even if you happen to be scanning this blurb in what you perceive to be a 'normal' timeline, I heartily recommend you read this book cover to cover.\" - Zach Weinersmith: Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, Soonish\n\"A witty pop science guide intended for those demanding times when one needs to create a civilization from scratch... a fun, thoughtful, and thoroughly accessible reference for curious readers, students, and world-builders, as well as wayward time travelers.\" - Publisher's Weekly (starred review!)\n\"Packed with cool, fun, and useful stuff... a friendly and thought-provoking reference, just the thing for the bright kid in the family, to say nothing of the neighborhood time traveler.\" - Kirkus Reviews\nOkay, now tell me about this bandana!\nThe book is inspired by a shirt I designed back in 2012 - after finishing the shirt, I still hadn't scratched that itch, and began to wonder if you really could condense all of civilization down to 450 or so pages. So I started researching. And once I'd written the book, I thought, wouldn't it be nice to take this full circle and bring this back to textiles with a Temporal Survival Bandana? The bandana itself is 22 inches square has more information than the shirt did - including instructions on how to use the bandana itself to invent other technologies like the water filter, the bandage, and the sexy adult handcuff! And if you do ever find yourself stranded in the past, it will be the single most valuable - and most dangerous - piece of fabric in human history.\nYou can get one exclusively with this Kickstarter!\nThat shape in the middle is the template for building a unit cube - whose weight, when filled with water, will be the basis of the measurements you need to build the other technologies explained on the bandana, up to and including telescopes, microscopes, smelters, electrical generators, and penicillin. At the top there's instructions for testing if unknown foods are safe to eat - a useful thing to know if you're stranded before the invention of domestication. Those pictures you see in the at the bottom are ways to transform the rotational motion of a water wheel into more useful motions, like the up-down motion of a hammer or the back-and-forth motion of a saw. Seems pretty straightforward, but it still took humans thousands of years to figure this stuff out!!\nOr rather, it DID take us that long, until you and your brilliant bandana showed up in the past.\nWhy are the bandana and book together?\nWell, here's the thing. This book is already being printed, and it'll be available in bookstores on September 18th... but these days most book orders happen online. That's great, but it would be MORE great if you could support independent booksellers! That's where this Kickstarter comes in: all the books ordered through this Kickstarter will be funneled through indie bookstores.\nBy buying the book through this Kickstarter, you not only get the exact same book you'd get from a giant online bookstore, but you also get it signed by the author (that's me!), PLUS you get the time traveler's bandana, PLUS the stretch goals we unlock (see below) - all for the same price you'd pay at retail. It'll be shipped direct to your door on the release day, and you'll get to feel good about supporting cool indie bookstores like:\nThe Strand in NY\nBookPeople in Texas\nWatermark Books & Cafe in Kansas\nTattered Cover Book Store in Denver\nJoseph-Beth Booksellers in Ohio\nVroman's Bookstore in California\nThe Beguiling in Toronto, Canada\nIt's thanks to these amazing booksellers that we can offer the book at a price low enough to give you all these exclusive goodies on top!\nCan we use stretch goals to make this Kickstarter even more awesome?\nWell heck, why not! Here's what I've got planned: every threshold we unlock will result in a new update, in which I (RYAN) will get stranded, Carmen Sandiego / Where's Waldo style, in a different period in time. While I'm there I'll source a postcard showing off that time, and everyone who backs will get one of each. These are actual postcards, suitable to send in the mail to your pals and say \"wish you were here\", only instead of promoting boring old places in the present, they're encouraging temporal tourism at various highlights in Earth's past. They'll be drawn by a variety of super awesome artists!  We'll unlock more soon as we fund!\n$10,000 = UNLOCKED: 1492 CE, with art by Alex Thomas!\n$20,000 = UNLOCKED: 1912 CE, with art by Bill Mudron!\n$30,000 = UNLOCKED: 2041 CE, with art by Anthony Clark!\n $40,000 = UNLOCKED: 650 BCE, with art by Shelli Paroline and Braden Lamb!\n$50,000 = UNLOCKED: 65,000 BCE, with art by John Allison!\n$60,000 = UNLOCKED: a postcard by David Malki!\n$70,000 AND $80,000 = UNLOCKED: a Chrononaut's Choice time travel pamphlet giving you a curated adventure in time, going to everyone at the book tier or above!\n$90,000 = UNLOCKED: a postcard by Rahzzah!\n$100,000 = UNLOCKED: an excerpt from the book!\n$150,000 = UNLOCKED: a postcard by David Hellman!\n$200,000 = one last postcard from Ben Hatke!! That's NINE POSTCARDS in total going to everyone who's getting anything physical!\nThe back of each postcard has an exclusive temporal survival tip tailored to each specific time period. They're going to be AWESOME.\nSo now with you're not just getting the signed book and bandana: you're also getting temporal tourism postcards, and as the Kickstarter continues, more and more cards will get added to that pack.\nWhat tiers do we have?\nWe've kept it pretty simple: there's a tier to get the postcards ($10), a tier to get the postcards and bandana ($20), and a really attractive tier that gets you the postcards, the bandana, and a SIGNED copy of the book all for $27 - the same price an unsigned book alone costs in a store! After that there's some tiers for those who want more than one book (you can get two or three), and finally a single-edition $1000 tier in which I hand-build you a time travel survival kit - which includes the book, bandana, and postcards too, of course.\nEach tier has a US and Canadian edition - besides the countries they're shipping to, they're otherwise identical.  That's right, Canadians: by teaming up with The Beguiling, we've managed to keep shipping costs identical!  Plus, the books will ship out of Toronto, so you don't need to worry about any customs costs at the border.  THIS WAS A LOT OF WORK BUT IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME. <3\nNOTE: the last time I did a Kickstarter with signed books was for To Be or Not To Be, and there I ended up signing 15,000 books in five days, during which I accidentally broke the world record for most books signed in a single day in the process. I have only gotten better at signing my own name since then.\nThis sounds great, but who are you and what else have you done?\nHi, I'm Ryan North! You may know me as the author of Dinosaur Comics, or The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl for Marvel Comics, or from my illustrated choosable-path adventure books like William Shakespeare Punches A Friggin' Shark and/or To Be or Not To Be - both of which were launched here on Kickstarter (and To Be or Not To Be became the most-funded publishing project ever on Kickstarter at the time!) I've also done writing for Bungie and once got stuck in a hole with my dog. You can read more about me here to assure yourself that I'm not one of those fly-by-night science writers!\nI want to ship outside the US and Canada - can I back this Kickstarter?\nUnfortunately we can't ship these books everywhere - the numbers simply don't work out (and also there's weird legal issues, since book rights are different in different countries). If you're outside the US and Canada, you may want to wait until the book comes out for real in your region - translated versions will shortly be available in:\nRussia\nPoland\nChina\nKorea\n...and MORE??\nAnd if you're in the UK - great news: the book is already available for pre-order there! \nThank you! <3\nI'm really excited to soon be able to share this book with you - it's the longest book project I've ever worked on! - and I really think it's the best, too. Hopefully what I've said in this Kickstarter intrigues you! Drop me a line if you've got any questions, and if you choose to back this campaign, thank you! I really think you'll have a good... time.\n(sorry about the pun, no regrets)\n(Oh also!

The bandana design is ready to go, and we've got a printer who can turn an order around in 15 days, which gives us plenty of time to get them - and the books - shipped to Make That Thing, who I've partnered with to help fulfill this project. I'll visit their warehouse to sign all the books for you, we'll put them in envelopes, and then we'll ship them off your homes. \n\nAll books are being shipped to a single warehouse, which will make things simpler. I've run two successfully completed Kickstarters in the past, and I feel really confident about this one, since unlike the others, the book is already being printed! That's how come we can ship so quickly after the campaign closes.\n\nThe main risk is unexpected shipping delays causing the book to arrive in some places after its release date on the 18th of September, but we're going to do all in our power to prevent that: we want you to read this book as soon as possible!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "USA: Just postcards", "descp": "You'll get a pack of all the temporal postcards we unlock, advertising different periods in time, each featuring art from a new artist: the better the campaign goes, the more there will be in the pack!

So close in fact, that to create the Tachyon I needed to make only a few minor tweaks to the Neutrino's layout to get the new chip to work with it!\nSpecifically, the values of two capacitors were changed, and one pin, which the Zero broke out for an RX LED, but which was not broken out on the Neutrino, was re-purposed for the chip's internal switching regulator.\nAnd, to enable you to make use of this switching regulator for low-power applications, I've added pads to the underside of the board where you can optionally mount the required 10uH inductor.\nFinally, because the SAMD51 is so similar to the SAMD21, most libraries written for the Zero should work on the Tachyon without modification!\nThe Tachyon - Front\nOpen Hardware\nLike all my Kickstarter projects, the Tachyon is open source! And like my other Kickstarter campaigns, once the campaign is successfully funded, I'll provide you with the Eagle cad files and schematics which you're free to modify as you wish and integrate it into your own designs, without ever paying royalties or licensing fees!\nTachyon PCB\nTechnical Specs\nMicrocontroller: Microchip ATSAMD51G18A ARM Cortex M4F\nClock speed: 120 MHz\nOperating voltage: 3.3V\nI/O pin limits: 3.3V, 7 mA\nDigital I/O pins: 14 w/ 12 PWM\nAnalog input pins: 6 12-bit ADC channels\nAnalog output pins: 2 10-bit DACs\nFlash memory: 256 KB\nSRAM: 128 KB\nVoltage regulator: 3.7-5.5V input / 3.3V, 300mA output\nDimensions: 1.4 x 0.7\" (36mm x 18mm)   \n[Pinout coming soon!]\nProgramming\nProgramming is easy! Like most Arduinos, you simply plug the board into your PC using a micro USB cable, select the board you want to program, and hit the upload button in the IDE when you're ready. The Tachyon ships with the Zero bootloader installed, and most of the time it will auto-reset when the USB serial port is opened by the IDE, but in the event that this fails, you can always hit the reset button on the board to force it to enter bootloader mode after your program finishes compiling.\nProgramming is easy with the Arduino IDE!\nThe Atmel ICE can be used to update the fuses and bootloader, but is NOT required for programming the board normally!\nOther Features\nStatus LED\nThe Tachyon features a red status LED you can control in your program. This LED is connected to the same pin the Zero uses for its TX LED.\nPower LED\nThe Tachyon also features a green LED to indicate when it is receiving power. Both power and status LEDs are located to either side of the reset switch.\n10-bit DACs\nSay goodbye to the Tone() command forever! Turn your Tachyon into a virtuoso by connecting an amplifier to pins A0 and A4 and using the Audio library to play .WAV files in stereo with the built-in DACs!\nReset Switch\nThe Tachyon also features a reset switch. Normally you won't need it, but if your sketch ever locks up and you can't seem to upload a new one to the board, you can press that magic button twice to force the bootloader to stay on!\nInductor Pads\nOn the back of the Tachyon are pads for an optional 1210 10uH inductor. This inductor is necessary should you desire to use the internal switching regulator of the Tachyon for low-power applications.

Digital circuits are in basically everything today and range from something as simple as a circuit that turns an LED on when a button is pressed to the complex processor in the device you are reading this on. Traditionally, these circuits are built by making ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) out of silicon wafers. This process is incredibly expensive and complex.\nFPGAs, or Field Programmable Gate Arrays, are a way to create digital circuits without these barriers. FPGAs are part of a class of devices known as programmable hardware. This means that you can design a digital circuit and program the FPGA to become that circuit. You can reconfigure the FPGA as many times as you want allowing you to create circuit after circuit without having to physically change a thing!\nBackground\nBack in 2013, the Mojo was launched here on Kickstarter. The goal of this campaign was to bring digital design to hobbyists with a low cost board and plenty of tutorials.\nThe campaign was a success and in the five years since then I've written many tutorials guiding a beginner from blinking LEDs to creating a basic CPU. Development on the Mojo continued in ways that were outside the scope of the original campaign with the creation of the Mojo IDE and a custom easier to use language, Lucid. There is now even a book that supports all this.\nAlchitry is the next step into simplified digital design. These new boards will bring all the goodies of the Mojo, simplicity, tutorials, an IDE, and Lucid. However, they are much more.\nAbout the Boards\nThis time around, there are two FPGA boards! These are the Alchity Au (gold) and the Alchitry Cu (copper).\nAlchitry Au\nArtix 7 XC7A35T-1C - 33,280 logic cells (approx. 4x the capacity of the Mojo)\n256MB DDR3 RAM\n102 IO pins (3.3V logic level, 20 of then can be switched to 1.8V for LVDS)\n9 differential analog inputs (1 dedicated, 8 mixed with digital IO)\nUSB C to configure and power the board\n8 general purpose LEDs\n1 button (typically used as a reset)\n100 MHz on-board clock (can be multiplied internally by the FPGA)\nPowered with 5V through USB C port, 0.1\" holes, or headers\nUSB to serial interface for data transfer (up to 12Mbaud)\nDimensions of 65mm x 45mm\nThe Alchitry Au is the workhorse of the two boards. It features an Artix 7 FPGA which means no more dealing with Xilinx's antiquated ISE tool. This board also has 256MB of DDR3 RAM while still having 102 IO pins available for your projects!\nAlchitry Cu\niCE40-HX8K FPGA - 7680 logic elements (approx. 0.8x the capacity of the Mojo)\n79 IO pins (3.3V logic level)\nUSB C to configure and power the board\n8 general purpose LEDs\n1 button (typically used as a reset)\n100 MHz on-board clock (can be multiplied internally by the FPGA)\nPowered with 5V through USB C port, 0.1\" holes, or headers\nUSB to serial interface for data transfer (up to 12Mbaud)\nDimensions of 65mm x 45mm\nThe Cu board is the lighter version of the two but offers something completely unique. The Cu uses a Lattice iCE40 HX FPGA that is supported by the open source tool chain Project IceStorm. The Mojo IDE will be transformed into Alchitry Labs to support the new boards. Alchitry Labs will be open source meaning that the Alchitry Cu can be developed for using entirely open source tools!\nAlchitry Breakout\nThe connectors on the Alchitry boards have been changed to surface mount. This allows for much cheaper assembly of elements (expansion boards). The Alchitry Breakout allows you to easily connect whatever you want to your board through 0.1\" holes!\nAlchitry IO\n4 7-segment LED digits\n5 momentary push buttons\n24 LEDs\n24 DIP switches\nThe Alchitry IO is the perfect way to get your feet wet with digital design. The plethora of buttons and LEDs lend themselves to fantastic beginner tutorials that will walk you through all the basics!\nThe different elements (expansion boards) simply stack on top of one another! They also have cut outs so that the LEDs and button on the main board are still accessible.\nFPGAs vs Microcontrollers\nFPGAs and microcontrollers, like the Arduino, are very different devices. With a microcontroller you write software. That software gives you control of the built-in peripherals, like IO pins, serial ports, or analog to digital converters. The biggest limitation of software is that you can only do one thing at a time!\nWith FPGAs you are not creating software. You are designing the hardware! Instead of writing code to run on a fixed processor with fixed peripherals, you get to design your own circuit. If you really want to you can even create your very own processor and write software to run on it!\nA huge benefit of working with FPGAs is that every element of your design runs independently of each other. That means one part of your design can be reading in some serial data, while another part is controlling a servo, while another is reading some sensors, and yet another is controlling a display.\nWith a microcontroller you can often be limited by the built in peripherals. There is a set number of serial ports, PWM pins, or maybe you can't use some components, like a camera, because you can't interface with them fast enough. With FPGAs every pin has the potential to become whatever you need it to be. Do you need 70 PWM signals to control a lot of servos? Alchitry has you covered. What about a bunch of serial ports or controlling a big LED display? You're covered there too. Since you are designing the hardware, you are deciding what each pin will do!\nGPU Example Project\nSo what's something crazy you can do with an FPGA that a microcontroller could never do? Make your own GPU!\nGPU Demo rendering Suzanne, the Blender monkey\nThis demo is running on the Alchitry Au. The FPGA is driving the display and generating every frame from scratch! The model is stored in a ROM and it consists of nearly 1000 triangles. Each triangle is transformed (rotated in this case), lighting calculated, projected onto the 2D space of the screen, rasterized, and checked against a z-buffer (so triangles in the front block triangles in the back).\nThis will be one of the first demo projects to be detailed after the campaign is over. It will cover everything from how all the rendering works to more common design elements like a cache for the RAM (the DDR3 on the Alchitry Au acts as a frame buffer).\nIt will be detailed through written tutorials as well as a video series.\nHow does this all work?\nDigital circuits are not usually designed by drawing out a circuit. You don't sit down and wire up logic gates individually. That would make designing anything but very basic circuits very difficult and tedious. Instead, you use things called HDLs, or Hardware Description Languages, to design the circuits. These languages are almost like writing code, as you are basically just creating text files, except that you are actually describing a digital circuit that will get synthesized into hardware.\nYou can use whatever method you'd like that is supported by Xilinx's or Lattice's tools to work with the Alchitry boards. This includes Verilog and VHDL, the two industry standard HDLs. You will also be able to use Alchitry Labs to create designs in the much simpler Lucid HDL.\nOnce you have created a design, it is loaded onto the board over USB from your computer. The FPGA then becomes the circuit you made! The boards have on board memory that stores your design between power cycles.\nIf you would like to check out some of the existing tutorials for the Mojo click here.\nAlchitry Labs\nThe Mojo IDE is changing into Alchitry Labs. This means that the Alchitry boards have full Lucid support, a built in library of useful components to use in your project, and a debugger!\nAlchitry Labs will be open source and support Project IceStorm. This means you can work with the Alchitry Cu using completely open source code! It will also integrate with Vivado and iCEcube2 allowing you to work with the Au and choose between proprietary or open tool chains for the Cu.\nDebugger in the Mojo IDE\nThe debugger in the Mojo IDE is currently pretty limited and a bit of a hassle to setup. This is largely due to how the USB interface was designed. The Alchitry boards are different and allow for a more seamless debugger. You'll be able to simply select the signals in your design you'd like to inspect and the tools will build a version of your project to inspect these!\nIf you haven't used the Mojo IDE before, here are some of the awesome features you can look forward to!\nReal time error checking for Lucid\nAuto-complete for Lucid\nA large library of components\nExample projects\nThe Future of Alchitry\nThis isn't a one-off Kickstarter project and development will continue far into the future. The near term effort will be focused on updating the software to support Alchitry. Once there is a solid working base, existing tutorials will be ported to the new platform. New elements (expansion boards) will be created (HDMI, camera, and sensors are on the short list).\nI am also planning to augment the written tutorials with video tutorials.\nI will also continue to expand the list of tutorials into more advanced subjects likely through example projects. Send me your ideas!\nStretch Goals\nTo make the campaign a little more exciting, let me introduce some stretch goals! If the campaign makes it to these higher benchmarks the rewards will be unlocked for everyone!\n$50K: Every reward will come with stickers!\n$75K: Every Au and Cu board will come with standoff screws!\n$100K: Every Au and Cu board will come with a USB C to USB A cable!\nCompatibility\nThe tools from Xilinx and Lattice only support Windows and Linux (sorry OSX users). These are required for building your projects. Many people have had success using a virtual machine running Linux on Macs to get around this.\nHowever, the Alchitry Cu can be developed for natively on OSX using the open source tools, Project IceStorm. These tools are pretty new and may not be fully functional.\nAlchitry Labs will initially only support Windows and Linux but support for OSX will be added if Project IceStorm turns out to be a fully viable alternative.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Alchitry Cu", "descp": "Get the open Alchitry Cu\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Cu", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "Breakout Cu Package", "descp": "A perfect start to build your own projects!\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Cu\nAlchitry Breakout", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Beginner Cu Package", "descp": "A great starting point for anyone getting into digital design!\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Cu\nAlchitry IO\nAlchitry Breakout", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "Alchitry Au", "descp": "Get the powerful Alchitry Au\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Au", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "Breakout Au Package", "descp": "A perfect start to build your own projects!\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Au\nAlchitry Breakout", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 135 or more", "title": "Beginner Au Package", "descp": "A great starting point for anyone getting into digital design with a lot of room to grow!\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Au\nAlchitry IO\nAlchitry Breakout", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["150 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 145 or more", "title": "Gold and Copper", "descp": "Get both FPGA boards!\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Au\nAlchitry Cu", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 175 or more", "title": "Gold and Copper Package", "descp": "Get both FPGA boards and two breakout elements!\nINCLUDES:\nAlchitry Au\nAlchitry Cu\n2\u00d7 Alchitry Breakout", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 185 or more", "title": "Master Builder", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nAlchitry Au\nAlchitry Cu\nAlchitry IO\nAlchitry Breakout", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["141 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 400 or more", "title": "The Collector", "descp": "Get some of the first boards out of production!

When I cook something that my grandmother used to cook when I was a little girl, I kind of bring her back a little. I get a sense of the flavors she loved, the spices she had in her kitchen and somehow pass them on to my children and grandchildren to get a sense of someone long gone. I\u2019ve always loved cooking, I just can't stop thinking about food and what I can cook next. I just find myself always talking about food. Came the time when I decided I was going to write and turn my passion into a cookbook.\nThroughout my life I have turned to cooking to find comfort, celebrate life, or simply to enjoy and share really good food. At a very young age I lost my mother and found comfort in cooking side by side with my loving and nurturing grandmother. At the age of 5 I was given a smaller replica of my grandmother\u2019s traditional clay pot and discovered the joy that learning, mimicking, preparing and savoring her recipes gave me.\nI immigrated to Montreal as a teenager where I  faced the challenges of adapting to a drastically new culture, by learning new recipes and reinventing myself. I adapted to my new life through my connection with food. \nSpiced Oranges with Orange Blossom Water\nI have since lived in many places including Venezuela, Haiti, the United States, Israel, France where I have shared my cooking. I have also cooked on private yachts off the coast of Spain, always perfecting my craft, creating elegant dishes, and memorable events. I was fortunate that my attention to incorporating spices, healthy ingredients and cooking techniques were harnessed by organic food company Cedar Lane to enhance their organic prepared foods line available in supermarkets around the world.\nI like to call myself a  cultural creative. I am now based in Montreal, but can usually be found traveling the world, experiencing other cultures, and sharing what I find most interesting. \nAt the top of my food passion is my attraction for spices, their benefits and the distinctive flavor they bring to all dishes. I am always proactively seeking ways to evolve my consciousness, through experiences as diverse as attending Woodstock or meditating with Kabbalists in Israel, because that a also contributes to the food you eat. Through my travels across the world, I have created a style of cooking that reflects the savory influences of all the wonderful places I have  lived, the people I have learned from, and my own personal evolution. \nYou will find in this book of treasured recipes all the detailed step by step info and tips I have  gathered and that will greatly benefit you when entertaining for a wide variety of occasions that represent many of life\u2019s special moments, ranging from what to cook for a crowd, what to cook with friends, what to prepare for occasions as diverse as an intimate lunch or a formal party. In these recipes, you will also find options that can be suited for a very diverse crowd ranging from vegetarian to vegan to gluten free, non- dairy or kosher.\nI hope you will enjoy all these recipes that have been created around my Love of Spices. It is this love that has made me wish to share.\nI am so eager to share so here is a little tantalizing glimpse from my book.\nGrilled Artichoke Saffron and Lavender Sauce\nRecipe", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have cooked all my life but putting together a cookbook was a challenge that I was not prepared for.\nFor the last two years I have been writing recipes. Indeed I always knew how to cook but in an instinctive way without measures. I had to cook all of my recipes over again for this book taking note of processes and quantities.\nOnce that was done I had to solicit a photographer. This was a trial and error experience because it is one thing to cook all the recipes you have cooked all your life but another thing to make them photo ready. I also had a vision of what I wanted them to look like. So here I had to solicit the help of a food stylist. I never even knew such a thing existed before!\nWhen the photographer and food stylist would come I had to make sure beforehand that I had enough recipes prepared for the photo shoot.The details I had to think of were insane : from the props, to dishes,to backgrounds to getting together all the ingredients for several recipes at a time. I also learned that timing was of the utmost importance because for the pictures to be appetizing, the food must be half cooked...so I had to readapt even my cooking times, my methods and the way the final product should look like. \nAfter the cropping of the pictures sometimes disappointed me so I worked with the graphic artist on the layout and design of my book.\nIf I did not want to share my Love & Spices so much I would have never seen this through!\nBut now that it is nearing completion I am thrilled that I did it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Monique Singer\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nMonique\u2019s fortunate guests will tell you that her meals will always be special as one of the greatest culinary moments of their life and...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 10 or more", "title": "Bag of Special Spices Mix", "descp": "A secret mix of delicious spices that will enhance all your dishes", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 35 or more", "title": "LOVE & SPICES BOOK AND SPICES", "descp": "A published Love & Spices book plus special mixture of spices\nINCLUDES:\nDownload of Book Love & Spices", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 70 or more", "title": "LOVE & SPICES BOOKS AND SPICES", "descp": "2 books and 2 bags of spice mixture.\nGive a book and a bag of spices to a friend\nINCLUDES:\nDownload of Book Love & Spices", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 100 or more", "title": "LOVE & SPICES BOOKS AND DELUXE SPICES", "descp": "2 Love and Spices books plus 2 bags of Spice mixture plus 1 bag Deluxe Saffron Mix\nINCLUDES:\nDownload of Book Love & Spices", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project ends": "AUGUST 21, 2018"}, {"Project launches": "JUNE 22, 2018"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/loveandspices/love-and-spices", "project_name": "LOVE & SPICES"}}, {"backer": "Norman Jaffe", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "All of the money raised in this campaign will be used to finish post-production for Space Command: Redemption - that's stunning visual effects, editing, sound, music, and everything else that goes into the highest quality film production. \nNow that we've surpassed our initial goal of $45,000 to complete Chapter Three, here are the next, big goals ahead that lead us into completing the fourth and final chapter! \n(More Stretch Goals will be added very shortly!)\nARMIN SHIMERMAN (Quark in Deep Space Nine) joins the cast!\n...\nETHAN PHILLIPS (Neelix in Voyager) joins the cast!\n...\nGigi Edgley (Chiana in Farscape) joins the cast!\n...\nDoug Tait (featured in Star Trek 2009) has joined the cast!\n...\nIf we hit $100,000, you won't only get Chapter 3, but Chapter 4 as well!

Whether you are a designer, maker, engineer, or anyone else, having a stencil, ruler, protractor, or design reference information is useful to have on hand, but the full-size versions of these tools are far too inconvenient to carry daily. AG Studios presents a solution with a sleek, lightweight, durable card to keep with you.\nEach PocketRule is identical in size to a standard credit card, and is made of fiberglass and copper to provide an elegant surface and appealing feel in your hand. In this small size, PocketRule delivers a broad array of tools and references for drawing and sketching, circuit design, and measurement.\nEven the simplest functions of a ruler and protractor are useful to always have on hand for day-to-day tasks. With your help, AG Studios can launch its debut product and provide a tool for thinkers and makers of all kinds.\nDesign Principles\nPocketRule is designed to be versatile and applicable across disciplines. When designing a circuit board, it is valuable to have a visual reference of circuit component sizes and common amplifier designs. When sketching, PocketRule is designed to provide a simple, yet effective, set of tools for producing common forms. As an engineer or designer, a reference of common physics and unit conversions allows you to not rely on memory.\nThe shape of a PocketRule is an elegant combination of convenience and functionality. Its dimensions are identical to a standard credit card, but only two of the corners are rounded. This design allows easy placement into a wallet while retaining one fully straight edge for a ruler. All references are drawn or cut out of the inside of the card, maintaining this streamlined shape.\nThree versions are available, with features selected for each PocketRule's user. The three versions are geared for use in graphic design, engineering, and circuit work; each is versatile enough for day-to-day use.\nFeatures\nElectrical is the PocketRule packed with reference information for the circuit designer. When designing a circuit board, it is valuable to have a physical size guide on hand to refer to in your work. The electrical PocketRule features a ruler, an AWG measurement tool, common amplifiers, and size guides for a variety of circuit board features. The ruler and size guides provide both metric and imperial reference.\nEngineer features a ruler, table of unit conversions, and common equations for the designer to think on the go. Equations featured range in depth from translational mechanics to modern physics, and include a reference for common statistics.\nDesigner focuses on simplicity and elegance in functionality. This PocketRule includes a millimeter ruler and a protractor, and also provides stencils for drawing circles and polygons from a triangle to a decagon.\nThe polygon tool manifests within the spiral. Each corner of the spiral subtends the appropriate angle to draw its corresponding polygon, enabling versatile drawing abilities in a small space.\nMaterials\nEvery PocketRule is made of copper-clad fiberglass, the same material used to make circuit boards. This choice of material makes the card lightweight and durable, and provides an elegant aesthetic and satisfying feel in your hand. Each card is 0.8 millimeters thick and weighs 7 grams.\nThe metallic inscriptions in each PocketRule are made of finished copper, and have the option to be gold-plated. The surface finish is glossy and can be made black, white, blue, purple, or green. Black and green colors can also be made matte rather than glossy.\nTimeline\nThis project has undergone five tested prototypes to optimize the design, improve aesthetics, and ensure production quality. The history and anticipated timeline of the project completes in several months:\nApril 2018 - Initial ideas and designing\nMay 2018 - First round of prototyping\nJune 2018 - Final preparations and campaign launch\nJuly 2018 - PocketRule arrives at your door", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a debut product, and the designer's first Kickstarter project.

Our magnetic positioning technology allows you to remove and reposition your Ziflex in a few seconds and ensures a perfect alignment to your printer\u2019s bed while maintaining a strong grip.\nVersion fran\u00e7aise \nRemoving 3D printed parts from a build plate is often a real pain. Using a spatula to remove a print can damage your printer, your print, or even yourself. It\u2019s not a safe option: we all have already faced this struggle with this tool...\nMaking a part stick to the platform isn\u2019t easy, and removing it is even more difficult. We usually use a lot of different tools and products to succeed in both print adherence and removal. It's over now. All these dangerous and unpractical tools are things of the past now. Ziflex replaces them all! \nRemoving a print is now easier than ever, no matter the size or shape of your print. Just remove the Ziflex off of your printer and flex it.\nZiflex is a thin, flexible and heat resistant build surface, and features a coating that can handle any material. Thanks to its magnetic technology, Ziflex will be strongly attached to your printer and will be perfectly placed every time.\nOur magnetic positioning technology is strong and also directional. It guides your Ziflex in a single direction and ensures a perfect alignment to your printer\u2019s bed while maintaining a strong grip.\nIts incredible flexibility will allow you to easily remove any print, even the smallest one, without damaging your new build surface.\nThe Ziflex comes in two parts, with strong directional magnetic sheets on both parts. Just stick the one with 3M adhesive to your original bed, and then place Ziflex on it. Calibrate your printer, and you're good to go for easy 3D printing!  \nThe Ziflex can heat up to 90\u00b0C. As you can see from the thermal picture above, the Ziflex provides an effective heat transmission. \nWe can produce the Ziflex in any size and any shape (round or rectangular). From 10 square centimetres to 1 square metre build area, we can make a Ziflex for you ;) We can adjust the Ziflex to the exact dimensions of your print bed. We are going to open a Discord to talk with you to find out the best dimensions for each of you. \nThese printers aren\u2019t the only ones, we can make any size you need. \nWe are providing you the Ziflex in the exact size of your build bed. The size above is just the price range.\nDoing a bigger size isn't a problem for us (up to 1000mm*1000mm).

I\u2019ve come up with a few improvements for my printers, and after a while, I realized it could interest other folks who enjoy 3D printing!

Skies was launched in 2014 has remained 100% independent through crowdfunding and the support of our fans.\nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds for a high quality, clothbound first volume of Skies of Fire, collecting the first four issues. The book is the first trade collection we've produced and represents a huge milestone for Mythopoeia. \nWe're creating a collected trade because we're sold out of our floppy comics. Thanks our fans we've sold over 15,000 copies of Skies of Fire to date!  Though we've thought about just continuing on with floppies, a trade allows us to better streamline our inventory and opens up distribution channels for Mythopoeia, and is imperative for the continuation of Skies of Fire. \nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.  \nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince. His actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.  \nIn Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.  \nIssue Three follows the pair as they recruit members for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead. \nIn Issue Four, the crew of the Zephyr must come together despite their differences. \nVincenzo Ferriero and Ray Chou have been creating stories together since 2008. They met in college and continue to collaborate despite being 5,437 miles apart.\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art. \nBryan Valenza is a prolific artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects from top publishers in the industry. \nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army.     \nJosephe Vandel is a German cartographer and graphic designer with a love for RPGs and creating fictional worlds.\nThe majority of funds from this Kickstarter will go into covering the cost of printing the book and fulfilling orders from this Kickstarter. Any remaining money will be put back into further production of Skies of Fire. \nSkies of Fire Volume I is 8x11\" clothbound hardcover with 120 pages including sequentials, codex documents, and variant covers.. The book features a new wraparound cover by Pablo de Bonis featuring the city of Monterey. \nActual copies of the book shown.\nAn interior from issue #4.\nCollector's Edition Book Plate\nThe prints have been carefully selected from some of the most iconic scenes in Skies of Fire using the highest quality archival paper.\nIssue #1 Variant Poster. 19 x 13\"\nRecruitment Poster from Issue #3.\nShips of the World Poster. 19 x 13\"\n This campaign we're introducing two new poster prints:\nZephyr Cutaway Poster. 19 x 13\"\n$15,000 - Digital Making Of (Updated) - Because we hit $15,000, we'll release our digital deluxe files to all backers! This includes an extensive Making Of, the inks of all of the issues, comic scripts, wallpapers, and more. All told, it should be about 100+ pages of bonus content. We'll also do our best to update the content and add a couple of new things for long time fans! \n$20,000 - Digital Issue #5 - We'll also be including a digital copy of Skies of Fire #5 free of charge to backers of this campaign when it's ready later this summer! This will coincide with the launch of the next Kickstarter campaign.\n$30,000 - New Landscape Illustration - If we reach $30,000 we'll be commissioning and packing in a new art print featuring Lutan, the city of opportunity in every physical package of Skies of Fire: Book I. \n$35,000 - Printable Zephyr Papercraft PDF   - Should we reach  $35,000, we'll include a PDF of a printable, low poly version papercraft model of the Zephyr!\n$40,000 - Skies of Fire RPG Alpha - If we reach $40k, we'll invite all members of this Kickstarter to the Skies of Fire RPG Alpha when it's ready to launch!\n$45,000 - Zephyr Papercraft Pack-In - If we reach $45k, we'll pack in a pre-printed version of the Zephyr Papercraft with every shipment of Skies of Fire: Book I!\n$50,000 - \"100\" Ships -Finally, if we reach $50k, we'll commission our resident ship designer Alex Bucur for a boatload more ship designs!

In other words, so long as we get the money, we'll be able to quickly fulfill the campaign. \n\nOtherwise, the biggest risk is in timely fulfillment. Last campaign we wrapped up two months after the closing day ended. Just like last time, we'll do our best to close the campaign as soon as we can. Everything is in place for this to happen - all items are in stock and ready to be shipped out. \n\nIf we don't succeed in this campaign, Vince and I are out about $10,000. That would not be good for our creative endeavors - not necessarily stop them, but severely slow us down. So please help us make sure that doesn't happen!\n\nThings can and do happen throughout the course of a campaign, but we've always made it a policy to be transparent and update our backers frequently.

Adding a \"dummy\" prototyping shield as a spacer in between usually solves the problem.\nWorks with both 5V and 3.3V boards!\nIndividual pairs of red and green LEDs with on-board drivers for displaying high/low status for each of the port pins, all located along one edge and extended out beyond the standard Arduino shield for easy viewing of all pins - even when placed in the middle of a shield sandwich!\nVirtually no loading on the GPIO pins, only 100Kohm pull-up resistors to keep the buffer inputs from floating - the LEDs are NOT driven directly by the GPIOs!\n3 user signal inputs with LEDs available to the user for probing other signals\nOne channel dedicated to the RESET signal helps catch those unexpected resets!\nA 6-position DIP switch for connecting/disconnecting the board's input buffers and 100Kohm pull-ups from the analog inputs (A0-A5) for sensitive applications that might be affected by the pull-up resistors\nProbe pins on 0.1\" male headers adjacent to the shield sockets are for external probing with oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, protocol analyzers and DMMs. They also make it easy to connect to boards that aren't shield compatible!\nTwo GND posts for grounding test equipment\nA prototyping area with all shield signals and power brought out for creating your own circuits and is also compatible with 170 tie-point breadboards (now included), just drop it in place!\nA 2-pin disable jumper (marked \"DIS\") is provided for disabling the LED circuits lets you conserve power when they're not needed, or wire it to a GPIO pin and control it from a sketch to build some creative LED patterns!\nA reset push button located for easy access!\nPLAY\n\n24 STATUS LEDs\nSTATUS LEDs\n  The status LEDs show the current state of all 20 GPIO pins at a glance...you don't have to turn the board around or try to peer around other shields to see what's happening on the other side of the board like some other designs.  The standard Arduino naming convention for the GPIOs are clearly shown adjacent to the LEDs along the edge of the board, plus their Microchip (formerly Atmel) PORT pin designations (PORT B, PORT C & PORT D) just above the row of green LEDs.\n  Three USER inputs (U1-U3) are provided to enable you to probe other parts of your circuits (the signals can be either 3.3V or 5V) that aren't connected to a GPIO pin.\n  The RESET signal has its own pair of LEDs to enable you to see if the reset line is being asserted.\nDEBUG HEADERS\nDEBUG HEADERS\n   The debug headers make it easy to probe the GPIOs and power supply circuits with a DMM, oscilloscope, or logic analyzer.  Easily connect an I2C or SPI protocol analyzer and start decoding those pesky communications!  If you're unable to decode the I2C or SPI interfaces, connect an oscilloscope probe to them and verify that the waveforms look right or possibly swapped!\n  The debug headers can also be used to connect other boards like sensor evaluation boards that aren't shield-compatible...just use jumper wires to patch it in!\n  A pair of GND posts make it easy to ground test equipment such as oscilloscope probes.\nANALOG DISCONNECT SWITCHES\nA0-A5 DISCONNECT SWITCHES\n   When using A0-A5 as analog inputs, you might not want a 100Kohm pull-up resistor affecting your circuit...turn off the corresponding DIP switch to electrically isolate it!\nPROTOTYPING AREA\nPROTOTYPING AREA\n   The 252-hole prototyping area is surrounded by all of the GPIO signals and power supply pins, making it easy to wire in your own custom electronics.  The pads are laid out in 18 columns of a 3-3-2-3-3 layout for maximum flexibility.  For maximum flexibility, place a 170 tie-point breadboard (not included) on top of the prototyping area, solder male or female headers into the GPIO and power supply holes (whichever suits you, a 40-pin stick is all it takes) and now you have a reusable rapid prototyping area!\n\nRESET & LED DISABLE\nRESET PUSHBUTTON AND LED DISABLE JUMPER\n   A reset pushbutton that protrudes beyond the standard shield size makes it easier to reset your system!\n  The board consumes as much as 125mA from the Vcc rail.  Maybe your design needs that extra power...just place a jumper across the pair of male header pins marked \"DIS\" to disable the power supply feeding the LEDs and their drivers, dropping the current consumption to below 2mA! \n\nARDUINO UNO COMPATIBLE HEADERS\nSTANDARD ARDUINO UNO HEADER FOOTPRINT\n  The standard Arduino UNO compatible shield headers are right where they should be, allowing the board to sit in the middle of a \"shield sandwich\" nicely while the status LEDs extend out for easy at-a-glance viewing.\nWHAT'S INCLUDED WITH THE KIT\nPCBA with all of the surface mount components pre-soldered\n170 tie-point breadboard w/double-stick tape on the back\nShield headers\n1 yellow 40-pin header strip\n1 green 40-pin header strip\n2 ground posts\n3 M/M and 3 M/F jumper wires for the user inputs\nKit Contents\nWHO CAN DeDe BENEFIT?\nIndividuals getting started with Arduinos & compatibles\nMakers building electronics for a project\nEngineers designing a proof-of-concept for a product\nSTEM & STEAM camps\nRobotics clubs\nHigh school, tech school and university labs\nPerfect for educators to teach electronics and programming!

Had it not been for that, I would've been a starving actor, as evidenced by that 30 seconds of OMG video above!  :D  (In grade school, I thought everyone grew up to be on TV or in the movies...the  naivety of youth!)\n\nI would also like to thank some of the players in industry, without some of whom, we wouldn't have Arduinos!\n\nArduino\nSeeed Fusion PCB & PCB Assembly Services\nAtmel, now part of Microchip\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nMost of the hard work has already been done. A lot of time and money have already been invested in the development of DeDe, and it's all but done...just a minor artwork tweak to the silk screen layer. The design is already proven and it works beautifully!  (It's fun to watch too!)  The next step involves designing and building a test jig to verify functionality of the boards before they ship out.\nThe monies raised during this campaign will go towards ordering everything needed to fulfill orders, such as boards, components, packaging, etc.  Depending on the success of the campaign, and more to the point, the number of rewards, I may or may not build the boards in-house.  I've been hand-stuffing prototypes with tweezers and a microscope, but that doesn't scale very well!  :^)  A pick and place machine for automating the placement of the surface mount components is a necessity for any quantity over 10-20 boards.  I would like to purchase a pick-and-place machine (likely the NeoDen3V) along with a manual stencil printer for applying the solder paste.  If the number of awards goes well above expectations, the plan is to farm out production to a third party, although I would still like to build the first 900 or so boards in-house to use up much of the inventory I've already purchased and to gain experience with the Neoden3V.\n\n\nTIMELINE\nDeDe Timeline\n DeDe Assembly Videos\nDeDe Unpacking and Assembly\n\nDeDe - Manual SMD Assembly Process\nBlinky Lights!!", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Student, Hobbyist, and Maker", "descp": "Save 25% off of the retail price!\n* Soldering required for the through-hole components only (headers and GND posts)\nINCLUDES:\nDebug Board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["108 backers", "Limited (92 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 79 or more", "title": "Pro Developer Pack of 3", "descp": "* Soldering required for the through-hole components only (headers and GND posts)\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Debug Board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["47 backers", "Limited (153 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 129 or more", "title": "Business Pack of 5", "descp": "* Soldering required for the through-hole components only (headers and GND posts)\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Debug Board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5 backers", "Limited (195 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 249 or more", "title": "STEM/STEAM Camp Pack of 10", "descp": "Great for STEM/STEAM camps!\n* Soldering required for the through-hole components only (headers and GND posts)\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Debug Board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (198 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 579 or more", "title": "Educator Pack for Universities", "descp": "The Educator Pack is for universities, tech schools, and high-schools that teach classes or have labs based on Arduino UNOs or its compatibles.\nPurchase enough boards for a classroom of students!\n* Soldering required for the through-hole components only (headers and GND posts)\nINCLUDES:\n25\u00d7 Debug Board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (199 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "EARLY BIRD", "descp": "The best deal for the first 50 backers only!\nPledge early and save 50% off of the retail price!\n* Soldering required for the through-hole components only (headers and GND posts)\nINCLUDES:\nDebug Board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Post-Kickstarter Update #8", "update_content": "Hello backers!!

I used some of the boards that I ran on my mini-production setup before I went with a CM, and it's easy to see the failures.\n   Basically, the test jig sits in an infinite loop checking the 100Kohm pullups that are on each Arduino port pin, which will fail if no board is inserted. When a board is inserted, the red row of LEDs will come on if there are any failed pullups, and it's easy to see (much easier after I updated the FW after I shot the video below) which pullup(s) are open. If the pullup test passes, then it flashes all of the green LEDs for a second and then proceeds with a walking 0 and a walking 1 test. It's a visual test for now, so I have to watch it for errors. The jig has the capability to tell whether the LEDs are good and look for shorted pairs of signals, but I decided that it was going to be quicker to do a visual test for now than to code up the ADC logic (I run an ADC channel in between each pair of LEDs, and based on voltage it call tell which LEDs are on and if there's an open based on the voltage)."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Post-Kickstarter Update #6", "update_content": "Hi Kickstarters!\n  I hope everyone has had a great Thanksgiving holiday!

My fingers are a bit sore, mostly from opening the ziploc bags (OMG), but I survived. :D  My learnings from this, besides realizing (and no real surprise here!) that I wouldn't want to do this for a living, is for a batch this size, do some test runs first on smaller quantities to make sure that the order in which you do things makes it easy for you. In this case...labels first! They are much easier to attach when the bag is still flat! I had pre-stuffed 35 bags w/components some time ago, and adding the labels to them wasn't so easy. Also, the index card idea looks like it will work great...I placed all of the loose components on the back side of the index card, and the front side will be where I place the PCBs and the instructions, both at the same time. I adjusted the order in which I added the loose components a few times to get all of the parts to go in as easy as possible. The six wires were the last to go in because putting them in early made it hard to get the 40-pin headers in without them getting snagged in the wires.

I kitted them up, which entails bundling each of the components and marking them with their manufacturer part number and DeDe\u2019s reference designators. I dropped everything off at the CM along with one of the boards I had built with the Neoden 3V, a set of Arduino headers, and an Arduino programmed with a test pattern for them to compare the first boards off of the line to prior to ramping up production. Testing the first articles is really a necessary step, as I found out when I went to assemble the board that I was going to deliver to them\u2026I found that the 3V LDO voltage regulator was placed 180 degrees out of place\u2026doh!

On the plus side, the boards will probably look at least a little better than what I can produce (although they look perfect w/my setup when I get everything right), but the down side is lead time which is looking to be 3-4 weeks to hit my dock, so shipping of all boards likely won\u2019t occur until mid-November.

It doesn\u2019t overwhelm the taste of a dish but instead heightens sensations and awakens the palate to deeper flavors. Its uses are varied and inventive: dry-fried in oil for a scorched-chili flavor; ground up and combined with aromatics to create the canvas for the most fragrant chili oils; and mixed with various other spices to make dozens of Sichuan flavor profiles.\n4.

THREE YEAR AGED PIXIAN DOUBANJIANG\nOften called the \u2018soul\u2019 of Sichuan cooking, doubanjiang, or fermented fava bean paste, is at the heart of many of the province\u2019s signature dishes. The best doubanjiang comes from a county called Pixian just outside of Chengdu. Here, factories have been fermenting their paste for hundreds of years, traditionally in large clay pots that are left out under the sun and mixed by hand daily to evenly distribute its exposure to the elements.

Leaving your filament spools unprotected will make it absorb moisture in the air and reduce its printability. This happens to almost all the filaments. Therefore, it is very important to store your filaments in a dry environment to ensure a longer shelf life. After 2 successful Kickstarter campaigns in 2016 for our filament dryer and in 2017 for our filament container. We are now glad to introduce the PrintDry Vacuum Sealed Filament Container. \nFeatured on \nFeatures \n1) Vacuum valve and pump: A special valve and a pump are used to suck the air out to create a vacuum seal and this will prevent the moisture in the air from getting into the container.    \n2) Stronger structure: In order to hold a strong vacuum seal, both the lid and the container itself have been specially designed. \n3)  Vacuum indicator: when completely vacuum sealed, the center of the vacuum valve will collapse inward from its original dome shape.   \nTesting   \nThe vacuum filament container has been tested with a 750g filament spool inside for 30 days. The graph below shows the changes of the relative humidity (grey line) inside the container and the ambient humidity (red line) as the storage time increases. Five pouches of 15g desiccant are included in the container.\nHow to use \n Our new vacuum sealed containers are super easy to use.  \n1) Place your filament spool inside the container with some desiccant pouches, put on the lid and align the tabs of the lid and the container, engage the 4 strong clamps.  \nPLAY\n\n2) Take the hand plunger and line up the bottom of the hand plunger with the center vacuum valve on the container lid.  Pressing down gently on the hand plunger, simply lift the plunger handle slowly until it reaches the top of the pump, and then push down on the plunger until it reaches the bottom of the pump. Repeat this up and down motion for 5-10 times.  \nPLAY\n\n3) To release the vacuum seal, place your index finger on the outside rim of the valve, and press it towards the center. \nPLAY\n\nPlease be aware that too many pumps will end up putting too much pressure on the container walls and lids and will lead to damage of your containers. \nSpecification  \nContainer overall size: 255(OD) x 115(H) mm (10.5\"OD x 4.5\"H)\nFilament spool size (max): 205(OD) x 85(H) mm (8\"OD x 3.3\"H)  \nDesign improvements\n1) A thicker durable plastic to withstand the extreme pressure of on the walls and lid of the containers when vacuum seal is achieved.  \n2) Accept taller spools of filament than our original container. \nSpecial UPGRADE package for our previous backer:  \nUPGRADE Package A: 6 vacuum sealed lids and 1 pump\nUPGRADE Package B: 12 vacuum sealed lids and 2 pumps\nReward Tiers\nTimeline \nInternational backer  \n The PrintDry filament containers will be shipped worldwide! However, please be aware that for some countries VAT/duties may incur upon receipt of your unit. These fees are the responsibility of each international backer.   \nDistributors:  If you would like to work with us to distribute PrintDry products around the world, please contact us at info@printdry.com  \nMedia kit:  Please click the link here for our Media Kit\nYou already know how well our original containers work and with this UPGRADE PACKAGE you can still use the original container bottoms with the new vacuum lids. This way you get to see how the vacuum sealed container works, without having to pay the cost for a whole new set of containers.  \nThanks\nAll of us at PrintDry would like to thank those who have supported us with our past Kickstarter campaigns and to all of you who will be supporting this 2018 Kickstarter campaign.

RGB LED protocols is just one example of what you can do!\n150-Mbit WiFi (2,4 GHz, 802.11 b/g/n), 10/100-Mbit Ethernet, Bluetooth Classic + Low Energy, USB 2.0 Full Speed\n240 Mhz, 4 MB RAM, 12 MB Flash dedicated to your application, with all files being compressed on the fly. System + IDE use separate dedicated CPU core, RAM and Flash.\n  Ready, set, go!\nAttach power supply. A USB cable or any power source with 3.3 V or 4.5 to 50 V works\nConnect to the WiFi access point \"neonious one\" (default password on sticker) or connect network cable\nPoint browser to 192.168.0.1 and log in to enter the IDE\nEnter your JavaScript code into the index.js file, upload static files, add external modules, all from the IDE\nClick \"Run\" and / or enable auto-run on power-up for long-term fun!\n\nProgramming Experience with the On-Board IDE\nThe on-board IDE is sophisticated:\nFull debugger including breakpoints, step through program, show and edit variables and more\nFull code editor with syntax highlighting, auto completion, and more\nFull file manager with on-the-fly compression while uploading\nShows syntax errors in realtime\nCPU, RAM, flash statistic graphs\nGraphical package manager for npm repository\nCheck out the following video to get an understanding on how direct the programming experience is with the IDE.\nPLAY\n\nWeb Server As A Starting Point For IoT Project\n... in only 5 minutes! Just install the npm modules express and compression through some clicks in the IDE and enter the following code into your index.js file:\nYou now have your web server serving your static pages up and running, including gzip compression!  \nWhere to Continue from Here\nWith addition of motors and sensors a great IoT project can be realized, fusioning both electronics and web development.\nAs an example, take a look at the table radar in the video below. You can find the code for this example here: https://github.com/neoniousTR/table_radar\nPLAY\n\nConnecting To Sensors, Motors And Other Electronics\nWe give you many pins to connect your electronics, and thanks to the LPC822 switch matrix, you can choose the pins quite freely.\n Apart from the standard protocols, neonious one allows you to implement custom protocols from your JavaScript program using an easy to understand abstraction language. Thanks to the LPC822 state-configured timer custom protocols way up into Mhz range are possible.\n\nThis allows you to interface RGB LED protocols and almost anything else you can imagine.  \nThe software\nECMASCRIPT 6 / TYPESCRIPT \nUse ES 6 modules, let, async/await, classes, typed array, you name it. For larger projects you might even want to use TypeScript, supported seamlessly on neonious one, to get rid of programming errors by introducing static typing.\nNODE.JS API \nneonious one provides the Node.JS API which brings its event-driven, non blocking I/O model to the embedded world. You can now write large embedded projects without having to think about realtime operating systems, synchronisation issues and deadlocks.\nNPM MODULES \nneonious one allows you to install modules from the largest software library in the world, the npm repository, from within its on-board graphical package manager.\nThe hardware\nCPU, RAM, STORAGE\nneonious one is based on the dual-core ESP32 microcontroller, running at 240 Mhz and providing up to 600 MIPS. One core is dedicated to your JavaScript program, run by a fast byte code based engine, and one core is dedicated to everything else, including things such as Wi-Fi, file compression, http or https handling. Your application has access to 4 MB of RAM, plenty to support all JavaScript features. System + IDE run in their own RAM space. 12 MB of data storage dedicated to your application is provided by an Flash chip connected via 4x80 Mhz dedicated SPI lines, giving you plenty of space for most embedded applications, especially thanks to an on-the-fly compression of all files.\nPOWER CONSUMPTION AND MODES\nEven though the highly efficient step-down regulator of neonious one allows you to connect any voltage between 4.5 V and 50 V (bypass if you want to use 3.3 V directly) and provides 1000 mA of current with ease, neonious one only uses around 160-240 mA with WiFi transmitting, and without WiFi just a fraction of that. You can let neonious one save your program to Flash and enter one of the sleep modes, reducing power consumption greatly (deep sleep mode under 50 \u00b5A). On the requested event your program gets reactivated and continues where it left. This allows battery powered installations to run for months or even years.\nneonious one Technology Preview\nBefore starting the Kickstarter, we already developed the neonious one Technology Preview. Buy it through our Kickstarter and get it shipped immediately!\nWill be shipped immediately!\nModern JavaScript ES 6\nModern IDE with debugger and graphical package manager\nGPIO, external packages to test, such as lodash, async, moment, uuid, underscore or rxjs\nHowever...\nAll software features of the final version will be added in the months to come via software updates\nOnly 4 MB storage dedicated to user programs, compressed on the fly\nOnly support for USB as power source\nAbsolutly all features will then be supported in the final version, which you get for free as soon as it is done, if you buy and pay the Technology Preview!\nneonious IoT Electronics Kit\nIf you are a great JavaScript developer without experience in electronics, this is for you: The all-in-one package to get you a full IoT electronics education.\nIncludes a 100+ page book, educating you about the basics of electronics, using microcontrollers and interfacing both sensors and motors of any kind.

It's a must have for any cosplayer or anyone who wants to add some extra flair to their Halloween costume or decorations! Use it to add lights and sounds to a toy car or space ship. Or, make a favorite stuffed animal talk and \"purr\" with a vibration motor. Or, place it in a chest with a limit switch on the lid and a high power LED and have it play the fanfare from the Legend of Zelda whenever it's opened. The only limit is your imagination. The possibilities are endless!\nOriginal Firecricket fully loaded!\nHow do I program it?\nProgramming is easy! Like all Arduino compatibles you simply download the Arduino IDE, install the configuration files through the board manager, select the Arduino Zero, plug the Firecricket XL into your PC using a MicroUSB cable, compose your sketch, and hit the upload button in the IDE when you're ready!\nA sample sketch that performs all the functions seen in the demo will also be provided so you'll have a solid starting point to build upon!\nProgramming is easy with the Arduino IDE!\nTechnical Specs\nMicrocontroller: Atmel ATSAMD21G18A ARM Cortex M0+\nClock speed: 48 MHz\nOperating voltage: 3.3V\nI/O pin limits: 3.3V, 3 mA (7mA w/ strong drive enabled)\nDigital I/O pins: 14 w/ 12 PWM channels + I2C (SDA/SCL) + UART (RX/TX)\nAnalog inputs: 5 12-bit ADC channels\nAnalog outputs: 1 10-bit DAC\nFlash (program) memory: 256K\nRAM: 32K\nVoltage regulator: TLV702, 3.5V - 5.5V input / 3.3V, 300mA output\nPCB Dimensions: 2.0\" x 1.1\" (51 x 28mm)\nAmplifier: TPA2012D2, 2W into 4\u03a9 x 2 w/ 5V supply\nN-FET + Flyback diode: FDN337N + SS24FL, 30V 2A max\nBuffer: SN74LV1T125SC70\nOpen Source Hardware\nThe Firecricket XL, like most of the boards I offer, will be open source. This means you'll have access to the Eagle CAD files and schematics, and the ability to modify and reuse the design as you see fit!\nFirecricket XL PCB Layout\nPin Functions\nPinout Diagram\nPin A0 / DAC + Volume\nPin A0 is the output for the DAC. Typically you'd just ignore it as it can't be used if you're going to be playing sound effects, but if you'd like to add a volume control to your project, there's a trace on the underside of the board between A0 and the pad in the middle that goes to the amplifier. If you cut that trace, you can connect a potentiometer with the wiper on the center pad, and the ends attached to A0 and GND, and voila, instant volume knob!\nPins A1..A5 / Analog + Digital IO\nThese pins serve as both analog and digital inputs, or digital outputs. Want to connect a potentiometer to adjust the speed of your animated LED display? These pins are just what the doctor ordered! In my demo you'll noticed I've attached these pins to switches and used them as digital inputs. You could also attach LEDs to them and use them as outputs. The possibilities are endless!\nAREF / Analog Reference\nYou can just ignore this pin. If you ever need this, you'll know!\nPins 0..6 / Digital IO\nThese pins serve as digital inputs and outputs. That means you can connect LEDs (Don't forget the resistors!), switches, or a multitude of other things!\nPins 0 + 1 are special in that they do double duty as the RX/TX pins if you ever need to do serial communication that doesn't involve debugging, which takes place over the USB port. If you wish to connect a Bluetooth module for example, this is where you'd do so!\nSPKRS L + R / Speakers\nThese pins connect to the built-in TPA2012D2 stereo amplifier. Simply attach a 4 ohm speaker or two, and the amplifier will supply up to 2.1W of audio power per channel. That's twice as loud as the original Firecricket!\n(Please note: Both channels of the amplifier are connected to the single DAC, so even though the amp itself is stereo, the output will be mono!)\nIf you don't have 4 ohm speakers, 8 ohm speakers will work as well, but be only half as loud.\nAnd speaking of loudness... For maximum volume, choose a speaker that is as big as you can fit in your enclosure* and with the highest sensitivity rating and widest frequency range you can get. A larger speaker will reproduce lower frequencies making it seem louder and of course the audio quality will be improved.\n(* Within reason. A 2W amplifier probably won't be able to take advantage of a speaker much larger than 4\".)\nPins 7..13 / Servos and Relays\nThese pins are designed with servos and relays in mind. They have VIN on the center pad instead of 3.3V so if you connect a 5V supply you will have that available to power them. And even if you don't have a 5V supply you may find that 3.7V will be sufficient. In my demo for instance, you can see that I am driving a typical servo rated for 4.5-5V from a 3.7V supply when I have the LiPo battery connected.\nA word of warning! The IO pins of the Firecricket XL are not 5V tolerant, so if you're going to use these pins as inputs, for example, to connect switches as I have in the demo, make sure you either connect the switch to ground and enable the internal pull up, or do as I did in the demo and connect it to one of the spare 3V3 pads on the board and enable the internal pull down.\nSPI Header\nThese are the pins for the SPI bus, and they connect to the SD card. You can use them to connect other breakout boards which require SPI communication, but this is discouraged as the SPI bus will be in constant use whenever audio is playing. If you want to connect LED drivers or other modules it is suggested you use...\nSCL + SDA / I2C Bus\nThe I2C pins are your best bet for connecting breakouts to the Firecricket XL. These pins have built-in 4.7K pull ups and are conveniently located next to 3V3, GND, and VIN, with three sets of pads available for you to use!\nPin 11B / 5V Logic Buffer for Neopixels\nThis pin is the output of a logic buffer, connected to pin 11, which converts 3.3V logic to 5V logic.. or whatever VIN happens to be.\nI chose pin 11 for a very specific reason: it supports DMA!\nWhat's the big deal about DMA you ask?\nDMA enables the processor to drive a strip of Neopixels in the background while other tasks are being performed without interruption in your main loop!\nPin 26N / N-FET + Diode for High Power LEDs and Inductive Loads\nPin 26N is designed for connecting devices like vibration motors, solenoids, or high power LEDs that require more current and voltage than a normal pin can supply.\nThe two pairs of pads for this pin are tied together with an N-FET on the - side, VIN on the + side, and a flyback diode wired in reverse between them to protect against high voltage spikes when driving inductive loads.\nNote: This pin is connected to the red status LED so when you trigger it the LED will also light.\nOptional Add-on: The TLC59116 LED Module\nThe TLC59116 LED module is a constant-current 16 LED driver which works via the I2C bus!\nTLC59116 LED Module\nWhen driving LEDs with this module, you won't need to wire resistors to all your LEDs... and you can control the brightness of them in software!\nYou also won't be limited to 3mA per LED as you would be if you were attempting to drive LEDs directly from the microcontroller's pins. With this module you can supply each LED with a full 20mA, which is especially handy with those dim rectangular LEDs that are often used for ammo counters!\nTLC59116 LED Module PCB Layout\nAnd, if you need more than 16 LEDs, you can chain multiple modules together or wire them in parallel. Each module has a set of pads on the bottom which you can bridge with solder to set that module's I2C address!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've received quotes for manufacture, taken shipping costs and Kickstarter's cut into account, and have chosen components that are available in large quantities from reputable distributors.

Funding will be reinvested in purchasing additional boards so that cheap FPGAs will be available to all future makers. MoCo Makers supports the learning process with guides published on our website.\nThe Fipsy Development Timeline\nWhat will we do with the money?\nWith a the funds from this Kickstarter we will place a first batch order of Fipsy FGPAs.

The font and most of the other, now iconic imagery was designed by Susan Kare in the 1980\u2019s. \nIn an article regarding Macintosh typefaces published 1991 in Electronic Publishing, type designers Charles A. Bigelow and Kris Holmes note:\n\"Macintosh Chicago is a distinctive design. There are few faces quite like it in traditional typography, even among so-called \u201cdisplay\u201d faces, used for headlines and titling. Because Chicago is deeply integrated into the Macintosh System, used in menus, titles, etc., it is a fundamental part of the look of the Macintosh.\"\nBigelow and Holmes were contracted to update the Chicago typeface. Personally I prefer the original design by Kare. \nProject Budget\n381\u20ac Minimum Printing Costs (250 pcs)\n208\u20ac Shipping (based on shipping 140 single rewards)\n24\u20ac Packaging Material\n30\u20ac Payment Processing Fees & dropped pledges\n30\u20ac Kickstarter Fees\n0\u20ac 3 days Research / Setting up Kickstarter Site\n0\u20ac 2 days Packaging and shipping rewards\n673\u20ac Minimum Budget \nStretchgoal:\n2000 pcs. - Recycled paper instead of new paper\nThe Sticky Notes are produced in high quality offset print in Germany. The product of the forerunner campaign the Cancel / Save Notepad was printed on recycled paper. Unfortunately it is far more expensive to print on recycled paper than on new paper. A higher print-run lowers the costs \u2014 if the production run crosses 2000 pieces It would be possible to produce the Cancel / OK Sticky notes on recycled paper and climate neutral. \nShipping\nAll rewards ship from Germany in a protective envelop or cardboard box. Shipping varies based on the weight of your reward. Please note that only the higher reward tiers ship with registered mail and are online trackable. If not noted in the reward description items will ship with regular mail that is not trackable \u2014 if your shipment is lost, it is lost. If tracking is important to you write me up before the campaign ends and I can add tracking to your shipment which is usually about 7-9\u20ac for international and 2-4\u20ac for national shipments. From the past campaigns I know that in average 1 of 200 shipments get lost with unregistered mail.\nLocal pickup in my studio in Frankfurt (60311 near Hauptwache) is also possible, you will then receive one extra Cancel / OK Sticky Note block for saving shipping and packaging costs :-)\nSchedule\nThe design is ready, so basically I just need to know how many I should order - which will be clear by the end of the campaign. \nCampaign phase: 60 days\nProduction phase: After the campaign ends it takes up to two weeks until the funds arrive in my account. Then I can place the order, production time is 2-3 weeks. During that time I can prepare the shipments (order packaging material, print address labels). \nPackaging and Shipping: Once the order arrives (and the prints are as expected) I can start packaging and schedule a pickup for the rewards. \nDelivery: All rewards will be delivered through your national post service (USPS in the US, AUSPOST in Australia, Deutsche Post in Germany and so on\u2026) Depending on your distance to Germany you can expect your reward between: 2-21 days.

All in an action packed, hand drawn, made-for-TV style comicbook.  \nBut why try to explain, when we can show you...\nThanks to the success of our \"RACE TO 50 BACKERS\" campaign event last week we have SECURED an award winning director to come on for the motion comic of Issues 5 & 6.

Now, the only way to securely transmit data is hand-delivery via highly skilled couriers. Working for the premiere courier company is OMEGA 1, a genetically enhanced she-weapon who is deadly with a sword, fist fights with firearms and can draw metal to herself. She searches for her lost identity while trying to keep herself and her clients' data in tact. Along with her extraordinarily gifted friends in the company, she must piece together her past to uncover a conspiracy for global control and Aryan genocide. But when she discovers the people responsible for the Hacker War are family, Omega quickly finds herself in ongoing dilemma that juxtaposes her incredible ability to kill and destroy against her heart for love and care.\nThe first Four Issues\n                                                        \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDon't Watch This Next Video...Whatever You Do.\nOMEGA 1 brings together the talents of Hollywood veteran Mark Edward Lewis, with DC, Boom, and Dark Horse artist Emmanuel Xerx Javier, and dynamite Hollywood actress Alina Andrei. Together, they span franchises like Marvel's Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N., Star Trek: New Voyages, Knight Rider, The Orville, Fear the Walking Dead and comics such as Doppleganger, Executive Outcomes, The Rest of Heaven was Blue and Nightbreed.\nMark Edward Lewis has been writing music and directing film and television for nearly 30 years in Hollywood. He's also worked as a post-production supervisor for several beloved sci-fi productions including Blade of Honor, Marvel's Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N, Star Trek: New Voyages and others. He also produced and directed the Omega 1 Motion Comic which is now sold all around the world in multiple languages.\nEmmanuel Xerx Javier is an independent artist who calls the Philippine islands home. His old-skool meets \u00fcber modern stylings have been seen in many comic book franchises including those distributed by BOOM!, DC Studios and more. Emmanuel is no stranger to science fiction artwork, and he pencilled and penned all 4 of the Omega 1 comic books including those books original covers.\nCody Reynolds is a super-fan of independent comic book creators. Originally connecting with the Omega 1 franchise at \"Amazing Arizona Comic Con\" in 2012, he brought is powerful understanding of comic book lore, business and knowledge of what fans want to the Omega 1 team. He also has the distinction of being the only person on the planet with acclaimed artists' Jamie Tyndal and Nei Ruffino's only collaboration tattooed on his leg: Omega 1. Cody is Co-Owner of the Omega 1 comic franchise.\nElle Sonnet is an award winning filmmaker, producer, actress, cosplayer and body builder. She brings her unique talents as a spokesmodel to Omega 1. After connecting with the Omega 1 team in 2012 where she was the host of the show \"The Chicly Geek,\" she went on to produce multiple short films with her convincing cosplays including \"Harley Quinn\" and \"Lady Deadpool.\"\nRebecca Larken is a long-time member of the science fiction community and has produced all manner of fan film series including Dr. Who, Star Trek: New Voyages, and more.

Tom is also a photographer and is an expert in creating great imagining of promotional content and graphic art content.\nThe minimum we need is $18,000. We are confident however, that with this small amount of money, we can make one heck of an impressive finish to an already powerful and loved chapter of OMEGA 1. Your donations will fund the artwork and printing of Issues 5 & 6 (they are already written and adapted for artwork) and their publishing into a trade paper back.\nPLEASE, Join The Revolution, choose an amazing reward package, donate, and help us SPREAD the word! Every time you share this campaign with someone, you bring us closer to our goal.\nOf course, we could produce this series two comics and one Kickstarter at-a-time, but wouldn\u2019t you rather binge read your favorite sci-fi comic to the tune of 10 comics at a time than wait 6 months for the next gripping episode?\nThanks to you and the success of this campaign we will be able to pitch OMEGA 1 to distributors so that additional chapters can be created and OMEGA 1 can receive an even wider audience. From there, our plan is to bring you as many action packed sci-fi issues of OMEGA 1 as we can!\nWe truly appreciate your support.\nThank You! We thank you for your time.

It's not easy making the story, adapting it to a comic book script, getting artwork, color, pencils, lettering and final prints done, getting them printed to a high degree of quality, shipped to all our great donors, and pitching the comic to more distributors. It's A LOT of work, and a lot of things can go wrong. But we want to note is that we've done all of this before. 4 times before. And we'll do it again with this campaign. To be clear, some of these challenges include unforeseen delays, cancellations and rescheduling, delivery issues, equipment issues etc. However, we have a professional and experienced crew who have faced these challenges before. \n\nThis successful campaign will allow us to leverage the completed Omega 1, Chapter 1 into more issues and ultimately a television series. And while there are certainly risks and challenges with getting a television series made, we've successfully created television pilots in the past and delivered what we promised both in rewards and product. \n\nWhile we can never predict what the future holds, we are a uniquely skilled team who can tackle whatever comes our way whether it\u2019s a network television deal, or a 40 book comic series.

Over the years, the story of Skylab has been relegated to space experts and enthusiasts and our goal is to bring the importance of its missions back to the forefront of public memory.\nWriter & Film Director\nDwight Steven-Boniecki - Photo by Robert Enneper\nAward-winning author of Live TV from the Moon, Live TV from Orbit, and editor of Skylab 1 & 2: The NASA Mission Reports, Skylab 3: The NASA Mission Reports, and Skylab 4: The NASA Mission Reports, Dwight returns to the art of film making. Armed with an in-depth knowledge of Skylab, he presents the largely forgotten Skylab Program in a detail on film not seen since 1973.\nDwight was born in Sydney, Australia and became an international broadcasting professional. After studying television theory at North Sydney Technical College he moved to San Diego, USA. He returned to Australia and worked in TV before heading back to university where he majored in Psychology. Following his studies he decided that television was where he truly wanted to be and returned to the TV industry. From there he heard about the expansion on satellite TV in Eastern Europe and jumped on a plane to work in Europe: first in Great Britain, and then in Germany - where he still works today as a transmission engineer.\nYour Support\nFrom left: Dwight Steven-Boniecki, Owen K. Garriott, David Hitt\nToday, we are relying on your help to promote our film of this incredible American achievement and keep it alive in memory of the human race worldwide! Why? Because like experts agree: \"It changed the way we live on this planet!\"  - Glen Nagle, CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex\nYour donation supports our post-production, our licensing, marketing, and the publicity expenses needed to make the film an undeniable success. We need your help to achieve our absolute bare minimum of \u00a315,000.\nAmerica's Forgotten Triumph\nSkylab 2 in orbit\nSearching for Skylab is the first ever feature-length documentary about this forgotten era of NASA\u2019s space program, which falls under the immediate shadow of the historic Apollo missions.\nWe have interviewed many people involved in the outstanding Skylab program, including most of the original astronauts who flew the missions.\nOn every significant Skylab Anniversary the Team of Searching for Skylab made video files available in their entirety for you to enjoy. Our audio requests to JSC have resulted in comprehensive PAO Audio files from each of the 3 missions being made available on the Internet Archive. In many cases these tapes have gone through a process called \u201cbaking\u201d in order to bring them to an acceptable level of quality. In the majority of cases these tapes have not been played since 1973/4! With your help, we are looking to make Skylab a household name again.\nSL-4 Crew post flight\nIndeed, we are well on our way as information about Skylab is now more available to the general public than ever before.\nThe Post-Production\nEditing the movie\nNo further filming is required, but we need to still complete the post-production.\nThe colour grading and final edit are the crucial phase in the film-making process. We require the expertise of an experienced colour grader to ease the burden of getting the film ready for its July 2018 launch date at the Spacefest in Arizona.\nAcquisition of the 16mm footage\nWe need to acquire archival NASA footage. We are working from watermarked screeners, but will need to pay the costs of getting the clean footage delivered to us for use in the film, once the rough cut is completed.\nMarketing & Promoting of the Film\nFilming Bernard Smith, USB & Data Section, Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, AU\nBeing independent, we need a strong and robust marketing and promotion campaign to make sure our potential audience knows about the film and sees/purchases it. We already have a solid social media base, but good publicity will help people learn about Skylab.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge would be not achieving the much needed public support.

The Easy-Peelzy platform includes two parts: the base layer that sticks to your existing 3D printer bed, and a top layer that snaps to the base layer. The top layer has a polymer sticker on the top so all your PLA and PLA-based (e.g. Laybrick, Laywood, Metal-fill, etc.) filaments would bond really well onto it.\nEasy to cut\nDon't worry if your printer is a Delta-type 3D printer that uses round print bed, or maybe your printer comes with an odd dimension, because Easy-Peelzy is soft enough so that it can be cut to shape easily with ordinary scissors - no special process or tools required.\nAfter printing you can simply grab a corner or edge of Easy-Peelzy, and lift it up, then hold the platform in both hand and bend it upward a bit, your print should pop right off. In rare case the print refuses to just pop off, just peel the soft and flexible platform off the print, don\u2019t worry about damaging the platform, it is made out of durable materials.\nRemoval process\nRemoval process 2 (super thin 3D print -- 1 layer on edge, 3 layers in center)\nBottom of a removed print (left) and print surface (right)\nIn case something covering big portion of print surface might make it difficult to grab the top layer corners (imagine a huge 20x20x20cm cube occupying entire plate), so in stead of prying the corners you can grab the print it self and give it a horizontal twist, this can break the magnetic alignment between top and bottom layer, weakening and eventually reverse the attraction force between the two, ensuring a successful, easy removal.\nPlease notice that the Easy-Peelzy platform utilizes magnetic materials to hold top and bottom layers together, and this material can only operate in low heat (below 80 degrees Celsius or 176 degrees Fahrenheit), otherwise the material would demagnetize thus cannot hold those two parts together. Also because of the platform\u2019s magnetic nature, it may interfere with inductive sensor type bed leveling mechanism.\nBacker reward packages are Easy-Peelzy platform sets (a set includes 1 top layer and 1 bottom layer) of 8x8 inches, or approximately 20x20 cm.\nEasy-Peelzy platform set: 8x8 inches or 20x20 cm\nUpdate #1:\nBacker reward now includes Easy-Peelzy XL platform sets!

I mean, of course, the year 1500, when the chili pepper arrived from the New World and Europe said arrivederci to the pre-chili Dark Ages. That\u2019s when the pepper-powered Renaissance really caught fire.\nNo one who has enjoyed a good bowl of chili or the joys of a good hot sauce could ever willingly go back to a pre-pepper medieval menu.\nChili peppers\u2014when the Renaissance heated up.\nFine art.

Delivered in a 11\" x 14\" bevel-cut mat\u2014ready for framing. The image is approximately 6\" x 10\" and will be lovingly bumped into the paper\u2019s surface by master printer, Bryce Knudson of Bj\u00f8rn Press.\nSigned and numbered limited-edition print makes a zesty gift.\nIt\u2019s a limited-edition print. I\u2019ll sign and number each copy and include a grandiose certificate of authenticity with each print to document its pedigree.\nImage will be bumped slightly into the surface of an all-cotton sheet.\nObviously, the Chili-Making print makes a perfect gift. Think about getting extras for any friend who:\n\u2022 Sailed with Columbus\n\u2022 Cultivates chili peppers\n\u2022 Cooks in a bold style\n\u2022 Likes spicy food\n\u2022 Practices witchcraft\n\u2022 Collects early-Renaissance prints\n\u2022 Needs artwork to enliven his or her kitchen\nI\u2019ve included pledge levels to make it easy to get extras. If you need more than 10, let me know.\nSCHEDULE\nWhen will you receive your rewards? I feel safe promising the end of May. There\u2019s a lot of printing, inspecting, signing, mat cutting, and packing to do once the project closes. I\u2019ll push to make it sooner.\nSHIPPING\nFree shipping in USA. If you live in the United States, there\u2019s no additional charge to deliver your reward to your door.\nInternational shipping. We apply the amount we\u2019ve budgeted for U.S. postage to international orders, so international sponsors only need to pay the extra amount beyond what a U.S. order costs. Kickstarter will apply that cost when you make your pledge.\nIn some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are all very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most shipments slide through without any extra duties, but a few sponsors may find that a customs fee has been slapped on. I can\u2019t predict it or avoid it.\nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to me. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled when they are nearly at your house, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly\u2014before the authorities send the package back.\nIf you don\u2019t want to bother with a custom framer, you can pop the matted print into any sufficiently majestic, standard 11\"x14\" frame.\n   Who\u2019s the artist? Chili Making is the work of Don Moyer. I\u2019m a retired graphic designer. I draw in my sketchbook each day in an effort to make myself laugh. When a sketch seems like it might make a good project, I use Kickstarter to find supporters for a production run. You may have seen my Calamityware, letterpress prints, designs on silk, or other Kickstarter projects. This is my 33rd Kickstarter project.\nTwo of the sketchbook pages that led to the Chili-Making print.\n You can see Don\u2019s daily sketches, doodles, experiments, and mistakes on display on Flickr.\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and if I know the answer, I\u2019ll add the Q and A to the FAQ section of this page.\nKickstarter has made a lot of strange products possible.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com.

Astronauts Frank Borman, Bill Anders, and James Lovell were the first people to ever leave the Earth, and we have their story.  \nIn December of 1968, amongst social strife, campus unrest, and a difficult war in Vietnam, these brave men ventured into unknown territory. They were the true pathfinders of the Apollo program.  \nThey brought back with them a photograph known as \"Earthrise\" photographed by Astronaut Bill Anders. This photo became one of the most printed and viewed photos in history, was immortalized by a US postage stamp, was displayed in the oval office, and changed how we viewed our planet.\nTHE FILM\nIn January 2018 we launched a Kickstarter for First to the Moon, requesting $100,000. This campaign was unsuccessful by about $35,000. Because of this we have re-evaluated the budget for the film and will be making some sacrifices and cutbacks in order to get the film made for a lower budget. We are continuing to push forward and need your help to raise as much as possible to get this film funded in time for a December release! It is urgent that we achieve our MINIMUM $50,000 goal as soon as possible so that we can begin ordering film transfers, a process that can sometimes take up to 2 months to complete.\nFirst to the Moon tells the life story of these three men, how they grew up, served in the US Military and eventually became the first people to travel to the Moon. This documentary is told through their own interviews and rare archival photos and film.\nIf funded, \"First to the Moon\" will feature exciting photorealistic animations of the Apollo 8 flight, recreating famous moments from the mission, such as the Earthrise photo, the reading of Genesis, TLI and TEI maneuvers.\nWe are scanning in many never before seen film reels from the National Archives and other sources which show how Apollo 8 really happened. These film reels will be painstakingly cleaned and restored in high definition.\nAfter completion of the film, all NASA archival material will be uploaded and distributed for free on Archive.org.\nThe stories of these three men have never been fully realized on screen, and the journey of Apollo 8 has never been illustrated in the way that we intend to bring it to life.\nFirst to the Moon looks at how Apollo 8 happened, and how in the year 1968 they were able to bring some hope to a world in chaos.\nAfter Apollo 8, environmental legislation began to appear in ways never before seen. Just two years after this mission Earth Day was created. Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act, from which came the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As we were still traveling to the Moon in the 70s, the Catalytic Converter was installed in vehicles to help eliminate toxic emissions. The Endangered Species Act is formed, the Clean Water Act is signed, and DDT is banned.  \nFrom Apollo 8 spawned the most profound environmental legislation in history. So as Bill Anders says, \"We went to the Moon, but we discovered Earth.\"\nOUR PROGRESS \nWe have completed detailed interviews with Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, filmed many original artifacts including the Apollo 8 capsule, and all principal photography of the film is complete.\nResearch effort has been put into locating rare photographs and film from their personal histories and from the Apollo 8 mission itself.\nWe are ready to move forward with the edit and post production, but we need your help to fund these steps.\nOur goal of $50,000 is the bare minimum that we need to move forward with the film. Any extra funds earned will go directly into the film, more funding means more footage, better quality animation, and better music. It all adds up!\nDirector Paul Hildebrandt researching film at the National Archives\nWHAT WE NEED\nFilming is complete, we need your funding help to do post-production on the film and get it out in time for the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 8 flight.\nArchival Film: We need funding to transfer over 50 reels of 16mm and 35mm film from the National Archives in Washington DC, all relating to the year 1968 and the Apollo 8 mission.\nColor News Clips: Clips from CBS, ABC, and NBC are needed to illustrate what the world was seeing at the time.\nAnimation: We need funding to pay an animator so we can deliver exciting and photo-realistic animations of the Apollo 8 flight. These animations will help illustrate the journey of Apollo 8 as has never been done before.\nMusic: We aim to deliver an amazing musical experience to go with you on the journey around the Moon. We need funding to hire our composer, sound crew, and orchestral players to bring the music to life.\nFILM GOALS\nComplete post-production on the film and have it released by December 2018, in time for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 8 Mission.\nDeliver all rewards by December 2018.\nSpread awareness of what NASA did in 1968 and could do again if our space program were allowed to thrive like during the Apollo program.\nUpload all Archival film to Archive.org after the completion of the film.\nSTRETCH GOAL: $100,000\nOn February 24th we successfully funded our campaign at $50,000. This is the absolute minimum amount required. The closer we get towards our stretch goal, the better our film will be.\nThis means we won't have to give up scanning precious archival film, ensuring that every piece of historical evidence from this mission makes it's way onto the screen.\nWe can have our musical score recorded by a live orchestra, relying less on computer generated sounds, and more on the human touch that is synonymous with the mission of Apollo 8.\nOur animations can be done better, ensuring that the cinematic experience is ever more timeless.\nLINKS\nWebpage  \nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nREWARDS\n        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur only risk is not getting enough funding to complete the film.

Plastic flows through the small orifice, thanks to the pressure generated by the extruder pinch system. This high flow can reach a pressure as high as 250 times the atmospheric pressure (25 MPa).  \nWith plain plastic, any common metal can easily hold up against the flow. Unfortunately, once we start using plastic filaments with hard reinforcement fibers such as carbon and glass, things start to get more complicated; these reinforcement materials will scratch the inner wall of your nozzle orifice as they pass due to the flow and pressure. Both glass and carbon are known to be very hard, a lot harder than any metals, resulting in what is known as abrasion inside your nozzle.  \nThe more you print; the worse it gets...  \nThat\u2019s why we designed the Tungsten Carbide Nozzle: a state of the art 3d printer nozzle that offers good durability and performance for almost any 3d printer, such as Ultimaker, Raise3d, Prusa, Makerbot, Robo, LulzBot, Flashforge and many more.\nAvailable in different shapes and models for compatibility\n    We've used peek carbon fiber filament from 3dxtech and colorfabb XT-CF20\n  Prusa i3 MK2 with Tungsten Carbide nozzle using Colorfabb XT-CF20 filament\n  Zoom on 3d printed part to show the really high quality of prints using the Tungsten Carbide Nozzle.\n              Tungsten carbide is the ceramic of choice when it comes to wearing and abrasion resistance. It is not to be confounded with tungsten alloy, which is metal. For instance, cutting tools for steel and tool steel are made from tungsten carbide. It is also used extensively in the mining industry as a button insert for crushing rocks.  \nThe high thermal performance of the tungsten carbide keeps the nozzle tip hot, thus allowing faster printing speed without sacrificing the quality.  \nTungsten carbide has exceptional wear resistance due to its high hardness. Both the nozzle hole size and height will always stay the same, no matter how long or how hard you use it.\nHardness, Thermal conductivity and wear resistance comparison between common nozzle materials\n   To understand the difference between tungsten and tungsten carbide, we first need to know what is a ceramic and what is a metal.  \nCeramics are among the hardest material known. They are completely different from metal, even if some of them contains metal atoms.  \nSilicon  \nFor example, silicon carbide, a ceramic, is used in high temperature and high hardness applications such as abrasives, brakes and bulletproof vest. On the other hand, silicon, a metal, is used mostly in electronics as a semiconductor. It is rarely used as a metal for mechanical applications, except as a minor alloying element.  \nTungsten  \nTungsten, as a metal, is mostly used for its very high density as counterweight and vibration dampening application. It\u2019s also a refractory metal, meaning that it can handle very high temperature. \n  Steel has been meticulously chosen as the nozzle frame. It has all the properties required for a good nozzle body. It has excellent mechanical properties at high temperature. It means that the nozzle will stay strong, no matter the pressure generated by the extruder. This is a very critical parameter as the assembly reliability depends on the mechanical joint between the tungsten carbide insert and the nozzle frame.\nNot only steel is strong, it\u2019s also very thermally stable. It has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) from the standard materials used as nozzles. While tungsten carbide has a lower CTE, it is critical to opt for a similar value, as it reduces the gap created by the temperature increase. \nThe steel thermal conductivity might seem low compared to the other common options, but it\u2019s actually around 3 times higher than tool steel. Also, the critical zone for thermal conductivity is the nozzle tip, where the section area is very low, and the convection cooling power is high. Fortunately, the tungsten carbide tip will provide the proper thermal conductivity, leaving the steel disadvantage behind.\n  Comparing a reference brass nozzle from Ultimaker, the tungsten carbide nozzle is much easier to extrude. In fact, the output flow can be increased by around 80% while having the same results.\n A highly flow optimized nozzle reference design can still benefit greatly from having a carbide nozzle. The example above compare both solutions, and the tungsten carbide nozzle still greatly reduce the extrusion losses.\n     ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you!", "descp": "A simple gesture to help us fund this project.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 56 or more", "title": "Early Bird", "descp": "One (x1) Tungsten Carbide Nozzle.

We have 10 days left in the campaign and we're announcing a $15,000 STRETCH GOAL. Our annual touring schedule starts in June and $45,000 for the next stage of the engine refurbishment is needed to get our B-25 back in the air. We hope you will share our project with family and friends - thank you for your support!\nOn November 3, 2017, Yellow Rose was making the final approach during its last airshow appearance of the year when it suffered an engine failure. The crew safely landed the airplane, but upon inspection after shutdown it was determined that the engine would have to be removed and replaced before further flight. \nOf the thousands of B-25s built during World War II, only 27 remain operationally airworthy. The Central Texas Wing\u2019s B-25, Yellow Rose, has been a part of the CAF since 1979 and is the oldest airworthy B-25J.\nWith a full 2018 airshow schedule waiting, Central Texas Wing volunteers have spent hundreds of hours removing the engine and preparing it for overhaul.

The B-25 is best known for its central role in the Doolittle Raid, a retaliatory mission undertaken a mere 107 days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that turned the tide of the war.\nOperation 107 seeks to capture the \"can-do\" spirit of the short period between the assault on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid.\nPLAY\n\nTelling the story of the Doolittle Raid has long been an integral part of the Yellow Rose mission. It took 107 days to plan, test, and execute the Doolittle Raid. The total cost for a new engine for the airplane is $80,000.  Our goal is to raise that amount in 107 days, harnessing the urgency that made the Doolittle Raid possible so that people can continue to experience this piece of living history. More than $25,000 has already been contributed, but we need your help to reach our ultimate goal.  $10,000 gets us to the next milestone for the engine replacement - the amount required by the engine rebuilder to begin work on the engine.\nAmong the airmen involved in the Doolittle Raid was Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cole, who served as a co-pilot of the lead aircraft. Lt. Col. Cole went on to serve in the China-Burma-India Theater and as Operations Advisor to the Venezuelan Air Force. Today he is the last surviving Doolittle Raider. Operation 107 seeks to honor this living American legend and Lt. Col. Cole is enthusiastically backing the project.  \nLieutenant Colonel Richard (Dick) E.

These aircraft are housed in an authentic WW II hangar, one of the last of its kind.  Yellow Rose was part of the J series, which featured 14-18 machine guns specially positioned for low-flying attacks. Thanks to a complete restoration to wartime condition by members of the Wing, she has been operational for nearly 40 years, fulfilling our mission of education through aviation around the country.\nThe Commemorative Air Force is a 501(c)(3) organization and your contribution is tax-deductible in the U.S. to the extent allowed by law.  \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Central Texas Wing serves as a living museum for the city of San Marcos and the surrounding rural areas of Central Texas. The Wing seeks to inform and inspire by acquiring, restoring, and preserving a collection of combat aircraft flown by the armed services of the United States and select aircraft of other nations. \n\nThe Central Texas Wing has successfully mobilized significant numbers of volunteers in its decades of operation. With a volunteer force 150 members strong, the Wing has made significant progress in improving its hangar facility, carrying out effective community outreach, and adding aircraft to the fleet. \n\nThe CAF\u2019s confidence in approaching this engine replacement successfully is based on numerous similar projects that have been completed since the organization was founded in 1957. The CAF is the largest operator of vintage military aircraft in the world, supported by a staff of 35 people at its headquarters and 12,000 passionate volunteers around the country.\n\nIt is acknowledged that while flying a historic aircraft can be a source of unparalleled inspiration and educational value, it also carries a level of operational risk. This risk is mitigated by the CAF's robust safety management system and our long track record of safe operation of the B-25 - one of the most common bombers types from WWII represented by airworthy aircraft today.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "8 x 10 Photo of Doolittle B-25 Bomber", "descp": "Regular project updates plus an 8 x 10\u201d photo of the Doolittle Raider\u2019s B-25 Mitchell Bomber by renowned aviation artist Ga\u00ebtan Marie.

The journey will be told using original, production-made movie and television props, costumes and published artwork.   \n Broadly, the museum will consist of two sections. The first will be a detailed and personal overview of science-fiction in its entirety; the second an illustrated \u2018episode guide\u2019 of the classic series of \u2018Doctor Who\u2019. The sci-fi history section will tell the story of the genre with an eclectic array of original, screen-used and production made items that includes titles such as \u2018Dune\u2019, \u2018Star Wars\u2019, \u20182010\u2019, \u2018Planet of the Apes\u2019 and \u2018The Outer Limits\u2019\u2026to name a but few. \nJust a very few of the characters you can expect to meet once the museum opens...\nAlso incorporated is an exciting collection featuring production pieces from the \u2018Marvel\u2019 cinematic universe, to highlight the impact of comics on the genre. In a special display, you will find original items dating back to the early days of the 'X-Men' franchise and more recently, from the new wave of Marvel movies such as 'The Avengers'. Also to be included is a fascinating selection of original animation cels featuring a 'rogues-gallery' of well known (and more obscure!) Marvel heroes and villains!\nExamples of the vibrant, original animation cels that will be displayed alongside the production made, Marvel Movie prop collection!\nThe second section, dedicated to the history of the classic \u2018Doctor Who\u2019 television series, will be illustrated with one of the largest collections of surviving, original, screen-used items currently in the UK. The story of the original series will be told as an \u2018Episode Guide\u2019, with as many of the original stories illustrated with a prop, costume, production made item or published artwork.  \nJust a small sample of some of the original artefacts from the 'Classic Doctor Who' section of the museum.\nIncluded will be a substantial collection of published work by prominent \u2018Who\u2019 artist Andrew Skilleter (who has supported the project since its inception). The intention is to give the visitor a comprehensive overview and authentic experience of the seminal, original series.\nA sample of the original published paintings of legendary artist Andrew Skilleter, that will help visualise the story of classic 'Doctor Who'.\nThe museum won\u2019t be \u2018just\u2019 a collection on display. I have been carefully selecting each addition to construct a \u2018visual narrative\u2019 of the genre. The focus is upon the ideas and writers who have crafted the story of science-fiction alongside the artists and makers who have skilfully realised these concepts in a broad variety of media. This flight of the imagination is to be chronological: an exciting and nostalgic one for the hardened fan and hopefully educational and inspiring for those either new to the genre, or just passing through. In time, I hope to invite guests to the museum to give special talks and signings, providing a friendly and intimate sci-fi hub for the enthusiast. \nProps from across Sci-Fi history: 'The Time Machine', 'Tron', 'Planet Robot', 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes' and 'The Force Awakens'.\nWhy I need your support\nMaking a permanent museum to open to the public is quite an undertaking for an individual. More than just a visitor attraction, at its heart, the project is preserving popular, cultural heritage for future generations. Beyond the artefacts, the building of the museum itself is a Georgian townhouse (Grade 2 listed) and has required considerable repair in readiness for opening as a museum (and safely housing fragile artefacts). I have accomplished (and self funded) a great deal myself over nearly a three year period, but to get the museum open this August (Gulp!), some financial assistance would advance the time-frame massively (to get help to tackle some of the more specialist work and purchase expensive materials like safety glass).\nYour money will pay for the following:\nA bespoke wooden floor (the stone floor is centuries old and an original, listed feature of the building. It is also an uneven and potentially unsafe surface to walk on. Creating a level and safe wooden floor on top of this is essential). I have built two thirds of the wooden floor already- on a concrete surface...this final section on the listed slabs is a little more tricky...and I need more timber!!!\nA professional electrician to install a heating system to ensure a consistent temperature is maintained for both visitors and long-term preservation of the collection.\nSafety glass to complete the 'display bays' that the props will be standing in- essential to maintain the collection.\nHelp with constructing the pathway leading to the museum door! Remember- this is a Georgian house, so the front of the building has been relatively unchanged for centuries! To ensure visitor safety, I want to construct an even walkway up to the museum, complete with a banister suitable for anyone a little unstable on their legs. \nSignage! The museum needs signs!  These will be outside the museum so that everyone can clearly see we're here!\nWhat I\u2019ve achieved so far\u2026  \n1: Preservation - The Collection  \nTo prepare and make the museum a reality has required a substantial work load and personal commitment. As a lifelong science-fiction enthusiast and artist, I have collected original props and costumes for over two decades. This was never \u2018for fiscal value\u2019 but because these items had a profound personal significance; resonating with childhood memories (and not just mine, but those of many others who had also shared in their stories). In many cases, the props had not been cared for and (especially in the case of BBC sourced material) required immediate attention to ensure their survival. As a result, I have spent literally years repairing and restoring items: moisturising and sealing old, fragile rubber pieces and in some extreme cases, sculpting missing replacement sections a-fresh. \nRestoring the surviving 'Red Terrileptil' from 'Doctor Who'...here sculpting a new neck section!\nOnce a prop is stable, it next needs a bespoke stand for support, enabling it to be displayed effectively. I have been steadily making these by hand to save on costs (as each is completely different as no two props are the same).  The final step in readying a prop for museum display involves thorough research to create again, a bespoke information plaque to accompany it.\nMyself sculpting in 'eyes' to actor Michael Chiklis' 'Thing' mask from Marvel's 'Fantastic Four' (2005).\n2: The Building - Planning, Restoration & Construction\nNearly three years ago (and with luck firmly on my side), my partner and I were able to purchase the museum premises. The catch was that they needed a lot of work. In addition, the building is a Grade 2 listed Georgian townhouse and it came with strict planning restrictions. My initial task was to ensure that I could secure all the necessary planning permissions (enabling minimal alterations) and for the building to be able to open as a museum. A year later and all the relevant planning was secured with the blessing of historical building officers! \nDespite no significant structural change, the ground-floor cellar (that will house the collection and \u2018become\u2019 the museum) has still required extensive work that I have carried out mostly myself. Two jobs have been particularly time intensive: restoring the 300-year old stonework (including a vaulted room) and preventing water ingress. When we first moved into the property there was basically a pond where the museum collection is going(!) and the centuries old lyme mortar was crumbling and damp. In the two years since the project began, I have pulled down the original ceiling, nearly completed re-pointing the stonework in both rooms and solved several of the water problems involved in the build. It felt essential to \u2018strip back\u2019 the two rooms to achieve a \u2018blank slate\u2019 from which to develop the new museum. \nSorting out the beams....all listed...so adding the new ceiling has had to be done with great care!\nThe work outlined above has taken a lot of personal dedication and time. Ultimately, it has had to be done around my teaching (I still have to eat and keep the roof over our heads!) and family commitments. Owing to a shortage of time, I soon realised that I needed to devote more to the project and hence took action last summer going part-time (after twenty years full-time teaching). Whilst this necessitated losing some income, the time to devote to the various tasks involved in making the museum a reality was essential. Ultimately- help with completing the cellar is where your money will be spent.\nOne of the corridors coming to life....\nSo in summary- I'm asking you to become part of and for help to, construct what will become the North of England's only permanent museum dedicated to the history of science-fiction. At a local level, the museum will help our village and it's surrounding area, boosting visitor numbers and showing them what a stunning part of the world the Allen Valley truly is. For genre enthusiasts, it will hopefully become a destination, a meeting place and an opportunity to see artefacts from our shared history of Sci-Fi first hand. For children; they will be able to meet creatures of the imagination and learn of the story of this most wonderful genre.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThankfully, I have worked very hard to ensure the risks associated with this project are negligible. The major problem facing a small museum is, once open, ensuring it stays that way! This is something I have given much consideration. Here\u2019s the plan\u2026.\n\n1: The Museum Building - My family and I live in and own the museum premises. We have no mortgage. This is a major positive for the fledgling museum. Ultimately, this means that we don\u2019t have to find a monthly rent, greatly reducing overheads. It also means that we can \u2018weather\u2019 quiet spells when visitor numbers are lower. \n\n2: Staffing - I will be personally \u2018manning\u2019 the museum, so again overheads are negligible. I have other willing family members nearby to help should I ever need it, to ensure \u2018the doors open\u2019!\n\n3: Hours of opening \u2026and keeping it open! - For the first two years of the museum, I intend to continue to teach part-time. The museum will be open all year at weekends plus one weekday and seven days a week during all the school holidays. This will enable me to teach for three days per week- important, as this will cover my living overheads. This means that the museum will be able to sustain \u2018quiet periods\u2019 without affecting my ability to pay the bills and feed my family! My fianc\u00e9e also works from the museum building as a private psychotherapist- again helping feed the family! As much as I would like to be able to open the museum seven days a week all year from the start, to give the project the best chance , having key living expenses in place and independent of it, will remove any risks involved in having to make \u2018X amount\u2019 each month. As time progresses, my long-term plan is to steadily increase opening times as word of the museum spreads (and indeed develop a programme of talks and school workshops utilising the collection to teach and inspire children).\n\n4: Building work - Thankfully, I am a fairly handy person, so maintenance of the building, I can manage largely myself. The space itself is fairly straightforward and having carried out much of the museum restoration, I am well placed to maintain it. Your money will be going directly into the essential infrastructure that I need assistance with, but again, I will be working alongside electricians, etc. to complete my understanding of the museum building.\n\n5: Curation - I am now an experienced artist who works in both 2-D and 3-D media. Always being open to developing new skills has enabled me to tackle the complex and varied work involved in repairing and preserving the museum collection. This has, once more, helped the museum become a reality as I haven\u2019t needed to spend extra money on caring for and the restoration of, the prop collection itself. I also build all the museum stands- again a big money saver, keeping outgoings to a minimum. Finally, I have also taught creative ICT for some years and so am able to manage the Museum website, again reducing outgoings.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Donor Shout-out!", "descp": "- Facebook Shout-out!\n- A place on the website supporters page!\n- Join our e-newsletter!\nThank you friend!

The plaques take a little longer as each artefact needs to be thoroughly researched, screen images gathered.

Please note, colors may vary.\nREWARDS\nAbout Me & How Sheer Fun For Cats Came to Be\nI\u2019ve loved animals since I was a little girl. Their innocence and curiosity has always fascinated me. As an adult, I represented foster children in the court system as a Guardian Ad Litem for many years. One day when I arrived to visit several foster children, the kids pulled me into the backyard where they had found 3 tiny kittens. The mother had been hit by a car and her babies were helpless and vulnerable. I was incredibly moved by these children, with no permanent home of their own, who were so concerned for these orphaned kittens.\nI brought all of the kittens home with me and bottle fed them until they were strong enough and old enough for me to find them forever homes. I adopted one of these kittens and named him Trooper.\nI\u2019d grown up with dogs mostly and had never really considered myself a cat person. Trooper changed all that. He opened my eyes to how amazing these beautiful creatures are and how devoted and loving they are as pets, and more importantly, family members.\nI owned a pet sitting business for many years and saw that my clients' cats, like my own, had toys EVERYWHERE, but had no interest in playing with them. One day I started laying tissue paper on top of the toys and all of a sudden, the cats became much more interested in the toys. Of course, I'd return to find shreds of paper all over the floor! I noticed my cats loved to play in and out of the sheer curtains I had in my bedroom, that is until one day the entire rod and curtain pulled out of the wall and fell on the floor. It was at that moment I came up with the idea for Sheer Fun For Cats. \nTrooper loved this product. He especially enjoyed hiding under or behind the sheer while stalking his favorite toy. Maybe he thought it made him invisible to his prey or maybe he just liked a fun game of hide and seek. The sheer made all of his toys new again. Every time I moved it from under a table to a chair, from one room to the next, it was as if I\u2019d given him a shiny, new toy.\nWhen Trooper passed away from cancer two years ago, I made myself (and Trooper) a promise to share this toy with as many cats and the people who love them as I could.\nPlease help me in bringing Sheer Fun For Cats to the 85 million house cats in America!\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to our enthusiastic team of test cats.

Our course aims to provide expertise which you can directly transfer in your day to day Jobs.\nMachine Learning\u2019s Potential To Change The World\nWhere Machine Learning can be used\nMachine Learning offers a slew of different opportunities in multiple sectors including Business, Medicine, Marketing, etc. From credit card fraud detection to offering a more personalized marketing experience, machine learning can not only help but will also change the way we surf the web, drive our cars and maybe even shower.\nMachine Learning is currently one of the hottest trends on the market with companies big and small using learning algorithms to offer a more personalised user experience for their customers.\nWhat This Course Offers\nMachine Learning comes with a lot of potential and it doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping any time soon. As technology gets smarter and better, so will your algorithms. If you\u2019ve always wanted to help build a more futuristic world, then this is your chance. We have designed the perfect course for helping you get started with machine learning by helping you understand the key algorithms that are used when writing machine learning programs.\nThis course won\u2019t focus on the theory or the boring aspects of machine learning, but instead you will actually build your own apps. You will learn how to write the codes and then see them in action. Using 5 projects (Now 10 projects) that range from simple to more complex ones, you\u2019ll actually learn how to think like a machine learning expert.\nWhy This Course?\nThis course has been designed keeping in mind all types of learners. It includes something for everyone, from newbies to even advanced programmers. The course focuses on helping you actually learn how to code and write the algorithms, instead of simply focusing on the theoretical or the boring aspects of Machine Learning.\nThe syllabus has been curated by experts and dedicates itself to bringing you the best approach approach to ML. The course has an example-based approach and will help you become more comfortable applying algorithms to real world problems. The course will focus on building 10 projects from scratch that will not only familiarize you with ML algorithms, but also will help you learn exactly how to use them.\nTentative 10 Projects\nFirst 5 New Projects are the additional projects which will be Added to the Course as we reached our First stretch goal.\nProject 1 \u2013 Markov Models and K-Nearest Neighbor Approaches to Classifying DNA Sequences\nClassifying DNA\n In this tutorial, we will explore the world of bioinformatics by using Markov models and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms to classify E. Coli DNA sequences. This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (\u201cbase-pairs\u201d) each.\nMarkov Models and K-Nearest Neighbor\nProject 2 \u2013 Getting Started with Natural Language Processing In Python\nNatural Language Processing\nHere we will cover the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology, including tokenizing words and sentences, part of speech identification and tagging, and phrase chunking. After this project, the student should have the necessary foundation to begin building and deploying machine learning algorithms for natural language processing.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) Methodology\nProject 3 \u2013 Obtaining Near State-of-the-Art Performance on Object Recognition Tasks Using Deep Learning\nObject Recognition\n Using the CIFAR-10 object recognition dataset as a benchmark, we will implement a recently published deep neural network that can obtain similar results to state-of-the-art networks, despite having less parameters and smaller computational requirements.\nDeep Learning\nProject 4 \u2013 Image Super Resolution with the SRCNN\nSuper Resolution\nIn this tutorial, we will implement and use a Tensorflow version of the Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) to improve the image quality of degraded images.\nSuper Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN)\nProject 5 \u2013 Natural Language Processing: Text Classification\nText Classification\nBuilding on the foundation developed in the previous project, this tutorial will dive deeper into Natural Language Processing. We will solve a text classification task using multiple classification algorithms, including a Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, SGD classifier, and linear support vector classifier (SVC).\nProject 6 \u2013 Stock Market Clustering Project\nThis project will use a K-means clustering algorithm to identify related companies by finding correlations among stock market movements over a given time span. It will use the open source data from the Yahoo Finance Python module. Also, in this project you are going to do a PCA dimensionality reduction to plot the data on a 2D plot. \nK-means clustering algorithm\nProject 7 \u2013 Breast Cancer Detection\nBreast Cancer Detection\nThis second project will build a program to help detect breast cancer malignancies by using a support vector machine. You are also going to use the K-nearest neighbour algorithm to compare and contrast performance with the support vector machine.\nK-nearest neighbour algorithm\nProject 8 \u2013 Board Game Review\nBoard Game Review\nThis project is actually going to be predicting board game reviews and in this project you are going to predict the average reviews on a board game based on characteristics such as difficulty, length, number of players. This will be accomplished by performing linear regression analysis.\nLinear Regression Analysis\nProject 9 \u2013 Credit Card Fraud Detection\nIn this project, you are going to do a credit card fraud detection and going to focus on anomaly detection by using probability densities.\nAnomaly Detection by Using Probability Densities\nProject 10 \u2013 Diabetes Onset Detection\nThis final project is going to be a diabetes onset detection with deep learning grid search. In this project, you will fine-tune a deep learning neural network by performing a grid search. The network will be used to detect the onset of diabetes based on patient data.\nDeep Learning Neural Network\nAbout the Company - Eduonix Learning Solutions\nEduonix learning Solutions is the premier training and skill development organization which was started with a vision to bring world class training content, pedagogy and best learning practices to everyone's doorsteps .
