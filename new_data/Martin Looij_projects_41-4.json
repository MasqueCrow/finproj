Store the bone or add it to a dino display you're preparing in your lab!\n Each turn, you have three energy points to spend moving around the site, collecting plaster, digging through layers of terrain, and extracting fossils. \n As you remove Terrain tiles from the board, you claim the tile for the precious fragments (eggshells, footprints, and amber) found on them. They can be used to buy helpful Tools or Supplies. \n Sometimes you'll find lost rock hammers in the dirt... return them to the display to learn game-changing skills as a reward! \n You can claim a dinosaur to your lab as long as you have at least one of its required bones. Your lab can only hold one dinosaur at a time, so you must score your dinosaur before taking another.  \n The plaster pool works as a timer for the game. Each time it's exhausted, an Event takes place that may have positive or negative effects on the game. Once the last pool runs out, game end is trigged. You earn points for the Tools and Supplies you've claimed and the different sets of dinosaurs you've collected throughout the game.  \n Ready to dig in deep?

The Rook, never one to shy away from the precarious, has decided to take down a string of casinos. But this is no office job - tougher safes, tightened security - and perhaps worst of all, you'll be working during the day!  The team will have to dress-up (or dress-down) to go unnoticed in the casino crowds.  You'll need to avoid making a commotion or taking too much heat before cracking the safe and escaping through whatever insane plan the Rook has dreamed up. \nThe original Burgle Bros was Kickstarted back in 2015 and since has become a sleeper hit in the boardgame world, winning various awards and multiple glowing reviews.  It even snuck past the guards to make it to the top 200 games on BoardGameGeek! The game have even been converted to a top-rated app, available on iOS, Android and Steam.\n Burgle Bros 2 is a 1-4 player cooperative game that plays in 60 min.\n Burgle Bros 2: The Casino Capers is not an expansion - it's a whole new game with all new ways to run a successful heist. While you'll still need to work together to explore the building and avoid getting caught, nearly every aspect of Burgle Bros has been reinvented for an even more exciting caper.\n Gear - Each players now has their own unique kit of tools that can be used during ANY player's turn.  You're no longer forced to wait until your turn before you can jump in and save the day, adding a whole new level of coordinated plays.\n New Rooms - The Pool, Blackjack table, Buffet, Dance Floor - casino rooms are a new mix of crazy and challenging effects that will keep you on your toes.\n Hidden Perks & Pitfalls - Chips are placed on rooms throughout the casino for additional one-time effects - some of them reward bold moves, and others punish them!\n Doors - In addition to walls, locked doors block your path on the casino floor.  The team can crack doors easy - the real question is, should you leave them open? \n Hunt Mode - No more moving slowly and cautiously during the heist.  Take too long and the bouncers will start hunting you. \n Finales - Cracking the safe is only step one. Now each games concludes with a big twist ending. What will the team have to do to make it out with a grand piano slowing you down, or with the swat team on your tail?\n Unlock New Content - Each time you complete a Finale, open the next sealed scenario, filled with new challenges, and new tools to get the job done.\nThis list is just scratching the surface.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs.

We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date.

Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience.

Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

Mike DePasquale stepped up and answered a random Facebook post to produce a ton of player trayz, (and FAST!) with his buddy Oscar Valera when we needed for review. John Popson (of Effin Cool Minis) - made the best \"where did you get those??\" minis and made sure our models were spot on.\nLORE/PUZZLES/WEBSITE - Astrid Dalmady was a key force on our team during development, helping shape this game from the ground up, art finding (especially the Darkness!), rule breaking, lore writing!

It is not a dwarf, nor does it seem to be one of the ghosts who haunt the realm of Eldervale. It forms itself out of whatever earth and sticks and rocks lay about. When I try to strike it with my hammer, it simply collapses in a cloud of debris, and my hammer harmlessly strikes the ground. But my relief at dispersing it is short lived, for when I turn around, there it is again. It is always watching\u2026 so I will call it the Watcher.\nThe Watcher may not be a ghost, but it must be communicating with them. The spirits always know where to find us and how to block our actions. The Watcher only watches, but I fear it is the true source of danger.\nI have tried to dispel the Watcher with magic \u2013 burn it with fireballs, strike it with lightning, flee from it in liquid form \u2013 all to no avail.

To send us a message please click here or on this banner:\nIt's rare to be able to work on something you love.\nThis is what happened with On the Underground. Long out of print, it was a favourite in our gaming group and when we realized that the rights were available, we reached out to Sebastian Bleasdale and, well, here we are!\nThe massive network of London Underground stations makes up one of the most complex transportation systems in the world, and On the Underground challenges you to develop it. \nBuild the most successful lines, connect them to landmarks and attract passenger traffic! \nOn the Underground is a game for players who love to create.\nWhile seemingly a simple game, the strategic depth takes you beyond other network-building games such as Ticket to Ride, Thurn & Taxis and Through the Desert.\nBesides each game being different due to the on-board objectives, the Passenger introduces a singular challenge to each turn of the game, inviting you to participate (and earn points) even when it is not your turn.\nThis edition of On the Underground includes the all-new Berlin map, a challenging change of pace for those who have played the original London one, which has also been updated to match the real-life Underground and improve gameplay.\nBesides adding Berlin and improving the art and graphic design, we took the opportunity to perfect the contents of the game, and even more so for the Deluxe edition that we hope to create with your support!\nWe decided early on to include more than one Passenger shape options, and thus the five custom-shaped tokens were born. Three of them (wheelchair user, elderly and pregnant) were kindly provided by Ian O'Toole and Alban Viard.\nIn addition, we felt the need to do even more to thank you for your support, and with  something truly special. That is why we created the transparent acrylic token, and we gave it a shape that may be familiar to our previous backers...\nFinally, we decided to wrap the whole package up in something even more \"Deluxe\", a beautiful slip case that will have your box shining amongst others on your shelf - literally. The wraparound UV coating on the water-colour graphical elements gives it an elegant sheen that stands out.\nThe Deluxe edition will be available through this campaign (including any retail backers - see below) and through events where we participate.\nWe also wanted to make sure that we offer the basic edition of the game to those who do not want improved components. There are no other differences between the two editions.\nNote that the included rulebook for any basic edition copies fulfilled as part of this campaign may depict Deluxe components.\nIn On the Underground, players compete to build the most valuable and convenient transportation network in London or Berlin. Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.\n At the beginning of each turn, 4 Destination cards are facing up, corresponding to stations on the map. A player\u2019s turn consists of taking four actions, followed by the Passenger\u2019s movement.\nAfter the player\u2019s turn, the Passenger token is moved along built lines and avoiding empty track spaces as much as possible, in order to reach 1 or 2 Destination stations.\n The Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, and then play passes to the next player in clockwise order.\nPlayers score points in two ways:\n\u2022 By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by building a circular line in London, or by collecting Landmark tiles in Berlin.\n\u2022 By having the Passenger use their lines when moving.\nThe game is over after all Destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns.\nThe player that has earned the most points is the winner, having built the most valuable network On the Underground!\nYou can download the rules of the game here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026):\n On_the_Underground_rules_EN_016_compressed.pdf\nPlease download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not be displayed properly.

EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 35 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 39 USD / 52 CAD / 57 AUD / 39 CHF / 4288 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe can also not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid. Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list.\nWe expect to have tracking for the USA, but not for anywhere else. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. We do not expect to be sending tracking codes when the games are shipped.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or at any other convention.\n We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained.\nCosts\nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for the period of the campaign. It includes costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them.\nEU: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD\nUSA: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD\nWorldwide: 14 USD. Real cost: At least 18-28 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRetailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/on-the-underground-london-berlin/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations\nThis offer is available only to retailers which have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. Stores with event space will be prioritized and all entities and locations will be verified.\nOnline-only retailers will be considered in territories where there no physical retailers have backed the campaign.\nFulfillment will be conducted in the following steps:\n1. Individual backers\n2. Physical stores\n3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step\nThere will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit.\nOnly retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order the game, should there be any stock available, for at least 6 months after fulfillment has commenced.\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nRetail availability: We pledge that, along with the exception of a limited number of retail backer and convention copies, your games will arrive long before the game (the basic edition) is available through wide distribution.\nSPIEL availability: Should production be completed in time, we plan to airship a limited number of copies to Essen, where we will be selling them. As mentioned above, we can not offer pickup there or at any other convention, and we can not guarantee availability.\nGame Design: Sebastian Bleasdale\nIllustration: Viktor Csete\nGraphic Design: Viktor Csete\nRules Editing: Paul Grogan\nTrailer: Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4\nTabletopia Implementation: Viktor Csete\nSpecial Thanks: JKLM & Rio Grande Games, Teppo Saarinen, the JunaCon crew, Ian O'Toole, Alban Viard, Toni Heinonen, Kira Peavley, David Turczi, John Albertson, Adrian & Sandie Whipp, Brett Gilbert, Matthew Dunstan, Tom Vasel, Luke Hector, Matt Evans, Joel Wright, Martyn Poole, Derek & Lizzie Funhouser, Nick Welford, Antti Punavaara, and the many, many playtesters that helped  create (and re-create!)

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\nA link to the Pledge Manager for Late Pledges will be coming soon!\nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com. \nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. \nWe successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. In the spring of 2018 we Kickstarted To The Barricades!, adding solo and CoOp play and two additional Quests, which were delivered in the spring of 2019.\nNew Horizons\nAfter the climactic battle in Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World, the Champions are dispersed by the forces of wild magic. One awakens in a far realm of endless sands. Another discovers himself in a strange new city where he may learn the fate of his people.\nThe world of Thunderstone Quest is even larger than we could ever imagine. It's time to explore these New Horizons.\nBack the campaign TODAY to begin or continue your Thunderstone Quest adventure!\nDue to the overwhelming support of the community, the $400,000 Stretch Goal has been Achieved! \nWe will add the 4th Level Heroes Add-on to all New Horizons Rewards (and Rewards that include New Horizons)! Congratulations to everyone who helped rally the community to reach this HUGE goal!\nBecause of Kickstarter's rules, we cannot change the description of the Rewards to note that the 4th Level Heroes have been added.\n(Backers who choose the \"Your Inventory is Full\" Reward will be issued a $25 credit in the Pledge Manager)\nThis Kickstarter features two new Quests: Quest 8: Vengeful Sands and Quest 9: Clockwork Destiny, both designed by Bryan Reese with story written by Brett Satkowiak. \nAll Quests including Vengeful Sands and Clockwork Destiny can be played in either Barricades Mode or Competitive Mode. \nThis campaign also includes a special promo pack for Barricades Mode: Ezuzrius' Lair (estimated MSRP $9.99) included in the New Horizons Reward (and all Rewards that contain the New Horizons reward)! Ezuzrius' Lair is a Kickstarter Early Access release, meaning that Kickstarter backers will get this promotional pack before it is available for sale. At this time we do not have a planned retail release for this item. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - New Horizons which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, Champion + Barricades + New Horizons which combines all three Kickstarter Rewards into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes everything we make for Thunderstone Quest.\nYour Inventory is Full!\n(If you have a Thunderstone Quest base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and did not back To the Barricades, you will be able to add it as an Add-on in the Pledge Manager with your New Horizons pledge.)\nWe are also offering a limited quantity of Expedited Rewards. Because of the long lead time for production of the new content in this Kickstarter we will not be able to deliver the new content until next year. But we have set aside a limited quantity of Champion and Barricades components so that we can swiftly manufacture enough units for delivery this November! \nNew Horizons and Add-ons to Expedited orders will ship next year with the rest of the Rewards.\nNote for Expedited Backers: After the campaign ends, you can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Expedited components. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status.\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your shipment Expedited.\nThis campaign also includes a special Add-on: 4th Level Heroes! The 4th Level Heroes bring more power and abilities to the game.\nNote to all Backers:  The Champion/To the Barricades! boxes contain space to hold these two new Quests and they will be shipped without the individual boxes shown in the graphics for this campaign. If you would like to order the boxes for these Quests they'll be available for a small fee as Add-ons in the Pledge Manager.\nNote to Non-English Speakers: All the contents of this campaign are in English only. AEG is working with a team of international partners on future campaigns for non-English language support which we'll be announcing later in 2019.\n Benefits to this Campaign: \nYou will get the product at a discount to the suggested retail price ($39.99 x 2 Quests + an estimated $9.99 for Ezuzuris' Lair)\nYou'll get the New Horizons content before the normal retail release\nYou'll get the Ezuzrius' Lair Promo Pack\nYou'll get the 4th Level Heroes Add-on\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward you will receive Kickstarter Exclusive Content\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward and/or the To the Barricades Reward you'll get the large boxes & storage system with those Rewards\nQualified Brick & Mortar Retail Stores please see the Kick It Here section below for details on the Kick It Here Reward. \nVengeful Sands Previews\nWe are pleased to showcase some of the cards from Quest 8: Vengeful Sands here on the Kickstarter Campaign page.

In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nIn Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people (up to 6 people with To The Barricades content!) to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.  \nYou can add funds to your pledge as described in the graphic above which will be automatically credited to your account in the Pledge Manager. Or, you can wait until the Pledge Manager opens and purchase Add-ons directly, paying the balance due on your order in the Pledge Manager instead. There is no difference in price or availability. Altering your pledge on Kickstarter is convenient and it helps us grow the total amount pledged which has a positive effect for attracting more Backers.\nTo the Barricades (not shown)\nYou will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping & Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won't be able to ship them Expedited unless they're included in an Expedited Reward.\nEpic Thunderstone Support for Champion: \nThis is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion Rewards. The Champion Reward does not include an extra copy of every card for Epic Thunderstone use.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play invented by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook. You can read those rules in the Rulebook link above!\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll the content in To The Barricades! and all new content for New Horizons in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nYou'll need a base copy of Thunderstone Quest (Champion, Adventurer or Retail) to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the base game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\n4th Level Heroes\nNOTE: The campaign has achieved it's $400,000 Stretch Goal and this Add-on will automatically be included in every New Horizons Reward! You do not need to pay extra to get this Stretch Goal benefit!\nThis is a special deck of cards which adds a 4th experience level to every Hero in the game from Quests 1-9 as well as the extra Heroes released with the Champion box. There are over fifty 4th Level Heroes in this package!\nThere will be 2 copies of each 4th level hero, one for use in normal Competitive and Barricades Mode play, and a second for use in Epic Thunderstone mode.\nQuest 2: Total Eclipse of the Sun\nThis Add-on is for people who have purchased the Retail Base Set and did not back either of the previous Kickstarters. The Champion Reward contains a Quest which is Kickstarter Exclusive and is not available in retail stores as a stand-alone purchase. You can buy that Quest via this Add-on.\nUpdate: 17 June: Based on a suggestion from backer @Chris, we're upgrading this Add-on to include all the additional promo cards added to the Champion Reward during the 1st Kickstarter so that you will be able to get every card released for Thunderstone Quest in the Champion unit if you get this Add-on, the Retail Base and the retail release of Quest 4 and Quest 5!\nThis change will add about 50 more cards to this Add-on at no additional charge!\nPlease Note: If you have or are buying the Champion Reward, or if you bought the Adventurer Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, you already have this Quest.\nThe Quest will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the New Horizons pledge level to order this Add-on.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern. It is substantially smaller than the board included in the main game. \nThe Playmat is double-sided. One side is the \"day\" layout for competitive play. And the reverse is the \"night\" side with spaces for the Barricades board overlays, showing the Village partially destroyed. The \"night\" side is intentionally darker than the day side to reflect the perilous condition of the Village!\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within either the Champion or the To The Barricades box, box, rolled up. The length is 300 mm.\nPremium Sleeves\nThese are AEG Premium Sleeves, also used in Mystic Vale, Edge of Darkness, and Valley of the Kings Premium. They have an excellent reputation for durability!\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 2 more packs to sleeve the all the new content in To the Barricades! including randomizers, Epic support cards, the 5th and 6th player support and other cards provided for Barricades Mode.\nYou will need 2 packs total to sleeve all the content in New Horizons.\nTo sleeve everything you'll need 8 packs of sleeves.\nYou can store all 9 Quests, starting cards, Kickstarter exclusive cards, and Epic support cards, sleeved, in the Champion and To the Barricades boxes. Space is also available for the rolled up playmat and all other game components. \nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected an Expedited reward you will receive your Champion and To The Barricades boxes in an expedited early shipment in November. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nNext year when the rest of the Kickstarter Rewards for this campaign are delivered Expedited backers will get all the rest of their order including any Add-ons they have ordered in a 2nd shipment.\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nUnited States & Canadian Backers: As you may know the Administration is preparing to implement a 25% import tariff on goods shipped to the US from China. We have estimated the impact these tariffs will have on the importation of your Rewards and have adjusted the costs of the Rewards and the Shipping & Handling estimates accordingly. There will be no additional charge made for the tariffs if and when they are imposed.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA.\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons at 33lbs/15kg. The following estimates are for both the regular and Expedited Rewards.\nThe following chart also provides estimates for shipping Your Inventory is Full without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Your Inventory Is Full at 47lbs/21kg\nUSA: Shipping & Handling included\nCANADA: $15\nEUROPE: Shipping & Handling included to Germany. $15 to EU + UK, Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $20 to Australia. $60 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $60\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping New Horizons without Add-Ons.

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nThe Kick It Here program is open to brick & mortar retail stores who generate a meaningful percentage of their sales from tabletop games. Kick It Here products may not be resold on the internet. AEG reserves the right to disqualify any backer from this promotion at its sole discretion.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to with the same Shipping & Handling costs as regular Backers.\nYou have to back this project at the Kick It Here Reward level to get the Kick It Here pricing and delivery. \nIf you select the $66 Kick It Here Reward level you will be eligible to make the full $195 purchase for 6 units of New Horizons in the Pledge Manager. The $66 you pay on Kickstarter will automatically be credited to your account as a pre-payment.\nAccess to Champion & Barricades Rewards: You will be able to order the Champion and Barricades Rewards as Add-ons to your Kick It Here order. However, due to the high cost of manufacturing these items we cannot offer a discount to the Kickstarter price; your price for Champion will be $120 per unit, and your price for Barricades will be $60. Due to the extremely large size of these boxes and their substantial weight they are usually shipped individually which means there's no meaningful savings on shipping for bulk orders.\nAccess to the Neoprene Playmat, Epic Support, 4th Level Heroes, Quest 2, and AEG Premium Sleeves: All of these Add-ons will be available for purchase via the Kick It Here program with a small discount from the Add-on prices as listed. You will be able to view these prices in the Pledge Manager.\nPlease Note: If you do not qualify as a brick & mortar retail store, or you fail to complete your order in the Pledge Manager, AEG can only refund you 92% of the amount you pledge. The other 8% is lost to unrecoverable Kickstarter fees.\nGroup Buys: AEG does not do group buys or offer increased discounts on Reward prices or shipping for multiple orders.\nKick It Here orders will ship at the same time as the other Kickstarter Rewards.\nAEG would like to thank the following experts who helped make this campaign possible: \nMike Elliott, Original Design & Development of Thunderstone\nMike Elliott, Bryan Reese & Mark Wootton, Design & Development of Thunderstone Quest\nByan Reese & Satkowiak for design and writing for Quest 8 & 9\nMatt Paquette, Kickstarter Campaign Page graphics\nErick Santz, producer for animated game segment in the campaign video\nJohnny Stone, voice work for the main campaign video\nHonor at Last by Hector Posser; Production music courtesy of www.epidemicsound.com \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the end of the campaign we will cancel and refund any pledge of less than $50.

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Then they'll begin picking & packing orders for pickup by the carriers. When the carrier picks up you may or may not receive an email telling you that an order is scheduled to ship. Orders will ship as the Depots process the orders, which may not all happen at the same time so some people may get orders while others are still unshipped.\n\n3: When all shipments from all Depots have finished, the logistics partner will receive tracking numbers for all packages, which are then transmitted to us. Until that step, we . When we receive the tracking information we will email all customers. We will also upload those tracking numbers into the pledge manager which MAY trigger an additional email notification to you that your order has \"shipped\".

Chinese factories close in January for the Lunar New Year, when many workers return home to their ancestral villages, celebrate with family & friends, and then travel back to their places of employment. This year, the Chinese Government has declared that the Lunar New Year holiday period will be extended, and movement inside of China has been restricted. All of the factories that we work with have been impacted.\n\nAs a result of these policies, work we expected to be underway at this time on your Kickstarter Rewards is on hold. When the factories re-open and travel is again permitted we expect that there will be a substantial backlog of work which will further impact the timing of the delivery of your Rewards.\n\nDue to the fluid and uncertain nature of the Chinese manufacturing infrastructure we cannot at this time provide firm estimates of when your Rewards will ship to you. We will continue to update you as we know more about the timing of production and fulfillment. Today, we believe that Rewards will be delayed at least one month from our original estimates.\n\nWe're sincerely sorry for these delays and the ripple effects they'll cause for other projects in the Thunderstone Quest and Edge of Darkness lines. We're working with our Chinese factories to ensure that when the restart happens we'll be able to communicate back to all our backers what our revised timelines will be.\n\nYou can always see the most current information we have about our Kickstarter projects by visiting our Kickstarter page:\n\n\n\nThis page will be updated as soon as we have new information on any project.\n\nIf after reading this message you have further questions please contact and we'll be happy to help!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "January Update", "update_content": "Champions of Thunderstone!\nThis Update will serve as notice of two developments. \nFirst, the Expedited portions of Expedited orders have been shipped to backers who processed their orders before the Expedited window was closed.

Instead of playing as only 1 civilization in 3 hours, each player could now play as 3 civilizations in 30 minutes!\nWith the help of the unique gaming mechanism, the set-up for every game is greatly different, providing a high replay-ability to players. During the game, players will rise civilization to collect resources, research technologies, build wonders, and prepare for war. Eventually, every civilization may become less powerful as the population may drop in different ways, or simply because the era is changing. (Not all civilization can adapt to a new era, as we know it from history.) It will be time for you to raise another kingdom! The new kingdom can inherit the advantages of the former civilization to continue the legend in the game. As the rise and fall of 3 empires, a unique set of the civilizations of yours will finally arise! \nPLAY\n\nAt the beginning of a game, 8 action cards are shuffled to form a time track in random order, then place the permanent action card at the upper left of the time track.\nIn each player turn, the player take actions by assigning worker tokens to the action slots. Only the 3 actions on the permanent action card AND the 3 actions right under the permanent action card are available to choose.\nWhen all players have finished their turn, the current round ends. Move the permanent action card to the right by 1 card slot when a round ends. As a result, 1 action card of the previous round will become unavailable, and 1 new action card will be available for the next round, creating a new era!\nBesides taking actions to develop empire, each player could rise civilization card to gain more powerful abilities and reset population(number of workers). Civilization cards you own are stacked to show your current civilization with its main ability, and the legacy ability of your previous civilizations.\nRising new civilization is very powerful, but the number of civil. card each player could own is limited to 3. So the timing of \"Rise and Fall\" is a critical decision to make.\nAfter 6 rounds, whoever has the most points wins! \nFor detail rules, please check out the following links:\nDownload / Game Trial\nRule Book v1.5 (English) PDF\nRegola v1.5 (Italian) PDF\n Regel v1.5 (German) PDF \n R\u00e8gle v1.5 (French) PDF \nTry it free on Tabletopia ! \nNote: All the above rule books are not the printed version. \n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.

Exploriana is easy to learn but filled with strategy and perfect for all ages, 8 and older. \nLate in the 19th century steam has replaced sail and the once distant uncharted lands are within grasp! Faraway countries are brought ever closer to hand and explorers equipped with as many charts and maps as they can carry, set out determined to update them!\nTake your place in history! Send your team of explorers out into the world and guide them as they plunge deep into steamy jungles, trek across vast tracts of Savannah and ascend towering peaks, courting danger to discover great wonders!\nFacing peril at every turn, your brave explorers will search for fantastic animals, ancient cities, new varieties of orchids and treasures of extreme beauty! \nFame and fortune await the triumphant but many expeditions are foiled by unexpected hazards, some are lost, never to be seen again!\nExploriana is a tense and exciting game filled with complexity, that you will want to play again and again!\nStandard and deluxe edition stretch goals! With the initial funding goal achieved we will begin upgraded both editions of Exploriana with some awesome enhancements!  \nRemember that the deluxe edition will receive ALL stretch goals, standard & deluxe!\nA note on the deluxe version stretch goals .  \nThe deluxe stretch goals are only unlocked with the total number of deluxe level pledge backers.  \nThe stretch goals for the deluxe version of Kickstarter will not be available in the retail version of Exploriana. The only way to get the deluxe edition of Exploriana is by pledging at the 'First Class Traveller' reward level.  \nAs with the standard edition stretch goals, more stretch goals for the deluxe edition of Exploriana will be revealed once the last one has been unlocked. \nBoth the standard edition and deluxe edition stretch goals will be included in the deluxe edition.\nClick here to become a fan on BoardGameGeek of Exploriana! \n Retweet us here to unlock the twitter goal!\nShare our Facebook post here!\nExploriana packs a lot of game into its box! The standard edition includes the following:\nGameplay Summary\nIn Exploriana YOU decide the fate of a team of brave explorers!\nSetting off into far flung corners of the globe, the explorers throw themselves deep into the unknown, each time hoping to discover new contributions to science and history!\nThe discoveries your explorers make will provide you with victory points and the player with the most victory points at the end of the game will be the winner.\nExploriana incorporates several cool game mechanics:\n\u2022 Resource management (money is the major resource in the game)  \n\u2022 Variable turn order (getting to play first can be a major advantage)\n\u2022 Push your luck (the core mechanic, drawing cards to make discoveries and avoiding hazards)\n\u2022 Hand management (the players get to choose various explorer cards with special abilities that they can use during the game)\n\u2022 Set collecting (with the many card combinations available collecting certain cards could deliver more points)\n\u2022 Worker placement (where to send your explorers is a crucial decision) \nSetup\nExploriana is simple to set up. Each player is given some starting funds, two mission cards, to try and complete during the course of the game, and a guide token to help them on their way. \nExploriana is played over a variable number of rounds, further split into 4 phases. \nPhase 1 - Recruit explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach round a number of explorers are laid out. Each explorer has their own special ability and each player gets to pick one to add to their team.\nExperienced players may choose to use the alternate recruitment rule that eliminates the need for the recruit explorers phase. The players start the game by drafting a full team of explorers to use throughout the game.\nPhase 2 - Send Explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nThere are three regions to explore in Exploriana: South America, Africa and the Far East, each of the regions is more dangerous than the last. \nThe players now decide which of the three regions they will send their explorers too. \nIn renown order, players take turns placing one of their explorers until every player has placed two explorers.\nPhase 3 - Explore regions\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach of the three region decks has its own unique deck of cards and the decks are packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries.\nEach deck contains five types of discovery cards! \nEvery card has a unique piece of art showing what type of discovery can be found.\nA region is explored by revealing cards one at a time, simulating an expedition pushing ever deeper into the wilderness. \nAs a player reveals a discovery card there is a chance a hazard is found on that discovery card! \nIf a player should reveal any three hazards of the same type, or all three different hazards while exploring, then the expedition is lost and the cards are shuffled back into the region deck to be found in furture expiditions. \nRevealing up to four discovery cards allows a player to make a single pick.\nA pick is taking a set of animals or a single treasure, orchid, map or location card.\nIf they are brave or lucky enough to have revealed five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra pick!\nPhase 4 - End of round\nAt the end of each round the players check to see if any deck is empty, and replace any region deck that is with its respective reserve, which will then trigger the final round of the game.\nVictory\nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points.\nThe discoveries the players make award renown, wealth or victory points, and some even give the player a combination of awards!\nFOR A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THE RULES PLEASE DOWNLOAD THEM FROM HERE.\nThe above is a brief overview of Exploriana.

It allows us to bring each company's unique skill set into the fold, ensuring we have the combined expertise and experience to make this campaign a resounding success.  \nThe team includes:\nRobin Elliott of Triple Ace Games Ltd. Triple Ace Games have been making games for 10 years and brings a wealth of knowledge to the team. Having successfully run 17 Kickstarter campaigns they have the know how to successfully deliver a KS project. Robin brings his knowledge of graphic design and manufacturing to the team.\nDicky Duerden of Counters Out Ltd. Counters out is the publishing arm of Chance & Counters, the Bristol-based board game cafe. Exploriana will be their first published game. Dicky is our community manager. Keeping our backers and potential backers up to date with all the news and information on our campaign as it develops.\nMiles Ratcliffe and David Inker of Chaos Publishing Ltd have brought Exploriana to the team. Miles is the game designer on this project. Having devised this amazing game he has play-tested Exploriana to exhaustion, honing its amazing game play. David  is in charge of the admin and creative content.\nRichard Dearing is our superb artist. He spent many hours creating the fabulous artwork for our game and we all think he did an awesome job!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll three companies involved in with the Exploriana Campaign are experienced with Kickstarter and the fulfilment process, each having run several Kickstarter campaigns in the past, Triple Ace Games alone has run 17 successful Kickstarter campaigns to date.\n\nThe game is complete, and we have already self-funded the artwork and design. There will be no delay in sending the game to the factory. The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well-known and well-established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery alongside our fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product.\n\nBrexit is a concern, of course. We are planning on using fulfilment centres within the EU to limit any impact that it may have on the campaign, in this way we don't envisage any major problems to overcome.\n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges we run into can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Benefactor", "descp": "A big thank you from us for showing your support for Exploriana.\nJoin us on our Kickstarter expedition and follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

By charging shipping after the campaign, we can properly assess the final weights and measures of our games, as well as group backers in such a way to maximize utility and ensure you get the lowest shipping cost. We will cover all customs and duties, but our low pledge tiers and small margins prevent us from providing free shipping.\nThe following table includes estimated shipping costs provided by stamps.com (for US backers) and Spiral Galaxy Games for our European and international backers. These are not final costs, but rather estimates.  The true and final shipping cost will be charged after the campaign.\nApproximate Shipping Rates\nCanadian backers. Starlit Citadel Games will ship orders that are larger than the retail game if we get sufficient Canadian orders.  Spiral Galaxy Games will currently handle delivery of the retail game.\nEU backers.  We are EU friendly.  Products ship to EU backers from within the EU and we handle all customs and administrative fees.\nTaxes\nEach backer is responsible for paying their share of the sales taxes for their pledge.  Since we are based out of Texas, we are required by law to collect sales tax from any Texas backers. Some European countries also require that we collect VAT. All taxes and shipping costs will be assessed and collected after the campaign via Pledge Manager.\nIt\u2019s our goal to be as transparent and fair as possible with regard to shipping. No one likes to pay shipping, and we are committed to doing our best to minimize its impact on everyone.\nWe'd like to thank the following people and organizations for all they've done to help bring Zoo-ography together.\nEric Jones, Marco Cervone, and Brian Edger for the hours of playtesting.\nMarc Hampson for his incredible artistic talents.\nPaul Olson for his superb work on our opening video.\nJennica Schwartzman for lending her beautiful voice to our video. \nStephen Selego with Panda Game Manufacturing for all the help and guidance preparing for manufacturing our games.\n Kristi Weyland with Peace, Love, & Games for the incredible preview video.\nFor the timely and inspirational reviews thank you, Dianne N. with Women Like Board Games, Eric Yurko with What's Eric Playing?, George Jaros with GJJ Games, and Steph Elizondo with Settler of the Boards \n Tabletop Artisan's Workshop, Dallas Games Marathon, DFW Nerd Night, and Dallas Designer Group got hosting us over these last few months while we demoed endlessly.\nDerek Funkhouser with The Board Game Spotlight for giving us a platform to promote our game. \n Gerald King III for the opportunity to be on your Kickstarter interview!\nMembers of the Zoo-ography Community Page for their contributions to the game's direction. \nOur Bridges to Nowhere backers for taking a chance on our little game.\nOur Families for their endless patience and support for our dream.\n...and Joshua Geimer whose efforts put us on the map and shaped our fledgling company.\nAnd of course, ALL OF YOU, our backers!!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter is an ever evolving market, and what games may have been a sure fire win even last year, may not be on anyone's radar today. With larger and larger game companies taking up greater share of the market, small indie board game publishers like ourselves can often be left in the dust - especially if our campaigns lack the polish backers have come to expect. While the ever rising bar is good for Kickstarter, it presents new challenges. With more up front capital needed and a demand for near completed games prior to launching, the cost of failure can be significant.\n\nWe at Doomsday Robots recognize the risks involved in pursuing our passion of making board games and are ready to rise to the challenge. Market analysis is a huge part of what we do prior to deciding which game to create and bring to publication, We want to make sure that not only is our investment secure, but that we can meet the demands of this amazing Kickstarter market. As such we've done our homework to minimize costs and risks to our backers.\n\nWe aren't perfect, and we've made mistakes in the past, but we never let that prevent us from doing right by our backers - a commitment we will keep today. We welcome feedback for how we can improve, and indeed listening to our backers have helped us to be a better company.\n\nThe biggest risk we face is the same that most publishers face - ever changing shipping costs. We've taken definitive steps to minimize this risk with an unprecedented level of transparency with our backers so that we can support one another in not only the successful creation of this game, but ensuring the costs to deliver it aren't unbearable to either party. As such we've moved the shipping charges to be collected after the campaign so we can truly minimize the costs with the foreknowledge of how many games we need, and exactly where they are going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Print and Play", "descp": "Receive a download link for the official print and play of Zoo-ography after the campaign and once all art assets are finalized.\nINCLUDES:\nZoo-ography Digital Print and Play Files", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["201 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Zoo-ography", "descp": "*The Game*\nReceive one copy of Zoo-ography Retail Edition including the Kickstarter exclusive Panda meeple with all applicable stretch goals.

PLEASE NOTE MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED.\nMonumental is a massive board game for 1 to 4 players where you\u2019ll compete with your opponents to lead your prestigious civilization through the ages.\nThe game starts with the Classic era (antiquity), will cross the Medieval times to end up in the Modern industrial age. Through all these ages, you\u2019ll have to assemble your military forces to conquer new territories, focus on scientific research to enhance your civilization\u2019s abilities, build breathtaking wonders to harness their unique advantages, and develop your cultural policies to guide your people to victory. The fate of your civilization is upon you!\nEach civilization has its own deck of cards with cultural specificities, as well as an army to explore and conquer the provinces on the board. On each turn, you\u2019ll be able to draw and activate cards, combining their effects to develop your civilization and conquer the world. But you\u2019re not alone in this race, as your opponents will try and outrun you as soon as they can. A game of Monumental plays over different eras, each of them featuring new cards to acquire and use. At the very beginning of the game, you control a small town in some remote country that nobody has ever heard of. Yet by the end of the game, thanks to the many cards that you will acquire, all will admire your monumental city, the jewel of a glorious nation!\nAs war is inevitable, you\u2019ll need to lead your troops to combat when necessary. Fight the barbarians or protohistoric Free Cities to loot their resources, then wage war against your opponents! Each civilization comes with 14 army units - either nicely illustrated tokens (Classic edition) or finely sculpted unique miniatures (Deluxe edition) that you\u2019ll be able to deploy on a richly illustrated modular game board to take control of the world. On the other side of your army, send your explorers to crawl new provinces, exploit new resources or even obtain new ones from various marketplaces in order to reinforce your city production capacity and speed up your evolution. Not a warmonger? Then maybe focus on Knowledge to enhance your cards\u2019 abilities and gain more resources. Build Libraries, Laboratories, Colleges and other scientific buildings to educate your people. Then use this Knowledge to gain powerful cards that will allow you to do more actions in a single turn. Another solution would be to focus on Culture: various actions you take in the game will develop the culture of your empire, which in turn allows you to deploy special Cultural Policies with permanent advantages.\nAnd of course, what would be a civilization without its wonders? The Great Pyramid, Stonehenge, the Great Wall\u2026 all have powerful in-game effects that will allow your empire to rise to glory. Building wonders is another way to assert your dominance over your opponents in Monumental, and a great way to show your greatness to the world.\nThe path to glory will not be simple. You need to find the proper balance between all these possibilities to achieve victory\u2026 and this will take time. But after all, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day!\nEach Civilization comes with a set of cards comprising common buildings along with a unique building and knowledge card. The basic buildings of your city will give you the basic resources: the fort will provide Military, the Library will provide Science and the Work Camp will provide Production.\nA unique Knowledge card as well as 5 Cultural Policies complete the cultural distinction between civilizations. A Warlord card, working along with the corresponding unit on the board, also gives a unique and special conquest power to their owner.\nKnowledge cards that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them.\nIn Monumental, the cards that you will buy and activate in your city are the key to victory. You must find the proper balance between the different types of cards, as each of them will give you special advantages. Managing your deck and anticipating the cards to come will also give you the upper hand over your opponents.\nAs the game progresses through its 3 ages (Classic \u2013 Medieval \u2013 Modern times), so does history allowing you to acquire several types of more and more powerful cards: Buildings to bring you more resources and some occasional special abilities, Knowledges that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them, Wonders which are very expensive but very powerful (and very rewarding as victory points) and, to finish with, Cultural Policies cards which can be activated thanks to culture points given by other type of cards and which will give you powerful passive permanent advantages.\nCITY AND CROSS-TAPING\nBefore the first turn, you randomly draw 9 cards from your deck (out of 14 at the beginning of the game) and place them on the table in a square of 3x3 cards: this is your city for the first turn. Over the course of the game, your city will evolve. You\u2019ll start with basic buildings with limited interaction, but by the end of the game, your city will be full of advanced buildings, breathtaking wonders, and top-notch Knowledge.\nHowever, even if there are 9 cards in your city, you can only activate 5 of them on each turn. This will lead to difficult choices, as all cards can be useful. Your citizens cannot work all the time though, and you need to allow them to rest.\nThis unique gaming mechanic is called CROSS-TAPPING. To activate your cards, you choose a line and a column in your city, and activate (tap) the cards from this line and column (5 cards out of 9). You can choose any line and any column; you simply cannot choose two lines or two columns.\nThis innovative mechanic introduces a whole new way of programing and using the cards of your deck turn after turn as optimization and combos are the heart of the game.\nEXPLORATION AND CONQUEST\nDeveloping your city and your empire will require you to gather resources and to conquer new territories.\nThe territories of Monumental are called Provinces. The modular game board gives the basic setup of each game. This setup will be different whether you use one of the pre-defined scenarios (made for a certain number of players) or one of the scenarios you create.\nAt the beginning of the game, the provinces are all to discover and are occupied by independent barbarian tribes or ancient Free Cities. You\u2019ll have to move your army (thanks to your military points) to conquer them. The conquest mechanism is very simple: one military point allow you to move one unit \u2013 you need to move at least the same number of military units as the defense value of the province (a number given by the terrain difficulty + the existing inhabitants resistance). Each conquered province gives you victory points at the end of the game but it also gives you more required space to build your wonders.\nThe Provinces also contains various resources depending on them. Sometimes you may recruit some workers (as a production token) and sometimes you may end up in a Maketplace (such as Babylon or Rome) where you will be able to grab new resources to bring to your city in order to enhance your future turns capacity of development. All these resources are only opened to your Explorers who moves thanks to military points too but who never take part in any battle.\nTurn after turns your realm will become bigger and bigger, your knowledge and culture stronger and your buildings and wonders more and more impressive.\nDesigned to be extremely modular, Monumental is implementing on one side the power and depth of a deckbuilding system which loads the game with hundreds of potential combos and on the other side the flexibility of a modular game board which allows the players to create an infinity of new scenarios, all of this to bring on the table a game that is super easy to learn but hard to master thanks to an important learning curve and which will grant dozens and dozens of hours of renewed playing pleasure!\nPlease note that we are currently working on the graphic layout of the rules. However, you may already access the prototype PDF file which is absolutely not what the final files layout will be ;). Please note also that, despite the fact that these rules have been thoroughly tested, they may still evolve during the campaign tweaking and fine tuning process.\nPlease click on the pic to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\n                    My name is Matthew Dunstan, and I\u2019m a research scientist and game designer based in Cambridge, UK. I started designing games about 8 years ago, when I was still living in Australia, and to date I have had 11 published designs. Monumental is my second game with Funforge following the release of Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time last year. Monumental is a fitting title for the game, considering it is the most ambitious of my designs to date!\nWhile the origin of Monumental isn\u2019t as old as the Pyramids or Stonehenge, it is still one with many twists and turns, a journey that started over 4 years ago. At the heart of Monumental is a new mechanic I call \u2018cross-tapping\u2019, where you deal cards from your deck into a 3 x 3 grid, and you choose 1 row and 1 column of cards to use on your turn. In this very simple system, you already have all the tools for some very satisfying combos, and every turn you are presented with engaging and interesting decisions.\nI was intrigued by deck-building games, which are interesting by the fact of them offering a random selection of cards from your deck each turn, and then you have to make the most of what you have been dealt. But the interest is not really in the playing of the cards \u2013 once you have a hand your choice of actions is mostly automatic. I wanted this feeling of getting a new set of opportunities each turn, but with some juicy decisions as to how to use these opportunities. What do you need to do right now, and what can wait until later? Do you pull off a small combo now, or wait and hope for something even better? Hopefully this tension and excitement permeates through Monumental from its core mechanism.\nFunforge has done an amazing job bringing my design to life, immersing you in the world of mighty armies, feats of technological advancement and towering wonders. The choices you make in Monumental will ultimately tell the tale of your civilization...what will you be remembered for?\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time. You\u2019ll also be able to add any new add-ons at this point or complete your pledge in any desired way.\nIf you change adresses before we ship your rewards, you\u2019ll be able to access your survey anytime after we\u2019ve send it at this link: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/funforge/monumental\nPledge levels will be available in English or French. You\u2019ll have to choose the language of your pledge in the Pledge Manager, after the campaign completion.\nWe will also deliver Digital only versions (pdf files) in the following languages: German, Polish and Spanish. Please note that these digital files are not yet available and will be provided somewhere between the end of the KS campaign and the delivery of the games.\nLes niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais. Vous devrez choisir la langue de votre pledge dans le Pledge Manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne.\nNous fournirons \u00e9galement des fichiers uniquement digitaux (pdf) dans les langues suivantes : Allemand, Polonais et Espagnol. Notez que ces fichiers ne sont pas encore disponibles et seront fournis entre la fin de la campagne KS et la livraison des jeux.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter campaign completion.\nWe will collect all information through the Pledge Manager in order to dispatch your pledge to the most accurate of our international shipping hubs.\nHere are the initial estimates for the shipping costs depending on your area of living. Please, keep in mind that these costs may rise depending on the evolution of the campaign (unlocked stretch goals which will increase the weight of the parcel) and on the potential add-ons you would add to your initial pledge during the Pledge Manager phase.\nUSA: 12-15\u20ac to most states, 40\u20ac to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\nEUROPE: 12\u20ac to France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. 15-20\u20ac to the rest of the UE countries. 20-25\u20ac to the non UE-countries.\nCANADA: 20\u20ac to most cities\nLATIN AMERICA: 45-80\u20ac to most countries.\nASIA: 15\u20ac to China and Hong Kong. 20-30\u20ac to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: 20-30\u20ac to Australia. 35\u20ac to New Zealand.\nFRENCH TERRITORIES: 40\u20ac to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nREST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): 80-100\u20ac to most other countries.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nWe DO NOT SHIP to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Russia and Syria.\nPlease note that these prices are NOT including the possible brokerage and/or custom fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country, these fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you). As a reminder, if your country is listed into the Friendly shipping badges, you would have no import fees to pay.\nThe decision of making this project a Kickstarter exclusive is the result of a long and precise thinking.\nIn short, we had the choice of offering a \u00ab regular \u00bb game at a \u00ab regular \u00bb price or a fantastic game at a fair price.\nWe decided to go for the second option as we believe that this game deserves the best from our publishing efforts. Notably we have put a lot of hard work for months into the testing process but most and foremost into the production works, hiring dozens of stellar artists to turn each of the card artwork into a masterpiece. This is also true regarding the mini pre-production process for which we aimed to fantastic sculptures and unique (and expensive) design choices. These are just some examples of our commitment into making MONUMENTAL a unique experience for you.\nWe are used to publish games for ten years now and we know fairly well the distribution network and how it works. Should we choose to let this game go to the regular network, it would have been financially unsustainable for us because of the cascading margins of the classic distribution scheme.\nGame Designer: Matthew Dunstan\nPublisher: Funforge\nArt Direction: Philippe Nouhra\nArtworks: Paul Mafayon, Georges \"Gorg\" Bouchelaghem, Fajareka Setiawan, Agri Karuniawan, Asep Ariyanto, Maerel Hibadita, Tey Bartolome, Justine Cruz, Wyn Lacabra, Raph Lomotan, Brian Valeza, Chang-Wei Chen, Andreas Rocha, Marco Gorlei, Hendry Iwanaga, Philippe Nouhra, Charles-Victorien Kaing, Grafit Studio, Ivan Sevic, Roman Tishenin, Piotr Dura, Eugenia Firs, Jordan Albro, Orion Vang, Esmail Zalat, Uros Sljivic, Heng Tang, Tomislav Jagnjic, Alisher Mirzoev, Tuan Nguyen, Alexandre Mokhov, Martin Mottet\nLead sculptor: Charles-Victorien Kaing\nAdditional sculptors: Alfonso Gonso, Nicolas Pessina, Gregory Krasnoperov, Raul Garcia Latorre\nTranslator & rules editing: Antoine Prono, Gersende Cheylan, Claude Amardeil\nPublisher Testing: Philippe Nouhra, Antoine Prono, Claude Amardeil, Thomas Baggi-Sani, Charlotte Noailles, Gersende Cheylan\nLead Community Manager: Charlotte Noailles\nAdditional Community Managers: Claude, Brett, Valentin\nTabletopia integration: Thomas Baggi-Sani\nFunforge would like to express special thanks to David Preti and R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e, you guys are the best! ;)\nFunforge social networks\nOfficial FB page: @MONUMENTALboardgame\nFunforge FB page: @Funforge\nTwitter: @funforge\nInstagram: @funforge\nTo spread the word!

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\n\nUse this link to access the Pledge Manager for Backer Rewards and Late Pledges! \nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. We successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. This Kickstarter features Barricades Mode designed by Bryan Reese - rules and components for Solo & CoOp play, plus Quest 6: What Lies Beneath. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter (but no new content), To The Barricades! which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion + Barricades! which combines both into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes the Champion Reward, To the Barricades, 6 packs of Premium Sleeves, the Epic Thunderstone Add-on for Champion, and the Neoprene Mat.\nNote for Expedited Backers: You can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Champion Expedited. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status. We will ensure that every Expedited Backer who wants this Add-on will be able to get it regardless of the quantity ordered by other backers.\n\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your Champion Expedited.\n\nNote for All other Backers (including $1 Backers): You will be able to upgrade your Reward in the Pledge Manager to Your Inventory Is Full! at the same price listed in this Kickstarter. QUANTITIES MAY BE LIMITED, so to guarantee that you get this Reward, select it now!\nAll Quests, including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath, and the Stretch Goals from this campaign, can be played in either Barricades Mode or normal Competitive Mode.\nFollow the story of our Stretch Goals through Kickstarter Updates!\nThe Backers of this campaign successfully unlocked all the contents of Quest 7: Frostbite(*)! Quest 7 will join Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in the To The Barricades! portion of the Rewards for this Kickstarter.\nThe Premium To the Barricades Box!\n(This packaging is for illustration purposes only. Actual box will differ in graphics and dimensions.)\nWith the completion of this Kickstarter the Thunderstone Quest product line will be quite large. 7 Quests, support for 6 players, and all the components of Barricades Mode, 8 plastic figures, plus Epic Thunderstone support and the Neoprene Mat.\nPlayers who sleeve their cards will have filled the original Champions box. Therefore the To the Barricades box is being engineered to complement the Champion box.\nIn addition, we\u2019re designing a plastic vac-formed tray that you can use to organize the various tokens and chits as you play. You can store those things in the tray in the box, and when it\u2019s time to play you can remove the tray and put it on the table! The tray will be designed to accommodate all the various tokens & chits included in Champion + Barricades and a little bit of future proofing as well!\nCurrently we envision a box with the same dimensions as the Champion box. The two boxes will be graphically designed to compliment each other on your shelf.\nWe believe that when you sleeve all cards including Epic the two boxes together will have room for one or two additional Quests beyond Quest 7, although the storage of the Neoprene Playmat Add-on will affect how many cards can be stored in the boxes.\nWe expect to provide a suggested setup for managing all the cards and components across the two boxes when To the Barricades is delivered. Some people will prefer to organize their cards alphabetically by type. Others will organize them by Quest. We will have suggested setups for both.\nThe To the Barricades! Box will be Kickstarter Exclusive!\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals are included in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory Is Full!, but are not included in the Champion reward.\nThe Champion, Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory is Full! rewards will include all the Kickstarter Exclusive Content from the 1st Kickstarter.\nKickstarter Exclusive content (\"KSE\") are game components and accessories that are available only to backers of AEG Kickstarters. Kickstarter Exclusive Content may be released in an alternate form more widely in the future (different art, different card titles, etc.).\nThunderstone is one of the most successful games AEG has ever published. The Kickstarter for Thunderstone Quest and delivery of those rewards to our backers has enabled us to continue to develop the game and expand its scope. \nThe major innovation for Thunderstone Quest is ... Quests! Each Quest consists of a selection of dungeon tiles and monster cards that create an engaging storyline. Each Quest includes rules for selecting Village and Dungeon cards to create a variety of Adventures. After you've mastered each Quest you use random setups of Quest cards to create new Dungeons and Villages - build your own Quests and Adventures!\nThe Champion Reward\nIncludes:\nReally Big Box that holds all Champion content (even sleeved!)\n5 Quests (each Quest includes approximately 245 cards and 6 Dungeon Tiles [except Ripples in Time which includes 4])\nOver 130 base game cards (starting cards, quest cards, treasure cards, wound cards, key cards, randomizers & dividers)\nWilderness tile\nVillage game board\n6 plastic Champion figures\n140 wood tokens\n5 six-sided dice\nRule book\nQuest book\nKickstarter exclusives & extras including The Yellow Knight card & meeple (googly eyes not included)\nBarricades Mode\nOne of the most requested features from the community was the ability to play the game solo or in a co-operative game. Our team has developed an extension to Thunderstone Quest called Barricades Mode to make that possible.\nIncludes:\n6 Guardian Boards\n[ In ongoing playtesting, Guardian Key cards were removed ]\n20 damage chits\n1 Damage chit bag\n2 Marketplace overlay boards\n8 Prestige Class boards\n30 Prestige tokens\n20 Guardian Dice (D12)\n1 Threat Level wooden token\n5 Barricade tokens\n2 Additional Player Packs (all components required for adding a 5th and 6th player to both Competitive Mode and Barricades Mode)\nQuest 6: What Lies Beneath\nWe area also presenting Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in this campaign. What Lies Beneath is designed to work with Barricades Mode to create a seamless storytelling experience. What Lies Beneath can be played in normal competitive mode too. All of the other Quests will be compatible with Barricades Mode.\nIncludes:\nApproximately 245 cards\n6 Dungeon tiles\nRulebook\nEpic Thunderstone support cards\nFull color storage box (will also hold components from Barricades Mode)\nThunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon is on Kickstarter so that we can bring all our current backers the content they've asked for quickly, and to create an opportunity for new backers to join the adventure and get access to all the Kickstarter Exclusive content from the first campaign.\nThe Stretch Goals in this campaign will be included in the To The Barricades! reward, and the Champion + Barricades!, and the Your Inventory Is Full! reward, but not the Champion reward.\n\n(*) Quest 7: Frostbite is a working title and is subject to change.\nThe rules for Thunderstone Quest are available for download on the Thunderstone page at alderac.com. \nUpdate 15AUG:  We have produced a special Print & Play package for Barricades Mode that you can download and assemble at home. This is version 2.2 of the Barricades Mode system! If you own Thunderstone Quest, you'll be able to play Barricades Mode with this Print & Play!\nThunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nThis new version of Thunderstone enhances the Dungeon mechanic introduced in classic Thunderstone. In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an Adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.\nThunderstone Quest uses a lot of the rules from previous versions of Thunderstone but the cards from previous versions are not compatible.\nThe heroes must travel through time and into the arctic waste in search of a legendary artifact of great power. Follow along as their story unfolds with each new Stretch Goal!\nEpic Thunderstone: \nOur 1st Add-On is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion and Champion + Barricades! Reward. If you backed the first Kickstarter and are backing this Kickstarter at the To the Barricades! level you can also order this Add-on.\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll new content (including Stretch Goals) in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play created by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook.\nThis Add-On is a pre-built Epic Thunderstone deck ready for play. You won't have to subtract cards from your main play set to play Epic Thunderstone.\nYou'll need a full copy of Thunderstone Quest to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the main game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern.\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within the To the Barricades box for this Kickstarter, rolled up. The length will be between 295 and 300 mm. The width is still undetermined; the graphics team will be redesigning the Village layout to accommodate the new size after the Kickstarter but the total will be smaller than the current Village board.\nPremium Sleeves\nOur 2nd Add-On are packs of Premium Sleeves. These Sleeves use the same plastic we used in the Mystic Vale sleeves.\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 1 more pack to sleeve the new content in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades!.\nThe Champion box holds all the Champion content, plus the Epic Add-on cards sleeved. You will need to store future Quests (including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath and the stretch goals from this campaign) in their own boxes if you wish to sleeve them.\nAdventurer Catch-Up Kit\nOur third Add-on is a way for people who purchased the Adventurer Reward in the first Kickstarter to get the Quests that they did not purchase in the first campaign. It consists of Quest 3: Risen from the Mire, and Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World. The Quests will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the To The Barricades! pledge level to order this Add-on (all this content is included in the Champion and Champion + Barricades! rewards.)\nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected the Champion+Barricades (Expedited US Only) reward you will receive your Champion box in an expedited early shipment soon after the campaign ends. We have 1,000 units of Champion in our warehouse in the US so we will be able to send the Champion part of your Reward on an expedited timeline. We believe we can have them delivered 6 to 8 weeks after the close of the campaign. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nBecause this inventory is already in the United States the cost, customs issues, and complexity of shipping to non-US addresses prohibit us from delivering the expedited portion of the Reward outside the United States.\nThe cost to ship the Champion Reward for expedited delivery will be borne by AEG. Backers at this level will pay for shipping & handling for the rest of the Reward normally based on weight, and the rest of the Reward will ship at the same time as fulfillment of all other Reward content for this Kickstarter in 2019.\n\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA (Canada and the rest of the world).\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! (including Stretch Goals) without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive. \nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! at 23lbs/12kg.\nUSA:$23 \nCANADA: $40 \nEUROPE: $27 to Germany. $39 to EU + Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nLATIN AMERICA: $80 to most countries. \nASIA: $33 to China and Hong Kong. $62 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $45 to Australia. $75 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $80\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping To The Barricades!

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores.

Each turn provides players a wide array of options and tools to pull ahead. You can focus on improving the lands of your kingdom, upgrading from simple meadows to a thriving economic engine. Or perhaps you'd rather battle your way to victory, plundering the other kingdoms' riches. With limited space to build and only three positions for key advisers, strategic decisions must be made to guarantee victory.\n Now unlocked, the Trade Route. \nA free mini-expansion for backers of any physical copy pledge. The Trade Route includes supplemental rules featuring a card drafting mechanic, new interaction using the Riches cards, and a new beautifully illustrated center game board -- now unlocked!\nNew Trade Route cards have been unlocked!\nRuler Traits have been unlocked for backers!\nAn optional mini-expansion that adds more depth, asymmetry, and replay value. Wall your kingdom off, by taking the Isolationist Trait, or hoard as much gold as you can, by taking the Avaricious Trait. Bring your kingdom to new heights with the Ambitious Trait, or swindle your opponents with the Mercantile Trait.\nIn the solo mode, race against an ever-expanding rival as you try to out-build and outscore the shadow kingdom.  \nA second solo mode, Conquest of the King, has been unlocked!! \nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nGeek Spiel\nUnfiltered Gamer\nSkip to example turn here.

Each hand is like a little puzzle where I need to figure out how to get the most value from it.\" -VVildcard\nUnedited audio from a blind playtest at a convention:\n [More reviews coming soon]\nThe current rules can be found here.\nSolo mode game play video with the developer\nI missed counting 2 VP for the Shadow Kingdom, can anyone figure out how many points the Shadow Kingdom had, and if I won this game or not? The rule book might come in handy! Comment if you've figured it out.\nGame Overview from Board Game Coffee\nSet up\nThe Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced decks are placed in the middle of the table. Each player sets a Kingdom Board, 3 Riches cards, and a Center Land card in front of them\nAction Phase \nEach player gets 3 actions per turn to improve their kingdoms, progress to better decks, and gather as many victory points as possible.\nActions\n Playing a card from their hand \n Drawing or drafting a Basic card\nPlayers will play Land, Person, Event and Victory cards as they advance their kingdom.\nLand Cards - The foundation of any kingdom. With only 8 tiles available for land cards players must make their choices carefully. Resource land cards can stack and upgrade resource cards of the same type.\nPerson Cards - The life force of a kingdom. Person cards will add resource, strength and defense to your kingdom and will play a vital role in balancing war and prosperity.\nEvent Cards - Events can alter the course of medieval history, but make sure it's in your favor. A key component to player interactivity, these cards add another layer of strategy. As you progress to higher decks, the event cards become more powerful allowing for victory point swings and keeping each game close right down to the very end. \nVictory Cards - Great achievements rewarded only to those that seize the opportunity. Victory cards allows players to boost their kingdom to glory, provided they meet the demands.\nDiscard Phase\nEach player can then choose to discard any number of cards from their hand. They will redraw back to their maximum hand size during the final phase of their turn.\nDeck Check Phase \nEach player checks to see if they can upgrade their kingdom based on the level of cards they have in play. Once a player has met the requirements, they can upgrade their kingdom and Center Land. They will be able to draw according to their upgraded Kingdom Level in the next phase.\nDraw Phase\nAt the end of a player\u2019s turn, they draft or draw cards back to their maximum hand size. Each card in the draft is replaced when selected. The maximum hand size by default is 5, but it can be expanded by certain cards.\nEnd of Game \nThere is an \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d card within the Advanced deck. When this card is drawn, each player will play one final turn. After all turns are played, each player will count their current Victory Points (VP). The player with the most VPs wins!\nSolo Mode\nRace Against the Shadow Kingdom\nIn the Solo mode, the game's setup, player turn actions, and player scoring are identical to the normal rules. After each turn the player takes, cards are drawn and placed face up for the Shadow Kingdom. The amount and type of cards drawn for the Shadow Kingdom depends on the player's current kingdom progression. The player can use Event cards against the Shadow Kingdom but be warned, if Event cards are drawn by the Shadow Kingdom there are unique effects that may occur.\nAfter the player draws the Age of Enlightenment card, the player's Victory Points are compared against the Shadow Kingdoms, the latter using a special scoring method.\nConquest of the King\nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nNaming Rules  \nKeeping the medieval theme is very important to us. We want backers to be able to include their own personal touch to our game but it must fit the following rules. \nFor the Person Cards, this can be any variant of First Name, Last Name and a Title within 35 characters. Land card names can be more flexible but all must stay within the theme.\nWe will work with you to agree upon a name but we reserve the right to decline any name that we feel would be detrimental to the game\nThere will be a deadline for sending your name requests to us. If you do not meet this deadline, we won't be able to use your chosen name. You will still be printed as a SIlver or Gold supporter in the rule book.\nThere will be a deadline for sending in a photo for your portrait to be added in to the game. Our talented illustrator, Jeff, may have some preferences in lighting or pose, so sending a couple reference images will help.\nThe Portrait tier will have our Illustrator, Jeff Porter, paint you into the game.

Emperor Xuanzong built the magnificent imperial Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake as an homage of life itself.\nTang Garden is a Zen-like game that will take you to the first golden age of China, where players will progressively build a garden by creating the landscape, placing the scenery and projecting their vision through vertical panoramas. During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.\nTang Garden is played in a variable number of turns. In each of these turns, the player will be allowed to pick only one action between expanding the garden and decorating the garden: Both actions balance each other, putting the player in the position of making simple and profound choices simultaneously.\nBringing Tang Garden to reality will only be possible with your support. \nMake the game better for everyone. Stretch goals will enhance the final quality and content of the game, the more we fund, the more we can upgrade. We will also offer a serie of Kickstarter Exclusive Stretch Goals.\nThe Deluxe edition contains a Limited Edition numbered Expansion. It won't be possible to get it in distribution. \nGet more value of what you pledge and a competitive discounted and tracked shipping rate.\nWe have planned the size and weight of the game after the Stretch Goals are unlocked and the shipping box will weight around 4 to 5 Kg. We are partnering up with our loyal fulfillment centers: QuarterMaster Logistics for USA, VFI for Asia, Snakes & Lattes for Canada and DHL + GLS tracked and reliable shipping couriers for Europe.\nAfter the campaign ends you will be able to choose your Base Game language from: English, French, German and Spanish.\nThe Deluxe Exclusive expansion: Ghost Stories, will include a multi language rulebook.\nFor the Italian version of the game, please pledge towards our partner, GateOnGames!

It is a challenge to create a game, manufacture it and then ship to the warehouse, but the most important of all, fulfill our backers. After what we learnt from our first three projects, specially Tao Long, we feel confident and prepared to manage this project in the best way possible.\n\nWe have delivered three games and Spirits of the Forest is going into assembling the shipped by sea very soon.\n\nTo avoid any delays, we decided to prepare the game assets for Tang Garden before the campaign. All the files but the rulebook are already in hands of our manufacturer and we should receive a final pre-production copy a couple weeks after the end of the campaign. \n\nLogistics is the most difficult part or running a campaign. From the lessons learned we are combining every time inside boxes as we did for Spirits of the Forest.\n\n- Base Game backers will receive two boxes (Base Game + Stretch Goals)\n- Deluxe backers will receive three boxes (Base Game + Stretch Goals, Tang Garden: Ghost Stories)\n\nThis time around we are also making sure all the add-ons have their own packing. For the decorations we are using booster packs, for the single characters as the Wayfarer tuck boxes and all the expansions and metal coin inside 2-pcs setup boxes.\n\nThese are our fulfillment partners for this campaign: \n- VFI will deliver the games to most of our Asian backers while the rest will be sent by DHL from Europe.\n- VR Distribution will deliver the games in Australia and New Zealand. \n- Quarter Master Logistics will deliver the games to our backers in the US. \n- ThunderGryph together with TCG & Happyshops will deliver the games to all our European Backers by using tracked DHL. \n- Snakes & Lattes will deliver the games to our Canadian Backers. \n- Any \"rest of the world\" backers will be fulfilled by ThunderGryph Games and HappyShops using DHL.\n\nWe are consistently monitoring the project and working hard to remove as much risk as we can from you and bear with it ourselves, If you have any questions about the project development please don't hesitate to ask.

The spies are able to move the monkey, and will also count towards the number of worker lice on that monkey (beware of that nitpicking!). This adds a whole new dimension to the game, making you rethink your old strategies. Also, we'll add a completely new game mode in which you're playing as a species of monkeys, trying to get rid of the lice!\nWith it's extensive development and play-testing, high quality components, and beautiful artwork, we believe there's little to improve on Itchy Monkey with (numerous) stretch goals.

We'll provide you with all the necessary information.\nTo make sure Itchy Monkey arrives at your doorstep safely, we will use a great fulfillment partner. All shipping fees are standard, and based on the actual fee we will need to pay our fulfillment partner. This also means we can ship EU and US-friendly to our backers.\nThe shipping fees will be charged after the campaign through our pledge manager Backerkit, another renowned company.\nTo reduce shipping costs for backers in Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, we will take care of the logistics in these countries ourselves. For an overview of the prices see below.\nGroup pledge\nYou can reduce shipping costs by making a group pledge!\nHere's an overview of a few examples for sending 5 games. For an accurate price for your country or more information, please send us a message or email us at kickstarter@blackboxadventures.com.\nJust like with our previous Kickstarter it is possible to pick up your game at one of the many conventions we're attending, including Essen SPIEL 2018.\nDanish backers\nIt's now possible to ship to Denmark via a group pledge. The designer (Allan, see below) will facilitate this himself, with the help of a boardgame cafe in the area of \u00c5rhus. Backers will be able to pick up the games on specific dates and will share the shipping costs. This option will be available through the pledge manager after the campaign. The reduced shipping costs will be charged at that time as well.\nBlack Box Adventures is an indie tabletop games developer and publisher from the Netherlands. We strive to bring you games with our three core values in mind:\nQUALITY: what you get is a high quality product worth your time, as we want to bring you more than some cards and dice in a box. Yes, we are a business, and our business is to make you happy.\nORIGINALITY: Zombies vs Cthulhu? Booooring!! We strive to think outside of the box and make tabletop games with unique twists and themes. Lice colonising monkeys... now we're talking.\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE: we only publish games that have our full support, but we\u2019re all just ordinary people. We like to work with our community so please let us know what you think!\nItchy Monkey: a Battle of Lice is the brainchild of Allan Kirkeby. For the art we partnered up with Maarten de Schrijver, the designer and illustrator of \"Frutti di Mare: Veni, Vidi, Antipasti!\". Maarten is a 2D and 3D designer, which you'll quickly recognize from the beautifully designed artwork and animation. When Allan presented his game to us the original game mechanics and theme struck us immediately. After more play testing and some adjustments Itchy Monkey was ready to be launched on Kickstarter.\nDoing some field research...\nMeet the game designer: Allan Kirkeby\nI\u2019ve always loved playing and making games. I made my first board game as a kid. In my teens I played tabletop miniature games, and designed campaign-worlds as a D&D game master. I got my first computer and started playing games, but quickly realized that making games with a computer was even more fun. Since then I\u2019ve designed and lead the development of a lot of computer games. Today I spend my daytime as an advisor and teacher for start-up computer game companies, and my evenings and weekends designing, building and playing board games.\nListen to a podcast featuring Allan Kirkeby!\nAllan Kirkeby\nClick this badge to get us to the top of the Kicktraq Hot List!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith two successfully funded and fulfilled projects, Black Box Adventures is ready for more. Although every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. This isn't our first project, we've got a great track record to give our backers confidence.\n\nThe game, artwork and design are ready to be printed. We received quotes from multiple manufacturers, both domestic as well as foreign. To get the high quality we want, we've chosen one of the best production facilities available. The manufacturer will print and assemble the games. None of the components need to come from China, so there won't be any possible delays/problems that are associated with overseas freight shipping.\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. Because the game is produced in the EU, EU-backers won't need to worry about extra customs charges. Like before, we're using a highly renowned fulfillment partner for an ultra smooth fulfilment process.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer the game will be ready before Essen SPIEL 2018, however some events may be out of our or their reach. If for some unforeseen circumstances we won't be able to deliver the product at Essen SPIEL 2018, we will have to arrange a pickup at another convention or charge shipping costs.\n\nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our range of games, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece drooling in flavor on its own. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous games, we will listen to the backers.

With a mix of worker placement (using cultists to perform tasks), deck building (collecting monster cards, spell cards and constellation cards to add more effects to the action cards) and programming (each round, players will need to build their own action deck) players will try to start the most powerful cult and complete rituals.\nThese are the prototype Power Dice - the final dice will have more color. \nReview by Bastiaan Nox (Dutch)\nVariable Player Powers: Each Old One has its own unique ability in the game. They all play a bit differently.\nMix of Mechanics: As said, players will use worker placement, deck building and programming to build their cult.\nLuck of the Draw & Strategy: Drawing cards to enhance your deck will mostly be a thing of luck...but the truly powerful Old Ones know how to plan their cards to make the best possible combinations.\nChoose your play style: The game will come with both a Power Die and Power Cards. If you like some randomness, play with the unique 8-sided Power Die. If you like strategy and planning, play with the Power Cards.\nReplayability: The numerous cards and possible combinations, paired with 16 different rituals, 3 different upgrade paths and 20+ unique buildings will give a different game every time.\n*Only real names are accepted. We don't want any profanity.\nAt the end of the campaign, I will contact all the backers who backed with a reward to name a game element (except the Supportive Cultist backers, as all cultists are the same). Starting with the first backer on that list, each backer has a chance to choose which game element (Old One, Artifact card, Cult Leader) they want to attach their name to.\nFirst of all, I want to thank YOU! Yes, you. You took the time to view this page, read about Castle Madness and perhaps you even backed this game. Without you, this project would not even exist.\nFurthermore, I'd like to thank all the people close to me. My friends, because they were the first to endure the many, many (many) playtest sessions of Castle Madness. They provided me with the first feedback and basically made this game into what it is now. My mum, who had to proofread the many, many (many) draft rules I showed her. My girlfriend, who had to put up with me for many (you get the idea) hours while I was in the same room with her, but at the same time, far away in Naallemrak.\nAlso, thank you to the people I got to know along the way. Arne De Cnodder and Gert Breugelmans, who became a valuable playtesters. All the visitors from Spiel '17 who took the time to stop at my booth and play a demo game. Seb Van Deun & Rudy Seuntjens from the Game Brewer and the games store De Kolonisten here in Turnhout, who gave me advice and let me use the store to host some demo games. Daniel Zayas and Tony Shen from LongPack Games for being patient with all my questions. SharkeeGames who helped me with finding shipping solutions. And Justin from OTX and Seth & Chris from QuarterMaster for providing me with those shipping solutions. FatherGeek who wrote a review for the first campaign and gave me some good insights. Bastiaan Nox and Undead Viking for their amazing review videos.\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some at this moment, but that doesn't make your contribution any less valuable. Thanks you.\nAs soon as LongPack Games is done with the production of Castle Madness, OTX will freight the games to QuarterMaster who will use their close contacts with other fulfillment centers (like Aetherworks and GamesQuest) to ship all the games to their rightful owners - you!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign via the pledge manager, to guarantee an honest and accurate shipping cost.\nThe prices below are estimates based on 2018 quotes and a weight of 2,5 kg, and can differ from the final prices.\nUS: \u20ac8,5\nEurope: \u20ac13,5\nNorway: \u20ac23\nCanada: \u20ac14,5\nAustralia: \u20ac16\nNew Zealand: \u20ac21\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: \u20ac8,5\nRest of Asia: \u20ac18,5\nAll other countries: \u20ac55", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I'm new to creating on Kickstarter, the entire campaign will be a challenge for me, I\u2019ll be honest. But I\u2019m backed by tested professionals who know their way around in this world.\n\nSome of you might notice that this is the second try on Kickstarter for Castle Madness. I believe I made some mistakes last time which made the funding goal too high. For example, I went to a publisher instead of a manufacturer to get the game made. This time however, I've cut out the middle man and went straight to a manufacturer.\n\nNow, with a realistic funding goal and realistic pledge level values, I believe Castle Madness is truly ready to be released into the world.\n\nLongPack Games will manufacture the game if the campaign is a success. I've met them at Spiel '17 when I was there promoting Castle Madness' first try on Kickstarter. They truly were a big help and I've contacted them after the first campaign failed to get this project on track again.\n\nFor the moment, this game will be a totally Kickstarter and event exclusive. As of yet, I have no publisher to bring this game to the retailers. The goal of this campaign is to get this game onto other players' tables and if a publisher discovers it along the way, so much the better!\n\nI really believe in this game and I think it is worth publishing.

You can download them right now from here:\nExploriana - Reglas\nWe hope to have more translations soon! If you would like to get involved and translate the rules we are currently looking for German and French translations! \nEXPLORIANA is a competitive push your luck game of exploration and discovery designed by Miles Ratcliffe  with stunningly gorgeous artwork by Richard Dearing. The players control the fates of intrepid explorers travelling to the far off regions of the globe in search of unknown species of plants, fantastic animals, glittering treasures and incredible lost cities that have never been seen before!\nLate in the 19th century vast continents open up to exploration and a wave of interest grips scientists and explorers across the globe. Fantastic animals, strange and beautiful plants, fantastic treasures and ancient sites of lost civilisations all await discovery. Expeditions to far-off regions are always filled with peril, but the challenge is hard to resist. Brave adventurers in search of riches, scientists with a hankering for knowledge and recognition, and intrepid explorers with a burning desire to map the globe: all set out for these wondrous lands with hopes of gaining a place in the history books.\nBelow is a brief overview of Exploriana. To get a full understanding of the game we have several ways in which you can get more information!\nWant to try Exploriana? You can try our Print & Play versions or head over to Tabletopia for a virtual experience!\n                 Thanks to Tabletopia you can try Exploriana now with your friends\nPlay NOW on Tabletopia!\n   In Exploriana you decide the fate of brave explorers as they set out to far flung corners of the globe and trek deep into dangerous, uncharted wilds. Exploriana incorporates several game mechanics:\nresource management (money is the major resource in the game)\nvariable turn order (getting to play first can be a major advantage)\npush your luck (the core mechanic, drawing cards discovering treasure & avoiding dangers)\nan auction every round (winning auctions gains special item cards)\nset collecting (with the many card combinations available collecting certain cards will deliver more points)\nworker placement (placing your explorers is a crucial decision)\n Exploriana is played over a number of rounds split into four phases \nIncome & Auction phases\nEach turn the players collect some extra funding during the income phase, then they bid against each other in the quick fire auction phase to attempt to acquire some choice items from the items deck. Some items assist the players on their perilous expeditions and some help the players grab bonus victory points.\nSend Explorers phase\nNow it's time to send your explorers off on their voyages of discovery in the 'send explorers' phase. There are three regions to explore in Exploriana, South America, Africa and the Far East, all uncharted, filled with wonder and teeming with danger and the players must decide which of the regions they will brave. \nDiscovery phase\nThe discovery phase uses three very different region decks. Each deck is packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries but each also has an increasing amount of peril, from South America, to Africa through to the most dangerous region, The Far East. \nThe discovery phase uses an exciting push your luck mechanic to represent the expeditions heading further and further into the wilds. The players reveal cards until they either decide to stop and make some discoveries or to push on, reveal too many hazards they will get hopelessly lost instead.\nAs a player reveals discoveries, one card at a time, there is a chance that the card may have an associated hazard. Before revealing the next discovery the player may first hire a local guide, to cancel one revealed hazard, or use items that can help the expedition avoid disaster. However, if a player reveals any three hazards of the same type or all three different hazards, then the expedition is lost and makes no new discoveries.\nThere are three different types of hazards represented in Exploriana, the dangerous uncharted terrain the explorers must trek through, ferocious creatures that could attack the expedition at any time and simply losing ones way, forcing the party to backtrack and waste valuable time and resources.\nThe number of discoveries that an expedition can make while exploring is dependant on the types of discoveries revealed and how far the expedition manages to push into the wilds. A player can reveal up to five discovery cards for each of their expeditions and may choose to discover all of the revealed animals or any one of the others or they may even be able to rescue a lost explorer. If they were brave or lucky enough to have revealed all five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra selection. \nVictory \nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points. There are various ways to get victory points in Exploriana and bonus victory points are also awarded at the end of the game.\nThe discoveries the players make can give them renown, wealth and victory points, some even give the player more than one type. Renown determines the turn order and awards some bonus victory points. Any money the players have accumulated during the game converts into bonus victory points. Some of the items may give a player bonus victory points, some enhance victory points awarded by discoveries and some are worth money. Finally, lost explorers that your expeditions have rescued can increase your wealth and also add a variable number of bonus victory points.\nThe various mechanics and hard decisions the players are forced to make at every turn ensure multiple paths to victory, making Exploriana exciting and really enjoyable. A game you will want to play again and again!\nInterested in a run through of the game?

Triple Ace Games alone has run 17 successful Kickstarter campaigns to date. \n\nThe game is complete and we have already self funded the artwork and design. There will be no delay in sending the game to the factory. The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well known and well established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery to the fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product. \n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Team Glory\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nExploriana has been developed and produced by a collaboration of three separate games companies, Chaos Publishing Ltd, Triple Ace Games Ltd...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Show your support for Exploriana with a token pledge and join us on our Kickstarter expedition.\nBy making a small pledge you can follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style boardgame of 60 to 120 minutes for 2 to 4 players.\nGraphic design and primary illustrations by Alayna Lemmer-Danner.\nPlayers are the heads of powerful guilds in the city of Aegis. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the Aegis in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.\nThe Guilds exert their control in the city by sending Agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of Aegis. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to Aegis' infrastructure.\nTo win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the city such as defending it from external and internal threats.\nHere are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:\n1. Card Crafting: \nSimilar to the original Card Crafting System game Mystic Vale all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on 1/3rd of the slip and are transparent on the other 2/3rds. During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). Each card represents either an important citizen or a patrician of the city which may or may not bare allegiance to a guild. Each advancement in the game is linked to an important location in the city and represents an individual with sway or power over that location. By crafting cards players are giving their citizens and patricians connections to the key power brokers of the city, and thereby the influence needed to benefit from the military, economic and political institutions of the city. Power in Aegis is all about being well connected.\nUnlike Mystic Vale the cards are double-sided. The back side of each citizen and patrician is its evil counterpart from the Blight: either a Dark Agent or an Archfiend. Each time you sleeve a new connection onto one of you citizens or patricians you also are adding a new threat to the back-side of the card, giving the Dark Agent or Archfiend a new minion or evil spirit to command in its sinister plot against the city.\n2. Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: \nRather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different citizens and patricians in that deck. You may benefit from the connections of other players' guild members, but the favor comes with a price; one coin paid to that player for each connection of theirs you want to use. During the game you can claim the allegiance of more citizens and patricians in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal on it, meaning you now control a larger portion on the main deck.\n3. Card-driven worker placement: \nWhile your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. You don't pay a cost to sleeve an Advancement or use its ability: instead many require the use of Agents. For example, many effects require dispatching or recovering Agents to or from different city Locations. This represents the key connection of that Location granting, jobs, positions or access to your guild members. Many Locations have abilities that are powered-up or can be triggered once you have enough Agents there. Since you have a limited number of Agents to use, you will constantly have to choose which useful thing to forgo in order to do another.\n4. Threat Tower: There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and who the Blight will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Tower, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes accumulate on a card, that blight attacks Aegis, and player with the most of their color cubes is responsible for defending the city. Fail in your responsibility and your guild loses reputation, succeed and you guild gains reputation.\n5. Modular set up: \nEach game you use 10 Locations. The Agent Reward has 12, the Guildmaster Reward begins with 21 and more planned as Stretch Goals. The rules will have various recommended sets of Location to use, with each set offering multiple paths to victory and a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you can peruse. The Locations set for a game can also be specifically selected by you or chosen randomly, making for even more variety. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Advancements representing the key connection at that Location. Location Boards may specify special rules for Agent placement or extend the basic rules with all new systems such as area majority, or the ability to assemble a party of heroes and hunt the Blight, or offer the possibility to actually join the \"Blood Cult\" and become evil yourself.\nThe game is designed for 2-4 players. Our first Stretch Goal unlocks solo rules. There are no co-op rules for Edge of Darkness. \nClick Here to Download the Edge of Darkness Prototype Rules\nThese rules are not final and will continue to evolve as we move closer to production of the game. Please send any questions or comments about the rules to edge@alderac.com.\nBecause of the complex nature of the components of Edge of Darkness it isn't possible to produce a print & play version of the game.\nWe've designed our logistics system to provide the lowest possible cost for the delivery of your Rewards!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address.

Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input. \n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once. \n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

By order of the bishop, you have been commissioned to restore a large fresco painting on the cathedral's ceiling. But not surprisingly, you are not the only master commissioned for the project.\nThis is an engaging game for families and gamers that has been recognized with over 15 major award nominations and wins worldwide, including a nomination for the Spiel de Jahres (German Board Game of the Year) and the winner of the Deutscher Spiel Preis.\nYou will need to carefully plan your workday: when to wake the apprentices, what stalls to visit, which paints to buy, which tiles to paint, and when it is appropriate to make a generous donation to the bishop. Buying materials costs money, so be prepared to take on additional projects to earn money to acquire the paints and materials necessary for completing your tasks; but your apprentices are not automatons, you need to keep them happy too. An evening at the theater can go a long way toward keeping your apprentices happy. By managing your decisions carefully and planning ahead, you can become one of the masters of the ages.The decisions you make in Fresco are all wonderfully woven into the theme of managing the challenging undertaking of restoring a Renaissance masterpiece!\nThis video describes Fresco Expansion 1 and the Scrolls module included in Fresco Big Box.\nBecause of safety issues, the glass nuggets of the previous print run will be substituted with cardboard tokens.\nThis video describes Fresco Expansion 2 included in Fresco Big Box.\nFor more information on the game check out the following link:\nBGG-Site for Fresco Big Box\nRules in different languages\nShogun re-implements Wallenstein with a setting in Japan during the Sengoku or \u201cWarring States\u201d Period (1467 - 1603). Shogun is Queen Games' highest rated game on BGG (number 126). In Shogun, each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his empire and secure points. Castles, temples and theaters replace the infrastructure of Wallenstein (as rice replaces wheat), creating a thematic experience for players who wish to move their exploits east to the Land of the Rising Sun.\n Japan during the Sengoku or \u201cWarring States\u201d Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cube tower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes \u2013 SHOGUN!\nThe main goal of the game is to have as many counties under your control as possible, but that alone is not enough to win you the game. Players must develop these counties by building palaces, churches and guilds. In addition to building infrastructure, you must also feed your peasants or they will revolt. Revolting peasants can lose you armies and possibly the county. At the beginning of the game, starting locations are assigned with a drafting mechanic using country cards and cubes representing armies; this ensures a different game every time you play.\nThere are 10 actions that can be performed by a player during a game round. There are two locations involving actions. Each player has his/her own board. On this board, the player places a county card on a particular action (for example if I want to build reinforcements in Bremen, I would place my Bremen county card face down in the reinforcement action box). The order of these actions is determined by shuffling a deck of 10 cards and displaying the first 5 face up on the main game board and the last 5 face down. This order changes round to round. So while players know the last 5 actions, advance planning and maneuvering is rewarded for the players who think about what is coming.\nMoving (another one of your actions) into a country where there is another player sparks a battle. Battle can also occur when a player has moved into a Neutral County, or when a revolt occurs in one of their own counties. Battles are resolved with the dice tower. The tower is seeded at the beginning of the game with army cubes from all players and some peasants\u2019 cubes so that there can be no perfect knowledge. The attacker and defender put all their cubes from the contested area into the tower at the same time. Whoever has the most cubes that fall out of the tower and into the tray is the winner of the battle. Cubes from other players not involved in the battle that fall into the tray are not counted. However, any peasants\u2019 cubes in the tray side with the defender. In addition to invading and controlling counties, taxing counties for gold, acquiring grain to feed your peasant population, enlisting reinforcements and building infrastructure (whew!), there are event cards and bonus tiles that add additional twists to this exciting and deep game of military conquest!\nFor more information on Shogun and the Big Box check out the following links:\nBGG-Site for Big Box\nBGG-Site for Shogun Basic Game\nRules in different languages\nThe Expansions\nExpansion 1: Tenno's Court\nThe Shoguns are still fighting over the distribution of the empire\u2019s provinces while peasant revolts and famines do not encourage ruling the country. But none other than the disempowered Tenno might tip the scales for some of the sovereigns: Ensuring the favor of the Tenno by using your diplomatic skills will help you win precious gifts and highly rated privileges. But be careful: If you vie too much for the Tenno\u2019s favor you might easily loose control of your armies \u2026  \nPlayer's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; The other way for players to acquire courtiers, is by converting armies to courtiers during the game. Whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available.\nExpansion 2: Samurai\nSamurai which can be used with \"Emperor's Court\" or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as receiving gold or placing armies in the dice tower tray for future conflicts) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter (turns represent seasons) ends.\nExpansion 3: Military Leaders\nEvery player is given one military leader figure to place on one of his controlled counties. While performing actions in this county he gets extra benefits, such as costs of buildings are reduced by 1 or he earns one extra grain. At the end of a players turn he then moves the leader to an adjacent county under his control, leaving a marker at the old location. If a player can not place the leader adjacent to his county, he has to move it to any of his controlled counties not leaving a marker behind. The more markers you have on the board at the end of the game the more points will be awarded!\nExpansion 4: Chambers\nMany offices have to be taken in order to rule the land. For each region there are several positions to be filled by the players. At the beginning of each round 6 chamber markers are revealed and placed on the corresponding spaces on the chamber tableau. These 6 positions are available to be filled in each region by the players. Whoever has the most counties under his control in that region will fill the position and exchange the camber marker on the tableau with one of his own player markers. At the end of the game, players are awarded extra points for majorities in horizontal and vertical lines on the chamber tableau.\nProduction and Delivery  \nThe Production of Shogun and Fresco Big Box is planned for August 2018. Once produced, we plan to ship the pledges out to the backers as soon as possible.

This campaign contains the first three titles in the series.\nEvery single game is modular. They can be played stand alone, in series (adding end game scores), or integrated with 1 or more other TOKYO titles for an expanded new experience!\nTOKYO JIDOHANBAIKI is a game about Japanese vending machines and drinks! Utilizing exquisite, tactile components, this title includes over 20 unique 5-15 minute games from various guest designers across the globe. With a huge range of game types and flavors (deduction, dexterity, economic, etc), this game is perfect for any setting or player count!\nTOKYO METRO is a heavy economic simulation of the metro system in Tokyo, using a unique action placement cycling system, stock investments, speculation, loans, bicycles, grid movement, train riding, and more! Playing 1-4 players and taking 120 minutes on average, TOKYO METRO will fill the hearts of train enthusiasts and \u30b5\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 alike! \nTOKYO JUTAKU is a larger version of the previously sold out game Jutaku, where 1-8 players will take on the role of Japanese architects designing small, abstract home models on strangely shaped plots of land. With 69 unique wooden pieces and a range of building conditions from easy to very difficult, this real time dexterity game is very exciting for a large group, but can also be played as a solitary meditation experience.\nStretch goals have been planned for and costed from the outset, ensuring that their addition will not incur delivery delays or compromises in the quality of the final product elsewhere. All of the TOKYO SERIES games come fully upgraded with SPOT UV, thick chip board, linen cards, real wooden pieces, resin and ABS miniatures, and more to follow!\nAlso available as an add on is a beautiful fully metal currency that can be used with all of the TOKYO SERIES games! Only one print run of this currency design will be created.\nCheckout a basic overview video for how to play each of the games below, or even better read each rulebook after the video! For TOKYO JIDOHANBAIKI, only a few of the 20+ included games are shown, but many more will be added throughout the campaign as the rules are submitted.\nIf a game has the (\u00a5) character inside of a circle next to its title in the rulebooks, that game is eligible to be played in series by keeping a total end game cumulative yen score. (click the rulebooks to view them).\nI've had the privilege of demoing all 3 titles at Essen Spiel 2017, and at the Kickstarter booth at PAX Unplugged 2017 with great reception! Here are some shots from those events, plus some reactions from the players:\nHere are some really cool people I met, betting on which miniature drinks they think will come out of the vending machine tower.

This game of historical set collection will see players taking on the mantle of Curator in one of the world\u2019s great museums.\nDiscover lost civilisations from four continents and acquire relics to display in your galleries. Each object you exhibit will earn you points! Additionally, at the end of the game, you\u2019ll score more based on the size of your different Collections, which can be based on Civilisations or Domains. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!\nThe world will keep turning as you play however and you\u2019ll have to contend with historical events that may make the acquisition of artefacts harder, as well as facing the scrutinising gaze of public opinion.\nWill your Museum go down in the annals of history? Or will it simply be a footnote?\nMuseum is a \u00ab big box \u00bb game of set collection that allows you, as the curator, to choose the strategy that suits you best. Accomplished gamers will be able to draw out all the depth and complexity from the game\u2019s mechanics yet its simple rules can be easily adapted to suit newer and younger players.\nThe fruit of over a year\u2019s research, the 180 objects included in the game are real and each one has been lovingly redrawn by Vincent Dutrait.\n The cards are also furnished with accurate historical information, bringing each artefact to life! This continues into the rest of the game which has been designed to provide a fun and immersive experience featuring almost 300 unique illustrations!\nA challenging set collection game that can also be adapted to suit less experienced players.\nA beautiful game featuring almost 300 unique illustrations by Vincent Dutrait.\nRich historical content that will pique your curiosity!\nFrom 2 to 4 players with a duration of 15-20min per player.\nThe Central Board represents the organised chaos that was a curator\u2019s desk during these wonderous times! On it, you\u2019ll find many of the elements required during the game.\nMost prominent are the 4 Continents and the available Objects brought back for your consideration by industrious explorers. During the game you\u2019ll be attempting to amass collections of these cards. Collections can either be based on the treasures of one Civilisation in particular, or be themed on artefact Domains, and ensure you additional points at the end of the game.\nEach card possesses a Value (used when purchasing/scoring cards), a Civilisation/colour (used when scoring collections based on civilisations) and a Domain/icon (used when scoring collections based on domains). Each of these authentic objects also has a Name, Illustration and Description. These don\u2019t have any effect on the rules but will give you a much better sense of what the game is about!\nAt the start of your turn you can choose one of the eight object cards available on the main board and take it for free. These cards will serve bothfor scoring items and as currency in the game as in Museum, objects are purchased using other objects! So, choose your card wisely\u2026do you want to exhibit a card, or do you need it to pay for something more interesting? Maybe both?\nOther players don\u2019t sit idly by during your turn either. After you\u2019ve chosen one, all the other players may also take a card. If they do though, you get Prestige Points! Prestige points represent the favours and honours your museum accumulates during the game and can be used to purchase cards!\nOnce all players have taken a card, you can move on with your action phase. Each player has a Museum Board representing the hallowed halls of their great establishment and it\u2019s in this part of the turn that you\u2019ll be filling yours with wonders from around the world.\nYou have two actions available to you:\nYou can furnish your museum (placing cards down)\nor\nPerform an Inventory (picking cards up).\nTo play a card into your museum you simply discard other cards of equal or greater value. You can also use any prestige points you collect to pay for cards too. Whenever you play objects into your museum, you score their value in points. There\u2019s no limit to how many objects you can purchase in one turn, as long as you can pay for them!\nDiscarded cards aren\u2019t lost however! Your Discard Pile represents your museum\u2019s storage and Objects in there can still be played exactly as if they were in your hand, with the exception of course being that you can\u2019t use them to pay for other cards.\nHowever, as you\u2019ve shown that you\u2019re not as interested in these cards, you leave them open to being taken by other parties who may have a better use for them! Effectively; cards that are in your discard pile aren\u2019t available only to you, any other player can now access them too! Any player can purchase a card from your discard pile. If they do so though, they must give you one of their Prestige points as payment!\nInstead of playing cards down you can pick them up! This action allows you to take all the cards from your discard pile and place them back in your hand. Although you won\u2019t be able to do anything else that turn, it will allow you to (maybe) get a full hand of cards back and ready to use again as well as keeping them out of the reach of your opponents!\nOnce you\u2019ve performed one of these two actions any missing objects cards on the central board are replaced and play passes to the next player!\nThis represents the basic rules and structure for each turn of the game: play will continue to pass from one player to another as each of you improves upon your collections.\nIf you think that the game is going to let you do that peacefully though, you\u2019re in for a surprise:\nHeadline cards: Historical events will unfurl as the game advances, having a direct effect on players. Headline cards can make it harder, or easier, to acquire objects as well as having other amusing or challenging effects.\nNotoriety Cards: As your Museum grows so will the different favours you can call in. Notoriety cards are powerful single-use abilities that can give you an edge during the game.\nPersonnel: A good museum needs the right people to help run it and that\u2019s where personnel cards come in. Representing experts from different fields, these individuals can help you enrich your collections and score more points at the end of the game.\nPublic Opinion: Hidden within the continent decks are Public Opinion cards. These represent the press noticing curators that have been taking lots of artefacts from certain Continents, without ever displaying them to the public! These can accumulate on different continents, leading to lost points at the end of the game if you don\u2019t manage your discard pile properly!\nPatron Cards: Rich patrons of history and art are more than willing to help you in your endeavour, all you\u2019ll have to do is meet some of their requests. You\u2019ll choose one of these cards at the start of the game and they\u2019ll ask you to assemble certain collections in order to gain more points at the end of the game.\nThe game Continues until a player reaches 50 points. This signals the end of the game as the public starts lining up to visit your establishment! The player in question finishes their turn and then everyone else gets one more turn before we move on to tallying up points.\nCards placed into your museum can be moved around as you see fit during the game as you search for those last items and perfect layout. At the end though you\u2019ll need to decide on your final layout before your museum opens!\nCollections are formed by placing cards orthogonally adjacent to each other, and consist of two categories: Civilisations (cards of the same colour) and Domains (cards with the same icon but different colours). The bigger the collection, the more points you can score!\nOnce everyone has finished organising their collections, your museum opens its doors to the public (with no small amount of pomp and circumstance) and we move into final scoring to see who wins!\nFirst take the points you scored during the game and add those gained from your collections. You can also convert any remaining Prestige points into victory points too.\nYou then score points for your Patron card as well as your museum\u2019s layout. If you managed to amass a big enough collection and fill your Grand Gallery (the red slots on the board) and/or your Entire Museum, you score even more points!\nFinally, players lose points based on the Public Opinion tokens on the board. Each card in your discard pile belonging to a continent with at least one Public Opinion token loses you points! The more tokens there are, the more points you lose!\nYour fellow curators will of course do the same and once scores have been tallied up, the player with the most points wins!\nThis is of course a summary or Museum\u2019s rules. If you\u2019d like to read the full version, you can find the work in progress Rulebook below.\nClick to download.\n Please note that this is a work in progress and not representative of the final product.\nMuseum is, at its heart, a set collection game. It's family orientated with just the right amount of rules and player interaction. Additionally, it can be tailored to suit more casual or younger players by easily removing elements such as Personnel, Events, Notoriety cards or Public Opinion to create an even easier, quicker, yet just as fun to play game. You can then add the different modules back in as the players become familiar with the rules and want to challenge themselves more.\nFor the more seasoned players out there though, don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve forgotten about you. Museum is a simple game compared to some, but it doesn\u2019t lack depth. Whilst the game has been designed with a family setting in mind, some of you may have noticed some of the subtler nuances whilst perusing the rules above. From manipulating discard piles to \u201ctaxing\u201d highly sought-after cards, there\u2019s more than a few ways for gamers to get their kicks! On top of this, upcoming expansions will allow you to add other elements to the game and create a much more cerebral challenge!\nYou can watch a full 4 -player game of Museum here:\nYou can also watch a video explanation of Museum's rules with Jamie here:\nStill not convinced that you want to back Museum? This video by Rahdo might change your mind!\nBarry Doublet from Board Games Everybody should has made a video about Museum !\nYou can also read his written article here!\nInterested in the World's Fair Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nInterested in the Archaeologists Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nWe'll be posting lots more video content during the campaign, including interviews with the game's authors and opinions from reviewers from around the world!\nWhat would a good KS be without Stretch Goats? As we move further and further through the project you'll unlock more and more content including plenty of exclusive elements that will enrich your pledge!\n From the seedy underworld of the Black Market, to the prestigious heights of the World Fair, there\u2019s more to the world of Museum than meets the eye!\nHow do I include add-ons in my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page.\n2. On the next screen, click on the blue \u201cChange your pledge\u201d button.\n3. Then, in the current reward box you\u2019ve chosen, increase the pledge amount by the value of the add-on and then click on the green \u201cContinue\u201d button.\n4. A new window will appear, click on the blue \u201cConfirm\u201d button.\n5. It\u2019s done!\n6. A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\nCurrently the game design for Museum is complete. You can see prototype copies of the game being played in the reviews and videos shown on this page. Whilst we\u2019re very happy with the game\u2019s current state, there may well be a few final modifications and checks to be made before we\u2019re fully satisfied with the final result.\nAs for stretch goals and other content we may unlock during the campaign: The game design for the majority of these elements have been tested and finalized. Any remaining queries should be resolved not long after the Kickstarter has ended. The brunt of the remaining work lies in the illustration work as you may have guessed.\nThe Core game is around 80% complete whereas the expansions require significantly more work. This has of course been taken into account for the announced delivery date. As Vincent finishes the illustrations the rest of the team will be working on pre-production so that the game is ready to be sent to print as soon as possible. We\u2019re planning for production to begin in late March in order to hit our planned delivery date of late July/early August.\nHowever, all this depends on the route the campaign takes. We have prepared as much as possible but developments during the campaign may cause delays so please bear this in mind.\nOlivier Melison and Eric Dubus have known each other for over 30 years, during which time they have played a huge selection of games together! Museum was born from their mutual desire to create a historically-themed game. When they're not creating amazing games together, Olivier works in international publishing, and Eric is a history teacher.\nVincent Dutrait is one of, if not the most, respected illustrators in the board gaming industry. Having worked on over 50 different projects (including Lewis & Clark, New York 1901, Robinson Crusoe, Broom Service, Lovecraft Letter, T.I.M.E. Stories, Augustus & Tikal 2...) his unique style of illustration and graphic design is popular with both players and publishers alike. He has also had the opportunity to work on prestigious licences such as Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer Fantasy, Pathfinder, Cthulhu and Games of Thrones.\nHoly Grail Games is a board game publisher that was born from its creators\u2019 desire to make great, unique games. HGG brings together the experience and passion of Jamie Johnson (community manager on multiple projects including Conan and The 7th Continent Kickstarter campaigns) Vincent Dutrait (renowned illustrator and artistic director) , and Olivier Melison (entrepreneur, passionate player and game author).\nWell, the real question is - why not? Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general are amazing tools for game publishers and have revolutionized our industry. Financially it is one of the most beneficial routes of publishing and helps us ensure that everyone involved in the project earns a good living from each game. At the end of the day, this is what allows us to continue to do what we love! Kickstarter is also an amazing communication tool, allowing us to reach out directly in a unique and engaging way to those most interested in what we have to offer.\nBut that's not all. Beyond good business sense, Kickstarter allows us to prioritise quality over quantity. It allows us to only deal with games that we love and believe in 100%, taking the time and care necessary to push their development as far as it will go. In the case of Museum, it has allowed us to justify the extensive art budget that we wanted to attribute to the game. Simply put, games like Museum and/or their content would just not be viable with a \"traditional\" publishing method.\nWith the leeway and support afforded to us by these kind of projects, we can take a normal gaming experience and make it extraordinary. Via both material and content, our aim is to have all our games provide a unique, exciting, engaging and luxury experience!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by August 2018. This may seem like a long time as the game itself is already quite advanced (as detailed in the \"development\" section). However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, fabrication and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nMeeple Logistics will be ensuring delivery In Europe and the surrounding regions whereas Shipnaked will be taking care of North America and other worldwide destinations.\nAs mentioned previously, Shipping costs are not included in your pledge. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase. \nCurrently the shipping for this project is both EU, US and CA friendly. What does this mean? It means that backers from these two regions will not have to pay any import tax whatsoever when they receive their game.\nHowever, even if your region is not covered by this: please rest assured that our dispatcher will ensure you pay the absolute minimum in tax or brokerage for your game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo crowdfunding project comes without risk but we have done our utmost to minimise it.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first rodeo, we have been involved in many Kickstarters before so are very familiar with any potential pitfalls.\n\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating an August 2018 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We are thankful for their contributions and plan on advancing the tabletop experience.\nThis Water Feature Collection was created for our personal AD&D campaign. While designing a Dark Elf Cavern* deep in the Underdark we wanted a reason for our players to interact with the terrain.  We came up with the idea of having a bunch of pool, spouts and bowls that have random magical effects. Drawing up a d20 water effect generator, characters that drink from the waters experience an effect for a short time.\nFantasy RPG: Its nice to be able to print terrain that will work with your Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder campaign that looks great and have an interaction effect! As stated above we have play tested random temporary effect for players that drink from the waters.\nDrinking from the waters could cause the adventurer to instantly cluck like a chicken gaining +5 initiative on the next encounter or whistle a quick melody gaining +5 to next dexterity check or the water could restore d4 health.  Not all waters offer a benefit some could require the adventurer to eat rations or suffer d4 damage.  Great concept and adds great value for interaction with the terrain.\nSiFi Gaming: Spacefinder!

They can easily blend into other terrain pieces I have or standout as needed. I would certainly recommend them to any who actually has a 3d printer. \nDave from Draven's RPG Review: I'm sure any gamers out there who own a 3D printer would love to make their own terrain, and these designs are some of the nicest I've ever seen.\nDave also posted an unboxing video and showed each piece. - Unboxing Video \nIn Game Mechanics: When a players drink from the waters they will be granted a temporary effect. Once a player drinks from the water source they are numb to receiving the effect again until after a short or long rest.  However! the water effect changes the next time the player drinks from it, have player roll for effect result.  The water when collected into a vessel loose the effect so it can't be stored for later use.  Most of the effects wear off quickly but some wear off after a short or long rest.  In general we do not stack effects.  We let the player who drinks the waters roll a d20 and read off the taste and effect for everyone to hear.  Lastly, you can change the effects, taste, let effects stack or even let players store some collected water if you wish, its your campaign Have Fun!\n  Possibilities: With 3d Printers we are able to make complex pieces in a single print which is drastically different from the traditional method of making the same piece using molds. With molds a complex design piece require us to make parts and then glue them together to create the same type of piece. Designing gaming terrain using software gives us the ability to make high definition simple AND complex terrain designs at a level not seen until now.\nWith that in mind we have every intention of taking advantage of this technology and pushing tabletop gaming terrain/scenery to an unparalleled level, this is just the beginning.\nWe See Eye to Eye: We want you to know we are doing this for both of us! You have a 3d Printer and are already part of the future or perhaps getting ready to jump in.  All you need is someone to design new quality content at a fair price, We promise you, we will continue to make affordable designs and offer discounts on our crowd funding campaigns.\n3d Printers in 2017: 3D Printing is affordable and easy to use! Currently there are good 3d printers such as the Monoprice Select Mini v2 pricing in at just over 200$ and PLA plastic for printing is less then 20$. With your own printer and files everyone can now make unlimited pieces for your tabletop gaming adventures.\nBackstory: A few years ago my wife and I created Mystic-Realm and began creating tabletop gaming terrain. Sculpts were made by hand using clay and a full range of tools. We made silicone molds and hand casted each piece using resin. Together we painted each peace offering them on eBay and our website. It has been an incredible experience with lots of fun and now we are moving into the future with 3d printing. This campaign is the first step in that direction. Once this campaign is over each piece will be listed on our website at 2$ per piece.  This is your chance to get the collection at a discount with free stretch goals as they unlock. We are looking for hardcore gamers like yourselves who love tabletop gaming with high quality 3D terrain.\nThis is the beginning of a loyal partnership with you. Thank you for believing in us, thank you for being our partner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNearly every design is complete, we just need a little bit more funding to finish the last few models. By the time the crowd funding campaign comes to a close we expect to have 100% of the plans ready for download.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

Dragon / Human size comparison (Dragon supplied unpainted. Leo not supplied at all)\nThe Dragon is supplied with the Archangel Saint Michael, one bombard, two artillerymen, ruins, 4 hexes, 6 hexagons of destruction and a special scenario featuring the Dragon, played by one player, and an army of human soldiers assisted by angels, played by the other players (1 or 2).\nClick here to find out more about this Add-On\n\u201cI loved loved loved this, and spent two days with the scenario bubbling in my mind around the other tactical options I could have taken!\u201d\nWarren (Beasts of War)\n\u201cThe miniatures are all cool.

Had a great time playing it.\u201d\nSam Healey (The Dice Tower) - in the Top 3 of the best games that Sam played at Gen Con 2017.\n\u201cTime of Legends: Joan of Arc stole the show for us. Mythic Games had pictures of hard plastic miniatures painted up, and they looked incredible.\u201d\n Techraptor at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cWithout a doubt, hands-down, my big giant experience at (GenCon) was Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.

Backers may, however, double their rewards by doubling their pledge amount (for example, $40 for two copies of Near and Far: Amber Mines, and then add shipping only once). Backers may not triple or quadruple their rewards, etc.  \nIt is possible that Near and Far: Amber Mines will be printed later by international publishers in various languages.

Much of the art is finished and the game is ready, but it won't see the light of day without the funds needed to see that the game is printed.\n\nThere are many other challenges to making sure this project is successful. Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games. My experience helps me ensure a smooth pre-production process.\n\nWith your help, we can have the funds to print the game, overcome the various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you are delivered a quality product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "SINGLE ITEM: Underforest Printed Book", "descp": "For Above and Below.

You can already find the new Kickstarter page here. Please hit the 'notify me on launch' button so you can back us right from the start. You can find more information about the relaunch in the latest update. Thanks!\nAbout The Game:\nGame Outlines\nHeropath is a fantasy game that incorporates features of classic Eurogame\nIn this story, the heroes join together to eradicate evil forces from their land. Although heroes start the game together, they end up each on their own path experiencing unique places, facing vicious monsters and struggling to gain power. The hero that obtains the most power will be the one to slay the dragon.\nEach hero will need to tactfully decide when to cooperate and when to be deceitful. As evil continues to rise throughout the game, the real competition is not against fellow heroes but rather the game itself.\nHeropath is played with 2 to 4 players, although there is an option to play with 6 players (with expansion packs).\nThis game doesn't just incorporate battle strategies, but also requires precise logistic planning and efficient resource management.\nGame Features\nTesters reviewing the game: Heropath\nPLAY\n\nGame Innovations:\nThis game combines a fantasy game with a Eurogame by incorporating three preexisting mechanisms:\n        1. CDR - Card Draft Rotation\n        2. FOW - Fog Of War\n        3. SOE - Scale Of Evil\nMechanism Description:\n Regarding mechanism 1 - CDR\nCDR enables the accumulation of power and players being able to choose their preferred game approach. This is done by; shuffling the cards between all players before the game begins, and allowing each hero to collect their preferred tools and methods.\n Regarding mechanism 2 - FOW\nSame FOW as in the classic computer game Warcraft, where a vast map was displayed to the player. Although in Heropath the map has thick, black smoke covering the land. In beginning stages the smoke effectively hides unrevealed spots where enemies are hiding. This effect will materialize as players advance further in the game.\n Regarding mechanism 3 - SOE\nIn this game, players must manage their steps wisely. With every advancement and power gain, your companions (who are playing against you) are advancing as well.\nThis creates harder battle arenas. Due to fear of losing, heroes may skip the station where the weak dragon is hiding, and in turn they are left defeated.\nResource Management\nIn this game, you must manage your resources more efficiently than that of the opposing participants. The more the heroes advance, the enemies\u2019 power advance as well. The game does not sit idly.\n  Player Interaction\nOne of the interesting features included in this game is the direct player interaction.\nIn so many games, especially Eurogames, there can be such little interaction that players can go almost the entire game without running into each other.\n     The interaction in this game raises the bar to the next level, unlike Eurogames, this game includes:\n1. Trading between heroes\n2. Stealing from other heroes\n3. Causing direct and indirect damage by using accessories/magic  \n4. Ambushing and tossing other players into the Goblin Prison\nAll of these interactions are happening while players remain oblivious to the fact that the game itself is simultaneously causing conflict and damage to the participants. The game wants to unexpectedly undermine you, and ultimately defeat you with your own preferred playing method.\nExpansion I: With Allies\n\"Now I shall haunt you, until you know the wrath of the flames, for this is my vengeance.\"\nIf one year ago, the Giant had been told how and where his life would take him, no one would have believed it, let alone heard of the goblin-slaying Giant. If only it wasn't for that one damn winter, up until then, our friend was a peaceful farmer, content with his share. He bothered no one and no one bothered him, until that goblin raid from the Caves of Doom \u2013 the night when their fury torched 1,000 straw huts, the night when the dank air was filled with the sounds of screams and weeping. That was also the night when, from the fire, the pain and the grief, a hero was reborn \u2013 and the legend was born as well \u2013 of the Giant who fought back. The Giant who faced everyone \u2013 and returned the favor twice over.\nIn this expansion:\nExperience a wide variety of additional, diverse events. Marvel at new abilities that will grant you new powers.\nGather companions to join your campaign!\nEnjoy the new additional dice. Get a new \"Giant\" character to enrich play.\n- You can now play alongside more friends in a wider, richer saga, as well as increase the number of participants by one more player!\nIf you buy more expansions, you can increase the number of participants up to 6 players!\nExpansion II: Fire and Light\n\"In dark times \u2013 in your hour of need \u2013 I shall return to you \u2013 that is my way.\"\nThese words were known to famed isolationists and those in-the-know as the final prophecy left by the Wizard. To others, it was no more than a rumor or a fable told to little children. But when the cursed hour arrived, and swarms of enemies sprouted from every hill, crevice and tunnel, it was also that hour \u2013 the hour foretold. The strange thing about prophecies, as you know, is that no one really believes in them, until he appeared\u2026 out of the darkness, the light appeared, and it shined in all colors and flashes, and the ground trembled at his feet \u2013 as he whispered under his breath: \"Dance, you fools, dance all the way from here to hell\u2026 dance, but do not forget to whisper to the dragon on your way\u2026 the wizard is back \u2013 your time is over.\"\nIn this expansion:\nAdditional assortment of interesting and festive events. Discover additional abilities that will transform your play. Study new and exciting magic spells to learn new fighting techniques.\nEnjoy the new function of magic dice!\nGet a new \"Wizard\" character to re-diversify play. You may cast fire spells at enemies or lightning spells against the dragon!\nYou can now play alongside more friends in a wider, richer saga, as well as increase the number of participants by one player!\nIf you buy more expansions, you can play with up to 6 players!\nNote: this \"expansion\" cannot be used without the Heropath \"core game\".\nLink to publisher website: http://unique-games.com\nIn this video, we tried to give you a glance at the spirit of the game.\nPLAY\n\nGetting the board game - Shipping information\nWe will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter has finished, based on the actual costs and information provided by our pledge manage after the campaign ends.\nWe do our best to keep shipping costs to a minimum.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are located, we will either ship to you from our hubs in; the UK, China, or the USA.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (5 kg weight for core box). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may vary depending on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\n\u2022 USA: $25-$30 to most states.  \n\u2022 CANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.  \n\u2022 ASIA: $40 -50$\n\u2022 OCEANIA: $30-$65.  \n\u2022 OTHERS $35-$95  \n\u2022 EUROPE: $25-$35\nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the closest usable hub at a later date, and will likely incur increased shipping costs. We will update you on estimated shipping boxes once we have the final box layout and dimensions sorted. All shipping will be done by carefully selected shipping partners, to minimize any chance of damage to the shipment!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have play tested this for 100+ hours, in events, even at the Spiel Essen fair, and will continue to do so during the next few months as we gather feedback. Therefore the game may be subject to change, which may affect our delivery schedule.\n\nWe also invite our backers to provide feedback on the current game version, this may change the exact number and types of components that will make go into the final game.\n\nWe are almost finished with the art behind the game, and are working closely with our manufacturers, although due to manufacturing and shipping there may be unexpected delays. \n\nPotential delays may occur with products that are produced in China. Common delays are often found in; production, shipping and customs. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others.\n\nREFUND GUARANTEE \nWe have prepared as much as possible for a successful production and Kickstarter. Although, if the game for any unforeseen reason cannot be deliver we will refund pledges according to the amount we received (after fees are applied).\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the Heropath\u2019s final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project. \n\nAfter sending our confirmation e-mail, you have an 8-week period to get back to us confirming your pledge.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week period has ended. \n\nPlease verify that your address can accept packages sent through normal shipping, unfortunately we cannot deliver to P.O. boxes.\n\nIf these terms are not acceptable to you, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign, and purchase the game when it is released.

A nice starter printer that can print these files starts around $220 (see our F.A.Q. for more info on printers, printing costs, filaments, and more.)\nEven if you don't currently own a 3D printer, it benefits you to support this campaign now.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played.

Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder.

Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1.

Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved!

It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings.

As a result, you've unlocked every stretch goal I could throw at you. The game is now bigger and better than I could have imagined. Thank you!\nRead Bod's full review here.\nI was inspired to create Forest of Fate by the gamebooks of my childhood, the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkein and Terry Pratchett, and the amazing and varied scenery near my home on the South West coast of England.\nMy goal was to make roleplaying games more accessible by stripping back almost all the conventional elements, revealing a strong procedural storytelling experience that is:\nEasy to grasp and \"safe\" for new players\nSelf-contained, and quick to play\nEndlessly replayable\nI hope I've succeeded!\nForest of Fate uses nothing but a storybook and high-quality cards for its unique brand of survival storytelling. It's compact enough to take anywhere, and has no small parts to lose!\nCheck out some of the gorgeous character art by the brilliant Milly Hanson:\nThe Thief\nThe Bard\nThe Ranger\nThe Warrior\nHere's a simplified interaction between a Character and an Encounter, to demonstrate the anatomy of the most important cards.\nThe Story Book is the heart and soul of Forest of Fate. It contains 1,164 paragraphs to spark your imagination, describing the encounters you'll face and the actions you'll take.\nA computer rendering of the Deluxe Story Book (Hero tier and above)\nYou have three choices when it comes to using the Story Book:\nThe content and gameplay for all three versions is identical, though I recommend the digital version - it can be updated later if we spot mistakes, and more importantly helps to save the forests we love!\nI've tried to make all rewards simple and fair. Please note that this campaign will not be using a pledge manager. Once it's over, it's over. If you've got your eye on something you should grab it while you can!\nForest of Fate is the debut game from Cards of Fate. As a startup publisher without a great deal of capital to invest or a name in the industry, I view Kickstarter as an exciting opportunity to help build a small community around my games and reward those who share my vision.\nPlaytesting (all components pictured are early prototypes, not final)\nThank you for reading, and I hope I've inspired you to try Forest of Fate.\nThanks also to the fine folk at Tabletop Audio for the ambient forest sounds used in my videos.

Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal service.\nWe expect to fulfill all rewards from within the EU, and as a result EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT \nShipments to backers outside of the EU will have the most updated EUR-equivalent value for each pledge level declared as the value of the package. For example, 25 USD is currently 21 EUR. That's roughly an equivalent of 31,5 CAD / 31,5 AUD / 24 CHF / 2 754 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees. \nTracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. \nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Hungary, Russia, Asia, South America, Africa or Antarctica. \nWe are confident the game we present to you is really good. Nevertheless, for your convenience we offer a satisfaction guarantee: a 100% return policy within 6 months counting from date of successful delivery, if you are not satisfied with the product. No questions asked. We will refund your full pledge amount, but we\u2019ll ask you to cover the cost of sending the game back to us. \nEnchanters is a fantasy card drafting game. As an Enchanter you create an artifact and upgrade it each turn. Every card you take retains some of its power. As you grow stronger, you can take on more powerful monsters and, if you plan well, even defeat a dragon.\nTo setup a game just:\n1. Give each player 5 crystals.\n2. Shuffle the Kingdom decks (one per player) together.\n3. Place 6 cards (Items and Enchantments only) on the Journey Track.\n4. Choose a Village Card.\n5. Pick the first player.\n6. You're ready to play.\nPlayers take turns to embark on quests: you collect cards from the Journey Track by paying with crystals. Cards go into two stacks: the Item Stack (here you put cards like \u201cLong Sword\u201d), and the Enchantment Stack (where you play titles, like \u201cof Fire\u201d). Combined, they create a \u201cLong Sword of Fire\u201d. The cards grant both temporary bonuses (upper icons and skills) and/or permanent ones (bottom icons).\nPlayers may also attack approaching monsters and defeat them in a simple combat encounter to score points. In combat, you compare your Defense against the monster's Strength to determine whether you receive damage. Then, you need to accumulate as much Attack as the monster's Health to defeat it. You keep defeated cards as trophies.\nFrom time to time, you rest in the village to gain crystals or heal wounds. If you do, discard the first card from the Journey Track.\nAt the end of each turn replenish the Journey Track to 6 cards.\nThe game ends when the last card is taken or discarded.\nWant to know more? See Richard 'Rahdo' Ham play:\nHere\u2019s the rulebook: \n  Note: Rulebook is not final, but really close to it. We\u2019re open to your feedback. \nWant to check out the Enchanters yourself? Just download, print and play. You\u2019ll just need some tokens to count crystals and wounds. The decks you find inside are what you need to play a full game. \n   Or try the game out on Tabletopia:\n  While Enchanters was thoroughly tested, we always welcome your feedback. Feel free to make suggestions and ask questions in the comments section.\n              First of all, Enchanters will not be published internationally without your help.  \nWe\u2019re still a relatively small independent publishing house. In 2016, we designed and published the Enchanters in Poland (under the name Zaklinacze). \nWhile the Polish edition was well received, we are cannot wait to share the game with the rest of the world. We know the game is good, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of players enjoy it - hardcore players and families alike. We had some time since the first run to make the game even better. We hope that reaching the stretch goals will allow us to show the Enchanters to the world in full glory.  \nOther companies in Poland approached us with publishing deals, but we turned them down. We decided to stay independent, make a name for ourselves, maybe go full-time one day. You can help us make this dream come true.\nOnce the game is funded, you will be one of the first to get it (maybe with the exception of Essen attendees). Also, once the game goes to retail, we expect the price to go up from the $25 Kickstarter price \u2013 that depends on the stretch goals we manage to unlock.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you see, we have very short delivery time. This begs a question, how do we do that?\n\n1) Both graphic design of the game and illustrations on the cards are 90% ready, since the game had a first edition in Poland last year.\n\n2) The production facility that we use (Trefl for cards, Mediagold for the rest) are located in our home cities. We worked together in the past and have booked their printing equipment ahead of time for this project.\n\n3) Gindie publishing house, the business Jacek is the owner of, is making t-shirts and gadgets for polish webcomics. He has rich experience in shipping and proven crew working every day of the week. \n\n4) The Polish edition of Enchanters was also crowdfunded. That campaign taught us a lot. We don\u2019t intend to repeat our mistakes.\n\n5) Our professional background gave us skills to do this right. All of us are working in video game development - an industry that provides even more challenges than board games.\n\n6) Last but not least, Ludi Creations, our partner in this endeavor, is a Kickstarter veteran.

Lucky for me, Canadian game designer, polyglot, traveler and all-around lovely human being Maxime Rioux (above left) volunteered his services. \nFor more than a year and a half we've been brainstorming, designing, scrapping, re-designing, experimenting, tinkering and testing, testing, testing.\nWe started long distance (I live in Germany, Maxime in Quebec), using a half-defunct web-based software called Tabloro to fiddle and test, including many very fun sessions with Itchy Feet fans over Skype (thank you, friends!).\nThen we played with handwritten flash cards, refining and re-jiggering and trying new ideas. We've been absolutely ruthless with it, only hanging on to the very best parts and cutting away any and all fat. \nWe wanted to create a game that was: \nSimple to learn\nInteractive\nFun to replay again and again\nNeither of us are huge gamers, so this was a high bar. It had to be something that we would love. With Itchy Feet: the Travel Game, we really believe we've succeeded. Our testers have been knocking our door down, wanting to keep playing.

The main mechanic is action selection with advanced resource management and an optional focus on area control. Game play generally takes 15-30 minutes per player.\nThe game was written and engineered over the course of several years by lifetime gamer, graphic designer, and branding consultant Marc Neidlinger, with the help of hundreds of play testers, artists, writers, and game enthusiasts.\nGame Play Overview\nThe game begins: thrown overboard for a life of wretchedness, you wash ashore a hostile island ruins. Through advanced resource management, area control tactics, and freeform action selection, you\u2019ll add companions to your party, acquire bizarre relics, attain potent character traits, and defeat a host of unusual monsters in the ultimate goal of mastering heroic attributes \u2014 and regaining honor.\nYou perform 3 actions on each turn in the order you feel is most advantageous that turn: activate a companion, travel to a new location, and interact with a map tile\u2014taking advantage of a few free actions along the way. Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game's most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain courage (inspired strength) which allows you to defeat monsters.\nAs you exert your influence to attain heroic attributes, build your party, and embark on your adventure, you'll find over 100 unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways to create potent combinations...only some of which will come out each game.

We've already approached the fulfillment companies for estimates and processes. We feel confident because we are using established fulfillment companies who have depth of experience specifically in the gaming industry.\n\nWhile this is Orange Nebula's first crowdfunding project (as creators), we have been in business for over 4 years under this name, with a full-time staff of 5 plus half a dozen steady contractors. We have carefully prepared for this project, including high levels of communication with manufacturers, fulfillment companies, financial institutions, tax and legal specialists, and a handful of other vendors.\n\nAs you are reading this, 90% of the design production and high-res digital file preparation is already completed. As a creative agency, we are experts at file preparation and print production, so there will be no delays on our end in that regard. All of the files for the miniatures are already built and ready to rock.\n\nIn terms of fulfillment, there will undoubtedly be a few bumps along the way -- there always are a few -- but we are committed to doing the right thing even when nobody is looking. This is our reputation. Our vision is to make the gaming industry stronger and smarter, and it is our privilege to be a part of it all.

Don't panic! Click the image to be automatically directed to where you can order Overworld!\n  Overworld is a competitive tile-placement, territory control, and exploration board game for 2-4 Players with a 1-player Solo Quest Variant! It was designed by Nemo Rathwald for ages 14+ and plays in about 30 minutes. The most beautiful thing about Overworld is its elegance in simplicity; it takes only 5 minutes to teach but mastery will only develop after many, many plays.\nIf you enjoy games like...\nCarcassonne\nAlhambra\nTakenoko\nTsuro\nThen Overworld should especially resonate with you!\nIn Overworld, players act as explorers piecing together bit by bit the map of the Overworld by placing specially designed interlocking tiles drawn from a bag onto an expanding world map and adding your explorer tokens onto any new tile you explore. The interlocking teeth will only allow you to place your tiles in legal locations, making gameplay very smooth and easy to learn. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\" \nEnclosed gaps will eventually form in the landscape, and in these gaps are where elusive Dungeons are discovered. Discover the Dungeons furthest apart from one another and control the most territory with your explorers riding Umbirds and Ships to win!\nOverworld is the second installment of our Super Nano Enhanced Series, which began with Fire of Eidolon (shipping now worldwide!) This project will undergo several ENHANCEMENTS during the campaign which will upgrade the components and content of Overworld, and can be unlocked via Backer total Stretch Goals, Funding Stretch Goals, and Social Media goals, which will all be explained in detail below.\nEVERY BACKER MAKES A DIFFERENCE! Overworld is mechanically like a Euro-game but is also highly thematic and heavily inspired by the 16-bit era of Role Playing and Adventure video games of the 1990's. It is visually stimulating and loaded with stylistic parody and in-jokes that fans of retro videogames will appreciate while still being accessible and wholly enjoyable by everyone all within a unique, original, and compelling game that stands entirely on its own. We started the Super Nano Enhanced Series with Fire of Eidolon and we continue the tradition as you explore that world in ages past...in Overworld!\nOverworld came to Magic Meeple Games as a fully complete publish-ready game called Mirage which had been nearly published by another company before coming to us at Origins a couple years ago. We absolutely loved Mirage and saw an opportunity to re-theme the game to fit into our Super Nano Enhanced Series. With a new title and theme, Overworld has been under iteration and development for years and we feel it is finally ready for everyone to enjoy!\nEasy to learn and teach, difficult to master, immersive theme, and a new board every time you play!\nHere are some of the features you'll find in this game and in our Kickstarter campaign:\nGreat Gameplay! - High praise from reviewers, gamers, convention-goers of all ages for Overworld! \nHigh Replayability! - Overworld uses a brand new PUZZELOCK TILE SYSTEM and is never the same game twice! Procedurally generate the world as you play to make every game a brand new story!\nHigh Accessibility! - Overworld uses a very simple set of rules has an extremely gentle learning curve and is extremely easy to pick up and play! The game can be taught in about FIVE MINUTES and after playing a few times will players begin to understand the depth that Overworld offers!\nBacker-only Discounts! - After all Enhancements from this campaign, Overworld will have an MSRP of at least $35.99. Our Backers can get it right now for just $25 no matter how much content is added on through Enhancements and Stretch Goals! That's a savings of nearly $11 per copy!\nENHANCEMENTS! Stretch Goals! Achievements! - Your pledge WILL make the game better! Together we will make it awesome! Every backer matters!\nInteractive Kickstarter campaign - Throughout the campaign we will make decisions about Enhancements and features based on the feedback YOU provide in our update polls! Leave your mark on tabletop gaming history!\nSimplest Bundle Pricing on KickStarter! - Order as many copies of Overworld as you want at $25 each and pay shipping only for the first one! Just add $25 per extra copy and enter the total at the pledge confirmation screen. Boom. Done. No spreadsheets. No tricks.\nCustomer Support - It is our duty and honor to put your concerns at ease throughout the ENTIRE production process. Frequent updates during the campaign and no less than one update a month post-campaign until delivery. If you have a question or just want to say hello, reach out to us!\nand now for something NEW:\nMONEY-BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE - We're borrowing a page from Stonemaier Games and offering a Money-back guarantee with the Overworld project! Within one month of receiving Overworld, if you're unhappy with the product and customer service you've received, just send the game back to us and we'll issue a full refund of your original pledge!\nNemo Rathwald's Puzzelock Interlocking Tile Design solves the #1 problem with tile-placement games!\n  Did you run out of play space? You can actually move this board and everything stays IN PLACE!\n  Questions? We're here to help! We aim to have 24-hour or less response time to all inquiries during the campaign!\n \nSuper Nano Enhanced Series games undergo many ENHANCEMENTS throughout the campaign, many are achieved like normal Stretch Goals, but some are special and will require involvement in the comments or on social media!\nHave a look at what we'e accomplished so far!\n      Click the image to visit our Twitter page!\n  And click HERE to visit our Facebook Page! \n  Measure the X/Y limits of your map and calculate your score much faster with this handy tool!\n  Towns and Sidequests now part of the Overworld package!\n  LINEN FINISH NOW INCLUDED!\n  You asked for it, and we've been saving it for the epic finish! Can we reach this high?\n    Your turn in Overworld is 4 simple steps: \n                                           Draw a Land Tile (from the bag) \nAttach it to another tile on the board (IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!) \nAdd Explorers to the Tile you added (one per segment, Umbirds for land, Ships for Sea) \nResolve Gaps! (Check for Dungeon discoveries!)\nJust how easy is it to play Overworld? Have a look!\nThe game will begin with a single Coastline Tile on the board. Begin your turn by drawing a Land Tile from the bag.\n  You may choose to place the tile LAND side up or SEA side up, as long as there is a place to connect it where the teeth fit without obstruction. IF THE TEETH FIT, IT'S LEGIT!\n  After placing a Land Tile, place three of your Explorer tokens on it, Umbird tokens explore LAND, and Ship tokens explore SEA. Each player gets seven of both to Explore the Overworld!\n  Yellow's turn is over, play continues in this way as Red and White each get a turn...until a gap is created into which no other tile can fit, then a Dungeon is discovered!\n  Dungeons are Discovered by counting up all of the Explorer tokens belonging to each player in all regions connected ORTHOGONALLY to the gap. Yellow has the most Explorers connected to this gap and gets to claim the Dungeon discovery.\nExplorer tokens (Umbirds or Ships) that are used to Discover a Dungeon (i.e. those belonging to the player that had the most and placed their dungeon door in the gap) are returned to that player to be used again, the others stay on the board!\nTake note that player White placed the tile that gave player Yellow that Dungeon! This is a very important tactic that you will need to deprive your opponents of territory!\nIf there is a tie, the player who placed the tile gets to decide who breaks the tie and gets the Dungeon Discovery. \nPlay continues until no more tiles remain in the bag, then scoring begins.\nEND OF GAME\nYou collect points for the Explorer tokens you still have in play, and the total distance of the shortest path (in Orthogonal spaces) around all of your Dungeon doors in play, door-to-door-to-door. Like this:\n  Click here to see the complete End Game scoring ruleset!\n    CURRENT GAME CONTENTS:\nThis list will change and evolve as we unlock Stretch Goals and add Enhancements! \nBox & Rulebook - Similar size and style as a 16-bit video game's box and manual!\n32x PUZZELOCK Land Tiles - Double-sided and Die-cut with our special Puzzelock design that physically prevents invalid tile placement. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\"\n28x Umbird Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n28x Ship Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n12x Dungeon Door Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n4x Quick-Reference/Faction Cards - Poker-Sized Cards - Never forget a rule or which color belongs to which player with these handy Quick-Reference/Faction cards! THANK YOU TO OUR DAY-1 BACKERS!\n1x Tile Bag - For randomization of tiles, through Enhancement goals, this could become a luxurious drawstring cloth bag with an embroidered design!\nExtra Zip-Lock Baggies - To carry everything and keep it organized!\nEXPANSION CONTENT PLANNED - To be revealed via Stretch Goal Enhancements. Planned content includes: Solo play and more than one Mini-Expansion!\nBONUS! Every copy of Overworld sold here will include an exclusive promo for our previous project, Fire of Eidolon! Thank you to all of the backers that helped us get here today!!\n  Throughout the campaign we will add additional goals to meet beyond our base funding goal. Each of those goals we achieve will add another ENHANCEMENT to Overworld. Some of these Enhancements will behave like traditional Stretch Goals which most are familiar with, but some will be different and put more focus on Backer Participation.                       \nThere are several ways to help support the Overworld project, here is more information about each available Pledge level to help you decide how you can support our project!\n                                                                                                                                                                                              Not enough Reviews for you?

The SECOND best thing you can do to help Overworld is to spread the word and share our campaign on all of your favorite Social Media sites! Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help express your fandom! Collect them all!\n      Or, use this to make your own and we'll post it here!\n  Increase our total reach by FOLLOWING Magic Meeple Games on Twitter!\n  Visit us on Facebook and LIKE our page to help us unlock additional ENHANCEMENTS!\n       Adding additional copies of Overworld to your Pledge will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. Add $25 to your Pledge for each extra copy if our built-in Pledge levels do not suit your needs. We will discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Overworld in each order!*\nRewards for this project will be shipped primarily from the USA. Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs. For the Fire of Eidolon project, we ultimately opted for a combination effort using Amazon and SFC (Ship from China) as many highly successful Kickstarter projects have done and the results have been favorable!\nRather than lock ourselves in to a specific method of shipping, we analyze the order distribution at the time of manufacturing to find the most cost-effective and time-effective distribution options available to us. This is our commitment to you in our goal for constant process-improvement and to provide the best possible products that we can!\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address. \nResidents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $20 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries. \nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partners offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. If any VAT taxes or customs fees would apply to your order, we make sure those are pre-paid to make it easier for YOU! \nWhile we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in our ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. If all of our efforts still do not meet your expectations, you are still protected by our Money-Back guarantee! Pledge with Confidence!\nDelivering your reward responsibly\nOur primary goal and responsibility as Magic Meeple Games is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for, at the level of quality they expect, and as quickly as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Overworld well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. \nSo far, Magic Meeple Games has produced and shipped two feature projects. Darkrock Ventures, which has fully fulfilled; and Fire of Eidolon which has been partially fulfilled already and will complete fulfillment before this Kickstarter campaign is complete.\nWe have run into slight speedbumps with each of these projects which hinged on the final completion of graphics. We can be proud of the fact the amount of delay was reduced dramatically with the fulfillment of FoE as compared to DRV, but we can do better. This time, we have a fully graphic-designed rulebook completed IN ADVANCE for everyone to enjoy which means we won't be waiting on it before manufacturing. This project focuses on the physical components of the game and less on artwork, this will also help us accelerate our manufacturing process and get the game made that much faster.\nIn fact, it is our goal to enter manufacturing on this project by October, and ALREADY have prepared art, graphics, and rules all in advance to make this a realistic goal. We are challenging ourselves to make Overworld our best-record for delivery, we have laid out even more groundwork ahead of time and together we can make this possible! Thank you for your support!\nWe do not plan to use use the built-in survey system for the Overworld Campaign, after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate or hidden Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous projects, Fire of Eidolon and Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional products added beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n    Seven hundred playtests. Two laser cutters. Twelve BoardGameGeekGold. Six Pez dispensers. The heat of a thousand suns. Boardgame designer Nemo Rathwald has most of these things. \nNemo's game design goals are:  \nInteresting choices\nLittle downtime\nLots of gameplay from as few rules as possible \nMultiple viable paths to victory \nComponents that physically don't let you break rules, so you don't have to remember them.\nNemo started searching the shelves for boardgames which turned out to only exist in his imagination. So he started making them so he could play them. He got into game design in 2003, at the first Penguicon (a convention of all geeky interests) and has been helping to run the convention ever since, where he playtests new board games of his own design every year.\nIn 2010, Nemo discovered i3Detroit hackerspace, a nonprofit community workshop with an educational mission in art and technology, where he volunteers as a Board Director, an Officer, and an Instructor. There, he upgraded his ability to make lavish show-stopping board game prototypes. Due to his experience in publishing, he fully illustrates and preps his games and rulebooks for pre-press in advance. In 2013 he changed careers from graphic design to web development. In 2014 he signed his first board game publishing contract at Protospiel, a convention for board game designers. \nNemo Rathwald carries a wheeled suitcase of board games in the trunk of his car at all times.\nHere is an unboxing video of our last production, Fire of Eidolon, so you can see the standard of quality we aim for with our projects!\nMagic Meeple Games, LLC. is a tabletop publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. By gamers, for gamers, we are Magic Meeple the Boardgame People! \nFounded, co-owned, and operated by a husband/wife team; We are passionate, lifelong tabletop gamers and we want to show that passion through the games we choose to design, develop, and publish. In our first campaign, Gamelyn Games partnered with us to elevate Magic Meeple Games to their level of quality and customer satisfaction straight out of the gate and we upheld that standard as we moved forward with our first solo campaign, Fire of Eidolon! Now we return for our THIRD Kickstarter project with hopefully many more to come.\nMagic Meeple Games origins began in the industry in 2007 through independent game design, company co-owner Ian Stedman is a published designer himself and has worked on several projects for several other publishing companies as a consultant and designed Magnum Opus for Clever Mojo Games. \nThis is the third core entry into our publishing catalog, and we drawn from the experience of designers, developers, publishers, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers all over the world. We would not ask for your pledges if we were not confident in our ability to fulfill the obligations we have set forth for ourselves.

It is prone to many surprises and problems, even for experienced publishers. \n\nFortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, Retail sales, and Graphics Design.\n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. Our first solo project, Fire of Eidolon was also a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur previous project fell a couple months short of our target Shipping date, and we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again.\n\nFor this project, we are focusing on a game which came to us very much complete. Additional features have been added and small tweaks have been made here and there, but suffice to say, the game is already finished and manufacturing-ready. All that is left is to put in the add-on content that is unlocked in the campaign, update the already designed fully-graphical rulebook (something that has been a challenge in the past) and send off the files. We have never been in a better position to go straight-to-print.\n\nWe are also expanding our horizons as we seek manufacturing and distribution, we are adapting to find better solutions to save time and money, this began by working with Discover Gaming Fulfillment with the distribution of Fire of Eidolon. Thanks to them, most of our backers have already gotten their rewards!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay that we could not control. This is just an example as things such as this cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributors, and our manufacturers and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! We couldn't do it without you! Look what we accomplished together with DRV and FoE!

The Queen's tyranny is spreading into every corner of the kingdom. Her foot soldiers scour the countryside to hunt the behemoth\u2015a bewitched creature that was once her husband. Your small band of rebels will need sharp wits and a bit of luck to save the King and reclaim the land's virtue.\nThe Queen's Army is the highly anticipated solo variant expansion for the game Feudum, allowing you (and others) to play against an A.I. player! The elegantly crafted automa deck was developed in collaboration with J.R. Honeycutt (developer for Tesla vs Edison: Powering Up!) and Brian Neff. The game rewards wise resource management and requires cunning play to keep the queen's army at bay as it tries to thwart your rise to power!\nAdditionally, The Queen's Army is being localized in Germany with help from our friends at Spielschmiede! They will handle the german translation upon reaching their crowdfunding goal. All funding raised on Spieleschmiede will count towards unlocking stretch goals here!\nFeudum: The Queen's Army features a keenly designed A.I. player that cleverly reacts to game conditions and keeps you guessing with her unpredictable maneuvering.  Rounds are played just like the base game with alternating turns, round by round until each epoch is triggered. However, the Queen is less restrained by resource or route requirements making her a powerful force to reckon with! Players may face the Queen alone, or cooperate to defeat her (while still competing for the highest individual score).\nThe game's solo play is streamlined and elegant like the automa mechanics found in games such as Between Two Cities, Alhambra, Viticulture and Scythe. After countless play tests, developer Brian Neff concluded in the Queen's Army Development Journal that the game is an \"incredibly in-depth, challenging and fun experience.\"\nEnglish Available Now\nSolo Variant Preview: Developer J.R. delivers a rousing single round run-through of the Queen's Army.\nBase Game Complete Rules:Here is a wonderfully crafted animation of the entire rules with subtitles (cc) in English, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (LaAm), Dutch and Greek.\nIntricately crafted pawns and a majestic horse\nFeudum: The Queen's Army will feature meticulously-crafted components designed by award-winning artist Justin Schultz.

I was Inspired by Eurostyle games in the late 90s and became a fan of legends like Reiner Knizia, Klaus Teuber, Martin Wallace and Andreas Seyfarth. I unveiled my prototype of Feudum at GenCon 2014 and was thrilled to meet and gain insight from folks like Eric Lang, Mike Eliott, Bruno Faidutti and Jamey Stegmaier. I am grateful for Feudum's wonderful reception back in November of 2016 and thrilled by its ever growing community. Check out facebook.com/feudum  or BoardGameGeek to learn more. \nArtist\nAs he likes to put it, Justin Schultz is an \"earthling living in Jackson, Mississippi.\" Justin studied graphic design at Mississippi State University and worked for a number of advertising agencies before focusing on concert posters, album covers, package design and, just recently, board game art! His distinctive style of populating his art with monsters, reptiles and robots conjures up memories of children's picture books, albeit slightly skewed. Justin explains that he likes to lure viewers in with \"superficially charming images,\" but then reveal something more \"heartbreaking\" or \"daunting\" upon closer inspection.  In 2010, Justin started his independent studio, The Flying Chair.\nJ.R. Honeycutt & Brian Neff\nJ.R. Honeycutt, Developer\nJR Honeycutt is a game designer and developer. He works with Rob and Lindsay Daviau in their game design studio, and is the Tinker-in-Chief at Restoration Games.\nJR's work includes development on Legacy games SeaFall and Charterstone, and on multiple titles during his time with Artana.

They are powered by CoolStuffInc.com, a business that has been shipping games for over 14 years to customers around the world. Quartermaster Logistics will ensure your packages arrive safe and on time as every game is professionally packed and protected.\nHow it Works\nA short time after the campaign is over, you will receive an email from Backerkit that directs you to a pledge manager where you can confirm or upgrade your pledge, and add base games, expansions or other \u201cadd-ons.\u201d (PayPal accepted). \n\nYour Shipping will be automatically calculated at that time based on the total weight of your order. (Backerkit has automated this, so it is a lot easier now!)  Note: Rewards from the previous Kickstarter campaign may NOT be delayed to ship with this campaign. Each campaign is on an independent fulfillment schedule.\nBackerkit turns overpledges into a credit that may be used as you see fit in the pledge manager.   \nShipping Estimates \nThe rates below are good faith 2018 ESTIMATES of carrier rates (FedEx, UPS) plus freight.

When possible, QM Logistics will use the fulfillment centers that are closest to backers in order to save them money. (For example, fulfilling from China, for East Asia, or fulfilling others from the EU shipping.)

These Speaking Stones began humming and pulsing when the lost city of Lux reappeared after disappearing thousands of years ago. Those who respond to the stones and hone their power become known as Stonebound. These stones are equipped to their weapons and armor to enable feats of incredible power and skill unlike anything the world has seen.\n\nPlayers pre-construct or draft teams of stonebound who are training against each other in preparation for an impending battle against a force known as Tenebris.\n  Players track their character's stats and abilities using dashboards with sliders to track dynamic stats, and pegs to track activated abilities. Each stonebound comes with two ability cards that are placed into each dashboard.\nThe Stonebound Saga comes with 12 character dashboards.\nThere are 35 unique characters for players to choose their teams from spanning 7 different character classes.

TERRAIN CARD EXPANSION - 140 CARDS!\n      A completely new card type!\nOur final stretch goal is a major expansion for The Stonebound Saga!\n\nIntroducing 'Terrain Cards'! \nThe terrain card expansion will include 140 cards in a tuck-box included with the game. Each copy of the game will include this expansion.\nThere are 35 unique terrain card designs which is 5 cards per speaking stone element. There are 3 copies of each terrain card plus 1 description card to describe how the card is played.\n\nTerrain cards modify the spaces on the battlefield during gameplay. These cards can affect single spaces or groups of spaces. Terrain cards open up a completely new way to play the game, and add another level of strategy to the gameplay itself.\n\nIn addition to the character cards players will pick for their teams; players will now choose or draft a total of 10 stars of rarity from the 'Terrain Card' deck. Each player may not have more than 3 of the same terrain card in their deck.\nPlayers will be able to activate terrain cards in battle by using 'Speaking Stone' cards just like they do to use their character's abilities. It is wise to pick terrain cards based off elements that are not in use by their characters to ensure they will not have any unused resources each turn. Once a terrain card is activated the speaking stone cards are discarded.\n\nWhen a terrain card is played it can be placed on ANY OPEN space on the battlefield. (not occupied by a character or another terrain card) Once a terrain card is placed on the battlefield it can be used by ANY player. This means both positive and negative effects are in play for both players. Terrain cards bring about attributes from various places and effect the battle in many ways. Each card is an actual location from the world of Telios.\nThere are many types of terrain cards that can both help your allies, and hinder your enemy! Let's take a look at a few terrain cards, and how they work on the battlefield.\n      Ice Blocks can be used to block enemy forces, and force them to move around to attack, or use a turn to remove them. They are excellent for buying time for your forces, and even preventing enemy formations!\n      Valley of the Wind can be used in multiple ways. Not only can it increase the range of your ranged characters, but it can be used for surprise rush attacks and combinations.\n      Sapping Stones can be very effective at preventing your opponent from using healing abilities, or healing from attacks. With good placement there will be no area available to heal, but be careful this affects your team as well!\n      The massive trees of Illandris make attacking from a distance difficult, and placing this card on the battlefield can greatly hinder your opponent's ranged forces!\n      Any player who moves their character to this location gets to immediately draw 2 extra speaking stone cards (resources). This can greatly help a player with their draw mechanics, and setting up for using their character abilities.\n      Fortifications can be a great location to place your vulnerable characters in the middle of battle. This location mitigates HP damage allowing a character to survive longer, but be careful - your opponent can steal this location from you and use it to their advantage!\nThat was just 6 of the 35 unique terrain card designs! We hope you love this new card type that adds an incredible amount of strategy and a new way to play! We will be revealing more of the terrain card designs once this stretch goal is unlocked! Once we reach this stretch goal the 'Terrain Card' expansion will be added to every copy of the game!\n  Centuries ago there was a lush and beautiful land named Telios. In the center of this kingdom stood the gleaming city of Lux ruled by a wise and loving king. The citizens of Telios wanted for nothing and their hearts were full of joy. The king walked among the people taking delight in their lives and the people loved him dearly. One day a dark force known as Tenebris arose from the deep places of the earth and touched a single man. Tenebris flattered the man with lies and whispered to him of greatness. The man spent his days plotting and he lay awake each night dreaming of riches and power. With a honeyed tongue this one man swayed the thoughts of those around him and the darkness spread. Soon, bitterness and jealousy welled up in the hearts of the people and they became discontent.\nTenebris grew and festered until the people of Telios succumbed to darkness. Out of this darkness the people rose up in defiance to their king. They gathered from all corners of Telios uniting under a banner of darkness. They made for themselves weapons of war and steeled themselves with hatred. The very first army the world had ever known assembled in the fields of Lux and prepared to strike down their king. The king looked out over his people and wept, for even still he loved them. With a heavy heart he uttered unknown words of power and there was a great cataclysm. The city of Lux rose from the ground and ascended into the sky. Mighty earthquakes shook the land and tore it to pieces. Great fires erupted from the center of the earth pushing up mountains where fertile plains used to be. Massive storms raged across the earth\u2019s surface stripping the land bare and scattering the once grand army. People all over Telios cried out in despair until finally everything was still.\nThe world was changed. Great chasms had formed separating the land into seven continents. All that remained in the heart of Telios where the city of Lux once stood was a great void. The king was gone. His absence could be felt by everyone as a sudden and unexplainable loss. Without a king to unite them and reeling in despair, seven kingdoms arose from the newly formed continents and turned their hatred upon each other.\nThe seven countries of Telios\nThousands of years passed and the world knew only war. Grievance was heaped upon grievance until the shared history of the seven kingdoms was all but forgotten. It was an age of darkness and brutality. The land was sapped of its bounty and the people were sapped of their strength. They no longer remembered why they fought nor did they care. They were ruled by hatred, they were ruled by bitterness and they were ruled by death. It hung like a pall in the air mocking the pitiful creatures clawing upon the surface of Telios.\nWhen humanity was on the brink of ruin and all seemed lost, hope broke through.\nIt started with a whisper...\nIt started with a whisper, a nearly imperceptible voice carried on the wind echoing through canyons, sweeping over fields, and flowing into the cities. The first people to hear the voice could make no sense of it. It seemed a trick of the ear, teasing those who could hear it as the memory of a dream teases one upon waking. The words spoke of a long lost king and a magnificent race of people. It spoke of light shattering the darkness and it spoke of the king returning! These words settled on the land and were absorbed like a fresh spring rain until the very stones of the earth hummed and pulsed with their power. These stones soon became known as speaking stones as they were able to speak into the very souls of the people, granting them power to push back the Tenebris. The king also gave a warning through the stones; Tenebris, the great darkness which had consumed the earth, was gathering its forces for one final battle.\n\u201cIf no one speaks of His name; even the rocks will cry out.\u201d\n  When our team at Sky Kingdom Games began working on The Stonebound Saga over 15 years ago we knew that this project wasn't going to be just a board game. We knew that in order to create something unique we would need to create a world with rich stories, compelling characters, and lore.\nClassic games from Squaresoft (now Square Enix) like Final Fantasy Tactics, Chrono Trigger, and Secret of Mana had significant influence on this project. Part of what made those games so great was not only the story and characters, but the beautiful music that gave the games atmosphere and depth. You would expect a digital title to have a soundtrack, but you usually don't see board or card games with an OST! We are proud to provide a soundtrack to accompany gameplay for those that want to add music to match the play experience.\nTo capture the sound of The Stonebound Saga we reached out to music composer Bill Piyatut H. Bill is an accomplished composer and arranger of multiple titles and projects around the world. We are excited to be able to offer this soundtrack as a reward for every backer! At the end of the campaign we will be emailing each backer a link to download the soundtrack. Until then you can preview some of the tracks below.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 1st Kickstarter (re-launched from October and February), and also a very ambitious project! Knowing this we started preparing for this campaign over a year ago. We reached out to other successful publishers, asked questions, talked to the gaming community, and found the best way to produce and deliver a wonderfully crafted game using the Kickstarter platform.\n\nWith that said - here's some key points to consider.\n1. We spent time setting up friendly shipping options for our backers so any extra fees and VAT will be covered by us. The Stonebound Saga will ship from various shipment centers in the U.S., Canada, the EU, and Australia. This way shipping is simple and not over complicated! \n\n2. We put a realistic timetable on production and delivery for this game - which is by February 2018. We anticipate the game shipping before then, but we would rather under promise and over deliver! Keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\n3. We have an amazing art studio handling our art designs - Caravan Studio. Caravan has produced work for various companies like Blizzard, Lucasfilm, Wizards of the Coast, and others. We expect a great turn around in the remaining art needed to complete the game which will not hold up the production of the game.\n\n4. You can be assured that every possible precaution and care will be put into providing an incredible game in a timely matter and exactly as we promised. Our team has worked for years pouring our time and our own personal funds into crafting a game that we are proud to share with the world.

For a limited time, you can still pre-order the game. Just click on the \"Pre-Order\" button above!\nBuilding a city is no easy task. You would think so many races working to toward a common goal might make things easier, but everyone is just out for themselves, and too many dissonant voices cause only chaos.\nStill, building the legendary city of Gloomhaven is the task before you. Can your race use the resources of your opponents effectively enough to hold the most prestige when the city is complete? Can you leverage your influence and construct the building projects that will benefit your race the most?\nFounders of Gloomhaven is a competitive 2 hour city building game for 1-4 players. It is not an expansion to Gloomhaven, but a stand-alone Euro project that features a unique mix of tile placement, action selection, hand management, worker placement, and blind bidding.\nAll 18 stretch goals are included in all copies of the game!\n  In Founders of Gloomhaven, you will have control of a number of resources that you can place on the board as tiles.\nYou must combine your own resource tiles with those of your opponents to create more advanced resource tiles, and then deliver these resources to prestige buildings to earn points.\nThis is all accomplished through your decks of action cards. On your turn, you can play a card to take a variety of actions:\nTrade: Placing resource tiles or buying access to others' resources.\nRecruit: Hiring adviser cards to add to your deck, giving you more influence and extra powerful actions.\nUpgrade: Building advanced resources to increase your income and scoring opportunities.\nConstruct: Erecting personal buildings like houses and bridges, which will give you more control over the board state.\nYou can also call a vote, which will retrieve all the cards you have played, but doing so will allow all other players to collect income, and then it will trigger a blind vote on which new prestige building gets placed on the board and where it gets placed.\nPrestige buildings offer the major scoring opportunities in the game, so you would do well to control the vote whenever possible by spending influence, making sure the building which scores the resources you control is built.\nInterested in trying it out? No problem! One of my main Kickstarter goals is to give everyone the chance to really get in there and play the game before they back the project.\nThere are two main ways you can sit down and give the game a test drive.\nFirst of all, if you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, you can follow this link to the Founders of Gloomhaven module. There's no automation to the file, so you will still need the rule book handy.\nAlternately, you can download the print-and-play files to construct your own physical copy of the game. Currently we just have a high-ink version, but there will be a more printer-friendly version very shortly.\nHigh-Ink: [Double-sided 11x17 cardstock (2 pages)], [Single-sided 11x17 cardstock (8 pages)], [Map board]. (There are two copies of each tile so you can tape/glue them together to give the cardstock more weight and avoid any bleed issues.)\nLow-ink: [Full file - includes map] (Print it all single-sided, then tape/glue together the front and back of each tile.)\nKeep in mind that in all these versions, the art and design is not final and is subject to change.\nOr if you just want to watch someone else play the game, we have you well-covered there, too.\nIntroductory game play through from Rahdo:\nTwo-player full game run through from Tom Heath:\nThree-player full game run through from JonGetsGames:\nFour-player full game run through from Heavy Cardboard:\nSolo full game run through from Rolling Solo:\n      New to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.  \nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the city!\n$10 for shipping is included in the base price, which means there is no extra shipping charge for the US, Canada or China. All additional shipping fees for other countries are added automatically when you pledge.\nIn addition, the game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia, Singapore, and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAlso note you can pledge for additional copies of the game by manually increasing your pledge amount, and you only have to pay the extra shipping fee for every three copies of the game. And don't worry if you can't do the math - the pledge manager will sort you out after the project ends.\nI am no stranger to slaying rats, destroying skeletons, and defacing board game components to honor and commemorate my wonderful Kickstarter supporters. This time around, however, instead of destroying things, I want to build.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar to the campaign, I will toil away in a variety of city-building video games and erect a grand structure in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come. You can watch the videos linked above to get a feel for what this will look like.\nThe main reward level will get you a copy of Founders of Gloomhaven, plain and simple, with no further effort required. All stretch goals are included.\nThere will be no add-ons, no Kickstarter exclusives, just the game delivered to your doorstep before it comes out in retail, at a significant discount off the expected retail price ($60-$70, depending on stretch goals).\nNot only that, but pledging to the Kickstarter gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. You will get weekly updates on the progress and development of the game.\nI love bringing games to Kickstarter because it gives me a chance to collaborate with this community, taking suggestions from the game's fans and using them to make the game better.\nFounders of Gloomhaven has been in development for over a year, and I am really excited to get it out into the world. As with all my designs, I believe it offers something unique and innovative to this great hobby, adding an incredibly high level of player interaction to the city-building genre and melding many disparate mechanics into a cohesive and engaging design.\nOnce you have played it, I hope you will feel the same way.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games. His first game, Forge War, was published three years ago, and his second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim back in February.

I will always let you know.\n\nAdmittedly, my delivery estimates have been off in the past, but with those mistakes in mind, I firmly believe that January is a very realistic goal to deliver this game to you.\n\nThere is a lot of art left to do, as well as some graphic design and making sure any mechanical changes or additions brought on by the Kickstarter process are implemented well, but all of us are dedicated to delivering this game to you in a timely manner.\n\nI also stand by the quality of the game and my customer service.

Communities Program and their fantastic Director, Julie Judkins for their ongoing partnership and friendship. As any long-distance hiker knows, the importance of trail communities cannot be understated. These communities anchor the Trail and provide critical services to hikers of all kinds -- especially those embarking on an extended journey. There are currently 41 designated A.T. Communities in the ATC\u2019s Program, and we want to extend a huge THANK YOU to them for sending us questions related to their community as contributions to the A.T. Communities Deck.

Kristin Peppel brings a background in conservation planning, trail community development, and environmental education.  Kristin worked closely with the ATC to design the current A.T. Community Program and has spent countless hours hiking on the A.T.\nThe Appalachian Trail Game was born on one of Mark's regular hikes between Max Patch and Hot Springs, NC after passing by Walnut Mountain shelter. It had been completely trashed, and after cleaning up the site and packing up the trash, he began envisioning a fun and engaging way to teach people about responsible trail ethics. Mark transformed his idea into a board game, and two years later, thanks to a small grant awarded through the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's (ATC) License Plate grant program, we were able to develop the prototype game. \nA small team of talented educators, artists, conservationists and backpackers formed to turn that prototype into a fully realized product, The Appalachian Trail Game. In August of 2014, we launched the game on Kicktstarter and were overjoyed with the response. We achieved our goal in the first 48 hours, and by the end of the campaign, we were over-funded by almost 600%. Since that time, we have sold over 15,000 copies and donated over 300 games to non-profit organizations, schools, and volunteer hiking clubs. The game has received rave reviews by teachers, hikers, A.T. volunteers, and players of all ages.\nIn 2015, we established new partnerships with Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and the American Hiking Society to help create the new content for the Special Edition version of the game. We launched this game via a second successful Kickstarter campaign in August of that same year. We are proud to be part of the #ProtectYourTrail campaign that integrates various strategies to educate new hikers about Leave No Trace principles and ways to get involved with volunteer trail clubs.\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt Outdoor Edutainment, LLC we are committed to producing high quality products and refuse to take any shortcuts that impede this commitment. Having run 2 successful Kickstarter campaigns, (The Appalachian Trail Game - Backpacking Edition and the Special Edition), we know much better how avoid trouble and navigate the complexities of production, shipping and working within the Kickstarter platform. We are confident that these changes will ensure that all customers get their rewards promptly and on or before the projected date of October 15, 2017\n\nOf course, we recognize that unforeseen manufacturing problems can arise. If a manufacturing problem should occur, we are confident in our abilities to work through these issues to get rewards out to all of our backers by the specified date. In the highly unlikely event that we are not able to deliver the game for some unforeseeable, unfathomable reason, we will refund all pledges.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Virtual High-Five", "descp": "Get updates on the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Hiker Support Team", "descp": "Sticker + Bandana", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "ME-GA EXPANSION Set - EARLY BIRD", "descp": "ME-GA Expansion Set + Sticker + Bandana\n*Includes both the Thru-Hiker and A.T.

Some real action: racing.\nYou know you can beat half of those twerps already. And if you can raise some quick cash and buy a better rod, you can beat the rest. You know with the right car you can beat the king. Then you\u2019ll have some cash and Becky Sue!\nThis is how the famous retro video game begins. Now we offer you the same experience, off-line and together with friends: Street Rod \u2013 the Card Game.     \nGameplay in action\n                 Basic set Tuck Box\n  Deluxe set Telescope Box with sturdy inlay\n  Street Rod - the card game is for 1-5 players and takes 20-30 minutes. The game is played over several rounds. In each round you buy car parts in the garage to customize your rod and, if you like, race an opponent or one of the other players. If you\u2019re good, you win some bucks. If you\u2019re better, you can win the other guy\u2019s rod. If you\u2019re the best, you can beat the king!  \nStep 1: At the beginning of the game, you split the deck and search yours for cars and parts worth $500. You find a nice chevrolet ($300), some tires ($100) and for the remaining $100 you pick a carburator.\nStep 2: You draw 5 cards from the deck. This is the shop. Your budget is $200 and you choose... the engine. It's a General Motors, so it fits your chevrolet! You add it to your hand.   \nStep 3: You have to choose whether you want to race, and with who. Patty? Nah, too easy. You want to race Tom in a drag race. His score on that track is 18.  \nStep 4: What's your score on the Drag Race Track? On the Drag Race, your total Power is doubled. So your end score will be: Power *2 + Acceleration + Skill = (2+2+0+1)*2 + (2+0+1+1) + 0 = 14. This means your score against Tom is 14-18 = -4.  \nStep 5: Pick the upper cards from the deck and check the BadLuck Indicator. If it's equal to or lower than your score against Tom, then you've won. The BadLuck Indicator is -7. Lucky you! You've won! Add Tom to your hand. Next time you race you will have an extra 6 skill points. You're almost ready to race the King...  \nThe concept rules are available for download on our BGG-page.\n     \nThe Basic set (MRSP: \u20ac13) contains the rules sheet, 54 cards (12 cars, 16 opponents and 26 parts), wrapped in a simple Tuck Box.\n   In the Deluxe version (MRSP \u20ac19), the tuck box is replaced for a twice as big 140x100x25mm Telescope Box.

You can see that in some of the other games we've published, like La Cosa Nostra, Carson City and Vanuatu.\nWith Halloween, there is a different kind of interaction, this game focuses on the movement of ghosts on the map. These ghost belong to everyone, so the confrontation is on another level. It's possible to advance quickly in this game and take out the weaker ghosts, so other players are finding it hard to accomplish the same level. \nThe most beautiful thing about this project is that Angelo made a game that is very variable and quite unique.

A vast network of mossy underground tunnels and connected forest areas await your adventurers! \nForest of Shadows is a stand alone expansion that you can play on its own or in combination with the original. \nOne Deck Dungeon: Forest of Shadows is a 1-2 player roguelike adventure card game (just like the original One Deck Dungeon!) It's a standalone expansion, so it can be played as its own full game, or mixed with the original. If you're new to One Deck Dungeon, see the Basics section below for an introduction to gameplay.\nThe game includes 44 Encounter cards, 5 Dungeon/Boss cards, 4 Level cards, a Stairs card, 5 postcard-sized Hero Cards, a Turn Reference, a set of campaign sheets, 15 hearts for damage tokens, 6 potion cubes, 8 poison cubes, and 30 shiny translucent dice. The 3D shot above doesn't show them as translucent, but that's merely a failing of my amazing 3D skills. Basically, the expansion has the same types of components as the base game. Since it's a stand-alone expansion, that makes sense!\nForest of Shadows comes with both a full v1.5 rulebook and a small rules supplement for its new mechanics. \nThe core gameplay elements are the same as the original One Deck Dungeon; you'll still be busting through doors ready to beat up baddies and avoid dangerous perils. There are some new twists, and of course all-new cards!\nYou can download a full Print and Play version of the base game and Forest of Shadows, along with the rules PDFs for each.  \nPrint and Play: [ Base | Forest ] Rules: [ Base | Forest ] \nv1.5 Upgrade Pack\nSince the original game's printing, we updated some of the terminology and made a few balance tweaks. A full list of these can be found in our [v1.5 Patch Notes] \nSeveral tiers offer a v1.5 upgrade pack, which is a full deck of 56 cards and 6 hero cards + turn reference with all the updates. You can add-on upgrade packs to any tier by adding to your pledge according to the chart at the bottom of the KS page. A full copy of the v1.5 rulebook is included with each copy of Forest of Shadows.\nPlastic Cards vs Normal Cards\nPlastic cards are waterproof, durable, and still very smooth to shuffle. Most people say that they feel like normal cards! You should never need to sleeve plastic cards, but avoid getting acidic foods or drinks on them. That can damage the coating. Both types of cards fit safely in the box (normal cards fit with sleeves, unless they are very thick sleeves)\nAdd-ons / Shipping Costs\nAt the end of the page there is a list of add-ons available and shipping costs. Simply increase your pledge by each add-on you want, and you're good to go! No additional shipping costs required. If you're in the EU (including the UK) we cover VAT and customs fees for you.\nWe'll have a post-campaign pledge management website to let you specify what your add-ons are, and increase your pledge if you decide you want additional items!\nOne Deck Dungeon is fully co-operative. Each turn in the game is shared by the entire party. Every turn, time will pass, and then the party will decide to either Explore or Enter a Room. Exploring will add more face-down cards to the dungeon as closed doors. Entering a room flips over one of these doors to reveal an encounter: either a combat you must face, or a peril to overcome.\nCombat encounters pit you against the monsters and denizens of the dungeon. Each card has a variety of challenge boxes, representing the amount of damage and spent time you might incur while fighting.\nIn a combat, you'll roll one die for each of the attribute icons on your hero card (plus any items you've picked up). You can place a die in any box matching its color, as long as the die's value is at least as high as the number in the box. \nAny boxes you don't fill with dice represent the consequences of vanquishing your foe: the amount of damage the party incurred and how long it took to win. Damage tokens are placed on your hero card, but be careful -- if the number of tokens is equal to your health, the game is over. As long as you survive, though, you always win the battle and claim loot. You're heroes, after all!\nPeril encounters pit you against all sorts of obstacles you may encounter on your adventure. Each peril has two options to choose from for how to best overcome it. \nAgainst a peril, you'll roll only your dice of the color that matches the choice you picked, trying to fill the box on the peril card for the option the party chose. Wide boxes like those on peril cards can be filled by any number of dice added together. Don't worry! You don't have to roll an 11 on one six-sided die.\nEven if the party takes damage and spends time, you still claw your way to the loot behind the peril... as long as the fall from that rope bridge wasn't too bad.\nEvery encounter you survive brings you loot! Each card in the dungeon deck can be used as loot in one of three ways. You always get the card as loot, even if you took damage or spent time during the Suffer Consequences step for not filling some of the challenge boxes in the encounter. \nItems and Skills are tucked underneath your Hero card. Items will increase your dice pool and possibly your maximum health. Skills are used during encounters to modify your dice or roll additional ones to help you overcome the situation at hand.\nExperience is tucked underneath the Level card. Your current level determines the maximum number of Items and Skills your hero can possess. Each time you level up, you'll also get a free potion. At the start of the game, you only have access to Healing potions, but you may find other types as you delve deeper...\nEach of the five dungeons has its own unique set of effects and challenge boxes. As you delve deeper into the dungeon, more and more of these boxes will be revealed. They add difficulty to every encounter in the game, and mean that an adventure in the Vile Roots feels very different from the Realm of Venom.  \nOnce you go through each section of the dungeon, the boss awaits at the end, on the back of the dungeon card. The boss battle is a multi-round combat encounter. If the party can vanquish this final foe, you'll have emerged victorious!\n  Poison is a new type of consequence that appears in challenge boxes. 8 green poison cubes are included with the game, and they get placed on heroes just like normal damage. Poison is dangerous for two reasons:\n1) If you ever need to add a poison token and none are available, the heroes lose.\n2) Every time the party explores, and before each round of boss combat, roll one die to resist poison. If the roll is higher than the number of poison tokens in the entire party, remove one poison token. Otherwise, remove one poison token and replace it with two damage tokens.\nLuckily, there are herbs in the forest! Half of the cards in the expansion have a leaf icon on them. For each open door with a leaf showing when the party explores, add 1 to the resist poison die roll.\nRemoval: Several boss and dungeon effects remove dice or poison tokens from play. These are not returned to the supply, they're placed in the box for the remainder of the game! \nSince running out of poison tokens ends the game, this is quite dangerous. Having less dice available is no picnic either, as you'll start running out when you try to use skills during encounters.\nPet Panther / Peril Options: Do you want a pet Panther? I bet you do! Several of the perils in Forest of Shadows have the loot they provide determined by which option the party chooses. In the case of the panther, you can try and sneak by it to claim an item, or charm it to keep it by your side for the rest of the adventure. Nobody's fighting that panther. It's big!\nCombining Sets: Forest of Shadows is a standalone expansion, which means you do not need the original game to play. You can mix and match heroes and dungeons from the two sets. The Hunter could visit the Dragon's Cave, and the Rogue could journey into the Realm of Venom. You can also create a dungeon deck of the two sets mixed together, taking 22 cards from the original One Deck Dungeon and 22 from Forest of Shadows. See the rulebook for more details! \n              We're doing something fun for this campaign: instead of small stretch goals for things we really wanted to put in the game no matter what, we're focusing on big exciting stretch goals! \nIt's still fun to reveal and unlock things as the campaign goes along though, so we revealed a number of bonus items over the course of teh campaign!\n5th Hero: The Alchemist was added. She gets a second use out of every potion!\n5th Dungeon: The Lair of Indrax was added, the hardest of the 5 Forest of Shadows dungeons!\nCampaign Sheets: New Campaign Sheets, with 3 new focus groups were added.\n6th Dungeon + Hero: Caliana and the Phoenix's Den will be in every copy of Forest of Shadows. Previously, they were available only as a PDF download.\nHordes of the Shadows: A special card to increase difficulty for 4 player games was added. Since the Phoenix's Den increased the deck size to 60 for the expansion, we added this card, along with Basic Potions and Poison Reference cards.\nThe big stretch goals below are all for items that don't go in the game box, because they are either digital in nature or simply too large and awesome. The goals are high, but that's what stretch goals should be - things we wouldn't be able to do without your support:\nOur first stretch goal is for a story mode to accompany the campaign sheets included with the game, and also a full soundtrack with a song for each of the five dungeons. The story will feature a choose-your-own-adventure style plot between games, linking together the 10 available dungeons into one larger campaign. It will be available as a PDF or on our website, OneDeckDungeon.com.  \nWe've already made one track, it's the one used in the video. Here's the full version:\nThe playmat has been unlocked early, and is available as a $20 add-on to your pledge. See the add-ons section below for details!\nShipping rates for this campaign are very simple. You pay one rate based on your region, regardless of the number of games you want to add on.\nUPDATE: We have reached a deal to prepay your customs and VAT if you're in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. In addition, we've been able to reduce shipping from $20 to $15 for UK backers. There's a special pledge level for UK backers, the $20 UK Shipping Zone level.\nKickstarter backer orders will be sent out first, before any copies bound for conventions, retail, or distribution. You're our backers! You deserve to be the first to delve into the Forest of Shadows. Sorry about all the poison and monsters~\nIn keeping with our simple shipping scheme, additional copies are very easy to add to your pledge. Simply add the amount below (after shipping), and note in the Kickstarter survey which thing you've backed for when the campaign concludes.  Add-ons of games and upgrade packs have no additional shipping cost. You can also add additional money through the pledge manager after the campaign.\n[$20: Glooping ooze plushie! It's here to steal your heart (tokens)]\nv1.5 Cards-only upgrade packs contain the 56 cards, 5 hero cards, and the Turn Reference necessary to play the game, and assume you have the rest of the components (dice, wooden bits, etc) from the original game. \nYou can read our \"patch notes\" describing what changed in v1.5. \nPlastic cards are more durable, waterproof, but still easy to shuffle and play with. After the first campaign, many people remarked that they couldn't possibly be plastic after feeling how nice the surface and shuffling was! \nJust, you know, don't put ketchup on them.

All shipping fees are standard, and based on the actual fee we will need to pay GamesQuest. The shipping fees will be added to your pledge level, and will be charged through Kickstarter. This will make sure you only need to provide your credit card information once. To reduce shipping costs for backers in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, we will take care of the shipping in these countries ourselves. For an overview of the prices see below. You can reduce shipping costs by making a group pledge! For more information give us a message.\nJust like with our previous Kickstarter it is possible to pick up your game at one of the many conventions we're attending, including Essen SPIEL 2017, Ducosim, Spel (Antwerp), Spellenspektakel, and at the BBA HQ and release party.\n    Black Box Adventures is an Indy tabletop games developer and publisher from the Netherlands. We strive to bring you games with our three core values in mind:\nQUALITY: what you get is a high quality product worth your time, as we want to bring you more than some cards and dice in a box. Yes, we are a business, and our business is to make you happy.\nORIGINAL: Zombies vs Cthulhu? Booooring!! We strive to think outside of the box and make tabletop games with unique twists and themes. Battling seafood on a plate of spaghetti...now we're talking.\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE: we only publish games that have our full support, but we\u2019re all just ordinary people. We like to work in the community so please let us know what you think!\nFrutti di Mare is the brainchild of Maarten de Schrijver. Maarten made the original game design \u00e1nd artwork. He was working on Frutti di Mare for 2 years before he contacted us. Maarten is a 2D and 3D designer, which you'll quickly recognize from the beautifully designed artwork. The original game and theme struck us immediately, and after more play testing and adjustments Frutti di Mare was ready to be brought on Kickstarter for your judgement. \nSaluti!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our first successfully funded and fulfilled project last year, Black Box Adventures is ready for more. Although every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. Because this won't be our first project, we have some record to give backers confidence.\n\nThe game, artwork and design are ready to be printed. We received quotes from multiple manufacturers, both domestic as well as foreign. To get the high quality we want, we've chosen one of the best production facilities available. In addition, this manufacturer is located in the vicinity, which makes it easy for us to check the production process if necessary. The manufacturer will print and assemble the games, however some parts are normally produced in China (dice). For these parts we've chosen to search for another producer in the EU instead, to prevent possible delays/problems that are associated with overseas freight shipping.\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. Because the game is produced in the EU, EU-backers won't need to worry about extra customs charges. In our previous project we handled the shipping ourselves in order to lower the shipping costs to our backers and to learn the ins and out of the shipping process, despite the enormous amount of work. Due to one failing shipping company some backers received their game a little bit later, however in the end we've managed to handle all problems. With Frutti di Mare we will use a highly renowned fulfillment partner to tackle both of these problems: GamesQuest. GamesQuest is a company located in the UK and has handled the fulfillment of numerous Kickstarter projects, including Scythe. Jamey Stegmaier highly recommends them.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer the game will be ready before Essen SPIEL 2017, however some events may be out of our or their reach. If for some unforeseen circumstances we won't be able to deliver the product at Essen SPIEL 2017, we will have to arrange a pickup at another convention or charge shipping costs if you've chosen for the pledge with pickup.\n\nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our assortment, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece drooling in flavor on its own. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous game, we will listen to the backers, so together we can make the best out of Frutti di Mare.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "GRAZIE!", "descp": "Antipasti for the small hunger:\nINCLUDES:\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nA sincere thank you!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["57 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "RETAILERS", "descp": "Please send us a message on Kickstarter or an email to: kickstarter@blackboxadventures.com to receive a price list.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "1x FRUTTI DI MARE (\u20ac35 MSRP)", "descp": "1 daily dish please:\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\nYour Name in the Cookbook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "1x FRUTTI DI MARE PICK-UP (\u20ac35 MSRP)", "descp": "1 daily dish to go please.\nPick up your game at Spiel Essen 2017, Spellenspektakel, Ducosim, Spel (Antwerpen), BBA HQ, release party.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\nYour Name in the Cookbook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac65 or more", "title": "1x FRUTTI DI MARE CON AMORE", "descp": "Romantic dinner for two!\nShipping included\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\nYour Name in the Cookbook\nReal looking pearls upgrade (plastic)\n2\u00d7 Set of 3 Geekboxes\nRed-white checkered Tablecloth\nA Romantic Candle\nShipping Included!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "COMBO DEAL FdM + RotD + Bob (\u20ac98 MSRP)", "descp": "One dish of the house please.\nNOTE: Revenge of the Dictators excluding the kickstarter only \"Fake Passports\"\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\n1 copy of Revenge of the Dictators\n1 copy of The American Agent a.k.a.

The game is as good as it can possibly be right now!\nPlease take a look at the Whats in the Box? and Stretch Goals sections below for more details on all the amazing content in store for Kickstarter backers.\nThank you all for an unbelievably fun, positive and successful campaign!\nMaximum Apocalypse is a cooperative roguelike adventure game for 1-6 players. Civilization has already fallen. The players must survive the hostile landscape.   \nThe game map is randomly generated and different every time that you play. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to explore the map, play cards, equip weapons, scavenge for resources, draw cards or battle off monsters.  \nPicking a unique survivor class within the group, players must plan their strategy and work together while leaning on their survivor\u2019s strengths in order to defeat monsters and avoid starvation. For example, the Fireman is deadly up close with his ax and can easily chop down monsters; meanwhile the stealthy Hunter is great at scouting the map and avoiding traps \u2014 but roaming monsters are gathering quickly and time is running out. If players are overwhelmed by monsters or die of starvation, they lose. If they can find enough fuel and get it back to their van to escape, they all win and live to play another scenario.\nAs a survivor of the apocalypse, players will equip weapons, battle monsters, draw cards and scavenge the post-apocalyptic wasteland looking for useful supplies. \nCooperation is key in this deep game of survival.  \nIt's Different Every Time you Play\nMaximum Apocalypse comes with (at least) 3 totally different post-apocalyptic scenarios. When you mix these scenarios with different monsters, map tiles, scavenge items, missions and characters classes, you get a near infinite amount of combinations and maps with tons of replayability.\nZombie - Don't get overwhelmed by the Undead...luckily they're not too bright.\nNuclear - Be prepared to give away your gear to nasty raiders before facing poisonous mutant rats.\nAlien - Race against the clock as the aliens force you to discard your deck as they work to ensure the enslavement of humanity.\nRobot - Fight the never ending replication and efficiency of your robotic overlords.\nChoose your Survivor\nThe Fireman is sturdy, strong and acts as the tank of the group. With his axe in hand, he is a massive short range damage dealer.\nThe Hunter is stealthy and precise. She can scout the landscape for danger and is deadly with her bow and traps.\nThe Gunslinger can deal midrange damage with his trusty revolvers as long as he has ammunition. \nThe Surgeon supports the group by restoring health and boosting team performance with shots of adrenaline.\nThe Veteran and his Dog are a team unto themselves.  The Vet has plenty of old military gear and his dog has excellent instincts. He's trained to scout and attack if necessary.\nThe Mechanic is a support class that can upgrade weapons, build defensive turrets or even call in a drone strike to clear a path forward.\nThe Scientist (KS BONUS!) is a quick learner that can adapt to the situation and research new skills and weapons.\nThe Army Ranger (KS BONUS!) is a sniper that can remove monster tokens and help control the onslaught of monsters.\nExplore and Survive!\nEvery turn, Players take 4 actions to explore the randomized map, fight off monsters, play cards and scavenge for resources.\nWhen you move to a new tile, you reveal it and get free actions or potentially fall into a trap...\nThere are two types of cards you can play on your turn: Instants and Gear.\nInstants are one shot cards that you play for their effect and then are discarded. Gear is equipped and takes up inventory slots but stays in play giving you access to new abilities. You will need to equip weapons and other gear to help you survive and fight dangerous roaming monsters.\nAs you explore the map, you\u2019ll come across new locations. Some of them are good and some can be very bad.\nOnce your turn is over, your hunger increases and monsters attack so you'll want to work together as a team to optimize your actions.\nComplete your Objective and Escape\nAs part of setup, players will select a mission or scenario. Most missions require finding a particular location and collecting enough fuel to escape.\nFace Roaming Monsters\nFor example, an early mission is to rescue a Scientist who may be able to cure the Zombie outbreak.

We know that shipping (especially internationally) can be annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! We are continuing to work toward minimizing the cost of shipping as much as possible. We don't want to stick anyone with a large shipping bill long after the campaign is over, so we will be subsidizing shipping equally in all regions so that we can charge affordable flat rate shipping:\nUnited States + UK: $5 \nCanada + Australia: $10\nEuropean Union: $10 - $15 (Depending on Country & Reward)\nSwitzerland, Norway: $15\nEverywhere Else: $20  \nWe plan on using customs-friendly shipping and fulfillment companies in each region to keep shipping costs as low as possible so that you can back more games! As a result, you should not get hit with customs, brokerage, or import fees. \nShipping is annoyingly expensive. However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, there are workarounds. The shipping rates will remain fixed regardless of the number of games or add-ons that you purchase. If you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like.\nRetailers  \nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact Mike directly at mike@rockmanorgames.com during the campaign for pricing information or back at the Retailer Pledge Level and we will be in touch.\nRock Manor Games successfully funded Brass Empire at the end of 2015 through Kickstarter. It was released 8 months later and subsequently sold out in limited distribution. We had so much fun making that game that we've been working on a bunch of new projects over the past few years and hope to have a very busy 2017-2018. The reception we've received has been amazing and we are thrilled to continue our work in the game industry.\n    About the Team\nMike with his wife Rose and daughter Penelope - Photo by Little Nest\nMike Gnade is a 10 year game industry veteran based in Wilmington, Delaware where he lives with his family.  He is obsessed with games of all kinds and is the designer and producer behind Maximum Apocalypse. He has been deeply involved in the indie gaming scene creating his own games and founding sites like IndieGameMag.com and IndieGameStand.com before designing his own tabletop games. \n  Gustav Rangmar is a freelance illustrator and concept artist from Sweden.  He is the one responsible for all of your gorgeous artwork.  You can see more of his work here.\nMatt Cangialosi, our lead playtester and marketing guru, is a gaming fanatic based up in Boston, MA.  His early feedback was essential and assisted with additional game design and playtesting.\nMartin Lauzon is a freelance Canadian video producer/animator and did an amazing job putting together our Kickstarter video.  You can contact him at albrech1s@gmail.com.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are fortunate to have gone through the Kickstarter process before and delivered our games to our backers in about 8 months from our project's end date. We attribute a lot of this speed to getting all of the core artwork completed upfront and have done the same with this project. We pride ourselves on communicating with our backers and impressing them by meeting deadlines and delivering an excellent product. \n\nAs with turning any idea into a physical product, any number of problems can get in the way. While we can\u2019t control everything, we can control our communication to our backers. Delays may happen, dates may change, but we will always be transparent and keep our backers in the loop.\n\n\nPRODUCTION & SHIPPING\n\nWe plan on using the same manufacturers and fulfillment pipeline that we have used in the past to minimize complications and ensure a high quality product.\n\nRULES \n\nDraft rules are available now under the Gameplay section. Please provide any feedback on them so that we can finalize the text and the rulebook shortly after the campaign.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your product to you in a timely manner.

We are showing love for beloved classics, as well as some of the hottest new games out there! And as always, please tell us which other games you'd still like to see upgrade options for - we listen!\nAs with our last Kickstarter project, we are glad to be able to offer flat rate shipping to all backers. You can get everything you want without raising your shipping cost - no limit!\n                                    If you missed the Kickstarter project for Hardback (the game itself), you can pre-order it here!\n  All pledge levels can also be an add-on! That means that if you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level and add the amount of the additional set(s). It's that easy!\nPlease Note: If you want a limited quantity pledge level and other items, please make sure your main pledge level is the limited one. If by chance you want two different limited pledge levels, send us a message on Kickstarter, and we'll make sure you are covered.\n  We don't want anything to stand between you and some really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\n  All orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally.\n  We do not have stretch goals for this project - at least not in the conventional sense. We are more interested in hearing your ideas for new upgrade kits, and moving forward with some of the suggestions, making some of them available in this project as new pledge levels (and add-ons to any pledge level, of course). So speak up in the comments section! And if you see a suggestion that you love, say so! You are as much of a part of the creative process as we are - which is one reason we love Kickstarter so much!\n  Chris and Cynthia Landon are the siblings that own and operate Meeple Source. Andrea is the fantastic artist behind all of these new Character Meeples, and the overwhelming majority of our Character Meeples and upgraded resource bits to date. Karen and Erika are an incredibly important part of our quality control, packaging, and shipping team.\nLocated in Orlando, FL, we are a small family business that takes great pride in superb product quality and excellent customer service!\n  We have already created an enormous number of cool game pieces and accessories, so feel free to browse some of that past work on MeepleSource.com.\nScythe Worker Meeples and Painted Tokens\n  Puerto Rico (boats, trading house, resources, and coins)\n  Colt Express (Character Meeples and Horses)\n  Food Chain Magnate\n  Pandemic Character Germs (plus Character Meeples and Research Centers, not pictured)\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for about six years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 8 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. As a result, in combination with the enormous number of custom product combinations that we allow in our Kickstarter projects, shipping takes a good deal of time. We do use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you may know that a couple of our projects experienced minor delays, and that we were always straight-forward with regard to that. A distinct possibility for delay lies in the painting of the pieces, particularly Character Meeples. Although every individual meeple is hand-sorted for quality control, by us personally, there are times that errors in screen printing require that we re-make the entire batch of pieces for that particular Character Meeple. If this occurs, it will take a minimum of 8-10 weeks to replace them, which could delay shipping. For example, if this were to occur only a month before shipping would otherwise commence, some pledges would deliver after the estimated delivery date. Although we believe that we have allotted plenty of time for situations such as this, it should be noted that project delays are still a possibility. \n\nYou may know that our last project delivered quite early, and although this could occur again, you should know that we believe our estimated delivery dates to be accurate.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges.

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing. It will be wonderful.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, three years ago, and its second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim in February.

It was an ambitious project, and we had great pressure to ensure that the game's quality would be met.\n\nWhile we can certainly be proud of the final's game quality (Panda did an amazing job), we did suffer some production delays. We wanted the game to be as good as it could be, and that led to some re-designing of the game, namely the ant miniatures, and especially their special rotating bases, which we had to scrap a few times over since they weren't working quite like we wanted them to.\n\nWhich is why we are re-using these bases in part for DiverCity -- because they work incredibly well with the theme of diving in this game, and also to alleviate risks since we know they work now, and that they work very well. We are working again with Panda to deliver a quality product, as we did with BrilliAnts!\n\nThe hard part of a Kickstarter is often the fulfillment, which is why we're going to work with the same fulfillment centers and freight companies we have worked with in the past. We were first timers last time, which led to some confusion in setting up some accounts and payment, but it won't happen this time around! We are now very familiar with the process of worldwide fulfillment, so we will be well prepared to tackle on that challenge from day one and lead the games to your doorsteps.\n\nAs always, we remain open to any suggestions or help on that matter!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Maxime Tardif\n4 created \u00b7 57 backed\nHi, I'm Max from Sphere Games!

The mining industry created toxic wastes, combined to pollution they proved fatal to agriculture. Soon, the first mutated crops unleashed havoc. Water was no longer enough for them, they wanted a protein-rich, juicy steak dinner. We tried to give them our politicians instead of steak, but they just wouldn't eat them\u2026 it made them sick.\nThough we were tough, not to be frightened by zombie potatoes. We learned to tame our mutated vegetables. The farming profession went from a peaceful activity to a very risky albeit lucrative profession. Those who can sow, water and feed the best crops will become rich. \nIt's your turn to go to the fields. The Mutant Crops are waiting... will you dare to harvest them? \nIn Mutant Crops you're playing as a farmer who is seeking riches farming some of the most ravenous and dangerous crops the world has ever seen. Mutated from decades of pollution, these aren't your everyday vegetables. \nIn this short, simple and fun worker placement game you'll be placing your meeples on spaces in order to perform their actions such as gaining resources, purchasing crops, watering your plants, feeding them the steaks they're craving and competing with other farmers for another space on the board. \n\nYou're collecting resources: seeds, water and steak dinners. Seeds are necessary to purchase plants, and water/meat are necessary to nourish your crops to provide the best return. Crops are not worth anything until they've been watered and/or fed.\n\nThe farmer who has the most money at the end of the game can laugh their way to the bank - and the victory circle. \n\nThe game is the ideal filler for worker placement fans who want to have a quick game that still challenge their skills. It's a great introductory game for new players on euro-style games, and plays perfect with kids.\n\nNOTE: PNP Demo and Rulebook aren't final. Both will be improved based on your feedback (Rules) and on stretch goals (Deluxe PNP).\n   Note: All previews where made with the prototype box. Final box will be different, and game components quality will be highly improved.\n  We'll be working with GamesQuest for fulfillment outside of the US, which will allow us to be EU-friendly. Since the game is under $20, it will also be US, Australia and Canadian-friendly. \nTo keep the cost of the game down we're going to send untracked packages, though we'll look into having an add-on in our pledge manager to add tracking after the campaign. \nWe love and support FLGS! We're very proud to be able to work with local gaming stores and are glad to have gaming stores working with us to deliver our games to more customers. \n\nIf you operate a retail store and would like to support our project please email info@atherisgames.com for pricing and shipping information. \n\nSebas & Rocio\nMutant Crops was designed by Sebastian Koziner and illustrated by Rocio Og\u00f1enovich. We're a married couple consisting of a board game artist (Rocio) and a graphic designer/game design (Sebas). For the last several years we've worked together running OK Art Studio, which has been involved in the art/graphic design of over 10 successful games with clients such as Dr Finn and Pencil First Games. \nWe publish our games and comics in Argentina with our publishing studio, OK Ediciones - a pioneer in modern games in our country. Mutant Crops will be our second game published worldwide, our first was called Oni. Oni was published through Kickstarter in 2015 by Treesharp Games. We're really excited to bring Mutant Crops to Kickstarter! \nAtheris Games\nAtheris Games is a board game publishing company based out of Orlando, FL. Atheris Games launched Cul-De-Sac Conquest on Kickstarter and were 're proud to bring Mutant Crops to Kickstarter! \nSebastian worked with Atheris for the graphic design of Cul-De-Sac Conquest and our up-and-coming game Supernatural Socks - when he said he had a game he would like us to publish we of course had to take a look. Though we definitely agreed to look at it because he was so great to work with, we were instantly super impressed with this little worker placement game. Mutant Crops is a great game, and one Atheris is proud to publish. \nWe hope you will enjoy it as much as we do! \nMutant Crops was originally co-published in Argentina by OK Ediciones and El Drag\u00f3n Azul.

We also took out some of the campaign pledge levels that added time for Cul-De-Sac. \n\nThough we're sure we will encounter some mistakes again we feel that we have learned a great deal to prevent them. Also, we have added a more solid buffer in our shipping time to account for any potential problems. \n\nFurthermore, our transparency with our backers and our communication is of supreme importance to us. For Cul-De-Sac Conquest we delivered thank you cards and stickers to all of our backers who answered our backer survey and continually update the campaign so backers knew everything that they needed to about the progress of the game. \n\nDespite being late on Cul-De-Sac backers were still constantly reminded that that we were working and doing everything in our power to deliver the best game possible.

Once you have all five animal cards and your lineage marker, you can move your student and master to the center octagon. The first player to do so has successfully passed on their martial arts lineage, and wins the game!\nMeanwhile, one player represents the emperor, working to unify the empire by placing towers in the four corners of the board. As the empire expands, the emperor\u2019s forces grow. Recruited generals give the emperor greater power and flexibility but the additional forces require vigilance and careful planning. Generals rely on the emperor or empress to create paths for them across unforgiving terrains. If the emperor places towers in the four corners before one of the other players has passed on their martial arts lineage, the emperor player wins, and only the emperor\u2019s lineage will prevail.\n    Wu Wei: Journey of the Changing Path is played in a series of rounds. In each round, players take turns in clockwise order, beginning with the starting player. As the seasons change, a gathering will be triggered every winter, during which turn order is reassigned. The game continues in this way until one player wins.\n                      SOLO CAMPAIGN ADDED  \nNot only is there going to be a solo campaign but I have enlisted the help of Mike Mullins (a solo gaming enthusiast and experienced developer) to help me put the final touches on the solo version of the game.

If you\u2019re a fan of abstract strategy or if you want to see a martial arts game that isn\u2019t about flying kicks and throwing punches but digs deeper into the philosophy, Wu Wei is certainly worth checking out.

This image links to the working document.\n               THE GAME \nPlayers have a team of food trucks matching each venue. Each round, players secretly select and reveal two venues to sell their grub.\n  Players select actions to play this round, and then play them clockwise one at a time hoping to better their chances at a fat payout.\n  At the end of a round, the customers are split evenly between # of trucks. Any remainder is discarded. Food trucks return to players and actions are discarded from the game.\nTWO PLAYER VARIANT\n WHY KICKSTARTER?\nIf we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of Truck Off: The Food Truck Frenzy. Manufacturing is lined up. Artwork files will be shipping to the printer shortly after the project. All that is left is the funding.  \nWe're still small, and we love Kickstarter because it puts us directly in contact with incredible people willing to help build something they believe in. We're engaged with the community attending events and meetups around the midwest including Gen Con four years in a row.  We feel energized by these connections and building trust within the community. We reward our supporters with discounts on the game and free flowing communication with us the creators. As a backer, you'll be a copilot and chef on this journey to create awesome games.\nPAST PROJECTS\nIn February 2015, we raised $36,078 on Kickstarter with our first game, Brewin' USA. This game takes place at the inception of the craft beer revolution. Players auction over brewing ingredients, brew their signature line of craft beers, and compete for city and regional area control! The game has continued to grow including selling out of inventory at GenCon 2016. This project was a wonderful ride and we owe a huge thanks to our backers.  \nBrewin' USA (Kickstarter)\nBrewin' USA website\nBrewin' USA (Amazon)\nMEET THE DESIGNER\nFrom Ryan Lambert - I started gaming when I was little, especially with my Dad. We played the standards like Monopoly, Risk, Pay Day, and Careers. Eventually, we discovered games like Catan and Agricola and the collection has gotten out of hand since then. My favorite game right now is Pandemic Legacy. It\u2019s cliche, but the experience is just too good. A close second would be Imperial Assault or Blood Rage. \nI started designing games a couple years ago because I love to create and explore themes and mechanics. Truck Off started with theme. Food trucks are abundant in the Twin Cities and the idea of owning one has always appealed to me. After so many iterations, I love how clean the design of Truck Off ended up with a good mix of strategy and luck. It\u2019s a great casual game that scales well for groups and I hope you have as much fun with it as I have.\nMEET THE PROJECT CREATOR\nStill a small outfit, Adam and Chris from Adam's Apple Games are eager to continue to grow in the gaming industry.  We're engaged in this community, and will continue to deliver awesome projects and give our commitment and energy back in return. We write our final rules in as a female lead player. Check us out from Gen Con 2016, and we're pumped to announce we'll be back at Gen Con 2017! \nMEET THE ARTIST\nJohn Ed de Vera on Instagram\nJohn specializes in a unique paper craft artwork style.  This means literally cutting paper and then photographing his work.  This is a super unique style that captures depth and shadows making his pieces look unbelievably real.  He is a master at his craft, hands down.\nMore artwork on the way soon!\n SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AVATARS\nPlace these in your profile picture on Kickstarter or as your profile pic on social media to showcase your support!  \n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Anything that gets your blood racing is probably worth doing.\" This is one of those things, but making new things is also tough!

You'll know if anything unexpected happens and do my best to make it right. I strive to deliver on time against project deadlines and to avoid unexpected shipping delays.

It sees a group of each characters wake up from the exact same terrible dream, only to discover it's coming to life in the real world.\nEach time the game is played, a Shared Dream scenario is chosen, with each one providing a different set of objectives, enemy mechanics, and unique Nemesis. Every Shared Dream also contains its own set of Personal Reflections, mini-stories each character must progress through in order to contribute to winning the scenario.\nWith 4 Shared Dream scenarios to choose from, 6 unique player characters, and a modular city that changes with every playthrough, The Shared Dream combines the strategy and replayability of a board game with the mood, theme, and storyline of a RPG.\n    Download the Rules Here!  \nCombining the storytelling of an RPG with the strategy of a board game, The Shared Dream contains 2 main mechanics that push the game forward.  \nFirst is the Personal Reflection deck. At the beginning of each game, every player randomly chooses a Personal Reflection deck that is tied to the specific Shared Dream scenario they have chosen to play. This Personal Reflection deck tells the story of that individual's part of the Shared Dream, and their efforts to combat it in the Waking World. Each Personal Reflection deck sees players travel throughout the city, speak with its denizens, and face challenges and obstacles as they work towards completing their part of The Shared Dream.\nThe reflections of your dreams are the key to ending this nightmare.\nThe second is personal resource management. Every player can only take 3 actions per turn, so they must carefully consider how they are going to best spend their time. Do they rush through their Personal Reflection, helping to reach the final conflict as soon as possible? Do they carefully manage their resources to help slow the tide of enemies? Or do they go all out and defeat everything they can, despite the risks?\nIn addition to their actions, the main resource players use is Conviction. Conviction is used to channel their dream identities, helping them grow temporarily stronger, gain access to special powers, and defeat their enemies. Unfortunately, every time Conviction is spent, a character's Nightmare track is increased. At the end of every turn, players must roll a Nightmare check that grows harder the more Nightmare they have.  \nOnce this Nightmare check is failed, that player spawns a new enemy whose strength is dictated by the amount of Nightmare the player has. In this way, players must always consider when and how to use their Conviction. While spending 3 Conviction to channel at full power may be helpful now, it will inevitably have consequences down the line.\nTo see more of The Shared Dream in action, check out these videos! \n                       *Please note that the Alternate Animus promo cards do not add an additional scenario to the Crux Collection.\n                      To include an add-on, after you pledge, click on the blue \"manage my pledge\" button. On the next page, you will see your current pledge total. Add the amount of the add-on you want to the current amount, and hit \"confirm\". Once the campaign has completed, we will gather more information as necessary.\nThis full set of Conviction and Nightmare themed custom dice comes with 4 blue Over dice and 4 red Under dice. Just add $5 to your pledge.\nAll returning backers receive a free set of custom dice!  \nThe Crux Collection adds 6 unique solo scenarios, each of which will help immerse you in the lore of The Shared Dream. \nThe Crux Collection will grow along with the rest of this project! Any additional characters unlocked through Stretch Goals will also add a playable solo story to The Crux Collection.\nWhen a vicious Blood Drinker savagely hunts throughout the city, only the curse of the Moon Beast can stop it! Every night phase, players gain a chance to become the vicious Moon Beast, the only force strong enough to directly confront the Blood Drinker.\nThe Blood Drinker and Moon Beast can also be used as new characters to play any Shared Dream Scenario.\nDarker still is the inclusion of a new Reaver type, the Malefic. Created by an abundance of Shadows, the Malefic floods the city with enemies, requiring everyone to handle the new threat.\nThe Malefic can be used to greatly increase the challenge of any Shared Dream scenario.\nThe Shared Dream's take on the zombie genre! When there's no more room in your head, the dead will walk the earth! Featuring a brand new Nemesis, the Necromancer, Necrophobia sees players deal with an onslaught of undead enemies guided by a dark sorcerer's hand.\nIf you are adding Necrophobia to the Ultimate Edition, Dreaming in Bulk, or a discounted Ultimate Edition (if you are a returning backer), please adjust your pledge by $20 ($100 for Dreaming in Bulk) to receive Necrophobia! \nThe Horned Horror of Laruna lays waste to the Waking World in the Wrath of Axitath! This add-on introduces the new \"Wrath of Axitath\" scenario to The Shared Dream and includes the 85mm tall Axitath miniature!\nSave some cash when you back The Shared Dream and its 3 initial addons! Just choose \"The Ultimate Collection\" as your pledge level. The Ultimate Collection does NOT include the Of Dreams and Magic RPG, the Necrophobia expansion, or the Axitath expansion.\nGo All-In on The Shared Dream! This backer level gets you The Shared Dream, all stretch goals, and all of its expansions!\nWhether you're a RPG vet adding to their collection, or a first-time RPG player, take your game beyond the board with a copy of Of Dreams And Magic.\n  Shipping will be handled AFTER the Kickstarter is complete. Since we have multiple add-ons and stretch goals, we cannot fairly offer a single shipping cost to every backer.\nTo help minimize shipping costs, we will be subsidizing $15 worth of shipping on every package, regardless of size.\nWe will also be shipping from multiple fulfillment centers around the globe to help reduce costs and manage shipping in the most streamlined way possible.\nWe will be handling post-campaign management through Backerkit, and fulfillment through FulfillRite in the US and Canada, and Happyshops in Europe. We also enjoy an existing fulfillment relationship with Amazon, giving us even further options to ensure we can provide an optimum fulfillment solution for every backer.\nBelow is our ESTIMATE of shipping costs for the base game. Our current estimates do not show a shipping cost difference between the base game and the Ultimate Edition.  These costs may change based on stretch goals unlocked and additional add-ons purchased.\nPlease note that you can save on shipping by selecting the Dreaming in Bulk pledge level! When backing at the Dreaming in Bulk level, all 6 copies will be shipped to one location with shipping paid only once!\nIf you are a retailer interested in carrying The Shared Dream, please send us a message on Kickstarter or email john@odampublishing.com for pricing and other information.\nPlease refer to the latest update on the original campaign (found here!) for more information before you back!\n  The Shared Dream will be manufactured by WinGo Games\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe originally launched a Kickstarter for The Shared Dream in November of 2016. Soon after we launched, we received revised manufacturing quotes which opened up a lot of possibilities for us.\n\nWe believe this relaunch presents less risk than our initial campaign because we have been able to listen to a lot of backer feedback on ways to advance the campaign and make The Shared Dream better.\n\nThis feedback has lead to new add-ons, a lower goal, a lower base price, and more video content. \n\nFinally, we've been very conservative with our delivery goal. Our true hope is to have The Shared Dream ready to ship by August, but we're well aware that there are many factors at play when it comes to fulfilling board games, and some of those factors are out of our control.

I was Inspired by Eurostyle games in the late 90s and became a fan of legends like Reiner Knizia, Klaus Teuber, Martin Wallace and Andreas Seyfarth. I unveiled my prototype of Feudum at GenCon 2014 and was thrilled to meet and gain insight from folks like Eric Lang, Mike Eliott, Bruno Faidutti and Jamey Stegmaier. I am excited that the game has been hailed as \"articulate and inventive,\" and appears on several \"watch\" lists within the BoardGameGeek community. I sincerely hope the kickstarter community feels the same way. Check out facebook.com/feudum or BoardGameGeek to learn more.\nArtist\nAs he likes to put it, Justin Schultz is an \"earthling living in Jackson, Mississippi.\" Justin studied graphic design at Mississippi State University and worked for a number of advertising agencies before focusing on concert posters, album covers, package design and, just recently, board game art! His distinctive style of populating his art with monsters, reptiles and robots conjures up memories of children's picture books, albeit slightly skewed. Justin explains that he likes to lure viewers in with \"superficially charming images,\" but then reveal something more \"heartbreaking\" or \"daunting\" upon closer inspection.  In 2010, Justin started his independent studio, The Flying Chair\nOdd Bird Games is excited to announce a partnership with Quartermaster Logistics to get you your rewards!

These rates are based on current carrier rates (FedEx, UPS) and may fluctuate.  \n\nRest of the World Fulfillment\nQM logistics is dedicated to finding the most cost-effective delivery solution for backers around the world, therefore, the \u201cRest of World\u201d rate is merely an averaged estimate. When possible, QM Logistics will use the fulfillment centers that are closest to backers in order to save them money. (For example, fulfilling from China, for East Asia, or fulfilling others from the EU shipping.) Be forewarned, it may be difficult to economically ship to some places in the world, but we will do our best.  \n\nBulk Shipping\nHeavier rates will generally just be a multiple or combination of 50lb and under rates. So, shipping 5 Feudum Cartons  (3 games per carton) at 46.5 kgs, would probably travel in 1 30kg and 1 20kg package in Europe, or possibly travel in 5 separate 10 kg packages. It would depend on how the packing works out. Often these shipments will be broken up in multiple boxes that are all shipped at once.\n\nPallet Shipping\nOnce we reach a pallet sized shipment, (i.e. 99+ games), costs almost entirely depend on where it will be shipped. For example, shipping a single pallet can range from $150 - $700 in the U.S. \nFollow Feudum on social media! Oh, and tell your friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTruth be told, there will undoubtedly be a smattering of bumps, hiccups and faux pas made on this maiden voyage of ours. It is, after all, the first game that Justin and I have created. Deftly navigating the rough waters of fulfillment houses, freight shippers, manufacturers and backer relations won't be easy. \n\nOur naivet\u00e9 is bound to try someone's patience at some point in this adventure. That said, my artist and I are indubitably marked by an old-fashioned, yet noble code of conduct: We always try to do the right thing. \n\nOf course, to do the right thing, one must have knowledge. Thanks to a treasure trove of books, online resources and the generous support of the game designer community, we both feel quite prepared to take on this challenge. \n\nAdditionally, we have invested time and money in key partnerships that will streamline all operations. Backerkit will facilitate backer orders; OTX will ensure that freight shipping goes off without a hitch; Fulfillment houses like Fulfillrite, Spiral Galaxy, Starlit, Aetherworks and SFC will allow games to ship from within backers' countries of origin. \n\nSo far, these partnerships have been marked by transparency and free-flowing communication, right down to the way cardboard boxes and bubble wrap will be used to ensure the safe transport of every game. \n\nAt first, Odd Bird Games was like a methane gas-sniffing canary trapped deep within the bowels of a coal mine.

It's originality has been recognized by the world record holder dice collector Mr. Kevin Cook, and the project is going to be featured in the art photo book \"Dice \u2013 Rendezvous with Randomness\" by M\u00e5ns Danneman (to be soon published by \u00c5skf\u00e5geln).\nThey are still in demand, but not many are left. This campaign will provide good company to your First Edition Ptolemaic Constellation Dice (Northern Sky), while offering new backers the chance to grab the very last available First Edition, along with all new designs.\nThis campaign has been in the making for one year... \n ...Have you got space in your collection? \nPlease note: The rewards launched when the campaign started do not include the dice unlocked with Stretch Goals. Suggested rewards for new backers are:\n\u20ac9 Sample Dice Colors (4 dice, 3 options)\n\u20ac18 Cartographer's Bundle (8 dice, 2 options)\n\u20ac24 Astronomer's Polyhedral set (9 dice)\n\u20ac35 Collector's Night Black Polyhedral set (12 dice)\n\u20ac65 Master's SUPERSAVER Bundle (30 dice)\n\u20ac24 Astronomer's Polyhedral set\nTo get one of all available dice versions (design / color / finishing) select the \u20ac22 One Deluxe Anniversary Set and increase your pledge by \u20ac30 to upgrade it with polyhedrals and the Northern Sky dice in light blue color.\nMost rewards over \u20ac22 are sent with tracked shipping, but that does not reach all destinations (e.g. Australia, Norway...). If your nation is missing in the list, and you are ok with untracked shipping, please contact me because it may be possible to ship that way.\nAll dice will be precision engraved (not silkscreened) for maximum durability.\nNow available... the full polyhedral set:\nThe sets will be made in a limited edition of only 500 sets per color, unless sufficient funding allows for a larger manufacturing quantity.\n\u20ac24 Astronomer's Polyhedral set\n  Celebrating 450 Years of Discovery and Exploration\n2017 will mark the 40th anniversary of the Voyager spacecrafts, that allowed us to admire Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and now are travelling out of the solar system.  \nIt is interesting to point out that \"Voyager\" actually means a traveller to a distant land (especially one who travels by sea) as 2017 will also be the uncelebrated 450th anniversary of the European exploration of the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn 1567 \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira reached the Solomon Islands, and very soon afterwards a new set of constellations was created to help navigators, and honor new instruments of science such as the pendulum clock and the telescope. \nThe first new dice will be 16mm d6 like the one before, showing the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere (including the Southern Cross), and the Magellanic Clouds. A glow-in-the-dark option of Constellation Dice is available.\nRendering of Southern Sky Constellation Dice\nDue to incredibly high demand and overwhelming positive feedback, and since a new color has been added to the available options, also the original limited edition Ptolemaic Constellation (Northern Sky) Dice will be reprinted IN THE NEW COLOR ONLY.\nRendering of Northern Sky Constellation Dice (new color)\nIf you choose Morning Sky color for your Constellation Dice, half will be Southern Sky, while the other half will be Northern Sky.\nIf you want a mixed set, to add more dice to your reward select one option from the list available in the FAQ at the bottom of this page:\n\"What are the available options to get Extra Dice?\".\nI have added a convenient \u20ac6 one to obtain both Constellation Dice finishing (standard and glow-in-the-dark).\nOptional glow-in-the-dark finish for all versions.\nIn the following years, as a result of improvements Galileo Galilei made to the telescope, with a magnifying capability of 20\u00d7, he was able to see celestial bodies more distinctly than was ever possible before. This allowed Galilei to discover in either December 1609 or January 1610 what came to be known as the Galilean moons. \nThe second new dice will be a couple of d10 featuring the planets, and all their 9 moons discovered before 1700 only by using optical means.\nThese dice do not glow in the dark. Prototypes should be ready soon. Update: if you get a total of at least four Solar System Voyager d10 (in your chosen reward, or by pledging extra), one couple will glow-in-the-dark. This doesn't apply for retailers bundles.\nRendering of Voyager Dice (planets d100, moons d10)\nAt zero sides you'll see the sun and our moon. Pluto is still included as the ninth planet, although it is now classified as a dwarf planet (one in a growing series). \nThe third new dice will be a 16mm d6 with little stars that can be used as pips counting from 1 to 6, while the big sparkling stars, spanning two sides each, make the dice compatibile with Fudge/FATE, for those who play by that ruleset (please check update #6 to learn more about Fudge).\nThese dice do not glow in the dark. Prototypes should be ready soon.\nAlthough they feature no recognizable constellations, these dice can be used as a background starfield to Constellation Dice, while allowing to reproduce your favourite asterism... as sung in the first inspiration of this project, Bj\u00f6rk's song \"Desired Constellation\":\nThe manufacturing of the dice will start in January 2017 as soon as the funds and the surveys are collected. According to the factory schedule, about three months would be needed for completing the order, which is much more complex than the initial plan of making only a couple of dice types in two colors. The sorting and packaging of the dice should take two weeks, and shipment about three weeks, allowing for delivery a couple months before the Voyagers' anniversary in August 2017.\nChart of the Reward Tiers\nKickstarter doesn't allow multiple pledges and I had to publish several different reward tiers trying to make everyone happy. The main offering including all the new dice is the Anniversary Set, to which the Collector's Bundles add the original first edition Constellation Dice in Night Black and Sky Blue color. The Deluxe versions include also glow-in-the-dark dice, along with the Scout's Bundles, the Master's SUPERSAVER Bundle and the Cartographer's Bundle which offer a partial, inexpensive selection of the available dice. If you value quantity, get the Five Friends SUPERSAVER Bundle, a good deal for retailers.\nThe following chart displays the content of the main sets. \nIt is also available for download in printable PDF format.\nThe costs do not include shipping because it may vary. If you need further help to pick the best one for you, scroll down to the FAQ: \"How do I choose the right bundle?\" at the bottom of this page, or just ask. I'm here to help.\nPlease CLICK to enlarge.\n  Extending your reward tier with dice unlocked by Stretch Goals\nThe Extended Sets where created to let all those who backed the project until the Black Friday weekend to get all the current Stretch Goals in one go. You can now access these bundles too.\nYou can only get the Extended set for the reward you have picked. The Extended Collector's bundles are grayed out because the corresponding reward tiers are all taken.\nTo upgrade your set to Extended, increase your pledge by the amount in the yellow box and contact me.\nAccording to the following list, for a couple of Extended Sets you will get more dice than specified in the sidebar description.\nThe green tabs indicate that some dice of a type glow in the dark. To learn the exact quantities, please refer to the full reward chart above.\nNeed extra dice? How to order more.\nIf your chosen reward level includes the \"Need extra dice?\" line, it means there is enough room for some more dice in your envelope, at the same shipping cost. A list of the possible options is available in the FAQ at the bottom of this page (\"What are the available options to get Extra Dice?\").\nExample: If you would like to add a couple of glowing d6 and one more couple of d10 to the One Anniversary Set reward (\u20ac15), select it and specify your shipping destination (i.e. \u20ac6 for Europe), then add the necessary amounts to the pledge:\n\u20ac21 for One Anniversary Set (that is, \u20ac15 + \u20ac6 for shipping to Europe)\n+ \u20ac11 for 2 Southern Sky d6 and 2 Solar System d10  \n\u20ac32 is the total pledge amount you would have to type in.\nPlease note that if you pledge extra for rewards that do not include the \"Need extra dice?\" line, I will consider that as a donation to the project. \n Stretch Goals!\nAs the project progresses, these Stretch Goals will be unlocked:\n\u20ac 6000: Free glow-in-the-dark paint on one of multiple d10 sets\nif your reward includes more than 2 Solar System Voyager dice (at least four d10) one couple will be upgraded to glow-in-the-dark free of charge!\nif you selected a pledge level with the line \"Need Extra Dice\" and will add more d10 as an extra, getting at least two couples of d10 (four dice) upgrading your pledge to meet the above condition, one couple will be upgraded to glow-in-the-dark free of charge!\nthis is valid for backers who increase their pledge before the counter hits \u20ac6000.\nthis doesn't apply to retailers bundles.\n\u20ac 7000: Free glow-in-the-dark paint as above (see update #10)  \nThe first Stretch Goal has been extended until the end of the campaign.\n\u20ac 8000: One extra color option, also valid for the Northern Sky set \nYou will be able to specify your favorite color for both Constellation dice (d6) and Desired Constellation dice (fudge d6), and you will be able to specify which colors will glow in the dark if you are getting such dice.\nIf you choose Morning Sky color for your Constellation Dice, half will be from the Northern Sky set, while the other half will be Southern Skies.\nNew color unlocked: Morning Sky (light blue) also for the Northern dice\nFOR DICE INCLUDED IN YOUR REWARD TIER:\nThe available options for the Constellation dice are:\nall Sky Blue\nall Night Black\nall Morning Sky (in this case half will be from the Northern Sky set)\nmixed (if you need all tre colors, get at least six Constellation Dice)\nThe available options for your Desired Constellation d6 dice as well as for you Solar System Voyager d10 dice are:  \nall Sky Blue\nall Night Black  \nmixed\nFOR EXTRA DICE OBTAINED BY INCREASING YOUR PLEDGE:\nYou will be able to specify exactly what you want from what is available.\n\u20ac 10000: Lunar Phases d4 (Supermoon dice) and Zodiacal d12\nThe stars around the top vertex indicate the value of the roll.\n  Each side show the real costellation for the respective sign, starting with Aries at #1\nThese two dice will be available in Night Black color only until the \u20ac20,000 Stretch Goal. \n\u20ac 13000: Compass d8 and Milky Way d20\nA compass rotates on the equator of the dice.\n  Stars are more dense all around the dice where #1 and #20 are.\nThese two dice will be available in Sky Blue color only until the \u20ac16,500 Stretch Goal.\n\u20ac 14000: Advertising the project on Board Game Geek and Kicktraq\nThe ads will be running during the final week of the campaign.\n\u20ac 16500: Night Black color option for all polyhedrals (including d10)\nThe black Northern Sky dice is only available in some Collector's bundles.\n\u20ac 20000: Sky Blue color option for all polyhedrals (including d10)\nThe blue Northern Sky dice is only available in some Collector's bundles.\nLOCKED Stretch Goals:  \n\u20ac 25000: one FREE bonus dice for all the backers!\n1 Desired Constellation d6 for all backers of the 'sample' rewards.  \n1 Constellation dice d6 (Southern Sky, or light blue Northern Sky) for all others. \nThe color will be random, but I will try to match your set when packaging.\nHigh quality, low price (for now). Where is the catch?\nThis is actually several campaigns in one, launched together to offer great value to a broad audience, and let you save on combined shipping, expecially now that we have funded a full polyhedral set.\nBy bundling the dice their cost get averaged out, even if some versions are quite expensive (the glow-in-the-dark paint is applied by hand, almost doubling the manufacturing price).\nI am in contact with a few shops around the world that are booking my dice in advance at a very convenient price. This helped me lower the initial funding goal.\nI have kept the rewards cost at a minimum, to thank you all for helping me make this project a reality. To do this I had to order about 1000 of each design (mass production), and I will pay for the unclaimed dice with my own money.\nSince the funding goal will only be enough to cover manufacturing and shipping expenses, this convenience had to come at a cost.\nAny remaining dice after the campaign will be sold at retail price so don't miss this heavily discounted chance (there is no plan to reprint the dice once they are all gone).\nThis campaign is EU / U.S.A. friendly\nBackers the United States will not have to pay any custom fee since the shipping will be taken care of by a local distribution company. Moreover shipping to the United States will be tracked in most cases, even when the reward specifies \"Untracked Shipping\".\n1st Edition Ptolemaic Constellation Dice (Northern Sky)\nBackers from Europe will enjoy a little discount for untracked shipping as the rewards will be sent from Italy.\nTo get these dice after the campaign please subscribe to my newsletter and you will be notified when they will be available for purchase.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am an experienced designer and this is my second crowdfunding campaign. The first one was delivered in time with regular updates and positive comments from happy backers at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/constellation-dice\n\nFor our german backers:\nhttp://bit.ly/GermanConstellationDice1\nhttp://bit.ly/GermanConstellationDice2\nhttp://bit.ly/GermanConstellationDice3 (this one has pictures)\n\nThe designs for this new project are ready and all fees and expenses have been taken into account, with a little margin for unexpected ones.\n\nAs soon as they are ready I shall receive and publish here pictures of the actual prototypes of the dice (the main image shows renderings, and your feedback is welcome, so it is possible the final product will appear slightly different).\n\nA quality output is expected because the bulk of the manufacturing will be taken care of by Q Workshop in Poland. This includes the d10 Voyager Dice and the Southern Sky Constellation Dice. The d6 Desired Constellation Dice will be manufactured in China with a custom mold, to allow the special design crossing the corners.\n\nThe main risk in a project like this is delays, but I have already taken into account one spare month. If all goes well, you will receive your rewards well in advance of the Voyagers' 40th anniversary in August, but probably later than the reported date of April 2017 (which didn't take into account the Stretch Goal manufacturing of full polyhedral sets).\n\nThe second risk is that some envelope may get lost during shipping. \nUntracked shipping is quite safe, inexpensive and reaches more locations. I have successfully sent hundreds of rewards this way last year. If anyway an envelope gets lost I will only be able to provide a proof of shipping, and tracking up to the moment it leaves the italian borders; for this reason I have provided the option for tracked shipping on more costly rewards.\n\nIt is your choice to pick tracked or untracked shipping, as I will not be able to resend more than a few packages (first come, first served) given the very limited budget I could allocate for that.\nI will do my best to help as usual, and I will try to locate both tracked and untracked shippings, as often it is just a matter of time before they arrive. Anyway I won't be able to resend/refund everyone in the unlikely event that a relevant number of packages is lost.\n\nPlease note that most the rewards destined to the U.S.A. shall be shipped with tracking from inside the country, making the risk even less.\n\nThe main challenge at the moment is to reach enough backers to reach all the Stretch Goals, the sooner the better.\n\nI trust you with this :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Notification Service", "descp": "Pledge to access the \"backers only\" updates, enjoy astronomy trivia and be alerted before the next limited offers will be published (great deals await!)\nAnd... many thanks for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac6 or more", "title": "LIMITED OFFER: Sample Dice Trio", "descp": "3 Dice (one is Glowing):\n1 Southern Sky d6 Dice (GLOWING)\n2 Desired Constellation d6 Dice\nShipping is UNTRACKED.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["35 backers", "Limited (15 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac9 or more", "title": "Sample Dice Colors", "descp": "4 Dice (the whole sky in your hands):\n1 Northern Sky Constellation Dice d6\n1 Southern Sky Constellation Dice d6\n2 Desired Constellation Dice d6\nThese dice will not glow in the dark.\nPick your favorite color option:\nA) Two light blue Constellation Dice,\nOne black, One blue Desired Constellation Dice\nB) One black, One light blue Constellation Dice,\nTwo blue Desired Constellation Dice\nC) One blue, One light blue Constellation Dice,\nTwo black Desired Constellation Dice\nShipping is UNTRACKED.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Desired Constellation Dice Bundle", "descp": "12 Desired Constellation d6 Dice\n(equivalent to 3 complete Fudge/FATE sets)\nNeed extra dice?

It all seems so easy! A small plot of land, a reception and a website is all you need to receive some income from tourists.\nSatisfied you take a rest \u2013 but not for long, as your guests already leave for greener pastures! They like your competitor's campground more: the \u2018Clash d\u2019Ard\u00e8che\u2019 has begun. \nClaim the best sites, bluff out your competitors, bribe the mayor and fulfill your secret assignment to win!\nWith this expansion pack, just bribe the mayor to be the one and only player with permission to receive camper-vans on your campground. Will you acquire this monopoly? The permit is given every season, so just take care to be the first in line!\nMRSP: \u20ac10, now on Kickstarter: \u20ac6 (shipping included). Content: 7 Camper-vans + rules.\n\nJust pledge your tier + \u20ac6 to receive one Camper-van expansion pack.\n                      The above is a prototype, not the final version of game components. Dutch gameplay video here.\nClash d\u2019Ard\u00e8che is a bluffing & strategic area control game for 1-4 players. In approximately one hour you start from scratch to end with a thriving campground.\nInvest your money wisely: buy the best facilities, broadcast radio commercials and bribe the mayor at the right time to expand and flourish. The bluffing element in the game is the time when you set the price you charge your guests. What price is set by your opponents? And how will their guests react to your price?\n\nBecause every player has a secret assignment with different victory conditions, players follow different strategies and replayability is high.\nSome upgrades for your campground\nThe two core game mechanics are the price-quality steps and the bribe cards. \nThe price-quality steps determine to which campground guests want to go. Influence those guests by building starbuildings on your campground and by charging them higher or lower prices. Because you don't know the price set by your competitors, this is the time when you have to bluff your way to the desired outcome. Be careful not to chase away your own guests though!\nThe bribe cards are a combination of worker placement, card drafting and set collection-mechanics. Different combinations of cigars, jewellery and wine get you powerful favors from the friendly mayor.\nIn the expert version another mechanic is added: the gameboard becomes a strategic puzzle as your guests want to camp nearby your sanitary, swimming pool or restaurant. Luckily you can also let them use your neighbours' facilities :-).\nHostel and Water Park camping upgrades\nSolo-game\nIn the solo-version of Clash d'Ard\u00e8che the friendly, but slightly corrupt mayor has gone megalomaniac. His nice country house in the outskirts of the small French village is no longer any good, he now demands the island as the vicinity for his mansion! Rules can be downloaded on our BGG-page.\nGames are shipped from within the USA and the EU, so no extra taxes apply. Shipping can be very complicated, but we want to keep it simple: we'll use the Royal Dutch Mail for worldwide shipping, Amazon Fulfillment for the USA and DHL for the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nShipping Costs:\nUSA, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium: \u20ac5\nEurope & Canada: \u20ac9\nWorldwide: \u20ac17\n  The rules and Print&Play files of the game are freely available on our BGG-page.   \nThe game comes with Dutch, French and English rules and cards.\nSome pics of the prototype:\nGameboard prototype\n   Two Campground upgrades\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaybe you've noticed we launched this game before, in june this year.

We've already unlocked those in green!\n  I've always considered myself a gamer, I was grew up during the vicious console wars of the 90's. Luckily I survived, and since being introduced to the world of the modern board game I've become somewhat obsessed. \nHaving built up a considerable collection, I couldn't help but be inspired to give back to the community that has given me so much joy. \nI want people to play more games. To achieve this I want to create games that appeal to a wide audience. That is why I created apauling games. We want to make games that are fun, engaging and contemporary. \nNothing To Declare is our first game. We've been working on it for some time and we have the rest of the project planned out to ensure that we deliver the game in a timely fashion. \n  I've been working on Nothing To Declare for about a year, in that time the game has gone through many iterations and improvements.\nThis has been a passion project of ours and it's now at a stage where we want to share it with you. This is the point where we cannot go any further without your help.\nTo make Nothing To Declare the best it can be we need to raise the funds to have it professionally manufactured.    \nWe really need you to make this game all it can be. We've got some cool things planned throughout the campaign to get everyone involved and make sure everyone has their say on the final product.\nThe art is 90% done and everything is lined up with our manufacturing and fulfillment partners we just need the funds to get over that final hurdle. \nBecause Nothing To Declare is a small box game we don't have to pay any large customs fees. This means we can offer worldwide friendly shipping and pass those savings on to you.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're familiar with board game Kickstarters you'll understand that there are things that affect all board game Kickstarters. \n\nMostly the biggest risks are around shipping and fulfillment.

Play as the stalwart Samurai Warrior, using your mastery of the Katana and your bushido code of honor to defeat your foes in combat, the nimble and deadly ninja Assassin, using stealth and speed as weapons, the Traveling Monk, a member of an ancient Yamabushi order devoted to fighting supernatural creatures wherever they may be found, and the powerful and mystic Sorceress, who wields Elemental Magik to crush her enemies.\n    Set in Feudal Japan, the Heroes must brave the Forbidden Fortress; a feudal castle overrun with all manner of Demons, Ghosts, and Monsters inspired by Japanese myth and legend. The massive Oni, red beast-like ogres wielding giant clubs, stalk the halls, while deadly Tengu sword masters descend from the skies with their raven wings to attack the Heroes. Legions of Samurai Dishonored Dead rise from the grave, and writhing Acidic Tentacles burst from the floor to spit acid and feed on the Heroes with their razor sharp teeth.\nBut at the heart of the fortress lie the most terrifying and epic foes of all; the Harionago, a ghostly, demonic woman, held aloft by the twisting strands of her animated hair, which is also used to entangle and slash at the Heroes with its vicious barbs, and the towering Living Statue, possessed by Darkness to break away from its posts, wreaking havoc and smashing the castle it was once built to protect!\nWe've just added a Surprise Bonus to both Sumo and Shogun Pledges!\n Game Features\nIncludes 27 beautifully detailed, multi piece hard plastic, 32mm scale game miniatures for the Heroes and Enemies, each designed with dynamic poses and detail perfect for painting.\nImmersive adventures and story driven gameplay, using the expansive and popular Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 Game Engine.\nFully Cooperative, with all of the players working together against the game itself\nDynamically generated adventures, 12 different Missions, and 4 unique Heroes with many options for customization, the game is designed for massive replayability.\nEasy to learn with simple but fun gameplay and rewarding thematic story moments as you progress your Heroes.\nBuilt-in Campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level.\nHeroes can visit a Feudal Japanese Village between mission to re-stock and re-supply before the next adventure, having a mini-adventure in town.\nDouble-sided Map Tiles include a Forbidden Fortress of Feudal Japan on one side and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld on the back side for the Heroes to explore; stepping through a shimmering portal and continuing their adventures in an alien world inside of a massive living creature.\nOver 250 game cards, a full set of beautifully illustrated, double-sided Map Tiles, a host of dice and counters, and all of the large Hero and Enemy record sheets needed to play\nIncludes a CD Soundtrack of original Music, created to set the mood while playing.\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress can be played on its own as a stand-alone game, or it can be used in combination with any and all of the other Shadows of Brimstone products already available! It is fully compatible, in every way! For new players, Forbidden Fortress will make a great introduction to the world of Shadows of Brimstone, and for veteran players, it adds a ton of new content, including two brand new Worlds to explore - the Japanese castles and temples of the Forbidden Fortress and a living world inside a massive creature in the Belly of the Beast. It also includes a brand new set of Heroes and Enemies to add to your games. With the option of starting your Heroes in Feudal Japan or the Old West, or having a mixed party of Heroes, drawn from both worlds, the possibilities are endless!\nThe Belly of the Beast OtherWorld\nForbidden Fortress also adds a brand new OtherWorld on the back side of the Map Tiles\u2026 The Belly of the Beast! Backers from the original Brimstone Kickstarter may recognize this as an OtherWorld Stretch Goal that was not unlocked during the original campaign. When we started formalizing what would be in Forbidden Fortress, the idea of adding the Belly of the Beast as the OtherWorld on the back side of the tiles was a perfect fit! What could be more in keeping with the Japanese theme than allowing the Heroes to find their way through a portal that leads inside of an unspeakably massive creature; battling all sorts of living organs and parasites, and fighting off the Flesh Mites, Acid Blobs, and Parasitic Tentacles that inhabit this \u2018living\u2019 world.\nWhat You Get in the Core Set Box\nThe Core Set for Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress includes all of the following:\n(Note that the final version of contents may vary from those shown here).\nThe Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion\nThe Temple of Shadows was once the home of an ancient and powerful order of Yamabushi monks, dedicated to battling supernatural creatures throughout the land. It was foretold that one day the Great Dragon King, Sho-Riu would return to destroy the Earth, and only they could stop him. When the meteor came from the heavens and devastated the mountain, the Dragon King came with it. For generations the monks had been training for this moment, and as Sho-Riu descended on the temple, they gathered their strength and prepared to fulfill their destiny.\nBut their victory was not to be. Reigning down death and destruction, the Dragon King broke through the monk\u2019s defenses and utterly destroyed the order, devouring their souls and bringing Darkness and shadow into the sacred temple. Those few that survived were scattered and leaderless, but they would not sit idle. Traveling the roads and countryside, the last of the monks dedicated their lives to finding new Heroes that could one day fulfill the prophecy and reclaim\u2026 the Temple of Shadows!\nBuilding on the themes from the Forbidden Fortress Core Set, the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion adds a ton of new content for the Feudal Japan setting and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld. This boxed set includes:\n4 New Hero Classes\nEnforcer \u2013 An outlaw and a gangster, the Enforcer is an anti-Hero renegade who favors brute strength and intimidation over elegant fighting weapons and technique. His tattooed body is hardened and scarred from a lifetime of brutal brawling.\nGeisha \u2013 Beautiful but deadly, the Geisha is a cunning and stealthful fighter. She employs deception and trickery to evade and confuse enemies, while slashing with her hidden blade from behind. Her comforting presence can heal the Heroes, both body and soul, to keep them in the fight.\nSoldier \u2013 The Soldier is a veteran of warfare who has seen many battles and is an expert marksman with his Rifle. Though he does not have the style or family heritage of the Samurai, he is a hardened foot soldier that has access to a variety of different weapons and training.\nKitsune \u2013 A guardian spirit, the Kitsune has come forward to defend this world against the demons and creatures that would threaten to destroy it. Taking on a human-fox form, the Kitsune uses supernatural tricks and auras to protect the Heroes, while darting between enemies to deliver killing blows with her deadly blades.\n4 New Enemy Types\nChochinobake \u2013 These demon-possessed, animated lanterns swarm the Heroes, relentlessly biting and burning them with terrifying speed.\nTakobake Warriors \u2013 Once a noble clan, the Takobake have embraced the power of the Dark Stone. Using its energy to grow in strength, they have become mutated into tentacled monstrosities, twisted and evil.\nSkin Crawlers \u2013 These large, parasitic creatures burrow through the flesh and muscle walls in the Belly of the Beast, rising up from the pools of sticky mucus to assault any Heroes foolish enough to enter into their feeding grounds.\nThe Fallen Shogun \u2013 This dreadful leader of the Takobake clan was one of the first to discover the magical properties of the Dark Stone. Weaving it into his armor, and forging it into weapons, he has gone mad with power, mutating into a giant among men! Declaring himself Shogun, he now sweeps across the land with his legions of mutated soldiers, conquering any who would stand in his way.\nNew Material for the Forbidden Fortress and Belly of the Beast\nThis expansion also features 4 new double-sided Map Tiles with new rooms for the Forbidden Fortress on one side and the Belly of the Beast on the other, 6 New Missions for the Temple of Shadows, loads of new cards and counters, and much more!\n.\nWhat You Get in the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion Box\nThe Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion includes all of the following:\n(Note that the final version of contents may vary from those shown here). Box Cover Art is Stand-in.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThere are two Kickstarter Exclusive Hero Classes created for this campaign.\nAs part of the Sumo Pledge Level, a backer will get the KS Exclusive Sumo Hero Class.\nSumo \u2013 A massive and imposing figure, the Sumo has trained all his life for unarmed battle in the wrestling ring. But when Demons and Monsters sweep across the land, he answers the call, stepping out of the ring and onto the battlefield.\nMounted on a 40mm base, the Sumo is the first ever large size Hero. He uses his weight and strength to mercilessly crush his foes, pushing enemies around the board and body slamming them with unbridled fury.\nAs part of the Shogun Pledge Level, a backer will also get the KS Exclusive Samurai Daimyo Hero Class, which also includes 3 Armored Ashigaru Foot Soldiers for him to command!\nSamurai Daimyo \u2013 A clan leader and military general, the Samurai Daimyo uses strategy and tactics to outwit and outmaneuver his opponents. As a powerful commander and trained Samurai warrior, he leads his armies into combat, for honor and glory!\nThe Samurai Daimyo starts each adventure with up to 3 Armored Ashigaru Foot Soldier Allies to command. In addition to being a skilled fighter, the Daimyo is also a natural leader, and many of his skills and abilities focus on giving bonuses to the rest of the Heroes and his Foot Soldiers\nStretch Goals\nThere are 2 types of Stretch Goals that can be unlocked during the course of this Kickstarter campaign: Sumo Level Stretch Goals (marked in Light Tan) and Shogun Level Stretch Goals (marked in Purple).\nSumo Level Pledges will receive only the Light Tan Sumo Level Stretch Goals, while Shogun Level Pledges will receive both the Light Tan Sumo Level Stretch Goals as well as all of the Purple Shogun Level Stretch Goals. \nHow To Purchase Add-Ons\nTo purchase items from the Add-Ons Menu below, simply click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button at the top of this page and increase your pledge amount to include the additional cost of the items that you\u2019d like to get. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want yet, that will happen in the Pledge Manager after the Forbidden Fortress KS Campaign has finished.\nHow Does the Game Play?\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress is a fully-cooperative, Dungeon Crawl adventure game! That means that all of the players form a Hero team (or you can play solo) and are working together against the game itself, entering the torch-lit castle gates and exploring dark courtyards and mysterious chambers within a fortress that has been overrun with creatures and demons!  The team can take on different missions from the Adventure Book, each with unique set up and victory conditions. You may be searching for a sacred artifact, stolen from the nearby temple by demons and carried off to the dark fortress, or you might be tasked with sealing off portals that unspeakable creatures are pouring out of!\n1-4 Players (or up to 6 Players if combined with the Temple of Shadows Expansion) create their Heroes by selecting a Hero Class to play, such as the Samurai Warrior or Sorceress. That Hero Class defines your basic character stats - how much Health and Sanity you have, how good you are at hitting enemies with your Katana, how good you are at solving puzzles or dodging fiendish traps, etc. It also defines your basic starting Gear - do you start with a sword, a staff, shuriken? Also, any abilities that all characters of your Hero Class share (a Samurai\u2019s \"Code of Honor\" for example). Each Hero also starts with a Random Personal Item that gives them a bit more \u2018character\u2019, and they get to choose one of three Starting Upgrades unique to their Hero Class. This gives players a chance to start guiding their Hero\u2019s development right from the outset!\nOnce your team is ready to go, the players roll (or decide) what Mission they have taken on and the game begins! Each Hero is represented by a figure on the game board and all of the figures are placed on the Fortress Entrance Map Tile to start the game. All of the Card Decks are shuffled, each Hero gets 1 Grit Token, and the Depth Track is setup with the Hero Party\u2019s marker on the entrance and the Darkness marker deep in the fortress (at the opposite end of the track).\nAt the start of each turn, the Hero with the Lantern rolls 2 dice to Hold Back the Darkness! This roll needs to be equal to or greater than the number listed on the current stage of the Depth Track. If the roll is passed, the Heroes carry on without delay. If the roll is failed, the Darkness moves one step up the track toward escaping the fortress! But beware, if the Darkness marker ever reaches the entrance space on the Depth Track, it has escaped, and the mission is failed. As an added element of danger, if the Hold Back the Darkness roll is ever doubles (1-1, 3-3, etc), this instead triggers a random event from the Depth Event Chart equal to that number!\nHeroes now take their turn in order of Initiative, with the highest going first. During a Hero\u2019s Activation, they roll a die and may move up to the amount rolled. If a 1 is rolled, the Hero also recovers an extra Grit Token. Grit Tokens are used for a number of things in game. A Grit Token may be discarded to Re-roll any number of your dice just rolled (though no die may be Re-rolled more than once), or a Grit Token may be discarded to move an extra die roll worth of spaces during your Movement. A Grit Token may also be used to activate certain powerful character abilities.\nAfter moving, the Hero may attack if there are any enemies on the board, or if they have ended their move in a space adjacent to a doorway (an open exit from the map tile you are on), you may look down the hall and draw a random Map Card to place the next Map Tile, connecting it to the doorway you are looking through. Each time a new Map Tile is placed, you must also move the Hero Party\u2019s marker one step forward on the Depth Track, as the Hero Team delves deeper into the fortress. This is important because as the Heroes go deeper underground, it becomes harder and harder to Hold Back the Darkness (the number required to roll gets higher, the deeper the Hero Party has gone).\nNewly placed Map Tiles are always either a Room or a Passage. Passage Tiles have open doorways on all ends and can often split the path in front of the Heroes. They do not, however, contain Encounters for the Heroes to deal with. Room Tiles, on the other hand, always come into play with an Exploration Token on them. As long as there is an unrevealed Exploration Token on a Map Tile, Heroes may not look through Doorways on that Map Tile (you can\u2019t explore further than that room with the unrevealed token). At the end of a full Hero Turn (after all Heroes have been Activated), if there are one or more Heroes in a Room with an Exploration Token, that token is revealed!\nWhile exploring, Heroes can find large, swirling portals that the Enemies are coming through to attack, and they can step through those gateways into a crazy alien World, continuing their adventures on the other side! All of the Map Tiles are double-sided, with the Fortress on one side and an alien OtherWorld on the back side. In Shadows of Brimstone:  Forbidden Fortress, the alien World included is the Belly of the Beast! Stepping through the portal, the Heroes find themselves inside an unfathomably large creature, exploring the living passages and inner chambers of its massive body, dripping with goo and overrun with parasites and living defenses.\nOnce the Heroes have reached their objective for the mission being played, they will often have one final Epic battle with an Enemy boss to complete the Adventure!\nBetween Adventures, the Heroes can travel back to a nearby Japanese Village to re-stock and re-supply, having a mini-Adventure in Town before setting out on the next Mission.\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress has a built in campaign system allowing the players to keep their Heroes from game to game, finding cool new Gear and Artifacts that they can use in their continuing Adventures, while gaining experience and going up in level to unlock new skills chosen from their Class-Specific Skill Tree.\nGame Miniatures\nThe Miniatures included in Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress and the Temple of Shadows Expansion are multi-part HIPS hard plastic. They come on frames and do require some assembly. We have taken great care to make the assembly in as few pieces per model as possible, while still getting a high level of detail and fantastic, dynamic poses. This also brings an aspect of Hobby to the game as many players find it fun to customize and paint their figures.\nShipping\nThis project is US, EU, Canada, UK, and Australia Friendly Shipping!\nOur intent is to ship all Pledge Rewards and Stretch Goals for this KS project as a single shipping Wave.\nHowever, all extra Add-On items (added individually beyond your Pledge Level/Stretch Goals) will be shipped separately from the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals, and will  likely ship AFTER the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals.\nExtra Add-on items are US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia Friendly. They will be packed and delivered to our distribution centers in the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia (at our expense) and then shipped to individual Backer addresses from within the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia for Backers in those regions.\nShipping and handling charges are not included in the pledge levels. We will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter ends, based on the actual costs to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards (at our cost) to our distribution centers in the US (in Washington State), Australia, UK, Canada, and the EU. Backers will then be responsible for shipping charges from the most appropriate distribution center to your address. \nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package for the Sumo and Shogun Pledge Levels.

First appearing as a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 was released to retail in late 2014 and has been going strong ever since.\nThe game supports 1-6 players, has a standard game time of 2-3 hours, and includes a campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level. You can also visit an Old West Frontier Town between adventures to re-stock and re-supply before setting out on your next mission, and during the game, you can find the swirling portals that the terrifying enemies are coming from, and you can step through those gateways to continue your adventures on the other side, in another dimension or alien world. The map tiles are all double-sided, with the Old West Mines on one side and an alien environment on the other side.\nOne of the main features of Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 is that all of the players work together against the game itself, and that everything is card-based and dynamically generated as you play (the encounters, enemies, board layout, etc.), meaning that the game never plays the same way twice.\nFlying Frog Productions\nFlying Frog Productions, LLC is a premier traditional game company that focuses on fun, theme-heavy, story driven board games. Their first game, Last Night on Earth\u2122, made a big splash when it launched in 2007, and since then they have released many more games such as A Touch of Evil\u2122, Fortune and Glory\u2122, and Shadows of Brimstone\u2122, as well as dozens of expansions to provide continued support for all of their game lines. You can find more information about Flying Frog Productions at www.flyingfrog.net, flyingfrogwiki.com, as well as their pages on Facebook, Twitter, and www.BoardGameGeek.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an established game company, Flying Frog Productions has been making high quality, thematic, fun games for nearly ten years! We launched our first Kickstarter Campaign in October of 2013 for the original Shadows of Brimstone, and have been through the process, working out the pipeline and navigating the hurdles. That project was enormous, with many moving parts, and logistical challenges. We have learned many lessons from that experience that will go into making this new Kickstarter project even better! The success of the first Kickstarter campaign allowed us to hire additional staff in our studio and find new manufacturing contacts who can produce higher quality miniatures and components.\n\nMiniatures \u2013 We have been producing HIPS hard plastic, multi-part figures for over 3 years now, working with several factories to refine the pipeline and process. The results are figures that keep getting better and better detail and quality, both in the tooling of the molds and the sculpting of the figures. The miniatures in Forbidden Fortress are some of our absolute best to date, and we are very excited for backers to see the level of detail on these figures.\n\nDelivery Timeline \u2013 \"Is March 2018 a realistic Delivery timeframe for this project?\"\nYes. By going through the (admittedly long) process of the first Shadows of Brimstone KS, we developed the pipeline and the tools needed to complete a project like this. Most of the rules and systems for the game are already in place, and this project is all about adding a lot of fun new content that builds on the established Game Engine.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to giving this project a faster delivery time than the original Shadows of Brimstone KS:\n- The Pledge Levels are streamlined to give only 2 variations on Rewards to be delivered, Sumo Level and Shogun Level boxes.\n- Pledge Rewards will be packed and shipped from China directly to our distribution facilities around the world in the US, Australia, Canada, UK, and EU.\n- Extra Add-ons added beyond the Pledge Rewards and Stretch Goals will be packed separately on a per backer basis. Extra Add-Ons will be shipped separately using EU, US, Canada, UK, and Australia Friendly shipping to allow backers to add extra items without slowing down the main project delivery timeline.\n- The project has been scoped to better fit the production window and estimated delivery of March 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Lotus Level", "descp": "You get an exclusive Forbidden Fortress Art Print signed by the Flying Frog Team. ***This will ship from the USA***\nINCLUDES:\nSigned Forbidden Fortress Art Print", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Sumo Level", "descp": "You get the Forbidden Fortress Core Set Boardgame, the Kickstarter-Exclusive Sumo Hero Class with Male Sumo Miniature, plus all 'Sumo Level' Stretch Goals unlocked during the Campaign. ***Shipping will be charged after the campaign ends (see Shipping section for details)***\nINCLUDES:\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress Core Set\nKS Exclusive Sumo Hero Class\nSumo Level Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["638 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Map Maker (Sumo) Level", "descp": "You get the Sumo Level plus a location on the Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress Map will be named for you, and you will receive a poster-sized art print of the Map, autographed by the Map Artist and the Creators of the game.

You recruited volunteers, set up demo tables, and built up your booth. Your games are selling like cardboard hotcakes. All is well until you turn around, and your shiny new cash box is gone...\nThis is Steal This Game, based on a true story.\nOn Saturday, 15 October 2016, around 4 pm, our cashier realized that in the 10 seconds it took to look in our warehouse for a game, our cash box was gone.\nFor a small indie board game publisher, this represents a significant loss. Besides the financial hit, this has also affected us on an emotional level.\nGames are fun. Gamers are fun. They are also some of the most welcoming, generous, and trusting people around. For this to happen during the greatest celebration of cardboard & wood in all of boardgamedom is a devastating blow.\nAccording to what venue security told us when we submitted the police report, this is likely the work of professionals. Fellow friendly publishers have indicated that they noticed similar attempts or approaches by individuals that did not seem to know much about the hobby. We hope and assume that this was not done by any gamer.\nTHE GAME\nThe card front (draft)\nThis asymmetric nanogame, playable by two players in five minutes or less, fits on a postcard (with two dice supplied by the players). One player takes on the role of a boardgame publisher at a big convention.\nThe other player is a thief, intent on robbing the publisher's booth \u2014 rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.\nThe card back (draft)\nThe exhibitor tries to keep the cash hidden in one of the four cash boxes. The thief secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves in order to gain more information about the location of the cash.\nIf the exhibitor catches the thief while attempting this, the thief makes one last attempt to steal. If that fails, then the exhibitor wins.\nUPDATE\nNew design (work in progress):\nRULES\nFor more details on the components and rules of Steal This Game, download the rule book here (right click and Save as\u2026).

EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have the base game cost declared as the value of the package (the shipping cost will not be included in the declaration). The postcards are not subject to taxes.\nThe postcard will be sent through regular mail. Tracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over.\nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Hungary, Russia, or South Africa.\nThere is a large number of incredibly talented and even more generous people that we would like to thank.\nFirst among them is David Turczi, who never even said \"of course\" when asked to design this game.

Thanks for your time, hope to have saved yours.*\nSpecial Notes: 3k Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nFull Campaign Details below. \nHello :) Welcome to my Fourth Kickstarter known as \"Meanders\": giant modular boards strewn with wandering paths that fit together with other similar-themed Meander. This Kickstarter is aimed at that special need for terrain between quests. A place for all of the stuff that happens in the beloved - but oft overlooked - mid-way point: shortly after departure from the tavern/spaceport/craft and just before the arrival at the dragon-filled mountain range or Alien Queens acid filled biomass cavern.\nWhat happens between setting off and finally arriving is perhaps the most important aspect of RPG to capture the imagination, for the Journey from Here to There represents endless possibility for stories to evolve, a mystical place for stumbling upon new side-quests, sudden action, the excitement of exploration and the threat of random encounters where anything can happen and often does.\nYet while they are particularly intended for areas after leaving the tavern/spaceship and before reaching the location of major quests - allowing players to wander the wilderness or planetary landscape - they also serve up a number of classic RPG tropes for situating major quests such as: a Desert Shipwreck or Temple Ruins, Woodland Altar or Forest Pond, Alpine Cemetery or Jungle Swingbridge. Each board has a mixture of narrow and wide paths with multiple clearings for hiding treasure chests, trapdoors, entrances to your dungeons or your custom secrets and strategic terrain design for setting up ambushes, wandering monster or NPC encounters and even labyrinths. Need an endless desert? Enchanted forest that won't let them leave? Lost in the snow? Meanders can take care of it for you. \nMeanders provide instant and massive adventure vistas for characters to wander through a variety of classic (and not-so-classic) tropes: from sprawling forest and steaming jungle, miles of snow or near-endless desert - and how big you make the playground is up to you. Simply join another board or boards of the same or different theme to your Meander and it will line up all of the paths, doubling, trebling or quadrupling the size of the Meander. Create a gigantic sprawling landscape just waiting to be populated with NPC's, monsters, treasure and Meanders provides enough caverns, clearings and paths to lead almost anywhere... \nWhile the majority of my completed pieces are Fantasy based - I am creating terrain for the Sci-fi RPGer's with plans for a gigantic Space Hulk, Deep Space, Planet Surfaces and Geiger-esque terrain suitable for Tyranids, Alien, Space Marines, Chthulu, and whatever else we can think of.\nMeanders are beautifully and carefully illustrated with shadows, lighting, realism and depth: take a look at these artwork samples.\nForest Themed Meanders\n  Jungle Themed Meanders\n  Snow Themed Meanders\n  Desert Themed Meanders\n      Gemstone Caverns Meanders\n  Alien Terrain\n  Chthulian Dimensions\n  1 of 4 Underdark Designs Unlocked @ 3k\nEach Meander measures 27 x 18\" each and is professionally printed on 60pt chipboard covered with matt finish paper on one side and black backing on the other with a dry/wet erasable finish. These are thick, high-quality durable dry/wet erase boards that unfold into a six-fold board or up into a 9\" square observable in the campaign video. This is a similar tried and tested board used for one of my previous Kickstarters for Urban Rooftops (please see below). You can also select various grid or no grid options and up to 4 individual terrain boards per themed-set (with some derivations available via stretch goals).\nMeanders are also designed with identical entrances/exits on each board - plus overlapping foliage - that helps blend the boards together when paired so you can easily enlarge the size of the Meander from a short walk (1-2 boards) to a days ride (4 boards) to an epic sojourn through snow, desert, forest and jungle. (6+ boards) without that harsh clash of contrasts or mis-matching trees. Each board in its own series fits with the others.\nMeanders can theoretically be joined to different terrains in the same series because the paths all occupy identical points: the join is not as neat, but it can be done.\nADDITIONAL OPTIONS\nPlease note: there will be a free option to have Meanders electronically joined to each other for your convenience at the end of the campaign. My computer processing will only allow me to do this with a maximum of four Meanders at a go but I can do it in separate blocks of 2-4 if you choose. I will of course adjust the grid so there is no overlap.  \nPlease also note: For an extra $2 per Meander I offer a service to join and blend terrains into one another more gradually so that you can place Snow by Forest without the overly harsh contrast and obvious join for instance. This is for those of you who enjoy the art but don't necessarily need modular terrain and are quite happy to have the 'four seasons' or don't need to change the terrain around. I.e. if you wanted your Sampler pack joined and you chose four different terrains this would be a good option to go with to have them blend into one another as one giant map and only cost you $16 in total. $8 for the sampler, $8 for the blend.\nFor some Boards, i.e. the Alien or Planetscapes there is an open colour choice so that you can get the planet surface colour you need to suit your games. \nAdvantages of using Meanders over 8x8\", 10x10\" tiles are many:\nInstant Terrain: No more time spent setting up smaller terrain squares: Meanders are huge 27x18\" modular boards designed to flow on to and fit with one another. Why move ten tile squares when you can move one board?\nModifiable Size: Meanders can be folded in such a way to provide 18x9\", 18x18\", or the full 27x18\" terrain template. (please see campaign video.)\nVariation: By mix and matching Meanders you can achieve a range of different terrain arrangements within a single theme simply by moving the boards around one another OR pair them with other terrains to make an entire world.\nTough: Meanders are professionally printed on six-fold boads with a tough wet/dry erase, scuff/oil/liquid resistant coating.\nPortable: Meanders fold down into a compact 9\" for light-weight portability.\nFlexibility: Using 1\" squares, Meanders fit the scale of existing 1\" RPG tiles and boards.\nGrid Options: Choose No Grid, 1\" Grid, Hex Grid or Cross-Hair.\n100% Completed Art: The art for 16 different Meanders, 4 each in Forest, Snow, Desert and Jungle terrain are fully completed. \nDigital/Printed or Both: Get the digital designs, printed boards, or both.\nImprovisation: Effortlessly add a huge Forest, Jungle or Desert to your game for your adventurers to explore, set up camp, be ambushed, for side and escort quests, or stretch out the campaign.\nElement of Surprise: Sit your castle, cave, town, lake or other destination tiles/set-up on the black reverse of a folded board or at the edge of a path of a Meander and let your adventurers work their way through the traps, encounters and adventure towards it.\nJoin and Blend Options: You can have your Meanders joined to one another for absolutely free: with up to 4 Meanders joined into one map AND you can pay a few extra dollars to have your Meanders joined and neatly custom blended into one another to create a nice seamless flow between terrains for just $2 per Meander.\nInexpensive: Get (Edit: 36+) giant 27x18\" Meanders for $25 AUD. No other kickstarter has ever offered this much quality terrain for such an amazing price.\nWant to break down what I'm offering for just $25?\n4 Forest Meanders\n4 Snow Meanders\n4 Desert Meanders\n4 Jungle Meanders\n6 Fantasy City / Castle & Frost Castle Meanders\n4 Alien Terrain Meanders\n2 Autumn Meanders\n2 Nocturnal Meanders\n2 Village and Fields Meanders\n2 Elven Treetop City Meanders\n2 Gemstone Cavern Meanders\n& all those digital goodies are yours if the campaign funds. Go beyond funding and it gets even crazier. And since we did, it has.\nBesides the 36 Core Meanders - Extra themed Meanders to choose from can be unlocked and added to your $25+ pledge just through the project funding: with the potential for even more additional designs to be added through achieving the following Stretch Goals.\n ... And should there be time - whatever else you and I can come up with.\n This is my Fourth Kickstarter on the back of three previously successfully           funded campaigns bringing creative innovations to life for RPG.\nThank you very much for your support and encouragement - I look forward to bringing these to a table-top near you - and as always please let me know if you have any questions about the campaign.\nKind Regards,\nKris McDermott\n *Skinny Bar concept inspired by August Hahn.\nConcepts in Development:\n An {im} possible Meander.\n  Frost-gravian style ice Castle\n     Alien Terrain Hostile Takeover Biomass\nIn Design but No Art to show yet: Sci-fi Meanders with a massive Space Hulk ...

A quick check into my previous Kickstarter with Deluxe Reversible Rooftop Tiles or Soloman Temple Squares for RPG will indicate rapid delivery and full backer satisfaction with my products as well as full communication the entire campaign through. I work extremely hard to make sure my backers are happy with the products I make and to ensure everyone gets their rewards on or or before time. \n\nIf there are any difficulties backers will immediately be notified and all possible steps taken to remedy them - but it is my experience that my production, manufacture and shipping is a stream-lined operation and backers can expect their rewards on time if not before time. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, concerns about the product or my campaign - I am always here to offer rapid response.

Each set is delivered in a downloadable .stl format via our online distribution partner DriveThruRPG.com, and once you have the set, you can print as many pieces as you like and never run out or need to purchase more.

A really nice starter printer that can print these files starts around $390 (see our F.A.Q. for more info on printers, printing costs, filaments, and more.)\nEven if you don't currently own a 3D printer, it benefits you to support this campaign now.

We have had tons of new ideas, and many of you have too, from the many requests that we've received. \nThe goal of this Kickstarter project is to create quite a few brand new deluxe Character Meeples, some for use in particular games (Codenames, Colt Express, Near and Far, Stone Age, Imperial Settlers, Aquasphere, Champions of Midgard, Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert, Targi, and more), and others for use in any game you love - simply because they are awesome!\nWe are proud to offer flat rate shipping for all backers. This means you can add-on your favorite sets (and individuals) without affecting your shipping amount - no limit!\n               A mock-up of the Codenames meeples in action!\n  Perfect for Champions of Midgard!\n    All pledge levels can also be an add-on! That means that if you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level and add the amount of the additional set(s). It's that easy!\n  We don't want anything to stand between you and some really fantastic Character Meeples. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your meeples). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is fairly inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \n    Chris and Cynthia Landon are the siblings that own and operate Meeple Source. Andrea is the fantastic artist behind all of these new Character Meeples, and the overwhelming majority of our Character Meeples and upgraded resource bits to date. Karen and Erika are an incredibly important part of our quality control, packaging, and shipping team. \nLocated in Orlando, FL, we are a small family business that takes great pride in superb product quality and excellent customer service!\n  We have already created an enormous number of cool game pieces and accessories, so feel free to browse some of that past work on MeepleSource.com.\nImperial Settlers\n  Orl\u00e9ans\n         Puerto Rico\n  Since we have way too many to show off here, use these category links to see more...\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for five years now. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 7 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. As a result, in combination with the enormous number of custom product combinations that we allow in our Kickstarter projects, shipping takes a good deal of time. To help with this, we have created some handy packages in this project, including themed sets and mixed packs of unique characters, that are designed to speed up fulfillment.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you may know that a couple of our projects experienced minor delays, and that we were always straight-forward with regard to that. A distinct possibility for delay lies in the painting of the meeples. Although every individual meeple is hand-sorted for quality control, by us personally, there are times that errors in screen printing require that we re-make the entire batch of pieces for that particular Character Meeple. If this occurs, it will take a minimum of 8-10 weeks to replace them, which could delay shipping. For example, if this were to occur only a month before shipping would otherwise commence, some pledges would deliver after the estimated delivery date. Although we believe that we have allotted plenty of time for situations such as this, it should be noted that project delays are still a possibility. \n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality.

The game gained a lot of popularity, and got high average rating on BGG. We are proud to have the most dedicated supporters and here we want to thank everyone of them for their enthusiasm and effort to help us in our journey. And after the first challenge is completed, we are ready for the next adventure. \nWe are happy to announce our first BIG! Expansion for Battalia the Creation. Here you will have the opportunity to get your copy of Battalia: The Stormgates, Crowdfunding Edition (CEdition). For newcomers in our universe there is a second chance to lay hands on the base game Battalia: The Creation, Crowdfunding edition or directly on a big combo package including both of them :) .\n  Important note: NO RETAIL version of the Stormgates CEdition expansion box is scheduled for next year and in our general plans. For now we prefer to work only for the Kickstarter community due to many meaningful reasons and the only one not to call the whole box officially Kickstarter exclusive is that we will distribute some minor quantities of games to some loyal retailers due to the round up needed to produce a reasonable number of this edition in the planned print run. Those will be only insignificant numbers and for sure it will be very unlikely to distribute them overseas due to some logistic and other issues.\nREAL SHOT 1 - BASIC 4 PLAYER GAME\n  REAL SHOT 2 - COMMON CARD POOL AND SUN ORACLE\n  REAL SHOT 3 - LARGE MINIATURES FROM THE BASIC SET\n  REAL SHOT 4 - THE PAINTED VERSION (delivered unpainted)\n  REAL SHOT 5 - PAINTED MINIS IN ACTION\n  REAL SHOT 6 - COLORFUL IDEAS FOR YOUR IMAGINATION\n  The game concept\nBATTALIA: The Creation is a medium weight strategy game for 2-4 players, ages 13 and up. It combines the mechanics of map construction, deck building, hero and area control and neat calendar mechanics. \nIn this game of creation and conquest the players will send their heroes on an epic journey to explore new territories and take control over neutral or enemy cities. They will hire battle units, and acquire useful artefacts, with the greater goal to create mighty nations and unbeatable armies. Every player will construct roads to gain access to new map areas and will build or upgrade cities, in order to expand his domain and to earn victory points. Battalia: The Creation can be won through intensive development and growth of your own city system, or through aggressive play of war and conquer, capturing opponents settlements.\nBase Game Features:  \nLanguage independent  \nBasic game mode  \nAdvanced game mode for experienced players   \nAlternative game scenario - The Bleading horn of destiny.  \nModular map, built during the game   \nHighly detailed big scale miniatures   \nUnique calendar mechanics   \nUnique cards purchase mechanics\nThe game rules are available in 15 languages.

This allows us to charge more individual and fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.\n\nBased on our previous experience with direct shipping, we've decided to have a different approach this time. We are working on building up of two shipping hubs at least in the US and Europe (calculated on the base of our previous campaign). Depending on the number of backers an Asia and Australia hubs are in consideration. For all overseas and faraway countries with lower number of backers we will deliver directly per courier. Exact calculations are possible after campaign ends.\nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping for your convenience* :\nSTORMGATES Pledge \nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15 \n BG: free pick up or $3 \n Rest of the World : $15-$20\nCREATION Pledge:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15  \n BG: free pick up or $3  \n Rest of the World : $15-$20\nCOMBO Pledge:\nUS & CA : $20-$25 / EU : $15 -$20  \nBG: free pick up or $5  \nRest of the World : $25-$30\nALL COHORT Pledges\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25 \n BG: free pick up or $8 \n Rest of the World : $60-$90\nADD-ONS\nAll destinations fixed: $1 - flat rate per unit!\nPlease note that the shipping may vary from the numbers above and cannot be fixed yet as a final price, because of the unknown number of unlocked Stretch goals.\nAll calculations are based on volumetric weight for the different pledges. These are just estimates - costs may slightly rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals.  \nAdd-ons are subject to different treatment on our campaign, compared to pledges and stretch goals. We've decided to make it more user friendly and convenient for you and charge just $1 per unit. This flat rate system allows us to set up easier our pledge manager system and is more comfortable for you to calculate. Just add +$1 per unit later through the pledge manager.\nIf you add extra games to your pledge the $1 shipping cost does not apply. The game box is big and heavy (about 2.5 kg each) so in this case we need to charge for than $1. One extra game box is not going to double the cost of the shipping, but it is going to increase the shipping cost by some percentage. The increase will be different according to your location and will depend on the number of unlocked stretch goals.\nPlease add NO SHIPPING COSTS NOW, no matter if for pledges or for add-ons!

But just take a look at our first campaign and the feedback after it and after delivery... I would say that nobody could complain about what we've shipped as a final product. Despites some small delivery difficulties in the horror \"just before Christmas period of the year\", everything else went well and on time. All backers received their products in less than 6 months after campaign's end. The game itself was produced in Germany covering highest manufacturing standards and the quality of all miniatures and materials is just awesome. \nAbout the gameplay you can read all over the internet, but here a short list with reviews and other worthy stuff on our home page: http://battalia.eu/reviews/ - it speaks for itself. \nI would add only that our average BGG rating for the basic game is about 8.0 (or more) since the beginning...\n\nOn one hand we are just a small company and this is our second Kickstarter project, but on the other we have been publishing board games for the past six years now. We are cooperating with more than 30 famous publishers like FFG, KOSMOS, Hans im Glueck, AMIGO, IELLO and others. During this time we have published Bulgarian localized editions of many worldwide popular board games such as \u201cGame Of Thrones: The Board Game\u201d, \u201cSid Meier\u2019s Civilization\u201d, \u201cThe Legends Of Andor\u201d, \u201cUbongo\u201d, \u201cCarcassonne\u201d, \u201cWizard\u201d, \u201cAtlantis\u201d, \u201c King Of Tokyo\u201d, etc\u2026 This means a lot of EXPERIENCE on our end! Our production sites are located mainly in Germany, US and China, so international logistics are not an obstacle for us and meanwhile we know very well how to play the \u201cbig game\u201d called PUBLISHING. \nPlease note: the estimated delivery date is June 2017, but please keep in mind that this is only an informed guess. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We will do our best to minimize this as much as possible, but if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all, we are always ready to refund pledges in full. \nOf course, there are risks with every project, but we hope that our track record in publishing and our commitment to do everything as good as possible will gain your trust in us.\nProduction shipping or customs delays are always possible, but since our game is 90% complete, a small delay is probably the worst thing that could occur on this project. The most sophisticated part of our project is probably the production of the Battalia heroes and NPCs. Yes, exactly \u2013 these large and beautiful, but really complicated for production figurines. They are expensive, the process takes a lot of time and commitment, but the result is really worth the effort. To ensure a smooth and accurate production and delivery, we are cooperating with an old partner who is among the best production factories in Germany - a renown specialist in the board game field with really high quality standards for everything they produce \u2013 miniatures, game material, game board, boxes and so on\u2026. They produce also for CMoN and many other renown publishers. This should put everyone's minds at ease, regarding quality and delivery schedule! \nWe have no reason to expect that something could go terribly wrong, but in case that this happens, please check our refund policy.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, charges included, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. After this period a refund without any explanation is still possible, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and Stripe payment processing fees (as we will not be refunded by them after this 60 day period). \nHowever, once we\u2019ve begun packaging and preparing your rewards for shipment (usually 8 weeks before the actual shipping date), refunds are no longer possible. This means that we will reject any refunds after end of March 2017. \nImportant: If a game or component cannot be delivered at all (which is very unlikely), at your wish we will refund you the full amount, including fees, or we will try to work with you per e-mail and find a satisfactory solution for your individual case. \nPlease note: All refunds requested during the original 60 day period are returned to your credit card via Stripe. Refunds requested after this period will be processed via PayPal only!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "STORMGATES Pledge", "descp": "BIG!Expansion / Retail Value - $50\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15\nBG: free pick up or $3\nRest of the World : $15-$20\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["189 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Early CREATION Pledge", "descp": "**** Happy 48 Hour Special ****\nBasic Game - CEdition / Retail Value - $70\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15\nBG: free pick up or $3\nRest of the World : $15-$20\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18 backers", "Limited (2 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "CREATION Pledge", "descp": "Basic Game - CEdition / Retail Value - $70\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15\nBG: free pick up or $3\nRest of the World : $15-$20\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "COMBO Pledge:", "descp": "Basic Game + BIG!Expansion - CEditions /\nRetail Value - $120\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $20-$25 / EU : $15 -$20\nBG: free pick up or $5\nRest of the World : $25-$30\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\nBATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["448 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 240 or more", "title": "NEW COHORT Pledge", "descp": "6 BIG!Expansions / Retail Value - $300\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25\nBG: free pick up or $8\nRest of the World : $60-$90\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n6\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 300 or more", "title": "MIX COHORT Pledge", "descp": "3 Basic games + 3 BIG!Expansions /\nRetail Value - $360\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25\nBG: free pick up or $8\nRest of the World : $60-$90\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n3\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n3\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals!\n3\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 360 or more", "title": "OLD COHORT Pledge", "descp": "6 Basic Games - CEdition / Retail Value - $420\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25\nBG: free pick up or $8\nRest of the World : $60-$90\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n6\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "SMUGGLER Pledge", "descp": "!

The game features traditional turn-based combat with a little bit of spice but will primarily focus on the story and how you change it. This will be done through the ESSENCE SYSTEM, which will track a player's personality and morality. After a glitch appears in the world of SOREN, our unexpected hero, Gus, will become aware of you- the player. Experience fourth wall breaking shenanigans while making decisions that will shape this world. \nWe are funded!\nThanks to all of our backers! GLITCHED is now funded and will begin development as soon as the Kickstarter is over! \nIf you cannot back through Kickstarter, use our Paypal to pre-order GLITCHED. You'll be able to pre-order GLITCHED for $10 and have the option for a few of our backer rewards as well. This will go down once our Kickstarter campaign is over! But be aware that any money given via Paypal will not reflect on the Kickstarter page total.\nIf you haven't backed us yet, check out our stretch goals to help add content to GLITCHED! \n   GLITCHED is being developed by En House Studios, a Chicago-based game dev team. Instead of wasting your time reading this introduction paragraph, you could be playing a demo of GLITCHED now.\n(Like right now.)\n     NOTE: This is a demo prototype of the game. It reflects an early development cycle and you can expect changes and improvements to a final version. This version will have some bugs which we will work to fix as soon as possible. We recommend 2 GB of free ram in order to run GLITCHED. A Linux version will be available for the final release only, sorry!\n  The small town of BETWIXT sits far removed from the events of the rest of the world and has always been home to GUS, our unlikely hero. \nThings remained ever constant until one day his best friend, CONRAD, told him he was going to leave for strange reasons.\nOn the night before CONRAD departs, an unexplained phenomenon, the glitch, seemingly erases his existence from the world. After coming face to face with the glitch, GUS is able to interact and speak to you- the player of GLITCHED. The traumatic event of suddenly losing his friend significantly affects GUS, but luckily you\u2019ll be there to guide him through.\nTogether, you and GUS will explore the world of SOREN and discover the truth behind it all. Each choice you make might influence who decides to be your friend or foe   \nYou\u2019ll travel from crowded cities to ancient kingdoms. Remnants and tales of the past will lead you to the answers of the present.\nYou're bound to meet plenty of strange characters on your journey. Some will be friends and other foes- perhaps that choice is left up to you.\n  At its core, GLITCHED is a story driven RPG where the player is constantly making decisions that have an impact of the world of SOREN. \nIn GLITCHED, the ESSENCE SYSTEM will track a player's choices and shape their personality and morality. This system will give each player a unique experience. \nBy exploring the world in your own way, you\u2019ll generate points towards six different ESSENCE alignments. \nThese alignments serve as personality types which will impact characters, story and the world around you. Your interaction with NPCs, how you explore the environment, combat, and even your conversations with GUS will determine your ESSENCE.   \nEach ESSENCE focuses on certain character traits and ideologies. No ESSENCE is good or evil, but instead explains the reasons behind your actions. Through meeting and talking to different NPCs, you\u2019ll get a better idea of what each ESSENCE is about. \n  GLITCHED uses traditional turn based combat with a few twists:\nThere is no leveling or random monster encounters.\nAll combat is story based and players will be making choices that may or may not lead to a brawl.\nLeveling up and experience are also removed. \nPlayers will have to use different party members and equipment in order to change how they approach each battle.\nDeciding to kill, spare, or find another way to stop a fight will all lead to different story outcomes.\nActions in battle are limited to three types: Fighting, Interacting, & Goodies. When enemies cannot fight anymore you'll be able to choose to kill or spare them which will alter the story. \nYou might also choose to interact with your enemy to resolve the conflict in a different way . Lastly, you'll be able to use items in battle to bring about various effects.\nCheck out our stretch goals section to see possible additions to the features of GLITCHED. There are plenty of things to be added, but prioritizing main game play features in the demo means smaller additions did not find their way in.\n  The soundtrack for GLITCHED features music composed by our very own Justin Hilton. Our friend Stijn Van Wakeren also composed a few songs and produced all of the tracks for the demo. Check out more of his work here. Visit the GLITCHED Soundcloud for more tracks here or check out the Band Camp to purchase some of the songs here.\n                                                               Forget Me Not\n                                                                  Kinda Lost\n                                                            Slick Like Green Skin\n                                                     Composed by Stijn Van Wakeren\n                                                                  Safe & Sound\n                                   We kept backer rewards as simple as possible. Each tier includes all previous rewards. The early bird special includes the full game, the soundtrack, and the dev book for $10 but is only for the first 75 backers.\n                                          \u22c6 STRETCH GOALS \u22c6\n  Customize a hub town! You\u2019ll be able to pick and choose the layout, buildings, and residents. A quiet (or noisy) place for you and your friends to kick back.\nBebo's are our lovable flightless birds. As a species, they are quite infatuated with Gus. As you traverse the world, you\u2019ll run into all different sorts of them. As any good RPG would have you do: it\u2019s time to collect them all.\nPut your number crunching to the test against a series of turn based combat trials. You\u2019ll be able to build an arcade in your hub town which will include boss rush modes, new game play, and more.\nOur pixel portraits for each character could use a little love, and with this stretch goal you\u2019ll get two upgrades for the price of one. First, each character will get a nice little talking animation to go along with their speech. Second, each character will get a full sheet of emotions to help bring conversations to life just a bit more. \nLet\u2019s get those enemy sprites movin\u2019 and groovin\u2019. With this stretch goal we\u2019ll add enemy animations along with some animation to the character cards for your allies. Making the battles just a bit more lively might help during some of those longer encounters.\nThis stretch goal will encompass quite a lot of content. We can\u2019t give away too many details about additions to the game, but you can expect more hours of game play at this stretch goal. This will add things like new places to explore, new quests and characters, new equipment, and more branching stories. At this funding level, we\u2019ll be able to create our \u2018dream game\u2019 without leaving content out that we really wished to see in the full release.\nGLITCHED already has tons of replay-ability with the Essence System, but with New Game+ you will challenge tougher enemies, uncover hidden secrets, and more to reward players who want to experience everything. More details will come once it's unlocked! \nThe friendship system will allow your party members to interact with one another. They will gain points being in the party together and learn tag skills in battle. More character backstory and cool skills await with the friendship system!\nNew quests and characters come along with the day and night system. You'll be able to wait or use an inn to cycle the time of day. Different quests and characters will be available during different parts of the day. More secrets and complex quests!\nPlay GLITCHED on PS Vita! All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nPlay GLITCHED on PS3 and PS4!

All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nWith this stretch goal, all backers will receive free additional content after release.

All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on. \nEn House Studios is a Chicago based game dev team. While the team is small, we are completely dedicated to this project. Through the demo, we hope to showcase our ability to fully develop GLITCHED. En House Studios LLC is an established limited liability company. \nAll funds earned through Kickstarter will be put directly into the company and go towards the development of GLITCHED. Funding allocation can be seen below in the money section.\nTUMBLR | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | RPGMaker.net | Itch.io | Press Kit | Steam GREENLIGHT\n    ZACK - Programmer  |  JUSTIN - Composer & Designer | NIKKO - Lead Designer & Artist \nOur friends:\nAnthony Luna (Enemy/Faces Pixel Art) \nStijn Van Wakeren (Soundtrack Production) \nLou H.\nIf you have any questions, get in contact with us through Kickstarter or social media. We\u2019ll make a video of us answering questions we get!\n  Let\u2019s talk cash. The reason we are here on Kickstarter is because we need more than our personal funds to fully develop GLITCHED. Above, you\u2019ll see the breakdown plan of our spending. A sizable chunk will go to backer rewards. Our development costs can be seen by adding art, soundtrack, licensing, and graphic design together. These all add up to fifty percent of the total. Art will go towards paying our pixel artists and promotional artists. Soundtrack will go towards producing our compositions. Kickstarter fees and taxes will take about ten percent. What\u2019s left will be spent on promotion which gets us to our full budget.   \nThis budget changes in the event that we earn more than our asking amount. We\u2019ll update this little pie chart if that does happen to keep you informed on where your money will be going. We wish to be transparent on how we will use these funds and will answer ANY possible question you have about spending. We take development costs very seriously and believe open communication is important to crowdfunding.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter is a risk. What we have tried to do is showcase not only our serious dedication to the project, but also that we have the skills, means, and environment to develop GLITCHED. We hope that our Kickstarter and demo has provided you enough confidence to consider backing us.\n\nWith that said, game development has its risks. There are everyday risks such as health, family, and life issues that might happen to anyone. Development risks are where most problems arise. For us, this means extended deadlines, delayed development, or the feared \"running out of funds.\" We have taken a look at the necessities for GLITCHED and have carefully based our budget around that. With more money behind the project comes more security, content, and quality. Our main goal is to deliver GLITCHED. We have estimated a release date of February 2018 but the stated risks could possibly change that.\n\nWe have laid out our case in this Kickstarter. We have the ability to produce GLITCHED and our demo shows a taste of what the final product will look like. We hope you understand the risks that might happen down the road but also take a look at what we have done to earn your trust in us. We believe greatly in transparency and there will be nothing that happens in development which we don't relay to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "Our thanks & a tiny place in our hearts.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Full Game", "descp": "Digital download of GLITCHED upon release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["1,841 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Soundtrack", "descp": "Digital download of the soundtrack for GLITCHED.

There is a huge world to explore here! \nWhen playing campaign mode, all stories are linked to a location on the map. You'll see something intriguing on the map, travel to that location, and read a story to find out what is there.\nIf you play story mode, you pick one character and play through a focused, connected story line over 4+ games. Early choices you make affect later outcomes in the story! Each character features multiple story paths and endings.\n    Retail Version: The standard retail version of Near and Far will have an MSRP of $59.99.

Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games.

So it's fresh and new to our world of open creativity. The creator of Peter Pan, J M Barrie also inspired us. When he passed away in 1929, he gave all the rights to Peter Pan to Great Ormond Street Hospital in the UK. GOSH (Great Ormond Street Hospital) grew and survived in part by the funds Peter Pan's play and book rights brought in for decades. As such, team Lynnvander is donating 5% of this Kickstarter (post fees) to GOSH!\n  Having a legacy doesn't mean having to grow up! Travel to Neverland with Peter Pan and his allies in the third epic installment in the Legacy series! Neverland's Legacy is set in the same universe as Albion's Legacy and Sherwood's Legacy but is a totally stand-alone game that doesn't require the other Legacy games to play.\nIn this strategic, dice-rolling skirmish game, you help either Peter Pan and his allies or Captain Hook and his crew to assault their rivals on Hook's pirate ship or in the lost boys' camp respectively. At the start of the game, you'll choose which faction to play as and then set up the appropriate location to attack. Whether you're playing as Peter and his allies or Hook and his crew, you'll then assault your foes' base of operations, drawing cards to search every nook and cranny for lost boys, fairies, and pirate treasure, while positioning yourselves around the board to bypass or fight off your enemies. As your foes cause you to fall into despair, you are forced to roll Stones of Chance instead of choosing your actions, making it more difficult to take optimal turns.\nAs Peter and his allies, the game is won when you rescue all of the lost boys aboard Hook's ship. As Captain Hook and his crew, the game is won when you capture all of the lost boys hiding in their camp. In either case, the game is lost when your foes defeat enough of your characters! Neverland's Legacy is an immersive, highly thematic game that carries on the Legacy series's focus on super challenging co-op games.\n  This game includes!\n  You can read a preview version of the rulebook at the following link:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/g6xmabugh0woz25/NeverlandsRulebook_KSpreview1.pdf?dl=0\nAlbion's Legacy Rules PDF - https://www.dropbox.com/s/6g7y7u94afngjyq/Albions%20Rules%20V2.pdf?dl=0\nSherwood's Legacy Rough Rules PDF - https://www.dropbox.com/s/qx7bjc8b5w5rdep/SherwoodsRules.pdf?dl=0\n Here's a few rounds of each game for you to compare\nNeverland's Legacy Play Through\nAlbion's Legacy Play Through\nSherwood's Legacy Play Through\n  To add to your Neverland experience we've created a Kickstarter exclusive expansion.

Below are a few titles you can expect to see in the coming 2016 and 2017 Lynnvander/Jasco release year. We'll take you from Feudal Japan all the way to the depths of Atlantis, whether riding a Chandelier as a Musketeer or sizing a French Castle as Joan of Arc, there will be something for everyone.\nFuture developed Legacy games\nEach Kickstarter will focus on the newest family member to the Legacy series, however, we will always open up exclusive content for previous Legacy games. This content will only be available through Kickstarter. Below are our first two Legacy games. \nAlbion's Legacy - Our first Legacy game! \nAlbion's Legacy is a a fully cooperative modular-adventure game for 1-4 players (expandable to 6).  In Albion's Legacy, King Arthur and his allies explore Albion in search of specific Realms, while trying to collect enough Quest Coins to win the game! As the Realms are explored, various Enemies will stand in the way, and must be Challenged by rolling the Stones of Chance! Meanwhile, Despair threatens the land! If the Flames of Hope are extinguished, or all Virtue is lost, the kingdom falls!

These avatars work perfectly with your Kickstarter Profiles. \n    Lynnvander Studios is a Southern Ontario based game design company focusing on the creation of board games from concept to deliverable files. Our work for major publishers in the industry includes the design of Buffy the Vampire Slayer: the Board Game, and Galaxy Quest: the Board Game.\nWe use Kickstarter because we love the community that's formed around our past campaigns and because, with your help, we can make games that we never would have been able to manufacture on our own, and we can make games that are bigger and better than would have been possible without your support. With that in mind, we've got an aggressive Kickstarter lineup planned for the coming year so get ready for a whole lot of new games!\nThe Legacy line is exclusively published and distributed through our amazing partners at Jasco Games.\n  Many companies use Kickstarter as a sort of preorder system for moving finished products - that\u2019s not us. We\u2019re a small team of 6 game designers, most of which are part time. We\u2019d like for most of our team to be full time but we\u2019re still building up to that and making our place in the industry. We\u2019ve been very lucky to build relationships with other companies that have allowed us to work on big licensed properties but our original properties are still a passion for us. That\u2019s why we\u2019re forging ahead with our line of Legacy games. With your support, we were able to manufacture Albion\u2019s Legacy, send it out to tons of backers, and bring it to retail. You\u2019ve also allowed us to create Sherwood\u2019s Legacy and Deep 5 which are in manufacturing now.\nAs you may know, we were appalled by the production issues and poor quality of the 1st edition of Albion\u2019s Legacy and, with your support, we were able to reprint Albion\u2019s Legacy through a new manufacturer, and send an improved copy of the game to all of our original backers for free. Despite tons of amazing backers helping to cover the costs of the 2nd edition of Albion\u2019s Legacy through our micro-kickstarter, this created a huge financial expense for us that we\u2019re still recovering from as a company. That\u2019s a very real reason why Kickstarter is still crucial for us to create new games. Plus, we love bringing the Legacy series to Kickstarter, and interacting with all of you along the way. With your help, we're going to make Neverland's Legacy way more awesome than we could have on our own.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign, based on the actual cost to ship your pledge reward to your location. We will not charge any handling fees above the actual cost to ship your game.\nThrough our strategic partnerships, we have arranged fulfillment options in multiple countries, significantly reducing your shipping costs. We will be shipping from locations in the United States, Canada, and the UK, saving you the cost of customs and VAT fees.\nPlease Note* Shipping to Military bases can be costly. Message us for details.\nSince Albion's Legacy has already been funded and fulfilled once, your copy will ship within 2-4 weeks of this campaign ending. You'll have the option to hold your game and wait for Neverland's OR ship it immediately. Sherwood's Legacy is still in manufacturing stages and is set to ship by the end of the summer. You may also elect to ship Sherwood's sooner or not.\nAll mini's and bonus content will released at the same time as Neverland's Legacy with exception to GripMats which in the case of Albion's and Sherwood's, may ship immediately.\nPlease Note* We open to any shipping options you can work out with us. We want to get these products in your hands as quickly and least expensive as possible. Contact us with any inquiry and we'll respond asap.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've come a long way and have learned a lot about Kickstarter and game manufacturing in general but challenges still come up.\n\nOur first game, Albion's Legacy, was a good game but very poorly manufactured. In response to the poor quality of our first product, we've reprinted the game and given the reprint to our original backers for free. While this commitment to quality is important to us, it's caused significant delays and pushed fulfillment of our other games back. With a better understanding of the industry, and the help of a great manufacturer, Deep 5, and Sherwood's Legacy are well on their way to being fulfilled. With nothing left for us to do but wait for manufacturing to be concluded, and ship out the remaining games, it's time for our team to get back to what we're best at: making new games.\n\nWe're confident that this campaign will be a smooth process but delays can happen. Sometimes the art takes longer to complete than we'd expected. Others, shipping or customs hit us with surprise delays. Whatever happens, we'll communicate with you honestly and openly and do everything that we can to provide you with a high quality game.\n\nRisks of workload, shipping, customs, art delays etc. But promises on making this game a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "KENSINGTON KID", "descp": "Thanks for your support!

Thank you very much!!!\nThe late pledging via PayPal will be open until the end of summer 2016.

You may also send us an e-mail to moroz@morozpublishing.com\nIn a few months after the campaign all these awesome towers will become available at the Rightgames online store. Please note that shipping will cost more as we cover 1/2 shipping expenses during the campaign, and there will be no Kickstarter exclusive First Player tokens and additional free dice bags (of course!).\nLET THE DICE ROLL!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLoad dice, then push down on the stylish lever. BANG! Random results guaranteed, along with a privilege to use dice towers that you won\u2019t find anywhere else!\nWe are proud to present the Orc Totem and the White Castle \u2014 dice towers with a rotating platform. Unlike ordinary towers, you don\u2019t throw your dice inside. Rather, you place them on a special platform, and let them loose with a special lever.\nIn addition, we\u2019ve created MDT-7 \u2014 a compact collapsible dice tower. This one easily fits in your bag and takes just a few seconds to fold out!\nDice towers come with awesome First Player tokens, created specifically for this Kickstarter campaign! Each of the three tokens accompanies its own dice tower.\nThe approximate value of each of these First Player tokens is $6. They won\u2019t be available for separate sale.\nHere is the deal: only now on Kickstarter, you get your First Player token for free with the appropriate tower!\nAnd even more! We give away a red velvet dice bag with each dice tower your purchase. Just for free!\n  The Orc Totem is the original dice tower. Everything started with it. We exhibited it at Essen last year, and were surprised with unbelievable feedback we got. A dozen test copies that we brought to Essen vanished before the end of the first day. It was incredible!  \nMany people stopped near our booth just to see how the tower works. It\u2019s really fun to watch! You place dice on top, press on the mushroom, and as the totem orc rolls his eyes fearfully, the dice tumble down. Not for the faint hearted!\nThe turning platform of the Orc Totem works for small and medium dice. You can also throw dice through the mouth of the daemon on the back. This way you can roll even the biggest and the baddest of your dice! A wooden fence keeps the dice from rolling too far.\n  The White Castle is absolutely amazing. First of all, it's huge! When you set it on the table, no matter what board game you play \u2014 everything becomes just... epic!\nThe Castle comes to life when you press the tiny turret on the top. Click! The dice start their thundering journey through the depths of the tower. The Castle\u2019s portcullis is lifted, and a medieval king, a queen, a knight and a minstrel appear in the gothic windows.\nAll our dice towers are covered with gorgeous laser engravings. However the White Castle stands in a league of its own. It is decorated with masonry, winches, hoists, and more. Furthermore, it\u2019s laminated with white plastic. Enough words \u2014 just take a look at this beauty!\n  Now for our little baby. MDT-7 is a collapsible tower that can be folded and unfolded in a few simple moves! Two or three seconds \u2014 and your dice have a place to roll!\nMDT-7 doesn\u2019t have a special dice throwing mechanism, as per the Orc Totem and the White Castle. Rather, MDT-7 is designed for portability. It is perfect for board-game parties when you need a dice tower, but don\u2019t want to be lugging around too much stuff.\nOne more thing. Does the folded MDT-7 remind you of anything? A Warhammer 40k tank, you say? Well, if that\u2019s how it is\u2026 Enemy sighted \u2014 ready the dice! Give \u2018em a round of d6! Load the armor-piercing d20!\nOur towers are all built of HDF \u2014 high-density fiberboard. It\u2019s famed for its strength and durability. If you\u2019re not planning to smash your tower with a hammer, sit on it, incinerate it (which isn\u2019t even all that easy to do!) or any other such nasty things \u2014 the tower will serve you for many years!\nTactilely, HDF is quite pleasant. The surface is smooth and flat. All towers are made with a laser, so the edges are free from burrs.\nAll parts fit each other perfectly. Assembling these towers is a piece of cake. As for gluing, it is not necessary at all. However if you wish to glue all the parts together, most common glues like PVA will be okay.\nRich laser engravings are applied to each of the towers. The towers look amazing as they are! Still, you are free to paint them if you want. Though preferably the Orc Totem and MDT-7, the White Castle has been painstakingly laminated.\nMore about painting in our update.\nThe Orc Totem, White Castle and MDT-7 are shipped in HDF punchboards. This is how it looks:\nYou will need to carefully press out the tower pieces. This procedure is simple and takes only a few minutes.\nEach tower supplied with detailed instructions:\nNote. If you order only the Orc Totem, it will arrive to you without the punchboard. We press out all the pieces for you in advance. This is done in order to reduce the shipping cost. Not all that important, but we prefer to make the things clear!\nIn addition to dice towers, we offer high-quality bags for your dice!\nThere are 2 different sets available: the Black and White set for $18 and the Multicolor set for $24. Each set includes 3 bags with either black-and-white or color pictures. Every picture in each set is dedicated to its own tower!\nThe bags are made from 100% linen. It\u2019s probably the best possible material to store dice and tokens. Such bags are smooth to the touch, well-ventilated, and durable. And they are washable, of course. Pictures won\u2019t wash out!\nCrafting. The picture is printed on the fabric with a special printer. Then it\u2019s finished with a thermal press. Only then the bag is sewed on the mechanical frame. This is not a high-volume manufacturing. This is true piece work!  \nHow to: To purchase bags, press \u2018MANAGE\u2019 on the top of the page, then select \u2018Change your pledge\u2019, add the cost of chosen bag sets in the \u2018PLEDGE AMOUNT\u2019 field and confirm the new amount.\nYou can read about these nice linen dice bags in more detail in this update!\nWe put all our love and expertise into our dice towers. Hence, we have no stretch goals like \"when we collect X money \u2014 we add something to the tower\". All that we wanted to do has already been done.\nHowever, if funding from this campaign exceeds our expectations (which are, by the way, a secret =), we promise to give you something exclusive and very special. We still have a couple of cool ideas, and perhaps you\u2019ll be able to help bring them to life!\nThe first such idea has come to life already. We are happy to add a free red velvet dice bag to every tower you purchase!\nNow every tower comes with a dice bag and an amazing First Player token. These are not stretch goals, but just free presents from us! Our hearty gift to everyone backing us on Kickstarter!\n    The main things you want to know about shipping:\nKnowledge comes with a click! You will see the shipping cost by simply choosing a reward to the right of this page.\nOne for all! The shipping costs are the same, no matter the destination. The only difference is in the type and number of towers you order.\nMore is less! The more towers you order, the cheaper is shipping per tower!\nTax Free! We do not claim \u00abEU Friendly\u00bb and so on, but we are very close to it. In our case, there are no customs taxes for 99% of the known world. More details in FAQ section, at the bottom of this page.\nAt the ready! We will start making and sending towers about a month after the end of the campaign. We hope to ship the last tower in September. Many of you will receive your towers earlier than the estimated delivery date!\nYour choice. You are free to choose any combination of towers and calculate shipping by yourself. Read about it next!\nWe\u2019ve prepared multiple rewards for all the main options: any one of three towers, any two towers, three towers.\nHowever, you are free to choose whatever you like \u2014 for example, two Orc Totems and one MDT-7. This way you\u2019ll have to calculate the total sum yourself, following instructions below. (Or you can cry for help, and we\u2019ll be happy to do it for you!).\nFor custom selection of towers please choose the very first reward level, called \u201cFree choice\u201d.\nNext, calculate shipping costs:\n1. The Orc Totem and MDT-7 are counted as 1 unit. White Castle is counted as 2 units.\n2. Shipping of the first unit costs $8. Add $4 for each additional unit.\nExample #1. You decided to buy a White Castle (2 units) and two MDT-7 (1 unit each). Total: 4 units. Shipping of the first unit is $8. Shipping of the remaining three units is $4 per each. Final shipping: $8 + $4x3 = $20.\nExample #2. You decided to buy three Orc Totems (1 unit each) and two MDT-7 (1 unit each). Total: 5 units. Shipping of the first unit is $8. Shipping of the remaining four units is $4 per each. Final shipping: $8 + $4x4 = $24.\nAdd the costs of your chosen towers (MDT-7 = $14, Orc Totem = $20, White Castle = $35). Add the shipping cost as described above. Pledge your resulting amount, choosing the \u201cFree choice\u201d reward. Done!\nYou can also add up to 10 linen dice bag sets. Adding them does not affect the shipping cost.\nImportant! If you want to get 6 or more towers units, please contact us directly. Maybe we can give you an extra shipping discount!\nWe are based in Russia. Although our trips to Essen Fair give us an opportunity to exhibit dice towers to visitors, it\u2019s not enough.\nWe know how great these towers are! We are delighted with what we\u2019ve created, and our wish is to share them with the world. Kickstarter is the best chance we have to achieve this!\nFedor and Sergey are both involved in Rightgames company. It is one of the oldest in Russia in the board games industry. Fedor takes care of the company\u2019s general service activities, and Sergey is the executive producer and head of production.\nThe dice towers idea was originally born as a fan project. Long evenings spent with the laser cutter, drawings, guesstimates, experiments... In the end, it turned out into something really awesome!\nWe\u2019d like to add that towers project is carried out together with Moroz Publishing. Denis Davydov from Moroz is the one who answers all your comments and messages here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSergey Machin, the main responsible for the production in Rightgames, fears that lasers will attack him at night and burn orcish totemic symbols onto his back. That he won't be able to read, because its very inconvenient to read from your own back. That is what scares him.\n\nFedor Myachin, the creator of Orc Totem tower, worries that people will buy so many towers that he and his team will be cutting wood and packing shipments day and night. But Ivan Tulovskiy, the President of Rightgames, would be rather pleased with that outcome. He loves it when people are working!\n\nSeriously though, we have a lot of experience with laser cutter production. Our towers are crash tested. They were assembled, checked, disassembled, jumped on, hammered, punched, slapped, again assembled and still everything works as it should! We take pride in quality.\n\nRightgames has been producing and shipping board games and accessories for over 10 years. Of course, unforeseen circumstances can always arise.

By us sorting and packing everything in the USA, any shortages will be able to be identified while the coins are still in the factory. If this occurs this time, production of the \"short list\" can begin while the bulk of the coins start their journey on the ocean.

Revenge of the Dictators fulfills the dire need that's inside all of us. Our pick-up-and-playcompetitive boardgame features Dictators in a ratrace for World Domination. Just disarm some Nuclear Facilities, annoy your fellow Dictators like it's the last thing you'll do, confront the President of the U.S.A. and BOOM, rule the world...\nSo why should you fund this game?\nYou just LOVE:\nBeing a dictator\nCut-throating and backstabbing\nLosing your friends\nPlaying games with your non-die-hard gamer friends\nOur artwork as much as we do\nAlthough you might recognize some look-a-likes from real Dictators, we want to make sure you know we're not using any of them! Instead, we're using some lesser known grand leaders like Adolf 'the Hipster', Saddam 'the Sadist', and Kim 'the Young-One'.\nKickstarter Limited Exclusive* bonus\nEvery backer will receive this Kickstarter Limited Exclusive bonus card featuring a well-known favorite American all-time hero. Pure awesomeness!\n*This content will only be available in the first print run.\nStill not satisfied? Check out our American Agent \"Bob\" Expansion\nWith this first expansion, you're able to play with a 6th \"friend\", except this friend will do anything to prevent the Dictators from succeeding. Bob has his own powerful abilities \u00e1nd a special deck of cards, which might force the Dictators to...play cooperatively? That's a dirty word!\nThe American Agent deck consists of several powerful cards only usable by the American Agent. The special agent acquires these cards by discarding Command cards, or visiting some special sites like Area 51 and the CIA HQ. \nThe American Agent can also go undercover, to do so he or she rolls a six-sided die at the start of his or her turn. There is a 50% chance that this will happen after which the American Agent stays \"undercover\" (removing his or her pawn from the board) until a dictator is spotted. Spotting a dictator gives the American Agent certain tactical advantages, for example increasing the DEFCON level. After all, the Amercian Agent wins the game at the end of DEFCON 1.\nHere are some incentives we are offering to all our backers:\n\u20ac10 off MSRP: pay only \u20ac35 instead of \u20ac45. \nGet your name in the Rulebook.\nThe opportunity to help us design extra Command cards.\nWhat about a Dictator card with your likeness? \nGet a Kickstarter Exclusive bonus card!\nAdd the first Expansion pack with a total new gameplay AND at a discounted price of \u20ac12 instead of \u20ac18. That's 33% OFF!\nNote: the \"Funding Father\", \"World Domination\" and \"Don't Push The Big Red Button!\" pledge levels will also include the majestic beard, traditional Hawaiian Lei, sleeves and sticker sheet.\nAdditional Dictators, including our higher pledge level backers, will be added soon.\nThe game is played in turns, with the best dressed up Dictator starting the game. At the start of the game every player receives a unique Passport-card of a Dictator, including a special ability!\nA turn consists of up to 3 of the following actions, in any combination:\nDRAW a card \nPLAY a card \nUse your TRAVEL ACTION (Max. 1)\nTo disarm a Nuclear Facility you first have to make sure you're in the right place. Second, you need to spend your Travel Action and an additional action to attempt the disarming. Finally: roll a 3-6 with a 6-sided die. If your opponents let you, you're now one step further to World Domination. Perhaps you'll even get an awesome wacky bonus?\nIf you reach Washington D.C. you have a chance of confronting the President. At the start of your turn, draw a Presidential card to see if the President is indeed present. Next, roll a 20-sided die and throw a minimal number, depending on how many Nuclear Facilities you disarmed.\nPresidential Card\nAnd really, that's it. At least, if you were playing by yourself. But you shouldn't do that according to mommy. There are 122 unique cards, which makes every game different! Apart from your opponents, the U.S.A. uses some anti-Dictator systems as well: DEFCON and Founding Fathers.\nFor an advanced gameplay run-through download the [concept] rulebook, which will be available in English, German and Dutch (depending on the backers possibly even more).\n                                                                                                We think retailer backers should be able to receive the same Kickstarter extras as other backers. In addition, they should receive their rewards before we release regular games into distribution. If you're an interested retailer, please contact Alina at alina@blackboxadventures.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nIn order to be fair to all backers, we will charge shipping after the Kickstarter based on the actual costs. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends through BACKERKIT. In addition, we are using Backerkit because it allows us to save time and focus on fulfillment so we can make sure you'll get your game in time to conquer the world!\nWe're talking to a few fulfillment partners in order to get the lowest shipping costs possible. We're even driving to some countries to ship directly from there. In addition, we offer you the opportunity to pick up your game at some conventions: Essen SPIEL 2016 (more to follow). The shipping charges below are the maximum charges.\nComrade & Party Member pledge levels:\nGermany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg: \u20ac8 (approx. $8.95)\nRest of Europe: \u20ac12 (approx. $13.40)\nRest of the World: \u20ac20 (approx. $22.35)\nPer extra base game (excluding the expansion, we'll include this one for free!) the shipping costs will increase as follows:\nGermany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg: + \u20ac2 per game (approx. $2.23)\nRest of Europe: + \u20ac7,50 per game (approx. $8.37) \nRest of the World: + \u20ac15 per game (approx. $16.75)\nBlack Box Adventures consists of three passionate tabletop gamers from the Netherlands. We are looking for enthusiastic people that would like to help us fund our first game. The early works on this project started almost 5 years ago and we really are looking forward to sharing Revenge of the Dictators with you. As with all Kickstarter campaigns, without your help and support, Revenge of the Dictators might die a horrible premature death, and thus drain all hope of it giving you tons of fun.\nWhy Kickstarter, and why 20.000?\nWell, first of all there is the minimum manufacturing number of 1.000 pieces. We're working with a very trustworthy high-quality game manufacturer located in our vicinity. We even visited the manufacturer to see for ourselves, as we like to triple-check things. This gives the additional advantage of not needing to send the total package from a foreign producer, thus saving us and you freight shipping costs and time.\nSecond, the stunning artwork and graphic design. Art isn't cheap, especially if you put as much work and effort as Frederick van de Bunt. We chose to integrate both the artwork and the graphic design through one person, in order to have a consistent style and to smoothen out the working process (a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link, and now we only have one link..a really strong one... you know what we mean!).\nLastly of course there is the small cut Kickstarter and our Pledge Manager takes. We're not counting the prototype costs, review packages, final prototype, review fees, final prototype 2.0, marketing and all the time and love we put into making Revenge of the Dictators to what it is now. We are not here to make money: we are here to share our beloved project with the world! Every stretch goal reflects this purpose and is designed to add more content and quality to the base game. Therefore, your support really makes a difference!\nWhether you completely support us and have your own Dictator card, or just like the project, please like us on facebook, have a look at our website, or lurk a bit more at our 1\u20ac pledge level: we appreciate your efforts!\nIf you're still reading this you must really like our project, go and back us!\nBart, Bas and Alina", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is the first game that Black Box Adventures has launched on Kickstarter, we want to put any concerns to rest. While every project has risks, we've done our best to minimize any complications. \n\nAll the designs for the game are close to final with any changes coming from additional backer input and stretch goals. In addition, Revenge of the Dictators has been thoroughly play-tested (over 300 playtesters).\n\nWe received a lot of quotes of multiple manufacturers, both domestically as well as foreign. In our opinion our choice of a local manufacturer offers the best price/quality rate. We have established solid ties to this manufacturer, as we have inspected the facility ourselves. Once the campaign concludes, we can start to get the manufacturing started asap. We were promised by the manufacturer that the game will be ready before Essen SPIEL 2016, however some events may be out of our reach. If for some unforeseen circumstances we won't be able to deliver the product at Essen SPIEL 2016, we have to arrange a pickup at another convention or charge shipping costs.\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. Because the game is produced in the EU, EU-backers won't need to worry about extra customs charges. We're doing our best to reduce shipping costs for backers worldwide. Backerkit will provide us a lot of help in managing all the pledges, so we are able to focus on the fulfillment.\n\nLastly, this Kickstarter also marks the start and future of Black Box Adventures.

The Evolution base game is so vivid and true-to-life that it was recently featured in the world's leading scientific journal, Nature.\nIn Evolution: Climate, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce, predators lurk, and the climate can swing between scorching hot and icy cold. Traits like a Hard Shell and Horns can protect your species from Carnivores while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. Heavy Fur and Migratory can protect your species from the cold while being Nocturnal or Burrowing will provide protection from the cruel desert sun. With over 200,000 ways to evolve your species, every game evolves into a different adventure.\nIf you don't own Evolution, then buy the stand-alone Evolution: CLIMATE ($55 pledge level). It contains everything you need to play Evolution: CLIMATE.  \nIf you already own Evolution, then buy the Evolution: CLIMATE conversion kit ($25 pledge level).  It contains everything you need to transform the base game into Evolution: CLIMATE.\nBelow are links to 3rd-party reviews of Climate prototypes. Some details may be different in the final game. \nGeekDad: \"I can\u2019t say enough how impressed I\u2019ve been with the Evolution game series, and I highly recommend taking a look at Climate.\" Full Review\nSpaceBiff: \"Not only are you competing with other species, but against the land itself. There are new methods for survival, a fresh crop of ways to die, and even more reasons to play it over and over, observing as different combinations of interdependent species, fearsome carnivores, and the climate itself conspire to prevent you from thriving. This is Evolution at its toughest and most rewarding.\" Full Review\nFatherGeek: \"The Climate track introduces a lot more strategy and tactics. I have to think more about what I will add to the Watering Hole, what Trait cards to use, and what situations I need to prepare for.\" Full Review\nClimate features original watercolors by world-renowned nature artist Catherine Hamilton. Catherine taught as a professor at Rhode Island School of Design between 1997 and 2003. She was featured in the 2012 HBO documentary \"Birders: the Central Park Effect\" and has developed a body of work that crosses the boundaries between artistic and scientific investigation.\nNocturnal Critters!\nEpic Volcanoes!\nGiant Beasts!\nDefensive Horns!\nScorching Deserts!\nTerrifying Carnivores!\nFAT TISSUE!!!\nRaging Wildfires!\nWe'll post more art from the game as the campaign progresses. Catherine Hamilton is hard at work at this very moment creating wonderfully beautiful watercolors to help bring this game to life. What's this? It's the middle of the night you say? It doesn't matter! Catherine Hamilton does not sleep.\nEvolution: CLIMATE stand-alone comes with everything you need to play the game. It comes with 48 new CLIMATE trait cards and a modified version of the 129 trait cards from the Evolution base set.  \nTechnical Note for those who care: It is possible (although a little cluncky) to play the Evolution base game using the components from the Climate stand-alone.  Read Update #4 for details.\nThe Evolution: CLIMATE conversion kit comes with everything you need to convert your base set of Evolution into Evolution: CLIMATE.  \n1) Remove Ambush, Burrowing, Defensive Herding, and Carnivore from the trait cards in your base set of Evolution.  \n2) Shuffle the 86 cards from the conversion kit into the remaining base set cards.\n3) Use the Climate Track instead of the Watering Hole. \n This video shows how to play the base game of Evolution: \nEvolution: CLIMATE builds upon the rules of the Evolution base set. The centerpiece of Evolution: CLIMATE is the Climate Track, a 21\" x 9\" Watering Hole that keeps track of the climate and features a dramatic watercolor vista by Catherine Hamilton. Here's a prototype of the Climate Track made from her rough draft concept sketch:\nCLIMATE TRACK PROTOTYPE - Not final art!\nThe climate moves between scorching hot where large animals die from the heat and icy cold where small animals die from the cold. This system is intended to mirror the actual effects of ambient temperature on animals.  Here is a link to the \"surface area-volume ratio effect\" science that is being modeled. Food is abundant when the climate is warm and scarce when it is scorching hot or freezing.\nEvery new trait introduced in CLIMATE helps prevent population loss from the heat or the cold. Species will need these new traits to adapt to extreme climate conditions. In the base set Evolution, species had to adapt to food scarcity and predators. Now there is an additional threat to survival: Mother Nature!   \nAdapting to a Changing Ecosystem!\nThe heart of the Evolution game system is adapting to a continually changing ecosystem. There is no best strategy or best card combination in Evolution: Climate.  \nVideo Overview\nThe  only video overview we have of Climate was done by a German. This will help you understand the new additions that Climate brings to the base Evolution game.\n  Stretch goals marked Kickstarter Exclusive below will be available in limited quantities at northstargames.com after the campaign is over and rewards have shipped. \nAmong them, you'll see Oversized Scenario Cards. These are 70x120mm cards, illustrated by the fabulous artist Anna Kryczkowska, each of which changes a fundamental aspect of the game.\nTo use them, players pick a scenario card before the game begins and the rule described on it will apply through the entire game. Example: the Cretaceous Period card specifies each species can have an unlimited number of traits. \nFor all levels that involve shipment of physical games, backers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge (all copies should be the same game; no mixing pledge levels). To add games beyond the first, manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge. \nAll pledges must be complete by March 22nd at 11:59 pm EST.

Shipping is EU friendly and won't incur VAT/import duties, nor for US, Canada, and Australia. You may incur duties in other countries, but only if there's more than one game in your order. \nWe subsidize shipping for every backer, so the shipping cost for each backer is $10 cheaper than it would otherwise be. \nNote: after the campaign is over, we'll send you a survey to get your shipping information. Backers who haven't filled theirs out by May 20 will be charged an extra $15 shipping, because shipping late individual rewards is much more expensive than the bulk shipping we do for those who fill out their surveys on time. \nWe're running an awesome promotion for Evolution 2nd Edition and the Climate Conversion Kit through our U.S. and Canadian distributors during this campaign.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNorth Star Games has been publishing board games for over 12 years. We know what it takes to produce high quality board games in large quantities. We have top notch employees and customer service.\n\nThis is our third Kickstarter campaign associated with the Evolution product line, and by now we have a clear idea of the pain points for a campaign of this type.\n\nFor example, one mistake we made in the last campaign was to use several distributors to ship to different regions around the world. This made fulfillment complicated and made it hard for us to monitor shipments. As a result too many boxes arrived to backers damaged, or failed to arrive at all. \n\nNow, instead, we're using a single fulfillment house which specializes in shipping rewards worldwide, one recommended by Jamie Stegmaier, whose campaigns are the gold standard in this area. This allows us to get games to you more reliably and more cheaply, and that backers automatically get tracking numbers. \n\nAs ever, unforeseen manufacturing problems can arise. The chances are low because the components for the expansion will be made by the same manufacturer that makes the base game, the Evolution: Flight expansion, and with whom we have a productive relationship. If a manufacturing problem should arise, we have lots of experience working through manufacturing issues, and can bring it to bear.\n\nFinally, whatever problems may arise, we will continue our policy of replacing any components with which our backers aren't satisfied.

Please make sure to follow our progress in the updates. \nVillages of Valeria is a village-building card game in which players establish resources, construct buildings, and attract adventurers to become the next capital city of Valeria. Take on the role of a Duke in the vast and beautiful kingdom of Valeria and, on your turn, lead the table by selecting an Action - Harvest, Develop, Build, Recruit, or Tax - for everyone to perform while you get a slight advantage for being the Active Player.\nVillages of Valeria is a stand alone game set in the world of Valeria and takes place just before the hordes of monsters invade the kingdom in Valeria: Card Kingdoms. \nUpdated Once Per Day - ~6000 Deluxe Copies Pledged and climbing!\nIn Villages of Valeria, 1 to 5 players compete to build the best village in the kingdom in about 45-60 minutes.\nCard Anatomy\nThere are two main cards in Villages of Valeria: Building cards and Adventurer cards. \nSurprising strategic decisions with just 2 types of cards!\nBuilding Cards can be used in two different ways: \nYou can pay the Resources listed on the left to build the Building and use its power during the game. \nYou can Develop it as a Resource by flipping it upside down and placing it under your Castle. \nAdventurer cards are attracted to your village by certain Building types listed on the left of the card. Pay Gold to add them to your village to use their power or reap Victory Points at the end of the game. \nGame Flow\nThe game is played over several rounds where players take turns being the Active Player. The Active Player chooses an Action and, in turn order, all other players may follow and do the same Action but at a slight disadvantage.  \nActions\nHARVEST: Draw 3 Cards. \n   Follow: Draw 1 Card. \nDEVELOP: Discard 1 card to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource.\n   Follow: You may discard 2 cards to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource. \nBUILD: Place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village and draw 1 card.\n   Follow: You may place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village. \nRECRUIT: Pay 1 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village.    Follow: Pay 2 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village. \nTAX: Collect 1 Gold and draw 1 Card.\n   Follow: None.\nVictory!\nThe game ends after the turn in which any player's Village contains the target number of Buildings and/or Adventurers. This can happen either because the Active Player has built a Building or recruited an Adventurer, or because another player following the action has done so. The entire Action is played out, so even if the Active Player has triggered the end of the game, all other players still get a chance to follow the Action and add to their own Villages.\nCount up your Victory Points and see who's village will become the next capital city of Valeria!\nWatch the play through video by Rahdo Runs Through: \nUpdated with Unlocked Stretch Goals.\n Game Contents \n72 Building Cards \n10 Adventurer Cards \n5 Castle Cards \n5 Player Reference Cards \n30 Screen Printed Wood Gold Coins\n1 Screen Printed Wood Active Player Token \n1 Rulebook \n1 Beautifully Illustrated Box \nAdded to Game via Stretch Goals Thanks to Our Backers\n1 Cleric Adventurer Card\n1 Warlord Adventurer Card\n1 Blacksmith Adventurer Card\n1 Rogue Adventurer Card\n1 Summoner Adventurer Card\n1 Necromancer Adventurer Card\n3 Fountain Building Cards\n3 Tannery Building Cards\n3 Forger's Den Building Cards\n3 Archery Range Building Cards\n1 Solo Variant Reference Card\n1 Action-Selection Card\nAll card will be 320gsm Blackcore stock with a Linen Finish thanks to our backers!

In A.D.A.P.T. I've created for you somewhat of a mash-up style fighting game that combines those two loves.\nA.D.A.P.T. is a mid-to-light weight card and dice game that...\nhas mighty new Leveling, Drafting, and Mash-up game mechanisms.\nimplements ocean-deep strategies via tons of abilities and body part combinations that are as fun to build as they are exciting to use.\nis designed to use full sets of polyhedral dice that directly support the above leveling mechanisms and strategies (21 unique Halfsies Dice included).\nAbout A.D.A.P.T. (updated)\nA.D.A.P.T. is a mashup style battle game with a unique new experience-based drafting mechanism where each player starts as a humble guppy fish and then upgrades his body over time, while forcibly Adapting new parts, to create a Frankenstein-level \"Masterfish\", all in preparation for battle to be come the last Masterfish in the sea. \nAlternately stated: It's a unique, clever, fast-playing game about mutant fish battling to the death. : )\nIn A.D.A.P.T. all players share one deck, and every single card in the deck is unique; unique art and unique stats! That means that whatever you buy I can't, and whatever I buy you can't.  As a result you'll not only Adapt your fish, but you'll also have to Adapt your strategy.\nA.D.A.P.T. plays in 30 minutes, and is designed for 2-3 players ages 13+, but can adapt to meet the needs of larger gaming groups (up to 6), as well as younger players (ages 7+).  Between A.D.A.P.T.'s in-game rules for playing with kids ages 7+, and the fact that all fish in the core game are real animals with stats and abilities based on those real animals, A.D.A.P.T. can serve as a reliable learning game for play with the younger crowd, while remaining, at it's core, meaty enough for the adults it is designed for.\nTo learn more about how the game plays, see our \"How it plays\" section below.  And thanks for backing A.D.A.P.T.\nRead all 23 third-party reviews below.\n Looking to share the fun?  You can this picture and link! \n Link: http://kck.st/1NiFRdx\nNow that we're fully funded, (THANK YOU!), I've moved the Stretch Goal stuff to the top here.

The new design will display the custom layout for playing with kids, as well as have a cheat-sheet of the basic rules of the game when gaming with your guppies!\nAdditionally the section of the manual dedicated to these rules will be expanded and upgraded as well.\nThe Final Stretch Goal Voting Area\nI hereby present to you two phenomenal upgrade options for the game box! Vote now, then go share the campaign to help us get there!\nOption #1!\n\"3d Lenticular Printing\" for the cover of the box!  As the box moves 3d fish will swarm in to form the final box cover image we all know and love!  Take a look!\nRender only, actual art will have a deep 3d appearance!  Final design will have splashy water, forming clouds, and may even have the fish leaping from the water!  To see the power of the potential motion and 3d effects, take a look at the video clip here (30s - sorry for the crazy music, I didn't make the video : ).\nOption #2!\nThe box is upgraded to a \"Hinge and Magnet\" style 1-piece box that closes with the power of the Magnetfish! Take a look!\nInstead of the image moving, the lid will!  Final design subject to change.  Magnet fish do not really exist (though it would be cool).\nThere can be only one Mastergoal in the sea!\nVOTE HERE!\nVoting will run until the moment that final Stretch Goal is unlocked!\nWant to find out all the glorious details?

See what's inside the Box of Delights video here:\nThe Purge has posted over 900 written reviews! ...but he's only done 8 videos. A.D.A.P.T. is one of them:\nBearded Meeple accepted a rare late request to review A.D.A.P.T. and blew this 4 MINUTE overview/review video out of the water!\nUndead Viking did his initial review using the B&W print & play version. I sent him a color prototype to take a look at, and he liked the art so much he shot a 2nd video (7mins).\nA.D.A.P.T. still has even more reviews coming!  \nA few press comments...\nA.D.A.P.T. includes 60+ unique cards, 3 player mats, and 3 sets of custom dice.\n...and every card in the box is unique, which results in very interesting gameplay since we all share one deck! \nPlus, with Stretch Goals the contents of the game have increased even further!\nBy popular demand, a closeup of the Maincore game's dice.\nGame Stats:\nAges \"7+\" listed due to in game rule mods, though primarily designed for 13+.\nFor 2-3 players, plays in 30 minutes, and designed for ages 13+.\n(Plays well with ages 7+. Certain Stretch Goals will further aid playing with the young ones.)\nFREE COMPANION APP! - Install it right now!\nAlso we're offering a Companion App that is both a general Dice Roller, and a Statistic Tracker.  Though it's not required for play, it sure can be helpful to have!  Best of all, it's totally free!  Enjoy!\nTo play with up to 6 players, order two copies or take a look at the Bonus Packs below.

No additional shipping charge.  Mats also upgrade with Stretch Goals.\n(Note: These 3 additional Player Mats are truly optional, please don't feel like you need to add them to enjoy the game or 6-player experience.  You can print extras at home from the Full Color PnP for free if you prefer; add these to have the same quality as the core game's 3. - Thanks for reading!)\nThese 3 dice sets, which will ship with your game rewards, and will each be packed in it's own plastic display case.\nTo add any of the above items to your pledge simply add the value of the items desired to your pledge total by clicking the \"Manage\" button next to your pledge amount at the top of the page.

You are helping make a dream come true, a mom 'stay-at-home' (yes, she very much wants to : ), and an amazing game to be made that you'll get to play before anyone else.\nThank you in advance for your pledge!\nIntroducing our new UFRST Shipping (Universal Flat Rate Shipping Technique).  Shipping has never been so simple.\nIn short: Free to the USA and $7 flat rate to everywhere else. Live in the EU? In Australia? In Brazil? ...all $7.  Even if you add everything to your pledge.  Take a look...\nHere's a visual of the shipping prices....\nFlat Rate Worldwide Shipping. That means: The same price everywhere outside the USA, no matter where you live, or how much you add to your pledge.\nWe gladly also offer Friendly Worldwide Shipping through our relationships with worldwide shipping agencies.  That means you don't have to pay VAT on the import of the game, we do it for you.\nHow are we able to do this? Shipping to the USA from the USA is inexpensive and is covered by the shipping subsidy built into the base pledge.  We then priced out how much extra it costs to ship to EU backers (the biggest slice of the pie outside the USA), and then we're covering the extra costs to everywhere else.  It's as simple as that! Our way of thanking everyone for being a part of this.\nTimelines are estimates based on quotes from manufacturing companies and previous experience. We promise to do our best to stay on top of, or ahead of, the timeline.\nGate Keeper Games is a family run game design and publishing company.  It's largely a one-man-show, but without my Beautiful Wife and Amazing Children I would not be able to do what I have with this company.\nWe as a family are committed to treating you like you're one of us.  That means we look out for you, we're honest with you, and we still love you even when you share \"constructive criticism\". ; )\nWe as a business take hard work seriously, believe in keeping promises, and don't believe in budgeting in profit into the Funding Goal.  If we make any 'take home' on this, which a hard worker has the right to do, it will be well into the Stretch Goals and/or after the campaign in retail.  It's not the best business model, but we're a family first!\nMe as me: I believe so strongly in this game I've invested $12,796 myself into the production, art, and shipping of the game (allowing us to fund that much sooner!). We authentically get to do this together! : )\nAll in all: Count on being respected and treated like you're cared about, because you are.

Additionally, players work to discredit the insane conspiracies of other players (what nut jobs!) by leaking stories to the tabloid press. Points are scored for the conspiracies left at the end of the round and those that are accepted as possibly true by the public double in value. The game ends when a player crosses one hundred points. The highest score wins.\n\nIf you would dare to read the rulebook for Conspiracy! it is available for download HERE. We promise such downloads are not tracked by the Reptilian overlords.

Firstly they take one Action to try to forward the group's goals.  There are a variety of Actions including Gather Wood, Start a Fire, or playing a Gear card from hand.  Then the player chooses which Disaster the group will deal with next.  There are a huge variety of Disasters that must be handled from Downpours to Scary Shadows to Park Ranger visits.  (Watch out for the sneaky Thieving Magpie)  Everyone has to work together to cook food and gather wood during the day and then roast marshmallows and party all night to have lots of fun!  You can see the complete rules Here.\nGame Goals\nThe goal of the game is to both survive all the Disasters that show up and have as much Fun as possible in the interim.  In the basic game most groups survive fairly easily and aim to have the highest Fun score they can, trying to beat their previous best record.  However, for those who like to live on the edge (and occasionally die gruesome deaths in the wilderness) there is Starvation Mode where just making it to the end of the game alive is an accomplishment.\nWhat I am trying to accomplish with Kickstarter\nThis Kickstarter isn't here to create the game - that part is done.  I built the game and Nathan Nun created all the art for it so the creative work is almost entirely finished.  What I am trying to arrange is a reasonably large scale production order so that lots of people can enjoy the game.  My goal is to order 500 units produced (or more, if possible!) and then ship them all out to the people who support this Kickstarter.  Because all of the work on my end is already done there is minimal risk because all I have to do is say go and wait for things to arrive.\nWhy support Camp Nightmare?\nSo why is this game worth supporting anyway?  Several reasons!  First off, it is simple to understand yet hard to play perfectly.  The rules are easy enough that my nine year old daughter can play the game but my hard core gamer nerd friends still have good debates over what choices are best to maximize the group's chances for success.  This makes Camp Nightmare ideal for a mixed group of gamers from beginners to the most hardcore of grognards.  It has a short rulebook and anyone can pick up the flow of the game in just a few turns... but figuring out whether or not it is optimal to pick Freezing Cold or Downpour for your next Weather effect can be a tricky thing indeed.\nCo-op game design\nCo-op games often fall into two common design traps.  The first trap is that they are extremely random, usually because they are marketed more for children than adults.  Camp Nightmare is designed to have easy rules but deep strategic possibility so that playing it feels like a strategy game instead of just rolling dice.  The second trap is a design that leads to one player telling everyone else what to do and playing their turn for them.  In Camp Nightmare each player has their own cards in hand and the other players don't know what those are.  This means that everyone has to work together rather than just following directions from the most experienced player (or just the loudest player, depending on your group.)\nFlexible number of players\nCamp Nightmare fills a niche for gamers who like to have game nights without knowing exactly who will show up.  You can add or subtract players from the game in progress without significantly disrupting the game.  If you have three players and Joe is coming soon but you don't know when, just get started!  If Joe shows up ten turns in you just give him 2 Energy tokens, deal him 4 cards, and he can sit down and take turns just like anyone else.  If Sarah has to leave early, she can just shuffle her cards into the deck, toss away her Energy tokens, and everyone else can continue.  The remaining players will no doubt be a little sad at the loss of their comrade (kidnapped by vicious deer, presumably) but the game will carry on just fine.  Camp Nightmare is a co-op game where you can just play with whoever is there at the time and have a fantastic time doing so.\nI am located in Canada and so this Kickstarter is in Canadian funds.  Because our dollar is worth considerably less than the US dollar you should take that into account if you are south of the border.  This also explains why the shipping costs will probably seem high for US residents - it just costs more to ship up here than it does down south.\nThe game designer\nI am Sky Roy.  I blog about games, both ones I am playing and building at http://brightcapegamer.blogspot.ca/   I have built a number of board games, a roleplaying game, and done some modding on computer games.  This is my first serious attempt at publication.  I have been really excited to finally see a game of mine look and feel real as none of my previous efforts have come to the stage of having proper art, design, or publication.  Here is a picture of the pieces when I first got them.  It was nice to have them in my hands, but I definitely look forward to having copies I don't have to cut out myself!\nThe artist\nNathan Nun is the artist who created all the art for the game.  He does all kinds of artistic and design work, which you can see more of at http://nathannun.ca/ , or at his etsy store at https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/NathanNunArt \nIf you like the pictures in the game and want prints or something of that nature, feel free to contact Nathan about it on the website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges with this project are minimal. The work is done, the art is made, the game is built. Production is always going to take some time, but there isn't any great likelihood of real problems since I have quotes for production all ready to go. \n\nThe only real issue I might run into is delays in production timing, which would be annoying for sure, but the product is going to be exactly what I have presented here.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sky Roy\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nI grew up in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.

Each scenario presents different quests that must be fulfilled in order to be victorious, and various monsters the heroes will need to defeat on their way. The monsters react to the heroes' actions, so no one is stuck playing the role of game master.\nThe Heroes of Arcadia!\nAs the heroes defeat their enemies and accomplish quests, their guilds rake in the coins, which will then allow them to acquire all sorts of powerful loot! From legendary weapons and armor, to new abilities and magic items. The combination of each hero's unique ability with all the different upgrades they earn through the campaign allows players to create amazing and unexpected combos!\nThe Monsters of Inferno!\nInferno is a standalone box, but also fully compatible with previous Arcadia Quest boxes. It contains a full campaign with 12 scenarios for players to explore. As players progress through the circles of Inferno, deeper and deeper into the Underworld, the campaign branches into two distinct paths. The path not taken results in quests the players will not fulfill, and therefore consequences that will come back to haunt them towards the end of the campaign.\nThe Angels. Will they help or hinder you?\nOne such key choice are the Angels. These secret protectors of Arcadia have been imprisoned by the Underlord, who is trying to corrupt them. If players rescue these Angels, they become powerful additions to their Guilds. But beware, the Angels that are abandoned to their fate will be consumed and come back as monsters to seek revenge on the heroes!\nProduction plastic miniatures of the Inferno monsters, angels, and heroes.\nGoing down into the infernal depths presents the heroes of Arcadia with a new set of challenges and opportunities, in the form of Damnation! This dark power permeates everything in Inferno, and daring heroes may want to use it to their advantage (and face the consequences). Weapons and equipment found in Inferno may become more powerful if a hero takes Damnation, monsters may offer the choice of taking Damnation instead of wounds (or flat out dealing Damnation to their target). However, accumulating Damnation may come at a high price. Some Upgrades are more effective against heroes with Damnation, some monsters more powerful against them, and specially Brimstone cards scattered through the scenarios may activate monsters to attack heroes who dabble too much in the dark powers!\nMany of the Upgrade cards use Damnation to punish or reward heroes.\nArcadia Quest: Inferno comes with:\n36 highly detailed figures, including:\n  12 Hero figures\n  5 Angel figures\n  19 Monster figures (6x Demoness, 6x Harpy, 2x Demon Pitcher, 2x Cerberus, Belly'aal, The Judge, The Underlord)\n12 color plastic bases\n8 Attack dice \n6 Defense dice \n9 double-sided game tiles \n4 guild dashboards \n276 cards\n300+ tokens\nCampaign Sheet pad\nRulebook\nCampaign Book\nExplore a brand new campaign, and add Pets to any Arcadia Quest experience with the Optional Buy Arcadia Quest: Pets expansion!\nFind out everything about the Pets Optional Buy box HERE.\nIf you wish to extend your campaign beyond the 6th scenario, don't miss out on the ultimate showdown with the Frost Dragon expansion box!\nFind out everything about the Frost Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nThe mad fight against the Chaos Dragon also takes place after the 6th scenario and brings a whole new epic experience to Arcadia Quest!\n Find out everything about the Chaos Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nNo epic campaign can end without a showdown against the majestic Fire Dragon!\nFind out everything about the Fire Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nHell of a Pledge - $100\nThe Hell of a Pledge gives you an Arcadia Quest: Inferno core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero King David III, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nKing David III is a natural born leader.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. \n  $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release.

Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will treat it as abandoned and will refund or ship on a case by case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.

As caretakers for kodama, the tree spirits, you must keep the forest a healthy and lush home for your little friends. Over three growing seasons, you must cultivate trees with the right mix of flowers, insects, and branch arrangements to make your kodama as happy as possible. Whoever cares for their kodama best will be remembered for generations!\nFrom the designer of the hit game Kigi, Kodama branches out into a fun new way to play! Grow your tree by placing cards in clever arrangements, being careful to leave room for future growth. At the end of each season, one kodama will award you points for how well your tree suits its needs. With beautiful art and innovative mechanics, Kodama is an inTREEguing game for the whole family.\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the newest Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games, playing in under 45 minutes for 2-5 players. We encourage you to view the videos directly below for more information. Or simply peruse our rule book here.\n \nThe Deluxe Edition of the game includes the below components in addition to the ones above:\nThe story of Kodama is an interesting one indeed. Initially, we sought to publish Daniel's game Kigi, but felt we could help to develop a few elements of the game. Two months later, we realized that we had a much different game than Kigi and Kodama took seed! (You can read more about this here in Daniel's Design Diary.)\nWhile both games come from similar roots, Kodama provides a very different game experience from its predecessor.\nHere are the differences in Kigi and Kodama:\nTHEME: In Kodama, players cultivate homes (trees) for the kodama.\nPLACEMENT: In Kodama, there is no pruning, but rather a 10 point scoring cap for placement that encourages diversity while leaving players with a beautiful tree by the end of the game. Additionally, players now only place branches on their own trees.\nFEATURES: Not only are all of the features updated to help represent the theme, there are now six features as opposed to five.\nGOALS: In Kigi, goals came in the form of Commission cards that were shuffled into the branch deck. Now, players are dealt four kodama cards, three of which they will score over three seasons.\nSEASONS: Play is now divided into three seasons: Spring, Summer, and Fall. At the beginning of each season a Decree will be revealed which will add or amend a rule in the game--adding more replayability and strategy to placement. After placing four branches, players will select one of their Kodama cards to score. At the end of three seasons, players score a final Kodama card and a winner is determined!\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the fifth project from Action Phase Games and was designed by the very talented Daniel Solis. With the successful execution of our first four projects, we have become experienced as publishers. We will confidently execute this project to the same high standard.\nThe deluxe edition, containing additional content and upgraded components, will not be available in retail.\nDaniel Solis has successfully designed a game that is accessible to gamers of all ages and levels of experience. Kodama is innovative while remaining easy to learn and play. Because of these factors, we have every confidence that this game will be played for years to come.\nPeople who have demoed and play-tested this game have uniformly loved it for its original mechanics, charm, artistic beauty, and accessibility. While the game takes under 45 minutes to teach and play, it offers a surprising amount of tactical depth and replay value.\nAll of the art assets (with the exception of the 3 Become a Guardian pledge levels) are complete.\nThe game is full of charming illustrations by the extremely gifted Kwanchai Moriya, with graphic design by the equally talented Scott Hartman.\nNot only do we offer free shipping in the US, but this project is EU friendly, too.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content). All non-promo stretch goals are in every version of the game.\nFind all Scythe media on our website and join discussions about the game on BGG.\n\"Scythe is a game that\u2019s about contrasts. It is complex in strategies and options, yet the action choices are fairly simple and the game is easy to pick up.\" \u2014 Dave Banks, GeekDad overview and review\n\"Scythe is so good as to almost defy description.\" \u2014 JR Honeycutt, The Nerds' Table overview and review\nAlso see Gen Con preview videos filmed by Joel Eddy and TechRaptor, as well as special episodes of Board Gamers Anonymous and Ding & Dent.\nIn addition to the gameplay video below (or on YouTube for full annotations in the description), here are Scythe's rules and free playtest PnP files.\nOur money-back guarantee says that you can return your copy of Scythe (opened or unopened) within 1 month of receiving it for a full pledge refund, no questions asked. We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria. He's also the co-founder and president of Stonemaier Games, and he's written a book about crowdfunding.\nJakub Rozalski is the artist, worldbuilder, and creative director of Scythe. Art prints of his work are available for purchase from him here.\nMorten Monrad Pedersen is Stonemaier's development specialist. He designed the Automa solo variant for Scythe as detailed on his BGG blog.\nCarsten Biernat & Jozsef Szollosi of Unique Voodoo Studio are the 3D modelers for Scythe's miniatures. \nChristine Santana is the lead graphic designer for Stonemaier Games.\nChris Matthew is the Panda Game Manufacturing project manager for Scythe.\nScott Wadyko is the the sculptor of the realistic resource tokens found in the collector's edition and in our new treasure chests.\nVideo: The project video was created by Josh McDowell,  narrated by A.T. Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

And one of us happens to be pretty handy with a crayon too ;)\nSerious Poulp\nWe founded Serious Poulp in 2010 so we could persue our dreams of publishing the games we designed.\nWe started with Steam Torpedo, a tactical Submarine combat game for 2 players with quite a significant metagame potential and combo mechanic.\nNext up was 8 Masters' Revenge, a martial arts game for 1 to 4 players that revamps the standard combat game genre.\nNow, it's time for The 7th Continent, our third game, the one we've been working full-time on for the past 2 years.\nLudovic Roudy & Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends since childhood, we love all kinds of games!\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp which we founded in 2010 when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludo was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives whether they be from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent: Ludovic also creates all the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpSlayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the community manager for The 7th Continent.\nA passionate gamer and journalist and far too English for his own good. He currently works for the French-based board gaming site Tric Trac. He is an aficionado of any tabletop game featuring toy soldiers. You may have already heard of him from his work on the incredibly successful CONAN board game by Monolith.\nThe chat with Mr Jamie\nAs passionate gamers, we imagined a game that didn\u2019t exist, as far as we were aware, and that we would love to play.\nThis game is The 7th Continent: an exploration and adventure game offering many hours of solo or cooperative fun with friends.\nHowever, we wouldn\u2019t have started working on The 7th Continent without the prospect of launching it on Kickstarter.\nWhy?\nBECAUSE of the investment that this game implies. Be it in terms of time spent on its conception, design or illustrations. It can\u2019t be supported by a small company like Serious Poulp without a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nBECAUSE after 2 years of work on this project we cannot, unlike with our other games, continue without ensuring a certain degree of success through Kickstarter first.\nBECAUSE our goal is to not publish a standard run-of-the-mill board game. We want The 7th Continent to be an adventure of epic proportions with the largest game board ever created! We can do this with your support and all the stretch goals that we hope to unlock during the campaign.\nWe\u2019ve invested over 2 years of our lives and a significant part of our savings into this project, the first \"choose-your-own-path\" exploration board game. Now we need to know if all this work is going to bear fruit. If this campaign is not successful then The 7th Continent game will never see the light of day. Any possible commercial release will also depend on the level of the campaign\u2019s success.\nWe\u2019ve done all we can to make this dream come true, now the rest is up to you!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in October 2016.\nNo extra customs charges for EU, USA and Canada.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends, which will be managed through the Pledge Manager.\nHere is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (between 2 and 3 kg). Please acknowledge that these are just estimates and that we\u2019ll do our best to get you the best shipping deal possible.\nArea 1 - Mainland USA, Western Europe (France, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal): Between \u20ac10 and \u20ac15\nArea 2 - Canada, Australia, Rest of EU countries: Between \u20ac15 and \u20ac23 [update]\nArea 3 - Russia, Israel, Norway, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, North Africa, Maghreb, New Zealand, Vietnam, India: Between \u20ac28 and \u20ac33\nArea 4 - Rest of the world: Between \u20ac33 and \u20ac38\nMORE PLEDGES ?\nIf you want more than one pledge (including All Applicable Stretch Goals), the shipping cost for each additional reward - from the 2nd and up to the 7th and last - will be divided by 2!\nGame mechanics : 99%\nGame conception (terrain, events, characters) : 85%\nNarration (flavor and event texts, descriptions, etc) : 50%\nArtwork* : 45%\nProof reading and translation : 5%\nIf the project is funded, we will start production in summer 2016.

We have been dedicated to The 7th Continent for over 2 years now. We will be concentrating on what we know and outsourcing other skills with industry professionals.\n\nZERO RISK DOESN\u2019T EXIST. BUT IT\u2019S STILL A LOT SIMPLER WITH CARDS.\n\nCards being the main component of The 7th Continent means that this project has a lower level of risk than others, particularly those with lots of miniatures.\n\nThat being said, outside of making sure that the game is properly prepared and choosing our partners wisely (printers, logistics, etc.), it is not impossible that we face delays from uncontrollable sources (curses, rafting accidents, attacks from giant bears, killer bees, etc). This may cause some delay in the delivery date but rest assured that, if this were to happen, we will keep you informed about the situation.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is asked more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded of them at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

(Print on Demand) Publisher, If you back at a (P.O.D.) level you will be able to buy Greatest of All Mountains at cost once the campaign is finished for about $12 + shipping.\nReviews \n\"I enjoyed my time with Greatest of All Mountains. It has some very interesting ideas and was most certainly a unique game in and of itself. The idea of bringing up a mountain at birth and setting it up on high was rewarding.\"- Father Geek. Parent and Child Geek Approved. Full review here.\n\"I've seen these mechanics in other games but mixed with this theme, I thought it was really well done, really well put together. I appreciated how the complexity or the in-depth-ness of the phases increased as you went... You can put in a lot of strategy if you want to, but you can also sit back and enjoy building yourself up as the mountain.\" -NVS Gameplays Full Review Here.\nGameplay\nGreatest of All Mountains is a competitive Mountain building card game for 2-5 players that can be played in 45-90 minutes. The game currently includes nearly 200 cards. \nEach player represents a mountain which is vying for the title of Greatest of All Mountains. To achieve this, players must acquire the most victory points in the three phases of the game, using various abilities and events to gain an advantage over the other players.\nAncient Glacier and Ancient Forest\nIn hopes of achieving the high honor of being named Greatest of All Mountains, each player must first form the terrain of their mountain. By adding slopes, lakes, cliffs and more to their mountain they craft the foundation of their strategy. Players may also compete to gain the all or nothing \"Tallest Mountain\" award for additional VP. \nThe Phase 1 deck\nNext, players must build facilities on their terrain. This is where strategy becomes very important as the facilities built greatly effect how the next phase will play out. Build the best facilities on the faces of your mountain or choose to build sub-par facilities on your opponent's mountains. \nFinally, each player must attract tourists to their mountain. The goal is to get tourists to your mountain's \"Safe Zone\" where they will be scored at the end of the game. Tourists frequently change hands, so players must employ a variety of strategies and abilities to make sure their tourists are safe from the other players. With your support we can make Greatest of All Mountains a reality.\nSkiiing isn't just for humans.\nFor an overview of gameplay visit: https://youtu.be/-kmqrLUSHlE \nTo view the complete rules: https://www.dropbox.com/s/m93vrtso8awd5jb/Rules.docx?dl=0\nBGG page: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180224/greatest-all-mountains\nPhase 1: Formation, Phase 2: Development, Phase 3: Tourism\nWhy Greatest of All Mountains is Great  \n\u2022 It's a Casual Game with Strategy- One of the best aspects of Greatest of All Mountains is that it's a fairly casual game but players can strategize as well. Luck does play a role, especially in the first phase, but even then players can make decisions and take risks by taking or passing up a card on the table. In the next two phases, decisions players make could win or lose the game for them.\n\u2022 Gameplay That Suits Several Play Styles- While this game is competitive and there are more than a few ways to mess with your fellow players, Greatest of All Mountains does not force you to do so. It is a legitimate and sometimes winning strategy to focus on improving yourself. There's a life lesson in there somewhere.\n\u2022 It's a Good Warm-up Game- Greatest of All Mountains is a great way to start off a game night. It's not terribly complicated but you need to make decisions too, making it a good primer for deeper strategy games later on.\nMadness Expansion ($4400)- New terrifying Terrain, Facilities, Tourists and Events for your Mountains to incorporate.  \nNew Terrain \u201cSlippery Slope\u201d, \u201cUnnatural Crag\u201d and \u201cInsidious Hollow.\u201d\nNew Facilities \u201cSpaceship Wreckage\u201d, \u201cHaunted Hotel\u201d and \u201cUnderwater Temple\u201d\nNew Tourists \u201cParanormal Investigator\u201d and \u201cCosmic Horror\u201d\nAs well as sanity-withering new events.

You must explore the harsh wilderness and engage in deep tactical combat, where the decisions you make have an impact not only on your own character, but also the world around you.\nGloomhaven is cooperative game of card-driven combat set in a persistent fantasy campaign which will change and grow as you play the game.\nThere is always more to unlock and explore in the world of Gloomhaven.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards from their hand of ability cards which determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can play the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up.\nPlayers gain the experience needed to level up by performing certain actions in their ability card deck. Through leveling up, players will also get access to more powerful, higher level ability cards which they can use to customize their deck.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase powerful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nOne way to unlock items is to increase the prosperity of the town, which players can do by completing scenarios and making decisions during events between scenarios. Players will also have to manage their reputation during these events, as reputation will influence the outcome of some events and also affect shop prices.\nAs players interact with the town and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing career goals. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like more information about any aspect of the game, you can find a wealth of information on the Gloomhaven website and also the BoardGameGeek page which features a number of illustrated lessons on how to play the game.\nIn addition, here is a PDF of a preliminary draft of the rules.\nIf you learn through action or just want to get a better feel for the game, there are a couple easy ways to sit down and play the game on your computer.\nThe introductory scenario of Gloomhaven is available through Tabletop Zen (free) and Tabletop Simulator (this requires the purchase of software).\nYou can get the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop mod here. From there you can play around with it on your own, or sign up to be taught the game through this Google Doc. When you become familiar with the game, you can also sign up for pick-up games, or even be a teacher yourself.\nTabletop Zen now has an open lobby where you can go play around with the game on your own, or you can sign up for pick-up games or teaching games through the Google Doc. All that's required is a valid email address to sign up.\nKeep in mind that the game is not automated. Players will have to move the pieces around according to the rules, and communication between players is highly advised. Tabletop Simulator has accompanying voice software, but Google Hangouts is needed to play on Tabletop Zen.\nFor those interested, a PDF Print-and-Play of the first scenario is also available, along with the accompanying pages from the scenario book.\nThe scenario available online is just the beginning, though. A scratch on the surface of the world.\nGloomhaven is deep and expansive. It is a game of exploration and discovery; of branching story paths and decisions with real consequences. You always have a choice of which scenario to undertake next and which plot thread to unravel.\nMore than that, though, there is plenty of content to support multiple game groups. If you want to play the game with someone new, you shouldn't reset the game, but instead just pursue a different story line. Each party of adventurers will develop their own campaign, but everyone will interact with and expand upon the same world.\nGloomhaven provides a persistent world of permanent choices without the restriction of only being able to play with the same people time and again. It does this by focusing on the stories of individual characters instead of an over-arching linear plot.\nAnd a few comments from play testers:\nNew classes will become available to play when players meet certain conditions in the game. If you want spoil yourself on the surprise, or you just really want to check out more amazing artwork, click here to see what else you'll be getting, or if you want to get a detailed look at the miniatures, you can check out all the original sculpts by clicking here (also full of spoilers).\n(Note that all depictions of miniatures are digitally modified pictures of the original physical sculpts.)\nI love Kickstarter. This platform brings together creators and their audiences in such a wonderful way. I absolutely would not be able to get this game made without your financial support, but what really makes Kickstarter exciting to me is the opportunity to involve the community in the creation of the project.\nThis project doesn't just give you a great game that will show up on your doorstep in May. It gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. There is also a scenario design competition to allow the backer community to make a significant mark on the creation of the game.\nMy amazing play testers have helped me get this far, but now with your help, we can not only get the game made, but also continue working to make it as great as possible.\nAlso remember that if you purchase the game through Kickstarter, you'll get the game before it comes out in retail and it's a significant discount off the MSRP (estimated at $100-120), especially after considering the added cost for shipping.\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.\nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nPledging at the MINIATURES level will get you all of the minis for the included 13 character classes (12 base plus 1 stretch goal). Any additional stretch goals that unlock extra classes beyond that will also unlock extra minis for you. If you'd like a better idea of all the minis you're getting, head on over to the spoilers page.\nPledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH STANDEES level will get you everything that you would get at the $79 level, except that you will get cardboard standees of the character classes instead of the plastic minis. You will also receive all unlocked stretch goals, with the exception of additional minis (receiving standees of additional unlocked character classes instead).\nOr you can get the whole package - all the content, all the stretch goals all the minis. Pledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH MINIS level gets you this.\nNote that this level does not come with standees for the character classes. If you really want both standees and minis (this is redundant and in no way adds content to the game), you can pledge at the $64 level and do a $20 add-on. That will get you absolutely everything.\n$15 for shipping is included in the base game price. All additional shipping fees are added automatically when you pledge.\nThe game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAll three main rewards levels are also available as add-ons. You can add $20 to your pledge to get an additional box of minis. You can add $64 to get a copy of Gloomhaven without the minis. And you can add $79 to get a copy of Gloomhaven with minis.\nUp to 4 $64 and $79 add-ons can be added to your order this way, PLUS you can add up to 5 $20 add-ons as well. You will not have to pay any additional shipping fees on your order.\nIn the proud tradition of slaying helpless rats, I have decided that to reward backers of the Gloomhaven project, I will graduate to a slightly more formidable - but equally prolific - foe: the animated skeleton.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar or more to the campaign, I will foray into a host of fantasy-themed games and slay a necromantic abomination in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, last April.

My previous project, Forge War, was rather massive as well, and I managed to deliver the game to backers just 1 month past the projection.\n\nI have learned so much about Kickstarter fulfillment from that project, though, and I fully expect this project will deliver on time without problem.\n\nThere is still artwork and graphic design to be done, but we should be able to finish that up by December. I know problems with miniatures plague a lot of projects, but James is very nearly done with the sculpting and he is a seasoned veteran in the field, so I don't expect there will be any significant manufacturer issues with the miniatures. We've already made masters of 4 of the sculpts without problem.\n\nI would say the biggest challenge at this point is going to be finishing the content for the game - both creating it and making sure everything is balanced appropriately. A lot of it has been done, but there is still more to do. I firmly believe I and my play testers are up to the task.\n\nWe're projecting to have all the content done by December as well so that we can allow 2 months for the printing process and another 2 months to get the game shipped out to everyone.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #95", "update_userinfo": "The Gloomhaven sequel is live on Kickstarter, now with a gift for returning backers", "update_content": "Hello!

Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.\nEasy to learn, but challenging to master! Includes simplified rules for younger children and tougher challenges for experienced players.\nYou start with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. You also start with one extra tile, with a picture of your animal on it. On the opposite side of each of your tiles is a picture of your animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When you flip a tile, it means your animal is travelling through a part of the dreamscape. Your goal is to guide your animal through the dreamscape by putting him in specified spaces (which are different each time you play).  Each time after a card is drawn, you take your extra animal and slide him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side.  You'll use this tile to shift another column or row on your next turn.  Play continues until one player's dreamscape tiles matches the goal.

It has some very interesting ideas and was most certainly a unique game in and of itself. The idea of bringing up a mountain at birth and setting it up on high was rewarding.\"- Father Geek. Parent and Child Geek Approved. Full review here.\n\"I've seen these mechanics in other games but mixed with this theme, I thought it was really well done, really well put together. I appreciated how the complexity or the in-depth-ness of the phases increased as you went... You can put in a lot of strategy if you want to, but you can also sit back and enjoy building yourself up as the mountain.\" -NVS Gameplays\nGreatest of All Mountains is a competitive Mountain building card game for 2-5 players that can be played in 45-90 minutes. The game currently includes nearly 160 cards.\nEach player represents a mountain which is vying for the title of Greatest of All Mountains. To achieve this, players must acquire the most victory points in the three phases of the game, using various abilities and events to gain an advantage over the other players.\nExamples of Terrain: Ancient Forest & Ancient Glacier\nIn hopes of achieving the high honor of being named Greatest of All Mountains, each player must first form the terrain of their mountain. By adding slopes, lakes, cliffs and more to their mountain they craft the foundation of their strategy. Players may also compete to gain the all or nothing \"Tallest Mountain\" award for additional VP.\nThe Phase 1 deck\nNext, players must build facilities on their terrain. This is where strategy becomes very important as the facilities built greatly effect how the next phase will play out. Build the best facilities on the faces of your mountain or choose to build sub-par facilities on your opponent's mountains.\nFinally, each player must attract tourists to their mountain. The goal is to get tourists to your mountain's \"Safe Zone\" where they will be scored at the end of the game. Tourists frequently change hands, so players must employ a variety of strategies and abilities to make sure their tourists are safe from the other players.

Luck does play a role, especially in the first phase, but even then players can make decisions and take risks by taking or passing up a card on the table. In the next two phases, decisions players make could win or lose the game for them.\nGameplay That Suits Several Play Styles- While this game is competitive and there are more than a few ways to mess with your fellow players, Greatest of All Mountains does not force you to do so. It is a legitimate and sometimes winning strategy to focus on improving yourself. There's a life lesson in there somewhere.\nIt's a Good Warm-up Game- Greatest of All Mountains is a great way to start off a game night. It's not terribly complicated but you need to make decisions too, making it a good primer for deeper strategy games later on.\nI currently have about 50% of the artwork completed. I need to have the artwork for Phase 2 & 3 completed. Once the artwork is finished the game will move into production. Once I have the final copies, I'll send them out to you.\nHere is a breakdown of where the funds will be going:\nMadness Expansion ($17,000)- New terrifying Terrain, Facilities, Tourists and Events for your Mountains to incorporate.\nNew Terrain \u201cSlippery Slope\u201d, \u201cUnnatural Crag\u201d and \u201cInsidious Hollow.\u201d\nNew Facilities \u201cSpaceship Wreckage\u201d, \u201cHaunted Hotel\u201d and \u201cUnderwater Temple\u201d\nNew Tourists \u201cParanormal Investigator\u201d and \u201cCosmic Horror\u201d\nAs well as sanity-withering new events. (2 additional events per Phase.)\nInner Peace Expansion ($21,000)- Embrace the tranquility of nature with these new cards.\nNew Terrain \u201cWild Flower Meadow\u201d, \u201cBabbling Brook\u201d, and \u201cHallowed Ground.\u201d\nNew Facilities \u201cPicnic Area\u201d, \u201cPaved Trail\u201d, and \u201cRelaxing Resort.\u201d\nNew Tourists \u201cMountain Biker\u201d and \u201cOffice Drone\u201d\nPeaceful(ish) events (2 additional events per Phase.)\nAdditional stretch goals will be unlocked as the previous ones are reached, including improved packaging and additional expansions.\nHot Springs and Gentle Lake\n Shipping\nFor this project I will be using the shipping and fulfillment service Ship Naked. They offer customs-friendly shipping to the European Union, Australia, and Canada, so you don't have to pay additional customs charges. Shipping in the US is included at every backer level, except the $1 and $10 levels. Actual shipping costs will be added when you back.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have had two successful Kickstarter projects before and know the ins and outs of running a campaign and what it takes to get content to backers on time.

I have an artist, Dustin Lincoln, who I have worked with previously on my first project, The Hunted. (And whose work you have seen on this page.)\n\nA manufacturer is lined up and a test print has already been run. The only thing needed is money to produce the game.

For the latest, see www.terratilesystem.com.\nCoasts and Rivers is a tabletop terrain system that will let you spend your time gaming instead of making terrain. It is the newest set in the TerraTiles terrain system, and it features beautiful river banks, elegant coastal tiles, and dirt paths. Quick to set up, and easy to take down, TerraTiles is ready right out of the box to turn your whole table into an awesome battlefield regardless of what game you play. There\u2019s nothing to assemble, paint, or flock, and the terrain itself doesn\u2019t get in the way of your miniatures during the game. In short, TerraTiles is fantastic terrain without the hassle! Click here for a FREE Print-n-Play pdf to try them out!\nThe Misty Moorlands Kickstarter campaign in January of 2015 was met with great success, and even before the campaign ended, the backers had lots of great ideas for terrain features they wanted to see included. This Coasts and Rivers set was born from those ideas, and when Coasts and Rivers is paired with The Misty Moorlands, the possibilities are endless!\nWe have been playing tabletop games our entire lives and wanted to provide the gaming community an alternative to green tablecloths. So, we set out to create an easy to use and inexpensive solution that could also create incredibly diverse battlefields. We believe TerraTiles is the best, most comprehensive table-top terrain solution for the following reasons:\nCreated by You - We polled over 450 backers from the Misty Moorlands Kickstarter campaign to determine which terrain features the community wanted. Then we tailored the Coasts and Rivers set specifically to them!\nQuick Set-Up - Each hexagon measures nine inches from corner to corner, so you can cover a table quickly and easily. Each box covers 24 square feet.\nVariety - There are nearly an infinite number of ways to assemble a TerraTiles board\nCompatible with Any Game, Genre, or Scale - Use TerraTiles for all of your miniature gaming. Check out this GeekList for all of the games our backers are using TerraTiles to play!\nEasy to Store and Transport - TerraTiles takes up no more room on your shelf than a regular board game.\nCompatible with Your Standalone Terrain Pieces - Place your buildings, trees, and other terrain pieces right on top of TerraTiles!\nWith all of these features TerraTiles will be your go-to terrain system!\nEvery TerraTiles: Coasts and Rivers box will contain 60 double sided hexagon tiles, which is enough to cover over 24 square feet. As part of the $25,000 stretch goal, each box will also feature 6 double sided half hexagon tiles to straight the edges of the board. 3D standup trees and walls will be included in every Coasts and Rivers box - 9 trees and 6 walls. It also includes reusable putty to secure your TerraTiles to the table. While the number of hexagons in the box is fixed, their distribution will change if stretch goals are reached. To ensure Coasts and Rivers matches The Misty Moorlands, the hexagons will showcase a matte finish and linen texture. Here's Heath to show you our advanced prototype so you know exactly what you will be getting:\nThe graphic below shows everything currently in the TerraTiles: Coasts and Rivers box. We\u2019ll keep it updated as any stretch goals are reached.\nMisty Moorlands is the first TerraTiles terrain set. It was funded on Kickstarter in January of 2015. It features 60 double sided tiles and 6 double sided half tiles with a variety of terrain features ranging from open grassland and forests, to streams and rocky terrain. The size of the tiles matches Coasts and Rivers exactly, so you can combine the two sets to create some amazing boards! The graphic below shows everything included in the Misty Moorlands box:\nTake TerraTiles to another level! We are offering a set of precision-cut expanded polystyrene risers to provide battlefield elevation. The risers are one inch thick and strong enough to support even your heaviest miniatures. Use them to raise any of the existing hexagons to different levels, greatly increasing the amount of variation in your battlefields and adding important strategic depth. The risers are white and can be painted any color you choose. Each package contains ten risers. If you would like a package of risers shipped to you as part of your Kickstarter rewards, be sure to select one of the reward levels in which they are included, or add 24 USD to your pledge for each additional package of risers you would like to add on.\nWe have set the Kickstarter funding goal for TerraTiles as low as possible to get it into production. But, this means we need your help to make the TerraTiles: Coasts and Rivers box as robust as it can possibly be. Therefore, we put together a stretch goal ladder based on campaign funding and an achievement ladder based on social media shares. All Coasts and Rivers boxes will include all stretch goals reached. \nThe social media achievements are reached by sharing this page on Facebook and retweeting the official campaign launch tweet. Facebook shares, retweets, entries in the TerraTiles GeekList, and \"thumbs\" given to the GeekList will be added together to reach the achievements on the ladder above. With the help of the Kickstarter community, we can make an already outstanding terrain system even better!\nWe are @RAINN_Studios on Twitter if you would like to follow us. We're live-blogging the campaign there, so if you want up-to-the-minute news about the campaign, that is the place to be. :-)\n*While supplies last. All miniatures are supplied unpainted.\nAll add ons will be shipped with your pledge rewards. No additional shipping fee is necessary with any add on so long as you have pledged at the $64 pledge level or higher. War of Kings was our first Kickstarter project and board game; for more information see www.WarOfKingsGame.com.\nMoney Back Guarantee - We understand the risk you are taking to support our project, but we are very confident you will love playing your games on TerraTiles. To demonstrate this, we want to extend a money back guarantee to all of our backers. If you are unhappy with TerraTiles, return it within 30 days of delivery for a full refund, no questions asked.\nKickstarter Exclusive Hexagon - The graveyard hexagon will not be included in the retail game box. Backing our Kickstarter project is the only way to receive this special hexagon.\nKickstarter Discount - By pledging on Kickstarter, you will receive TerraTiles at a discount from its MSRP of $74.95.\nWe Need You - We have paid for the art and created the prototype, but only your support will enable us to manufacture and distribute TerraTiles. Your support will also help us to increase the quality of TerraTiles as we reach the stretch goals.\nInfluence the Coasts and Rivers Design \u2013 In anticipation of all the great ideas we know the community will have during this campaign, we have included stretch goals that will enable you to vote directly on new art to commission for the set!\nTerraTiles creates a beautiful table with lots of terrain options while still being very practical for game play. Each tile works with all of the others in any orientation. The streams, roads, and coasts each enter and exit in the middle of a side of the hexagon, so they link seamlessly with the adjacent hex. The stream hexagons do not have a distinguishable current, so they may be used in either direction. The sandy shore hexagons can be used to depict a shoreline or can be put together to create a wide river. The putty included in the boxed set can be placed in a few spots around the board to prevent sliding.\nTerraTiles depicts a variety of easily distinguishable terrain types that can be used with any number of rule sets. You will find lightly wooded and heavily wooded hexagons, as well as difficult and very difficult ground.\nWe understand you would rather spend your hard earned money on games rather than shipping, so we have done as much as possible to keep shipping costs to a minimum. Therefore, we have worked to make this Kickstarter campaign EU Friendly by coordinating with Ideaspatcher. We are also partnering with Snakes and Lattes in Canada and an Australian fulfillment center to help bring down the cost of shipping to those areas. Rewards shipped to backers in the US, EU, CAN, and AU will have their rewards shipped from within those countries.\nThe shipping costs below are applicable to all pledge levels and do not increase, no matter how much you pledge.\nWe welcome any retailers who would like to support TerraTiles: Coasts and Rivers and get the Kickstarter version to sell in their stores. Our retail policy can be found here. Whether you operate a brick-and-mortar or web-based store, please message us directly through Kickstarter or email us at info@rainnstudios.com for information on pledging.\nIan Schofield has returned to work with us to produce TerraTiles: Coasts and Rivers! He used the moorlands of Scotland as inspiration and really produced some fantastic pieces. Here are a few of the layouts you can make with TerraTiles. These utilize Misty Moorlands and include stretch goals.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter campaign, and we have learned a tremendous amount from the previous two campaigns. We are applying every lesson that we learned to this campaign.\n Therefore, when this campaign is successful, we expect TerraTiles to move smoothly from Kickstarter to production. And, because we are partnering with three international fulfillment services (in the EU, Australia, and Canada), our fulfillment process has become more efficient. However, there is always the potential for unexpected surprises. Art can take longer than expected to finalize. Subcontractors can take longer than expected to produce the components. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. As we found with the Misty Moorlands Kickstarter, even unexpectedly heavy rain at the manufacturer can slow down packaging for shipment as shipping containers have to be dehumidified to ensure the contents don't mold on their trip across the ocean! Any of these would slow down the production of TerraTiles. And of course, even once TerraTiles leaves the manufacturer, there is still the potential for delays with freight shipping, customs clearance, distribution, etc.\n However, if you back the TerraTiles: Coasts and Rivers Kickstarter campaign, we will keep you well informed and up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the rewards are shipped.

Players control a party of survivors as they fight to rid the land of an invasion of zombies controlled by the game itself. Survivors find weapons, learn spells, battle zombies, and gain experience. The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them!\nHere's a look at everything we've unlocked!\nZombicide: Black Plague is much more than just the classic Zombicide game you know and love, transported into a fantasy world. While it retains the general Zombicide mechanics, several changes and additions were made for this new iteration.\nBlack Plague's brave survivors: Clovis, Nelly, Baldric, Ann, Samson, and Silas\nBlack Plague brings a whole new breed of survivors to Zombicide, hailing from all walks of medieval life, and even including some fantasy races like dwarves and elves! Each of these heroes posses their own unique abilities to face the zombie horde, from familiar skills to all-new ones.\nA survivor's plastic dashboard, with a full inventory of cards\nEach survivor in Black Plague receives a quality plastic dashboard to keep them organized. A built-in sliding arrow tracks experience gains, and plastic pegs mark wounds and indicate new skills. Finally, multiple slots hold all your cards, making the new inventory system intuitive and structured.\nEach card's symbol indicates the slot where it's used. Weapons and magic spells must be equipped in-hand. Armor must be worn on the body. Special items like extra arrows can be stashed in your backpack. Survivors have varying equipment specializations, allowing them to equip a particular card on the body slot, and still have it instantly accessible.\nArmor introduces a new twist for Zombicide veterans. A survivor wearing armor (or carrying a shield) has a chance of blocking multiple zombie attacks with a lucky roll (although it\u2019s no help against the Abomination).\nThe Black Plague itself: Runner, Walker, Necromancer, Abomination, and Fatty\nThe zombie hordes shuffling around Zombicide: Black Plague\u2019s alleys were raised by powerful Necromancers. When these dark masters enter the board, even more zombies spawn every round. But, instead of mindlessly chasing survivors, Necromancers will try to escape and spread more dread across the land! If they\u2019re not eliminated, the avalanche of zombies only gets worse!\nThe always terrifying Abomination ignores your armor, and is practically invulnerable to your weapons. Your only hope is to lay a trap of Dragon Bile in his path. Light it up with a torch at the right moment, and you\u2019ll see there\u2019s almost no problem that can\u2019t be solved with the judicious application of Dragon Fire!\nThe highly detailed Black Plague survivor miniatures\nAnd the frighteningly detailed Black Plague zombies!\nZombicide: Black Plague comes with dozens and dozens of incredibly detailed miniatures. Survivors have detachable colored plastic bases to help identify them, matching the color of the pegs on your survivor dashboard.\nA sample of the 9 tiles included in Black Plague\nThe Black Plague tiles create a rich and intricate medieval town. Street zones don't spread across multiple tiles, creating lots of twisting alleys for you to try and evade the oncoming undead. And if you find one of the secret vaults, you may be able to cross the entire map a lot faster (and you may even find a couple of very powerful artifacts down there).\nZombicide: Black Plague comes with:\n9 double-sided game tiles \n71 miniatures \n6 survivor plastic dashboards, color bases, and ID Cards \n48 plastic trackers \n6 dice \n125 cards\n63 tokens\n1 Rulebook\nPreview Rulebook:\nhttp://cmon.co/ZF-BP-RULEBOOK-KS\nPlease be aware that this is a Preview Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nBut that's not all we've uncovered from this ancient time!\nZombicide: Wulfsburg is a blood-curdling expansion for Zombicide: Black Plague!\nWulfsburg's dauntless survivors: Theo, Ariane, Karl, and Morrigan\nWulfsburg not only introduces four new survivors to your Zombicide: Black Plague games, but each of them comes with their own plastic dashboard, colored bases and trackers. That means this expansion allows you expand your group to up to 10 survivors at the same time!\nWolfz and the terrifying Wolf-Bomination!\nYou'll need all the help you can get when fighting the Wulfsburg zombies: packs of ravenous zombie wolves (or Wolfz)! Even faster than Runners, these Wolfz can easily tear apart any careless survivor. And pray the pack leader doesn't show up. Just as relentless as the normal Wolfz, the hulking Wolf-Bomination is as resilient as any Abomination, also ignoring any armor on its attacks.\nThe powerful magic weapons from Wulfsburg\nTo help you on your quest, Wulfsburg comes with several unique magic equipment. Most of these items are so powerful that survivors are only able to wield them once they reach a specific danger level.\nThe new tiles in Wulfsburg introduce a new strategic feature into Zombicide in the form of large towers you can climb. From the ramparts, you can fire at the zombies below, but they have to go all the way around to the stairs to reach you. This high vantage point even allows you to fire over buildings, provided your attack has enough range.\nThe highly detailed Wulfsburg miniatures\n Zombicide: Wulfsburg comes with:\n2 double-sided game tiles \n22 zombie wolf miniatures \n4 survivor miniatures and ID cards \n4 plastic dashboards and color bases \n32 plastic trackers\n30 cards\n1 Rulebook\nJoin us for a little session of Zombicide: Black Plague with the CMON team and special guest Steve Avery!\nHuntsman - $100\nHuntsman Level pledges will receive: Zombicide: Black Plague (MSRP $100) + Hero Box (MSRP $25) + All Applicable Stretch Goals.\nKnight - $150\nKnight Level pledges will receive: Zombicide: Black Plague (MSRP $100) + Zombicide: Wulfsburg (MSRP $60) + Hero Box (MSRP $25) + Gowan exclusive survivor miniature and ID card + All Applicable Stretch Goals.\nThe Hero Box that all Huntsman and Knight level backers will get contains not only 5 new Survivors to add to your zombie-killing party (including their miniatures and ID cards), but also 2 more plastic dashboards, each with 8 colored plastic trackers and color base, allowing you to add two more players to your game!\nHero Box: Glynda Battlestout, Julian, Sylvia Samedi, Tucker, and Arnaud\nKnight level backers will also get the Kickstarter Exclusive survivor Gowan, including his miniature and ID card.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\n More on Grom & Thalia HERE.\n More on Jovem Nerd's box HERE.\n More on Neal Adams' box HERE.\n More on Edouard Guiton's box HERE.\nMore on Stefan Kopinski's box HERE and HERE, and HERE.\n More on Karl Kopinski's box HERE and HERE.\nMore on John Howe's box HERE, HERE and HERE.\n More on Paolo Parente's box HERE.\n More on Adrian Smith's box HERE and HERE.\n More on Gipi's box HERE.\n More on Carl Critchlow's box HERE, HERE, and HERE.\nMore on Deadeye Walkers box HERE.\nMore on NPC-2 box HERE and HERE.\n More on the Plastic Token Pack HERE.\nMore on the 3D Doors HERE.\n More on the Deck Holders Set HERE.\nMore on the Counter Bases Pack HERE.\n More on the Extra Tiles Pack HERE.\nMore on Murder of Crowz HERE. \nMore on the Abomination Pack HERE.\nPlease Take Note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 18th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is December 2015, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, and XenoShyft. Zombicide Season 3 has been fully sent out and being delivered to the last backers, and we are in the process of delivering our Base System and The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: Rum & Bones which is in the final stages of production, Blood Rage which is well advanced, and B-Sieged which is starting production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent of each other and have completely different development teams and have no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Black Plague.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will treat it as abandoned and will refund or ship on a case by case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.

This also means that Quined has 10 years of experience in game-publishing. It has published quite a number of games in the Netherlands and Europe. Here is a brief history of how Quined got started.\nQuined Games was founded in 2005 by brothers Arno and Frank Quispel, respectively a lawyer and doctor, both living in a small town near Rotterdam in the Netherlands.\nThe name Quined can be interpreted as 'Quispel Nederland' and as \" 'k win 't \", Dutch for \u201cI win it\u201d. The first game that was published was a Dutch-French edition of Reef Encounter.\nIn 2007 we launched our famous Master Print series, which celebrates the best games in the business by reprinting them and giving them a unique box cover resembling an old hardcover sleeved book. It makes for a beautiful collection of games, something we\u2019re very proud of. The first edition was Leonardo da Vinci. The most recent member of the series, number 14, is The Golden Ages by Luigi Ferrini.\nFrank has left Quined Games some years ago and Arno is still going strong. This year it is Quined's 10th anniversary.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs mentioned above Quined has been in the board game publishing business for ten years now. Arno has all these years of experience within the industry which gives him the insights of the do's and don'ts at first hand. We are giving our 100 % to make it the best Kickstarter Campaign we've ever ran.\n\nCarson City has already sold 10,000 copies worldwide. On one hand that's already a lot for this type of strategy game. But on the other hand, many players asked us to do another edition of the game. However, Carson City has a lot of material, so it has to be printed in a large number of copies in order to sell at a reasonable price. So it is very risky to do without knowing if enough players are interested.

An expansion for up to 6 players is on our schedule, but for now let\u2019s focus on the basics (for more information about the expansion see our section \"future plans\"): the game combines the mechanics of map construction, deck building, hero and area control and unique calendar mechanics.\nWhat actually happens during the game?\nIn the base game, you will buy useful artefacts and hire battle units to support your armies, you will build roads and cities and send your heroes to battle - you will have to find the most powerful mixture of all these assets and apply them at the right moment, so you could claim to be the rightful ruler of Battalia and win the game. A victory can be obtained through aggressive conquest or a peaceful development of your own city system (if you are lucky and the others let you :) . The interesting game play will provide you with the opportunity to make key decisions and turn the tides of even the grimmest outcomes. A player can outmaneuver and BE outmaneuvered by his opponents at any point during the game. Dynamic atmosphere and intense battles are key factors in the overall experience, however the game strives to stimulate planning and strategy over rash and impulsive decisions. In general this is not a luck based game, because of the core deck building mechanics, but a die is integrated as an optional element and is the ingredient, which spices up the game for all the fortunate fellows! You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent. The game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.\nGame Features:  \nLanguage independent\nBasic game mode \nAdvanced game mode for experienced players \nAlternative game scenarios - including completely new game setup for adventurous type of players. \nModular map, built during the game \nFour factions - the Bearfolk, the Cloudborn, the Emberians, the Islanders \nUnique calendar mechanics \nUnique cards purchase mechanics \nVideo rules (available at the end of this summer)\nWhat is in the box?\nGame board\nA special dial, called \u201cThe Sun Oracle\u201d\n330 cards\n61 City tokens.\n8 Miniatures\n4 Reference sheets\n1 Die - standard D6\nAnd of course - a Rulebook - 12 pages\nUnits are the heart of any players deck. There are four types resp. ranks - Frimen, Chiefs, Priests and Lords. These cards are used for creating new artefacts, building roads or cities and of course for conducting battles.\nThere are seven types of artefacts, each of them with its own special ability. The players use them for faster development, to upgrade their units, to transform their factions, to travel on the game board, etc. - they will give you a lot of flexibility.\nThe Great Artefacts are powerful objects crafted in ancient times. Every one of them has its own unique ability and provides big advantages to the player who earned it.\nTerrain cards can be cities or roads. They are used for the construction of the map, and.. well - to gain victory points. No matter how strong is your deck, if you don\u2019t have cities, you have nothing!\nWhat we have here is 56 x 56 cm game board, city tokens to mark the level and the owner of the cities, reference sheets to help the players with the different costs in the game and the supply cards which are actually very, very important cards, as they are used for hiring units, building roads, traveling and more. Now, let me tell you a few words about the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players and it could support you, if you catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides you through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands.\nThe Reference sheets: a great additional aid for beginners - 12 x 18 cm. They are double sided and describe all the artefact abilities, all the creation costs, a player's turn sequence and some important rules!\nSome pictures of the first prototypes and size reference.\nThe miniatures. There are 8 large scale miniatures which represent the players\u2019 heroes in the game. These figures are the leaders of a player\u2019s armies and mark players\u2019 presence on the game board. Plus - they look amazing!\nThe factions.\nFour factions coexist in the world of Battalia. Most of the cards in the game (units, artefacts and terrain cards) and the 8 figures belong to one of the four factions. A leading concept in the game is that the four factions can freely collaborate with each other, but many units from the same faction, using their own artefacts, are much stronger together. Also, unlike all other games where the players choose their factions, in this game the factions choose the players.\nEnglish - Ver.1.1\n                                                                                                                                          French - Ver.1.1\nGerman - Ver.1.1\nSpanish - Ver. 1.0\nItalian - Ver.1.0\nBrazilian portuguese - Ver.1.0\nChinese - Ver. 1.1\nPolish - Ver. 1.1\n  Czech - Ver. 1.1\nCroatian - Ver. 1.0\nRussian - Ver.1.0\nUkrainian - Ver. 1.0\n   Hungarian - Ver.1.0\nWe have serious plans for the future and actually already working on the first big expansion of Battalia Universe. We want to expand the universe step by step and you will get even more nice artwork, beautiful miniatures and interesting game play! The first expansion will include game material for 2 new factions, resp. for 5-6 players, additional peace of game board, some new Great Artefacts with new powers, the Storm Gates - places on the map, which you can use to travel from one to another gate in a different parts of the much bigger map for 6 players.... and of course a few new miniatures - 2 Heroes for the Wolfsclan and 2 Riders for the Tigerblessed :). We will add some NPCs (Mouflon & Mammoth riders), which belong to nobody, but will be aggressive to all heroes and will be moved from all players (clockwise) according to a special rule in one single turn...  The NPCs will come through the Storm Gates and because they are extremely strong, they will try to make troubles on the map. Since we'll have 6 Gates - the D6 will decide from which gate they will appear each particular time :) ! All of this will come with the first expansion and we do not want to add more to the game play now, because of so many reasons. Balance is always important! And sometimes to add MORE is actually LESS in terms of the quality of the game play. The game is already a deep strategy game, so we fear that the complexity of the game will rise to unknown heights, if we add a lot of specific abilities now. That's why, we are very cautious with this topic and will add only the portion which is tested and already approved from our designers team (s. f.e. the Hero Sheets down below). The rest will come with the expansions. Please watch the reviews, all of them emphasize one thing - that the game is actually easy to learn and accessible, but very complex and deep as it is in the basic version.\n                                                                                                Click on the picture to see all designs.\n                                                                          REVIEW: BATTALIA THE CREATION on BGG, by Nikolay Zhekov\nShort Introduction from OTSBGR, that gives a very good quick overview:\nReview from Michael Von Kirchmeyer - Off The Shelf Board Game Reviews\nAnd now we have an actual SAMPLE GAME-PLAY VIDEO from Michael - Off The Shelf Board Game Reviews\nHere one more video showing Game rules - the LONG version. In part 1 Michael explains all the rules in detail!\nBattalia: TC Review from Undead Viking\nBattalia: TC preview from Board Game Brawl with Nick Meenachan\n* Designer team note: The game material shown in the OTSBGR and Board Game Brawl videos are very early PROTOTYPE - The reviewers got the game a few weeks ago and meanwhile, we've improved a lot the design of the cards and other components like the Oracle and Game Board.\nWe ship from EUROPE (with lowered US shipping rate)\nWe lowered the shipping costs as much as possible for this campaign. The main shipping prices are described in the pledge categories and they will not change, if you pledge the category as described!  \nBut we have to explain some special cases. For example if you want to put some ad-ons in a specific pledge category. This action has the impact, that you will add unknown weight to something, that is calculated as it is and in the most cases even 200 gr. (f.e. for one T-shirt or a dice box) could change dramatically the shipping cost situation, since the most of our rewards are calculated to be under 2 kg. - it counts as a \"small package\" and has relatively low shipping costs worldwide. Even in this case we cover a big part of the shipping costs to many overseas and other countries just to be able to offer you the best possible basic shipping conditions for the \"basic\" reward levels. But with all stretch goals unlocked, we will be really on the edge of this limit of 2 kg. and we will face completely new situation.\n\nSo our solution for this problem: if we reach the $80 000 stretch goal please add $5 for every add-on you pledged in addition to the standard levels, because the weight of the delivery package will overstep the 2 kg. limitation and the shipping costs will be more than doubled. Please note: in this case Fantasmagoria will cover even bigger share of the increased shipping price, so the $5 will be your more or less \"symbolical\" contribution to the changed situation. In this case we will ask all backers with add-ons to increase their pledge on a voluntary base supporting us to solve the difficult shipping problem.\n\nBefore reaching the $80 000 stretch goal  everything stays as it is .... no pledge changes have to be made! In general all of this concerns only ADD-ON backers, but if you want to help us out with the difficult situation feel free to add $5 as standard pledge backer. We highly appreciate this!\n\nOne more thing: please note that we've tried to calculate a great game with a lot of components and cool miniatures plus many additional stuff as stretch goals to a very low basic price! We hope that you will understand, that the pricing for shipment is out of our scope and we can do a lot of compromises, but somewhere we have to make the final cut.\n\nThanks for your understanding!\nFantasmagoria Games LLC are:\nSvetoslav Yankov - project coordinator in the USA\nAlexandar Guerov - Game design and Development, Graphic design.\nBorn in Sofia/Bulgaria in 1976.

We are cooperating with more than 30 famous publishers like FFG, KOSMOS, Hans im Glueck, AMIGO, IELLO and others. During this time we have published Bulgarian localized editions of many worldwide popular board games such as \u201cGame Of Thrones: The Board Game\u201d, \u201cSid Meier\u2019s Civilization\u201d, \u201cThe Legends Of Andor\u201d, \u201cUbongo\u201d, \u201cCarcassonne\u201d, \u201cWizard\u201d, \u201cAtlantis\u201d, \u201c King Of Tokyo\u201d, etc\u2026 This means a lot of EXPERIENCE for us! Our production sites are located mainly in Germany, US and China, so international logistics are not an obstacle for us and meanwhile we know very well how to play the \u201cbig game\u201d called PUBLISHING. \nPlease note: the estimated delivery date is mid-November 2015, but please keep in mind that this is only an informed guess. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We will do our best to minimize this as much as possible, but if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all we are always ready to refund pledges in full. \nOf course, there are risks with every project, but we hope that our track record in publishing and our commitment to do everything as good as possible will gain your trust in us , dear Backer! Battalia: The Creation will be our first own \u201cbaby\u201d and we don\u2019t want to do anything wrong after two and a half years of development. \nProduction shipping or customs delays are always possible, but since our game is 95% complete, a small delay is probably the worst thing that could occur on this project. The most sophisticated part of our project is probably the production of the Battalia heroes. Yes, exactly \u2013 these large and beautiful, but really complicated for production figurines. They are expensive, the process takes a lot of time and commitment, but the result is really worth the effort \uf04a. To ensure a smooth and accurate production and delivery, we are cooperating with an old partner who is among , the best production factories in Germany - a renown specialist in the board game field with really high quality standards for everything they produce \u2013 miniatures, game material, game board, boxes and so on\u2026. This should put everyone's minds at ease, regarding quality and delivery schedule! \nWe have no reason to expect that something could go terribly wrong, but in case that this happens, please check our refund policy.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, charges included, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. After this period a refund without any explanation is still possible, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and Stripe payment processing fees (as we will not be refunded by them after this 60 day period). However, once we\u2019ve begun packaging your rewards for shipment (usually 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), refunds are no longer possible. \nImportant: If a game or component cannot be delivered at all (which is very unlikely), at your wish we will refund you the full amount, including fees, or we will try to work with you per e-mail and find a satisfactory solution for your individual case. \nPlease note: All refunds requested during the original 60 day period are returned to your credit card via Stripe. Refunds requested after this period will be processed via PayPal only!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Attention: potential late pledgers!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Small reminder: no plans for big distribution in retail for the expansion's CEdition box!", "update_content": "Dear backer,  \ntoday one of our great supporters on the Stormgate campaign Nicole reminded me to post an update here - to the complete community from the first campaign, in order to remind you about one important side aspect of the new campaign and our strategy about the expansion CEdition box.

So, in short:\nImportant note: NO RETAIL version of the Stormgates CEdition expansion box is scheduled for next year and in our general plans. For now we prefer to work only for the Kickstarter community due to many meaningful reasons and the only one not to call the whole box officially Kickstarter exclusive is that we will distribute some minor quantities of games to some loyal retailers due to the round up needed to produce a reasonable number of this edition in the planned print run.

There are 16 characters on the board, and each player secretly embodies one of them.. Each player also has 3 secret targets he must eliminate, without being discovered. The players have two actions each turn, (choosing from the following) : move any character anywhere on the board, eliminate a character (different ways of doing it), make an identity check by the police. The trick is, when a character is eliminated, nobody says by who or how ! You must apply yourself in blending your true hitman in a crowd of possible suspects, or guess which character is the hitman of the other players.\nAs time goes by in 10' to kill, you will feel pressure and suspicion weight on your shoulders. 10 minutes is a short time, but it can sometimes be very long when all eyes are on you!

Only one kill per player and per turn is allowed.\nMove a character :\nA player can move any character he/she wants on the board, including policemen. To move a character, take it and put it on any other location tile.\nKill a character :\nOnce per turn, a player may kill a character on the board. A character can only be killed with the player\u2019s hitman. The hitman must use one of the 3 authorized weapons to kill: Gun, Sniper Rifle or Knife. The hitman must remain unseen when he kills his target. (For more details read the rules book). When a player performs a kill, he takes the victim and says: \u201cthis character has been killed\u201d. The player never says nor reveals the character he/she used to do it or the way he/she used. Because keeping their hitman secret identities is an essential part of the game, players should try to kill with as many suspects as possible.

Identity checks are performed only by policemen. Move a policeman on a tile with a character on it and investigate his identity. If the character is the player\u2019s hitman, he must reveal it. The player who discovered the hitman's identity takes the character and the matching tile and put them in front of him.\nA player is never eliminated from the game. Even when he /she has lost his/her hitman, the player can still play and win by discovering the identites of other players.\nWhen the party is over, players count their prestige points according to what they have in front of them !\nIn the game there are 2 kinds of location tiles: normal and sniper rifle potential spot.\nTo use Sniper rifle, your hitman needs to be on a blue edge location tile marked with a \"sight\" symbole.\nWhen starting a game, build the board as you want. We recommend that you do not make square.

We are very proud of this!\n\"Terribly addictive!\", Monsieur Guillaume from Tric Trac (http://www.trictrac.net/)\nWant to know more? Check these articles about the game (in French):\nTric Trac (French)\nLudovox (French)\nJaureic'\u00e0 jouer (French)\nGeklette (French)\nIf you don\u2019t understand French reviews, don\u2019t worry, the only thing to remember is: this game is fun as hell! (according to my mother and some guy I met in a party).\nThe illustrations are signed by Pauline Detraz (http://paulinedetraz.fr/), a french artist. Her work is really fantastic. She has captured the mood of the game through characters both cute and vicious!\nYou can see below some of her wok:\nWork in progress for the Tiger\nWork in progress for the Cop\nA few examples of buildings for location tiles\nAnd as we are fans of pop-culture, we asked her to put some easter-eggs in a few tiles! Examples:\nCan you find them all?\nWe wanted the shipping fees to be as low as possible for everyone:\n5\u20ac for France\n7\u20ac for all others countries around the world\nFree, if you pick up the game at Le Nid, Cocon ludique in Paris (France)\nThis project is EU friendly and can be shipped anywere in the world\nThe fulfillment will be entrusted to ideaspatcher, a french company that already do this for other KS as stonemaier games. So don't worry about that. Shipping will be in good hands.\nLa boite de jeu was born in late 2013. Benoit, Benjamin and Timoth\u00e9e have been knowing each other from high school, but have since worked in different fields. Gathered by their common love for boardgames, each one of them brings his own skills to the company. This teamwork allows them to publish games with a really good care: from a great idea to a great product.\nFounder of La boite de jeu, Benoit is the core member of the company. He's also a game author (Invazions, 10' to kill) and uses his knowledge to interact with the authors, to choose the artists and to select the games-to-be. He's also a fairly average Magic player but he carries on hoping that one day he will go to pro-tour!\nBenjamin studied Advertising in a French school and takes care of the communication aspect. From website creation to rulesheet page layout, he uses his skills to bring a proper communication for every game. He told us that once he opened the fridge using the Force, but we still have our doubts...\nMan in the shadow, Timoth\u00e9e is the manager of the company. He takes care of the accounting, the logistics and so on, to make our player fantasies possible. He told us he's also the nephew of the cousin's brother of a guy who once knew the real Harry Potter!\nPauline is the artist of 10' to kill. Professional graphic artist she is all into illustration work, photo and video. She graduated from Emile Cohl school of art and she completed her training within ICOM Lyon (France). After serving for two years as art director in an advertising agency from Lyon (France), she now works on freelance for agencies, companies and individuals on various media creations. Pauline would like to be professional NBA player. But we haven't told her yet that she's not allowed to play with her feet.\nA big thank you to Mathieu and Thibal who helped us a lot with this game! They are a bit ugly (so no photos to preserve your eyes) and wicked but they were very helpful.\nThe game will be produce in Poland by Axel.pl. We know this partner, we know the quality of his work and we are very confident for 10' to kill. This printer is already working with many boardgame publishers (Galakta, Pegasus spiel, etc...) and quality is always at its best.\nAfter the campaign, we\u2019ll need about 3-4 weeks of work to finalize everything and about 3-5 weeks for production (provided by the printer). Then the games will be sent to backers. That is why Septembre is a reasonable delivery time.\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n10' to kill has already been designed and play-tested, so we can produce the game very \n\nquickly after the Kickstarter campaign.

Depending on which of these (or other) will \"get the job\", the miniatures may or may not be produced seperately by DrawLab (Greece).\n\nSHIPPING - Shipping is a huge expense. As we do not know in advance where our backers are from, the 20% we are calculating with is a budget. Actual shipping costs will most probably be higher than this, we will cover extra costs ourselves. \nCOMMITMENT - I personally invested thousands of euros as well as a lot of time and energy in this project over the past 2 years - which I enjoy by the way! I will keep contributing financially by taking care of part of the shipping cost and other expenses such as 3D sculpting for production.\nCONCLUSION - As we may not need the total number of copies we are required to produce to meet production minimums, we would have spare inventory to sell after all rewards are shipped. With the money generated from this, designers will finally get some compensation for the excellent work they've done. I hope you agree and will help make this happen by backing this project!\nIf our funding goal is exceeded, additional funds will be used for even better quality components such as more casino quality poker chips, more miniatures (up to 5 new bosses with unique SKILL) and even a \"hitman\" style poker case! \n\n\u20ac 24,000 BADABING BADABOOOOM, the game will be MADE!\n\n\u20ac 25,000 LOCKED: Upgrade 5 cardboard \"SKILL\" tokens to poker chips.\n\u20ac 26,000 LOCKED: Upgrade 12 company tokens to 3mm thick coin tokens.\n\u20ac 27,000 LOCKED: Will be revealed as campaign progresses ....\nNOTE: Additional miniatures are not included in the \"ASSOCIATE\" pledge level.

We are a small team of passionate board game players, (including a warrior, a snow queen, a leprechaun, a dwarf, a giant and a dream walker), who also have some experience in board game publishing and who with a little help form their friends, after more than 2 years of development, have finally finished their first own game. Hurray!! If you want to learn more about us, check our bio, website and the information at the bottom.\nNow, let me walk you trough our project.\nWhat kind of game is this?\nBATTALIA: The Creation is a medium weight strategy game for 2-4 players, ages 13 and up. An expansion for up to 6 players is on our schedule, but for now let\u2019s focus on the basics: the game combines the mechanics of map construction, deck building, hero and area control and unique calendar mechanics.\nIn-Game Layout\nWhat actually happens during the game?\nIn the base game, you will buy useful artefacts and hire battle units to support your armies, you will build roads and cities and send your heroes to battle - you will have to find the most powerful mixture of all these assets and apply them at the right moment, so you could claim to be the rightful ruler of Battalia and win the game. A victory can be obtained through aggressive conquest or a peaceful development of your own city system (if you are lucky and the others let you ... :) .\nThe interesting game play will provide you with the opportunity to make key decisions and turn the tides of even the grimmest outcomes. A player can outmaneuver and BE outmaneuvered by his opponents at any point during the game. Dynamic atmosphere and intense battles are key factors in the overall experience, however the game strives to stimulate planning and strategy over rash and impulsive decisions.\nIn general this is not a luck based game, because of the core deck building mechanics, but a die is integrated as an optional element and is the ingredient, which spices up the game for all the fortunate fellows! You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.\nThe game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.\n\n\nGame Features:\nBasic game mode\nAdvanced game mode for experienced players\nAlternative game scenarios - including completely new game setup for adventurous type of players.\nModular map, built during the game \nFour factions - the Bearfolk, the Cloudborn, the Emberians, the Islanders\nUnique calendar mechanics\nUnique cards purchase mechanics\nVideo rules (available at the end of this summer)\n\nWhat is in the box?\nThe game contains the following components:\nGame board\nA special dial, called \u201cThe Sun Oracle\u201d\nAt least 333 cards\nA bunch of city tokens - 61 pcs.\n8 Miniatures\n4 Reference sheets\n1 Die - standard D6\nAnd of course - a Rulebook - 12 pages\nAnd here is the components breakdown:\nUnits are the heart of any players deck. There are four types resp. ranks - Frimen, Chiefs, Priests and Lords. These cards are used for creating new artefacts, building roads or cities and of course for conducting battles.\nThere are seven types of artefacts, each of them with its own special ability. The players use them for faster development, to upgrade their units, to transform their factions, to travel on the game board, etc. - they will give you a lot of flexibility.\nThe Great Artefacts are powerful objects crafted in ancient times. Every one of them has its own unique ability and provides big advantages to the player who earned it.\nTerrain cards can be cities or roads. They are used for the construction of the map, and.. well - to gain victory points. No matter how strong is your deck, if you don\u2019t have cities, you have nothing!\nWhat we have here is 56 x 56 cm game board, city tokens to mark the level and the owner of the cities, reference sheets to help the players with the different costs in the game and the supply cards which are actually very, very important cards, as they are used for hiring units, building roads, traveling and more. \nNow, let me tell you a few words about the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players and it could support you, if you catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides you through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands.\nSome pictures of the first prototypes and size reference.\nThe miniatures. There are 8 large scale miniatures which represent the players\u2019 heroes in the game. These figures are the leaders of a player\u2019s armies and mark players\u2019 presence on the game board. Plus - they look amazing!\nThe factions.\nFour factions coexist in the world of Battalia. Most of the cards in the game (units, artefacts and terrain cards) and the 8 figures belong to one of the four factions. A leading concept in the game is that the four factions can freely collaborate with each other, but many units from the same faction, using their own artefacts, are much stronger together. Also, unlike all other games where the players choose their factions, in this game the factions choose the players.\nThe Cloudborn\nThe Bearfolk\nThe Islanders\nThe Emberians\nBATTALIA : The Creation - PDF English rule book - not final, we are still editing spelling & wording!\n                                          Like Battalia: The Creation on facebook\n    Here the short Introduction from OTSBGR, which came last, but gives a very good quick overview :\nYou definitely should watch this one!

We are cooperating with more than 30 famous publishers like FFG, KOSMOS, Hans im Glueck, AMIGO, IELLO and others. During this time we have published Bulgarian localized editions of many worldwide popular board games such as \u201cGame Of Thrones: The Board Game\u201d, \u201cSid Meier\u2019s Civilization\u201d, \u201cThe Legends Of Andor\u201d, \u201cUbongo\u201d, \u201cCarcassonne\u201d, \u201cWizard\u201d, \u201cAtlantis\u201d, \u201c King Of Tokyo\u201d, etc\u2026 This means a lot of EXPERIENCE for us! Our production sites are located mainly in Germany, US and China, so international logistics are not an obstacle for us and meanwhile we know very well how to play the \u201cbig game\u201d called PUBLISHING.\nPlease note: the estimated delivery date is mid-November 2015, but please keep in mind that this is only an informed guess. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We will do our best to minimize this as much as possible, but if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all we are always ready to refund pledges in full.\nOf course, there are risks with every project, but we hope that our track record in publishing and our commitment to do everything as good as possible will gain your trust in us , dear Backer! Battalia: The Creation will be our first own \u201cbaby\u201d and we don\u2019t want to do anything wrong after two and a half years of development.\n Production shipping or customs delays are always possible, but since our game is 95% complete, a small delay is probably the worst thing that could occur on this project. The most sophisticated part of our project is probably the production of the Battalia heroes. Yes, exactly \u2013 these large and beautiful, but really complicated for production figurines. They are expensive, the process takes a lot of time and commitment, but the result is really worth the effort \uf04a. To ensure a smooth and accurate production and delivery, we are cooperating with an old partner who is among , the best production factories in Germany - a renown specialist in the board game field with really high quality standards for everything they produce \u2013 miniatures, game material, game board, boxes and so on\u2026. This should put everyone's minds at ease, regarding quality and delivery schedule!\nWe have no reason to expect that something could go terribly wrong, but in case that this happens, please check our refund policy.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, charges included, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. After this period a refund without any explanation is still possible, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and Stripe payment processing fees (as we will not be refunded by them after this 60 day period). However, once we\u2019ve begun packaging your rewards for shipment (usually 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), refunds are no longer possible. \nImportant: If a game or component cannot be delivered at all (which is very unlikely), at your wish we will refund you the full amount, including fees, or we will try to work with you per e-mail and find a satisfactory solution for your individual case.\nPlease note: All refunds requested during the original 60 day period are returned to your credit card via Stripe. Refunds requested after this period will be processed via PayPal only!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "FANTASMAGORIA Games LLC\n3 created \u00b7 56 backed\nFantasmagoria is a young board game publisher and a creative studio.

In this game, you play either an evil lord with vast necromantic powers or a mob of townfolk who have been alerted to his approach. Your object as the lord is to fight your way through the village and reach the cemetery, where you will raise an undead army. Your object as the townsfolk is to stop the villain from defiling your ancestral burial grounds and raising up his horrifying army.\nCheck out Lord of the Dead on Board Game Geek and join the converstations!\nMore content = greater replayability. And that's never a bad thing, right? Here is the expanded list of components in Lord of the Dead, including all stretch goals made possible by the Kickstarter community:\nRULES: Basic rules, advanced options for neutral monsters and interactive terrain, and detailed turn descriptions for each side.\nSCENARIO PACK: A set of six different scenarios, giving you options for single player, three-player (both vs. and co-op), arena mode, and even campaign-style story mode.\nHEX MAP: With turn summaries, unit rosters, a tracker for health, magic, & reinforcements, and a black magic tracker.\nTOWNSFOLK DIE-CUT COUNTERS: A horde of villagers and reinforcements, enough to fill 1/3rd of the entire map.\nGRAY LORD of the DEAD DIE-CUT COUNTERS: Eight different lords, spell trackers, and minions, color-coded for multi-lord play.\nBLUE LORD of the DEAD DIE-CUT COUNTERS: Eight different lords, spell trackers, and minions, color-coded for multi-lord play.\nMONSTER DIE-CUT COUNTERS: For those who want the full experience, these randomly-spawned creatures wander around the battlefield and attack the closest unit.\nDIE-CUT ATTACK CARDS: For those who prefer a more strategic, less random game, a sheet of attack cards are provided, giving you the option of diceless play.\nZIP LOCK BAGS: One large bag for the game, and several smaller bags to keep your counters and cards organized.\nPRINT & PLAY: All game files are available for both 8.5\"x11\" and A4 paper. Print off replacements for lost components, extra copies for your friends or as reference, or beef up your game with more counters! The print & play also includes a new map: Cathedral Defense. The lord of the dead is attacking the cemetery on the print map. On this one, he's defending the cemetery from the horde of villagers.\nThis is the upgraded board, made possible by the generosity of this project's fantastic backers!!\nThe board is printed on 14 pt cover stock with UV gloss coating on both sides. The rules are on one side, the board on the other. The counters and optional diceless cards will be die-cut on a separate sheet. Just punch out the counters, add a 6-sided die (or use the cards), and you're ready to play! The game folds up small enough and light enough to be mailed as a letter, so you save money on shipping and customs. I've already tested this out with international mailings to playtesters in Australia and Europe, without any hassle at all!\nOne player chooses one of the eight lords of the dead: the Necromancer (the basic lord), the Banshee (with an area of effect attack),the Shadow Wraith (who is incorporeal, and so can occupy the same hex as any other unit), the Pumpkinhead (who alone among the lords has a ranged basic attack), the Vampire (who can heal himself when he hits with a basic attack),the Lich-King (a particularly powerful commander of the undead), the Demon-Prince (whose curses cannot be broken) or the Elder Horror (a brutal Lovecraftian monstrosity). Each has a starting health and harvested souls. As he takes damage, his health decreases. If his health is reduced to 0, he dies. As he casts spells, his harvested souls decrease. If his harvested souls is reduced to 0, he can no longer cast spells. He can increase souls by killing townsfolk. Few of his spells trigger immediately. Instead, he keeps track of spell progress via trackers, advancing each spell turn-by-turn until it triggers. Some trigger several turns in a row, some have a one-time effect. One, Call to the Grave, turns a villager into an undead servant. The lord has several play options available to him: leech the townsfolk's life to bolster his own, freeze them in place, kill them outright, or raise them as undead slaves.\nIn this early playtest, the Lich-King and Shadow Wraith team up against the villagers in a 3-player game.\nThe townsfolk player selects his starting army equal to the value of the lord. There are nine types of townsfolk: expendable Commoners, stronger Thugs, magic-flinging Wise Ones, aggressive Soldiers, long-ranged Foresters, swift Cavalry, creature-controlling Shaman, bomb-flinging Engineers, and anti-magic Paladins. Each is weak, compared to the dark lord, but together they are strong. As the lord nears the graveyard, the urgency of their mission grows. Unlike the lord, who must bolster his ranks by killing villagers, the townsfolk automatically grow stronger each turn and are able to summon increasing amounts of reinforcements from the garrison. Townsfolk have several play options available to them: overwhelm with cheap hordes, rain missiles from afar, or attack directly. With judicious positioning and a bit of luck, they can stop the lord.\nEach unit has six stats: Speed (how far it can move each turn), Attack (how likely it will hit), Range (how far its attack reaches), Health (how many hits it takes to kill it), Harvested Souls (how much spell-casting power it has), and Cost (its overall value).\nI'll try to make this as open, honest, and clear as possible. This is the approximate timeline for project phases, from the design of the game to estimated incentive fulfillment.\n\nDesign - done\nAlpha Playtesting - done\nGraphic Design - done\nPrototyping - done\nBeta Playtesting - done\nEditing - done\nArtwork - done\nProduction Proofing - done\nDomestic Test Mailing - done (IN 2 days, AK 2 days, NY 3 days, FL 4 days)\nInternational Test Mailing - done (Australia 6 days, Switzerland 8 days, Finland 11 days)\nKickstarter Crowdfunding - done (2199 fantastic backers, $20,516 total, 2279% funded!!)\nFunds Deposited - Monday, June 8\nPrint Run Commissioned - Monday, June 8\nPrint Run Shipped - Thursday, June 11\nPrint Run Arrives - Tuesday, June 16\nIncentives Mailed - Wednesday, June 17 - Saturday, June 27 (The response to this project has been overwhelming.

It is time for an adventure.\nI just hope the dragon will take it easy on you during your first run.\nAssault on Doomrock is a cooperative game set in a fantasy world, that can be played by 1 to 4 players. A complete adventure takes from 2 to 3 hours.\nWhat is the gameplay like?\nStep 1 - Gather the party!\nGenerate your hero by combining a hero card and a trait card. Grab your set of ability cards, dice, health tokens and steel yourself for a difficult journey. The game is quite challenging!\nStep 2 - Adventuring!\nTravel through the randomly assembled deck of area cards. Explore locations, complete objectives, experience events and look for gold and trouble. Try reaching Doomrock Mountain in time.\nStep 3 - Gear up!\nBuy, loot, or steal awesome gear! You would especially like these epic items the dragon is sleeping on.\nStep 4 - Level up\nSpend silver to level up during camps. Draw 3 random cards and keep one. Don't be surprised if your warrior friend suddenly starts shooting fireballs from his eyes! Whatever combinations work between your party members.\nStep 5 - Do battle!\nIn order to win the game you must overcome 3 random and increasingly difficult encounters.\nThe battles play out in a unique system, that does not use a grid or distance measuring, yet provides a wide array of tactical options. There are no player turns, heroes perform their actions in any order they like. This opens opportunities for a lot of insane party combinations.\nIn battles heroes roll dice at the start of the round and assign them to ability cards to plan their round as a party.\nEnemies are controlled by their dedicated artificial intelligence decks. This creates thematic encounters that play out differently every time.\nWhy do we think Assault on Doomrock is special?\n1. Variable scenarios\nAlmost every aspect of the game is assembled randomly from decks of cards: heroes, hero traits, encounters, abilities, common items, epic items, adventure areas, objectives, events, encounters. This makes every game play out differently. There are nearly 300 cards in the game and almost every card is unique.\n\n2. Level up system\nYou are not limited in which direction you develop your character and looking for crazy combos between your party members is satisfying.\n\n3. True cooperation\nThere is no 'me' in this game, there is only 'we'. You control your own character during battles but group planning is essential.\n\n4. Humor\nIt\u2019s lighthearted, and a bit absurd but we never go overboard with it.\n\n5. Battle system\nUnique. Simple rules, giving a wide array of tactical options. No player turns, an exciting planning phase with dice allocation, minimal randomness when determining damage. Intelligent enemies without an \u2018overlord player\u2019'.\n\n6. Role player friendly\nThe abstract nature of battles and actions on the adventure map sets an excellent ground for player narration.\n\nIf you would like to see how the game plays, I recommend the original Rahdo Runthrough video:\nRahdo gets it! Although please keep in mind that this video has been recorded with a prototype of the base game.\nThe second edition of the base game features some balance tweaks, corrected card texts, and a revised rulebook.The quality of the components remains the same as in first edition.\nAlmost 300 cards and over 150 tokens!\nThe 8 promo cards from the original Indiegogo campaign are included in the second edition.\n.\nThe base game is required in order to use the contents of the expansion.\nDoompocalypse features additional cards for all the decks in the base game.\nTwo new heroes join the battle in the expansion.\nThe hardcore Bard and the dominant Commander both focus on teamwork oriented mechanics. Although the bard would argue that he is not 'the support act'. He is the main event.\nNew areas such as the Hidden stash or Lonely tower will riddle the adventure map with decisions. Just do not get distracted by all the ladies, heroes. Focus on the quest!\nThere are new enemies. Hope you are looking for a challenge, because they sure are tough. Battle the shark tornado, heart of darkness, armored skeletons, sneaky elven archers and more.\nThe encounters are presented on a new large card format, containing visualized battle setup. Each encounter card from the base game is included in the expansion, redone in the large format. Some effects have been tweaked and rebalanced, introducing additional AI cards and giving the old encounters some new life.\nBattle these enemies with original new items. Guns, throwing weapons, impossible new artifacts and accessories required to be operated by 2 heroes. These will change how you approach some of the battles.\nA set of new level up abilities is also added. Both utility skills and attacks in this expansion accentuate cooperation within the party.\nWe revisited the trait cards in this expansion, recreating old traits and adding a couple of new ones. These traits allow actions to be performed during the roll phase, if a specific set of dice results is achieved. Pushing your luck during roll phase has never been this interesting.\nLast but not least, battles now feature terrain elements, drafted from a random pool for every encounter. These objects, when approached, can be used by both the heroes and enemies, providing another layer of depth to the system.\nSlide on shields from a hill. Move your party members with a barrel. Throw enemies into bonfires. Flip tables and take cover behind them. Throw acorns at bosses! Fall into deadly traps! Yeah!\nIf you would like to learn more about terrain in the expansion, check out these previews:\nFlipping tables\nTraps and hazards\nThe mule\nWhat do you get in the expansion?\nExpansion rulebook\n6 new large scale encounter cards\n9 large scale revisited encounter cards from the base game\n46 artificial intelligence cards for the new encounters\n6 artificial intelligence cards for old encounters\n2 hero cards\n10 trait cards\n2 setting cards\n8 area cards\n15 terrain cards with around 20 terrain tokens.\n2 large tokens for dividing the battlefield\n8 starting ability cards\n12 level up ability cards\n10 common item cards\n10 epic item cards\n8 wilderness event cards\n8 mountain event cards\n5 additional silver/gold tokens\nExtra heroism/shield and secret/time markers in quantity that will fill the remaining space on punch-boards (exact quantity currently unknown).\nThe final contents of the expansion may be expanded by several cards and tokens from stretch goals.\nThe final number of components may vary slightly.\n\nPlease note that with exception of the first stretch goal, the rest affects only the content of the expansion.\nThe second edition of the base game went through minor balance and text error corrections. As a sign of respect for our original supporters, we are releasing an upgrade pack that will set your cards from first edition on par with the second edition. This upgrade is free for everyone ordering only the expansion, either via worldwide delivery, or Essen pickup.\nIf you would like to improve your base game without ordering the expansion, you may order it via a separate pledge.\nThe upgrade pack consists of approximately 40 cards and a revised rulebook. The exact final contents of the upgrade pack may vary slightly.\nPlease note that, if you ordered the base game via this Kickstarter campaign, you do not need an upgrade pack, since the version you ordered is the second edition.\nThe upgrade pack is a one-time Kickstarter offer. It is very unlikely that it will become available anywhere else.\n As a sign of appreciation for our supporters, each non-anonymous supporter's name will be engraved on the wall of doom, situated around the sides of the inner box part and box insert.\nWe barely had enough room to place all the names on the sides of the box during the last campaign, so we will now also use the box insert if need be. However, names will be split between two boxes now.\nEach supporter ordering the base game or base game with the expansion, will have his name printed on the base game box.\nEach supporter ordering only the expansion, or simply supporting us, will have his name printed on the expansion's box.\nBD Games is a young game development company located in Poland.\nToday it is basically a two man show, consisting of the company owner and lead designer:\nTom Stasiak and a co-designer and editor: Christopher Niewiadomski. Bartosz P\u0142awecki, with his unique art style, is engaged in this project as our primary illustrator.\nWe are gamers of all genres and platforms, making games out of passion. The ones we would like to play.\nWith last year's Assault on Doomrock release, we earned the trust of many gamers with our original approach and attention to detail.\nWith numerous new ideas in mind, in the future we would like continue to develop quality games for the undeniably awesome board gaming community.\nSupport us!\nIf you think this project is worth supporting, please share this project on your social media.\nBD games is just 2 guys who are not big with social media. Any help with spreading the word about this project is greatly appreciated!\nThis Kickstarter campaign has been prepared in collaboration with Mage Company. .\nhttp://www.magecompany.com/\nThis is the state of the project at the date of Kickstarter launch.\nThe base game has been developed and released in 2014. Second edition in an upgraded version almost ready and waiting to be produced. We are just making a few final decisions regarding some balance factors.\nWe have been working on the expansion for a year now and it is in its final stages of development in both the gameplay and graphical department.\nWhat we ask for are funds required for production and delivery of the games.\nOur primary goal all along was to bring the expansion to the Essen 2015 fair for pick up and send the Kickstarter copies worldwide just after the fair.\nThis is a goal similar to the one we had in 2014 with the Indiegogo campaign. We assumed to deliver the games in November, but non Europe backers were receiving them until mid January. This was our first project.\nThis year we speak from experience. The estimated delivery time is by the end of year for Europe and USA. Some countries like Australia or Canada may receive the games in early 2016, due to longer shipping time. The games will be shipped from Poland.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRegarding delays.\nWe really want to exhibit at the Essen fair of 2015. \nSince this is a date set in stone, games have to be produced before then.

Recreate history or follow your own path!\nBecome the tribe leader by exploring the landscape and gathering the raw materials needed to develop tools and skills. Fish for food, hunt for deerskins and trade with the other players. Travel the earth by foot or canoe while also making sure to appease the gods.\nDo you have it in you to become a legend amongst your tribe?\nIn Epoch - Early Inventors you and the other players are all part of the same tribe and compete for leadership by gaining the most status. You must explore and forage in order to develop bronze-age technologies and offer to the gods. At first the number of possible inventions may seem daunting, but after one or two games, you will have a rough idea of how it all fits together. And then you will start to appreciate the numerous possible strategies and the depth of the game.\nAt the start of the game all landscape tiles are shuffled and placed face down on the table to form a  rugged unknown world. During the game, you will explore these tiles. Grass and forest will be easy to cross. Drifting sands and mountains a lot harder.\nEpoch - Early Inventors has a unique game system: each of the landscape tiles features a tool or skill on the back that is only revealed when you explore it.\nInvent a new tool by 'paying' the resources depicted on the tile. Each player will develop 6-10 of the 21 available technologies in a game. So choose carefully!\nTo invent a tool or skill, you will need raw material and/or processed material. You can acquire raw material when you work. The landscape surrounding your camp will influence which materials can be easily found and which ones are more difficult to come by. Putting your back into it may help you acquire more material, but also requires more food.\nSince the amount of effort you can exert is limited, you will often want to move your camp onto the landscapes where the raw material you need is easy to come by. Of course if you have already invented gloves, axe, knife, shovel and/or mining axe it takes less effort to get the raw material you need.\nMoving your camp means you have to carry all the resources you have already gathered but you can only carry so much. Any excess food or material must be left behind. Anyone (such as another player) is free to take any of these resources that they happen to find.\nDomesticating the horse or inventing the basket, canoe or cart enables you to carry more resources. Having boots or a cloak means less food is required when moving around.\nAs you can imagine, moving around and working costs a lot of food. So at some point you will need to gather extra food or go fishing. Technologies such as pottery, sowing, a fishing pole, hoop nets and spears increase your ability to acquire food. Alternatively you could go hunting, especially if you have a bow or a spear. You can eat the deer you catch immediately or take an extra action to butcher it. Then you not only get food, but also skins, antlers and sinew, which are a great help in inventing new tools.\nTo cast bronze, make rope or leather, there has to be someone who invents it. Otherwise, no one will be able to create these processed materials at all.\nProcessed materials make it a lot easier to invent other skills. Without leather you cannot invent boots. Without rope, climbing the mountains is almost impossible.\nProcessed materials are also very much appreciated by the gods. There are always four holy places where you can bring an offer. The gods will reward you lavishly if you manage to offer to them all!\nReplayability guaranteed!\nEpoch - Early Inventors really gives you the feeling that you are living in the Bronze Age and inventing new tools along the way. Everything in the game is connected to each other in a logical and realistic way. No food means no travelling or working. If you do not work you cannot come by any raw material. Without raw material it is impossible to invent any new tool. If you cannot carry your stuff you have to leave it behind.\nMost of the time when you play this game, only about seventy percent of the tools or skills will be invented by the players and setup is almost completely random. This means that every game will be new and different. Will you follow the historical path or will you create your own?\nControlling key technologies is important since your opponents will want to bargain for their use. Combining your own inventions with those developed by others is the key to winning the game.\nEvery game will be a new journey and brings new insights! Are you able to develop the best combination of skills and tools? Can you spare enough to win the favor of the gods as well?\nShort overview\nComplete walkthrough\n         Please be aware that this is a Preview Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked, layouts and graphics may still be altered. So, some aspects of the final game may be different from what you see here. Please understand that during the Kickstarter campaign the project is still under development and all aspects of the game are subject to improvements.\nGerman and Dutch rulebooks will be added to BGG and my site as the campaign develops.\nGenuine historical theme\nWhereas in many games the theme is just a nice finish, in Epoch - Early Inventors every effort has been made to engrain the thematic aspects into the game.\nDuring the late Stone Age and Bronze Age humans developed many new tools and skills. This led to a huge step forward for our species. I have incorporated almost all known inventions from this period into this game. A group of archeologists from Leiden University ((http://www.leiden.edu/) have helped in designing the game with as much historical accuracy as possible.\nLike those early inventors from the Bronze Age, you can develop tools like axes, knives, bows, fishing poles and spears as well as skills like rope making, bronze casting and tanning. These tools and skills will be important in helping you improve your ability to gather food, fish, hunt butcher work and explore.\nThe appendix will not only explain each card in more detail but it will also contain interesting archeological background information.\nAdventure\nPlaying Epoch \u2013 Early Inventors is one big adventure. Not only does it incorporate a surprisingly large number of game elements, these elements are all combined into a seamless playing experience that will make you feel like you are an explorer in unknown territory.\nThe first few games are very explorative. You will find new ways of developing your clan. As your understanding of the game and its tiles grows, you will recognize that there is more to this game than just the collection of raw materials and the development of new skills.\nOffering to the gods is also a very important feature. They are picky and will only be satisfied by certain combinations of resources. First come, first serve means that players must \"race\" to be the first ones to offer a sacrifice.\nAnd just as you think you have seen it all, the expansion offers new tiles and strategies!\nCompetition and fun\nSince all players are clan members from the same tribe, there will be some wheeling and dealing, but no one can ruin your strategy or your game. There are so many strategies possible, that you can always head in in another direction if another player is in your way somehow.\nFor experienced players offering to the gods will become an exciting \"race\" towards the end of the game. But even then, there are always other options open if the player before you made the same offer you were planning on making.\nLuck\nEpoch - Early Inventors features a small component of luck. You can reduce the influence of that by developing the right tools. It all depends on the choices you make.\nBut if you want you can easily play the game without any luck. \nNumber of players\nEpoch \u2013 Early Inventors is very enjoyable with 3 or 4 players and also plays very well with 2 players.\n44 Tiles - 21 Different types: each with a landscape on the back and an invention on the front + 2 village tiles (Size appr.: 72x62x2mm card board).\n5 Holy places + 5 extensions (Size appr.: 72x62x2mm card board). The illustrations are not complete yet, what you see here is a  prototype (not all tiles are depicted).\n4 Carrier boards (2mm card board)\n48 Huts (wood), 64 Food cubes, 32 + 8 Status (2mm card board or wood), 4 Camps (wood), 7 Dice, 16 Offer tokens (2mm card board or wood).\nDepending on unlocked stretch goals, most printed components will hopefully be replaced by wooden components.\n200 Raw and Processed Material counters - flax, stone, clay, wood (twigs), deer, flint, (copper) ore, rope, antler, leather, skin, sinews and bronze. (Size: at least 26x26x2mm).\n4 Overviews, 2 Booklets, Game rules and Appendix (with interesting archeological background information).\n20 Tiles (10 different types), 3 Holy places, 1 Holy place extension and game rules.\nThe adventurer makes it possible to move onto unexplored tiles. The relic gives you 1 food each turn and 1 extra work power when working. The dog makes it possible to reroll the dice. The raft is a big canoe (with more storage room and higher status!). Tunneling enables you to dig for stone, flint and ore more efficiently. The negotiator is helpful when exploring: for every 2 food you can take 1 processed material.\nThe pathfinder earns an extra status every time you explore 2 cards in one turn. The venus figurine gives you extra status when offering. Wisdom allows you to invent a tool without paying the food needed to invent it. The traveler can exchange 1 processed material for any other material (max. twice per turn).\nThere will be three new holy places included. The first will split a fixed number of points among all players that offered at the holy place. The second holy place gives the highest reward to the highest number of different raw and processed materials offered by the players. The third one will ask you to offer raw and processed materials in a certain sequence. The more items in the sequence that you can offer, the more points you will receive.\nStrategies and player interaction\nThe extra landscape tiles and holy places are shuffled together with the tiles from the base game before setup. Of course you can also choose to replace tiles from the base game with some or all of the tiles from the expansion. The expansion does not influence the playing time!\nThe new tiles enhance the number of strategies possible. Furthermore, you will not be able to rely on inherent strategies, as the availability of certain tiles will vary each game.\nThe new tiles not only bring more variation to the game, but also more player interaction.\nBy backing this project you will make it possible to have this game produced!\nBut you will also be able to influence the physical development of the game. You will get a say in what player colours there will be. Which counters will be upgraded to playing pieces. You will even get a say in what extra sets of tiles you would like to have if we do not unlock all stretch goals!\nThe more stretch goals we reach, the more influence you have!\nSome of the stretch goals are exclusive to backers. You should be rewarded for supporting this board game from the start!\n                    Note: The playing pieces shown in the illustrations of the stretch goals  will not necessarily be available as options to choose from.\nIf there are more than 150 backers in any other language, I will add the game rules and booklet in their own language. The tiles will still have the English names.\nIf there are more than 250 backers in any other language, I will also be able to change the language on the tiles.\nI will roughly calculate this during the campaign, based on the country of origin of the backers. I will ask you what language you prefer after the campaign has finished.\nI will also launch this campaign on Spieleschmiede to attract extra (German) backers. These backers will count towards the totals needed to add extra languages to the game.\n                Note: This is your chance to get your hands onto this game that is normally only available in Germany and the Netherlands.\nI have chosen for the power of crowdfunding because of three reasons:\n1. I love the interaction with fans and the new ideas and inspiration this gives me.\n2. I believe crowdfunding is the future of the economy. Backers can help shape the product to their wishes.\n3. I want to make a series of games about the past. They will have different rules, but some elements will be the same. I would love to do this together with you!\nTo avoid shipping costs, you can pick up your game at Spiel'15 in Essen. Please choose the appropriate pledge level if you want to do this.\nIf you cannot or will not pick up your game, I will have it shipped to you. I have a fulfillment partner who will do this for me. They have over 10 years of experience with shipping games.\nShipping rates are fixed and will not change.\nCosts of the game including shipping are as follows (dollar prices based on the rate of 1,14 doller per euro):\nIf the game is not delivered because of an error on our part, we will resend it free of charge.\nIf the game is not delivered because of an error and/or other actions on your part (wrong address, recipient repeatedly absent at the provided address, etc.), you will have to pay \u20ac40 to have us resend the game to you (this includes the costs of the game returning to us).\nIf for any reason, you wish to withdraw your backing after the Kickstarter has ended, I will work with you to make this happen.\nIf you cancel within 14 days of the end of the Kickstarter campaign, I will be able to offer an 80% refund (less Kickstarter, bank and CC processing fees).\nFor a refund request after this 14 day period, please send me an e-mail via martynf.com and I will try to work with you for a partial refund if possible, but you will be responsible for return shipping (if necessary).\nIf for any reason you feel that your game is defective (ie you have a missing piece or the game is damaged), please email me via martynf.com. Please add photos if possible, and I will work to replace the missing or damaged items ASAP.\nGames for backers within the EU are shipped from within the EU, so you don't have to worry about extra charges.\nGames for backers within the United States are shipped from within the US. No worries about extra charges.\nBackers living outside the United States and EU, may have customs taxes added. Although this usually does not happen for games, it is the responsibility of individual backers to verify the shipping and taxes regulations within their own countries.\nGame specifications and contents shown above are prototypes and may be changed during final production. This is not my intention and I do not think it will happen, but there are always unforeseeable circumstances. If it does happen, I will keep you posted of course!\nKickstarter Exclusives listed here are considered Limited Edition. Should any remain after fulfillment of the campaign, they will be used as promotional items.\nAll Exclusives are subject to possible future inclusion in any potential future Kickstarter expansions should future demand warrant it.\nKickstarter Exclusives will NOT be available in any eventual retail copies.\nI will not accept complaints related to this campaign later than 12 months after it has finished.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce the project is funded, the risks are minimal.\n\nI have a European company producing the complete game. They have produced thousands of games, so they know what they are doing.\n\nThe illustrations are 90% finished at the start of the campaign. They will probably be finished before the end of it.\n\nI myself have published 4 games and 5 expansions (via Emma Games) in previous years (see www.martynf.com) and I ran a crowdfunding project for my game Oklahoma Boomers. \n\nThis game has no risky game pieces, so no delays are expected.\n\nIf anything does happen, however, I have planned enough time to correct it and make amends. \n\nAnd of course I will keep you posted about the progress.\n\nThe estimated delivery date is October 2015. If all goes well, I will be able to ship sooner. Due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Martyn F\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nPublished games and awards: 2018: Epoch - Early Inventors 2014: Limes (published by Abacus Spiele) - WINNER of the International Gamers...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Epoch - Early Inventors in stores!", "update_content": "Some of you might have despaired (I did a few times!), but the wait was worth it.

[/German]\nHier geht es zum DefShop Gewinnspiel - bis 19. May 2015\n  If funding is succesful, this is how it will be used:\n  56% \u20ac 15,000 Production and shipping to hubs in USA, Canada and EU\n  30% \u20ac   8,100 Worldwide shipping rewards to backers.\n  10% \u20ac   2,700 Kickstarter (5%) and Amazon (3-5%) fees.\n    4% \u20ac   1,200 Miscellaneous\n100% \u20ac 27,000 Total (funding goal)\nSHIPPING - As you can see, shipping is a huge expense. As we do not know in advance where our backers are from, the 30% we are calculating with is merely an estimate. If the vast majority of backers will come from the USA, Canada and EU, the amount needed for shipping will go down. Anything we can save on shipping will go towards production. \n\nPRODUCTION - Calculation for production is very tight but doable. Obviousely we will not be making any money if we just hit our goal, nor will we make any if we would exceed it by 50%. These extra funds would be used to further enhance the game with even better quality components and extra's such as additional miniatures. We started this project because we want this game to be produced in the best quality possible so we can be proud of it and enjoy it for many years to come. \nCOMMITMENT - I personally invested thousands of euros as well as a lot of time and energy in this project over the past 2 years - which I enjoy by the way! I also got help from many friends by calling in favors and promising favors in return...  \nCONCLUSION - As we may not need the total number of copies we are required to produce to meet production minimums, we would have spare inventory to sell after all rewards are shipped to backers. With the money generated from this, designers will finally get some compensation for the excellent work they've done. I hope you agree and will help make this happen by backing and sharing this project!\nThank you for reading this far! Still not had enough?!

I have this game buried deep in my brain. You can help me unlock the memories of the game. If you'd like to find out what it is, read on.\nBox mockup. Image not final.\nThe Apocrypha Adventure Card Game is the next evolution of the gameplay from two games I helped create: the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game and Betrayal at House on the Hill. It can be run as a fully cooperative adventure card game solo or in a group, or a gamemaster can take over and expand it into a full-blown roleplaying game. It's designed by me and my teammates at Lone Shark Games, with card text by authors like Jerry Holkins, Kij Johnson, Kris Straub, and Patrick Rothfuss.\nSet on the precipice of a modern day apocalypse, Apocrypha is an hour-long game that immerses 1 to 6 players in a conflict with the most dangerous entities in the universe. Players play \"saints,\" characters who can see the monsters lurking in every alley and school lunch room. These characters grow through multiple sessions of gameplay, unlocking repressed memory fragments that expand their powers and capabilities. You get a character card around which you can display these fragments in a card sleeve page, and can change the arrangement of your brain from game to game. A gamemaster can customize new content that leads the story anywhere she wants. Here are the playtest rules to the game.\nThe game is expanded by chapters of new cards, each chapter revealing a new type of threat and introducing new mechanics. All chapters in this campaign have been unlocked, meaning we'll have 1,300+ cards in the game. Each chapter has its memory fragments written in collaboration with a well-known author and friend of Lone Shark, so you can get inside their brains as well as ours.\nYou know, because that sounds completely safe.\nFor $66 plus shipping, you can get the Revelation Box, which includes more than 500 cards, including a 90-card first chapter called The Book of the Skinwalkers and a bonus chapter called The Secrets of Candlepoint. It also contains 20 dice, card game and RPG rules, and standup character pawns.\nFor $99 plus shipping, you can get the Revelation Box plus all the chapters we've unlocked during the campaign. There are eight chapter expansions with approximately 90 cards each in this set.\nFor $333 plus shipping, you can get the Master's Edition. That's a special upgraded version for the ultimate adventure card game player. With a beautiful embossed deluxe box in the style of Doctor Zeez's Aesculapian Journal (see below), the Master's Edition will be numbered and signed by Mike Selinker, have upgraded custom dice, an Apocrypha dice bag, and more! And of course it will have all the cards from the base set and all the chapters. The box will have an insert that will hold the cards in place, even if you put it on its side like on a bookshelf. The cover will be faux-leather with a strap to hold it shut. It will hold all the cards whether sleeved or not. It will look a bit like this.\nMockup of Master's Edition. Image not final.\n Here's a video of the inside of the Master's Edition.\nPLAY\n\nAnd if you want it all, then you need the Beast Box. For (ahem) $666, you get 1 Master's Edition signed by all the developers, 1 signed Revelation Box with all the chapters, 1 Ultra PRO character binder, 2 mission playmats, 18 deckboxes (9 of Hope, 9 of Doom), 1,300+ Ultra PRO sleeves, 5 more sets of dice so every player can have a set, 2 sets of promo cards, and printed stories and selections from the Apocrypha Bible.\nEach copy of the game will ship with at least 10 promo cards. These are multicolor fragment cards and a special Day One card.\nShipping for any edition is $8 in the USA, $25 in Canada and the EU, $30 in Australia, and $45 elsewhere. If you want more than 1 copy, add up the costs of shipping all your games individually, then cut it in half. This game is EU-friendly, and will ship to EU residents from within the European Union.\nYou bet. They're from our friends at Ultra PRO. To order add-ons, just add their amount to your pledge. Your shipping cost stays the same.\nYou can order this awesome official Ultra PRO character binder. The \"soulbinder\" contains 20 sleeve pages for characters and their fragments, and you can keep your punched out pawns in there too. You can add this on to any level for an additional $17. No additional shipping is required.\nUltra PRO binder mockup. Art by Nick Kay. Image not final.\nAnd these amazing Ultra PRO mission playmats. Each is 13.5\"x24\". We recommend one for a 1-2 player games, and two for a 3-6 player game. They're an additional $18 each, or two for $33.\nTwo Ultra PRO mission playmats, side by side. Image not final.\nAnd these cool \"Box of Hope\" and \"Box of Doom\" character deckboxes. Each box holds a character or a mission's cards. They're an additional $3 each, or 6 for $16. You might want 6 because that's 1 for each player.\nIndeed so. These:\nAt our previous goals, we unlocked the base set and all the chapters, with memories written by esteemed authors Matt Forbeck, Bruce Cordell, Jerry \"Tycho\" Holkins, Kij Johnson, Keith Baker, Erin M. Evans, Mary Robinette Kowal, Wolfgang Baur, Kris Straub, and Patrick Rothfuss.\nWe also unlocked a DriveThruCards custom card creator, 9 cross-chapter missions and 9 multicolor fragment promo cards!\nWe also unlocked a short story by Matt Forbeck and selections from the Apocrypha Bible!\nWe unlocked over a hundred new cards, bringing the number of cards in the game to an astonishing 1,300+ cards!\nWe unlocked a game mastering guide, 4 more dice, and 9 RPG missions in either the rulebook or a special GM's PDF.\nAnd because we got real close to $333,333, we unlocked a Day Zero promo card.\nThe Apocrypha Adventure Card Game is based on a system we came up with in 2011 that would allow the feel of a roleplaying game with all the pressure of a great board game. Designed to play in an hour, an adventure card game has each player build a character that lasts through a year or more of gameplay, growing and changing as cards pass through her deck. The first example of this was the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, released to considerable acclaim in summer 2013.\nApocrypha is a card-based roleplaying game and a roleplaying-like card game in the same box. Here is the playtest rulebook for the game in both of its modes. Without a gamemaster, the game will run itself, and do its best to kill you before you beat it. With a gamemaster, you will decide the story and how the characters will evolve. This is not a permanent decision; you can play a campaign where some sessions are run by the game and some are run by a gamemaster.\nEach player starts with a single character card among the 18 playable characters. Your character card shows your virtues (Mind, Body, Soul, and Rage, in some order), skills, powers, and what kinds and numbers of cards you have in your deck. Along the way you unearth repressed memory fragments that open up new powers, new cards, and a whole bunch of new problems. As your character grows, she becomes more powerful but more unstable, meaning an experienced character might want to adventure with a brand new one. You can place these fragments around your character card in whatever order you like, but the position of these cards\u2014and your position around the table\u2014matters a whole lot.\nCharacter and fragment cards. Images not final.\nChapter and mission cards. Images not final.\nYou will select a chapter to play. Each chapter has nine missions you can choose from. In the course of playing a mission, the characters cooperatively explore nexuses of great power and overcome the threats you uncover. Your goal in a typical mission is to track down a master and her minions, and thwart whatever evil they're undertaking. They may be altered by mutations, which make them stranger and tougher.\nNexus and mutation cards. Images not final.\nMaster and threat cards. Images not final.\nYou will find good cards called gifts for your deck, You might be branded with tattoos of those you take down. A deck of omens looms over the game, and each turn, you'll draw an omen and decide whether to investigate your nexus. If the omen deck runs out, you lose. If your deck runs out, you gain a death card which will slow down your character's growth. Gain enough of them, and you're gone forever.\nGift and omen cards. Images not final.\nThose are the basics, but there is a lot more to it. We'll unveil a series of nine gameplay-focused videos over the campaign. Here's an overview.\nPLAY\n\nHere's a video on how characters work, with me and developer Liz Spain.\nPLAY\n\nHere's how memory fragments work, co-starring writer Jerry Holkins.\nPLAY\n\nHere's one on setting up and winning, with developer Gaby Weidling.\nPLAY\n\n Here's another on investigations, with developer Chad Brown.\nPLAY\n\nAnd Chad and I continue to talk about gifts and dice rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHere's developer Tanis O'Connor and me on assisting and mutations.\nPLAY\n\nDeveloper Paul Peterson joins me to discuss threats and true threats.\nPLAY\n\nAnd here's the gamemastering video, where Gaby, Chad, and Liz go on a mission. You can see a full gameplay session in action here.\nThose are all our gameplay videos. Watch them all before Doctor Zeez writes the cause of your death in his journal.\nIt's 2016, and the apocalypse is nigh. Because of a veil called the Paradigm, the world believes monsters aren't real. Nonetheless there continue to be outliers, creatures and events that don't make sense. Most people ignore the outliers, because it's a lot easier to make sense of the world if you do. But the saints, an often misapplied name for a group of oddly powered individuals who can see through the Paradigm, have formed choirs of defenders of humanity. These choirs will go out and try to stem the incursions of monsters into the everyday world.\nA group of ancient and powerful entities called the Novem are at the height of their power, threatening to break the Paradigm. Each chapter of the game is about the forces of a Novem, and they all behave differently. One type of monster might be highly organized and plotting an all-out assault on humanity, while another might be hoping not to be discovered but be under a threat of revelation by another faction. Each chapter will feel very different, and you can move between them as much as you like. You can create your own stories in this world, which of course is your world with a few outliers. Because monsters don't exist.\nThe Secrets of Candlepoint is the base set chapter which features an invasion of a small city called Candlepoint, Wisconsin. It's recommended for starting play before beginning all the other chapters.\nThe Book of the Skinwalkers is about the fractured legions of the werewolf lord Keiros. His shapechangers have balkanized into street gangs defending minuscule turfs against each other. When the 80th Street Griffons clash with the Bronx Jackals, silver hollowpoints will fly.\nThe Book of the Deathless features the Novem Ereshkigal seeks to expand her army of flesheaters, spooks, and bloodsuckers. What they lack in creativity, they will make up in sheer numbers. Numbers which might eventually include you.\nThe Book of the Fae has a tripartite Novem named The Morrigan. The Phantom Queen appears as three bickering sisters, each trying to trick the others into doing her bidding. The fae are more than just enemies; maybe you can trick the faeries to your side.\nThe Book of the Animus depicts the spirit of the earth, Mother Gaia. She has a decidedly anti-human bent; nothing humanity has done for millennia has sat well with her. Gaia's spirits inhabit every animal, river, and blade of grass. You wouldn't want to make Mother angry. \nThe Book of the Dreamers introduces the Novem Nebuchadnezzar, whose sorcerers are unlocking their subconsciousnesses and loosing them on the world. What you see as nightmares, they see as weapons. So don't sleep, and you've got a chance. \nThe Book of the Damned is the province of the teacher Abramelin. The Damned truck with things they call demons, but whether Hell is on their side is quite unclear. The demons sure are in a foul mood about doing their bidding, and the Damned sure seem oblivious to that.\nThe Book of the Golems centers on the chosen of Aleph, the original Golem of Chelm. Aleph has few living followers; his creatures were once limited to animated clay and walking rock piles. Now science has given him robots and computers to work with.\nThe Book of the Serpents has a Novem who no longer answers his adherents. The dragon Quetzalcoatl is buried under a Mesoamerican ziggurat, or so his cultists say. The nagavanshi Princess Kuberanaga has taken the dragon's place among the Novem for now.\nThe Book of the Physicians caters to the Novem Celsus, the first surgeon amongst the Greeks. The Physicians believe they are healing the world, but their obsession with perfection through fleshcrafting is most definitely non-Hippocratic.\nThe Lone Shark Games creative team and friends have come together to create a sweeping new world of gameplay for you. Here's the team.\nI'm the co-designer of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Lords of Vegas, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Unspeakable Words, and many other games. I'm the author of the books Puzzlecraft, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and the interactive puzzle novel The Maze of Games, which we launched on Kickstarter. I co-designed the core of this game with Rian Sand, who came up with the world in which Apocrypha is set.\nThe development team is Lone Shark's adventure card game team: PACG lead developer Chad Brown, puzzle ninja Gaby Weidling, Smash Up designer Paul Peterson, PACG class deck designer Tanis O'Connor, PACG developer Keith Richmond, and Incredible Expeditions designer Liz Spain. Art director Mike Vaillancourt is crafting the artistic look. Former Playroom Entertainment design and development director Elisa Teague is our production manager. \nOur other team members are just as important. Lone Shark chief operating officer Marie Poole will be handling our distribution, and Geeky Hostess Tara Theoharis is co-managing our campaign. You will see all these fine folks throughout the campaign. And more.\nNovelist and game designer Matt Forbeck is building our story bible and leading our Remembrance Team. Here's the list of our memory authors:\nKeith Baker, creator of the card game Gloom and the RPG Phoenix: Dawn Command. See what Keith wrote about Apocrypha here.\nWolfgang Baur, publisher of Kobold Press, and creator of books like Deep Magic, Courts of the Shadow Fey, and The Free City of Zobeck. \nBruce Cordell, game designer for D&D and The Strange RPG, and author of ten Forgotten Realms novels.\nErin M.

You can see their work in this creepy teaser video, released before the campaign.\nPLAY\n\nI wouldn't worry about it. But while we're here, I'd like to introduce you to Doctor Zeez, one of our playable characters in Apocrypha. \nHe's a saint, but as you can probably guess from his plague mask, he's not exactly all that saintly. Nonetheless, he tries to prevent the monsters from bringing about the apocalypse, and if he gets to dissect a few of them along the way, so much the better.\nDoctor Zeez keeps a journal. And every few days during this campaign, he'll share an entry with you. Well, maybe not \"share,\" per se. He's not the sharing kind. But there may be something you can derive from each of his entries. Along the way, you might pick up a few fragments of your own. \nHere are journal entries #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, and #10. If you find something hidden, send it to us via the manner on the update and you'll get one of our Apocrypha virtual badges that you can use as your Kickstarter, Facebook, or Twitter icons. \nWatch for more from Doctor Zeez in the coming days. While we still have days to come, that is.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis game is big. We've been on projects that big for many years.

This is a fairly lengthy process, but please rest assured we're working very hard to make this as affordable as possible for all parties involved.\nUnited States and Canada (free shipping): This entire process will take about 45-50 days after final manufacture. Because this level is set up for free shipping, we've worked in the basic costs to our campaign pledge goals. For those backers that are local to Toronto, Ontario Canada or even closer to home, Guelph, we will be hosting a backers launch party where you will be invited to attend, meet the design team, have a drink and pick up your copy of the game. Otherwise we'll make sure it gets shipped to you from our studio shortly after that!\nEuropean Union (free shipping): Our costs for most of the EU are covered in terms of shipping.  We'll be shipping out of Germany so most countries here are covered. Please note that some countries are near by geographically but are not part of the EU and as such, we'll need a reliable EU address to complete free shipping to those destinations. For Western Europe NOT part of the EU, please add $8 to your pledge levels and for Central Europe NOT part of the EU please add $28 to your pledge levels. We are working to mitigate this in the interim so hang tight for updates.\nAny not EU, US or Canada: It's very expensive to ship individual packages to anywhere outside of our free shipping destinations.  Some are more expensive than others so we're trying to make it as cheap as possible for all our backers, period. Sending multiple units to a single place is one method to reduce shipping.

We have diligently sought advice from many successful campaign proprietors such as individuals from Dreadball Xtreme, The Rangers, Upon a Fable and many individuals from several forums that have gone out of their way to help shape us to succeed. We can't thank them enough for taking their valuable time to believe in us. \n\nThis is a first time Kickstarter for us without the help of others. We have been involved in very successful campaigns before such as our involvement in The Gamers: Natural 1 and Hands of Fate. If you have any inquiries, our team leader Thomas Gofton is 100% available to answer any inquiries.\n\nWe hope that you will understand that our pledge to you is that every backer and future consumer / player of the game receives the highest quality of manufactured product. This is our first impression to you, the backer world and we're planning on making it a satisfying and safe experience. \n\nIndustry standards will be met on all levels. Of course there are always monkey wrenches that may interfere with the timeline of production. These conditions will be communicated to you, the backers at every single stage from art work bleed issues to a delay in shipping if they become prevalent. \n\nOur manufacturing company has excellent reputable services and a high degree of successful Kickstarted games manufactured through them. Our chosen company is Panda Game Manufacturing. You can find more about them here: http://pandagm.com/\n\nOnce this campaign is complete, we estimate 30 days for character illustrations, art asset finalization and 3d imaging for certain components of the game. After that we are expecting 50-60 more days for pre-production.

In order to cover the fees associated with providing this amazing content, we need a certain number of committed backers. We want to offer many new things to the game and this community is the perfect fit to help make this happen. As for how these funds will be utilized, your support ensures that not only will we have the cash to pay our printers to make Ancestors Legacy but also to reprint 12 Realms. Additionally, money will be used for molds for the minis, sculptors, artists, set-ups, shipments, taxes, customs, and handling.\nThere is a discount for all pledge levels for both the items and shipping. Example: In EU we pay $25 ship fees for a package like 12 Realms. You will pay $10 to us and then we will pay the remaining $15. Thus, we will be responsible for 60% of the shipping fees so as to make things easier for you.\nUSA Backers: Shipping takes place via Fedex. You will receive your products on time, safely and you do not pay additional taxes or handling fees.  \nEU Backers: Shipping takes place via DHL from within Europe. Thanks to that, you will receive your products on time, and you will not pay additional taxes or handling fees.  \nCanadian Backers: The shipping fees we have calculated in the pledge level are based on delivery via Fedex. That means the ship fees are much less than USPS BUT most of the packs will be subject to customs so you may pay more. Of course we can change that and send your order via USPS but you will have to pay more ship fees depending on the order and the final size. If you want us to use USPS just contact us before you pledge.  \nAustralian-Asian Backers: Shipping fees takes place from China via courier in order to keep as low as possible the ship fees. This way you will not have to wait anymore much longer to receive your goods + there will be a safety regarding the products' delivery at your door.  \nFor the rest countries please contact us first!!\nA special thanks to WAMP the friendly miniature painting community for their support on 12 Realms.\nMany thanks to Paul Presley from Continue Magazine who helped us with the game's graphics and to Epitrapaizoume.gr for creating one of the KS videos!\nEditing: Alexander Argyropoulos, Michael Andresakis  \nGame Designer / Art Director: Ingazio Corrao\nIllustrator: Jerome Jaquinto\nSculptor: Alexander Lopez\nRules Editing: Robert Searing  \nDirector of Operations: Alexander Argyropoulos\nDark Wizardry: Michael Andresakis \nVideo Editing: Ben Kerns\nPlaytesters & Supporters: Paco Garcia Jaen by GMS Magazine, Michael Andresakis, Tony Cimino, Lefteris Voutsas, the Game Cafe: Playstories and the rest friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BEFORE PLEDGING ON THIS CAMPAIGN.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS \nEven though we do our best to ensure a quality product and a fast production, there is always the risk of delays.

It plays in 60 minutes for 2-6 players ages 10 and up. \nIn Evolution, players create and adapt their own species in a dynamic ecosystem of limited resources and hungry predators.  Increase your species\u2019 Body Size and Population and give them traits to ensure their survival.  Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help your species get food that others cannot reach.  Gather your friends and family around the table and see who will survive, who will thrive, and who will become someone else\u2019s lunch.\nYou can learn more about the game on the BoardGameGeek.com:\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155703/evolution\nDownload the rules here: Evolution Rules\nEach player starts with one species.  At the beginning of each round, players draw 3 cards plus one for each species they have.  Each card is an evolutionary trait that can be added to a species.  Then each player plays one card into the center.  The number on these cards represents how much food will be available when it comes time to eat.\nPlayers then play cards to evolve and create new species.  Players may discard a card to increase a species\u2019 Body Size or Population, or to create a new species.  Players may also play cards as traits on existing species.  Each species may have up to 3 traits.\nWhen all players have finished playing their cards, the cards in the center are revealed and that much food is added to the watering hole.  In player order, players may then feed their species.  To feed, a player takes one food from the watering hole and places it on a species.  A species that has evolved as a Carnivore cannot eat from the watering hole - it must feed by attacking other species.  When all species have eaten their fill or the watering hole is empty, feeding ends.\nAll players score the food they ate for the round by placing it in their food bag.  Any species who didn\u2019t get anything to eat goes extinct.  At the end of the game the player with the most food, traits, and population wins.\nUndead Viking Reviews Evolution\n\u201cIt has a lot of very simple rules, but a lot of really deep game play\u2026I really enjoy the game.

Our games have won many awards and Wits & Wagers is about to sell its 1 Millionth copy.  So why do we need Kickstarter to fund Evolution?\nWe're gamers here at North Star Games, and our Founder Dominic Crapuchettes has been wanting to dive into strategy games for a long time.  We're all very excited to bring you our first strategy game but it poses a big risk to our company.  We want to be able to fund Evolution without taking away from our successful party games.  Kickstarter presents with a great opportunity to not only fund Evolution, but to gauge the interest of our fans as well.  Our goal is to one day have a product line of strategy games that is as successful as our party games.\nThe Publisher\nNorth Star Games was founded in 2003 by Dominic Crapuchettes.  We make fun party games for the whole family.  Our games include the award-winning hits Wits & Wagers and Say Anything.\nThe Designers\nEvolution was originally designed by Dmitry Knorre and Sergey Machin in Russia.  Dominic Crapuchettes, designer of Wits & Wagers and other party games, brought Evolution to North Star Games and has redesigned it. \nThe Artists\nCatherine Hamilton is a world-renowned nature artist who is creating all of the card artwork for Evolution.   http://mydogoscar.com/birdspot/\nJacoby O'Connor is one of the graphic designers for Evolution.

Perfect for beginners and experts alike, just plug in the printer, download or create models, hit print, and watch your custom creations form right before your eyes.\nThe Micro is Designed For Everyone\nBring your ideas to life, turn them into businesses, educate, learn, personalize products, make toys, make jewelry, start a curriculum, run a modern workshop, and unleash your creativity.  The power of creation is yours!\nA Fantastic 3D Printing Experience\nWe've built The Micro with reliability, consistency, and accessibility in mind.  Micro Motion Technology is a sensor and feedback system built into the print head, providing auto-leveling and auto-calibration.  This means that every time you run the printer it works, even after thousands of hours of use! The Micro is not only a useful tool, it makes 3D printing an enjoyable experience for the every-day person.\nMaterial & Filament options\nYou can use PLA or ABS, as well as our Micro filament spools or standard 1.75 mm filament spools available on the market.  \nWhat's the difference?  We made Micro filament spools so that people can print with more materials and colors, by adding $12 to their pledge amount per spool.  These spools fit inside The Micro, allowing it to be portable and seamless.  They weigh nearly 1/2 lb (225 g) of.That is enough material to make 45 of the vases from the time-lapse in our video!\nThe Micro filament spools are fed from inside the printer.  Alternatively, you can use an external filament access port located on top of the extruder.  \nSoftware Options\n3D printer software should be as fun and futuristic as the printer itself.  That's why we've designed the M3D software to be as interactive and enjoyable as a game, making sure it\u2019s fully touchscreen-capable with a minimalist and simple-to-use interface. It allows you to search and browse countless objects online, organizing 3D models you've downloaded into an easy to view library.  Just pick a model, drag it into the printer, adjust the model if needed, and hit <print>. Software shouldn't be a barrier to 3D printing, and it\u2019s our goal to make The Micro accessible to everyday users.\nAdvanced users can use the expert settings as well as other software such as open-source slicers.  \nTechnical Specifications\nPrinter Dimensions: It's a cube, 7.3 in (185 mm) per side.\nIt is lightweight, roughly 2.2 lb (1 kg).\nIt can also be used with any Windows, Mac, or Linux based system.\nUSB-Compatible connection.\nSupports many different materials: ABS, PLA, Nylon, and more.\nFilament: standard 1.75mm. Nearly 1/2 lb (225 g) rolls.\nStandard filament rolls also supported.\nRemovable Print Bed.\n50-350 micron layer resolution.\n15 micron X and Y positioning accuracy.\nDimensions: Print height: 116mm (4.6\"). Base Print Area: 109mm x 113mm.  Print Area Above 74mm: 91mm x 84mm.\nM3D software for an effortless, plug-and-play experience.  \nSupports and uses open source software (for advanced users).\nHow Did You Create The Micro?\nStarting with a seamless design, the Micro evolved from two years of productive debates between engineers, artists and production experts.  Since everyone was involved from the beginning, their vision of the product was fully integrated into the final result.  This led to 15 innovations in the field of 3D printing and we are very honored to share the result of all that hard work with you.\nBut the work doesn't stop there. We want your feedback on The Micro, and help us build a community that can be a part of this exciting project.\n15 Innovations\nM3D has introduced many innovations in the field of filament-based 3D printing with the introduction of The Micro:\n1. Most space-efficient 3D printer ever made.  \n2. Light-weight, portable design fits nicely on your desk.\n3. Micro motion chip provides completely automatic leveling and calibration.\n4. Most quiet 3D printer ever made.\n5. Lowest power consumption 3D printer ever made.\n6. Carbon fiber rods: light, sturdy, self-lubricating and long-lasting\n7. Ceramic heater for rapid heat-up, power efficiency, reliability and safety.\n8. Bold colors. Choose from Silver, Black, Blue, RedOrange, and Green.\n9. New filament materials like Chameleon PLA.\n10. Inspirational Micro filament spools.\n11. Modernized touch-capable software.\n12. Replaceable print beds for alternative materials.\n13. Replaceable nozzles for experimenters.\n14. Designed for fast assembly in the US for quality control.\n15. An ABS-based print bed allows you to print larger ABS parts.\nDesigned & Assembled in The USA\nThe Micro was designed for assembly and production in the USA.  We will use a combination of imported and domestic components to assemble all of the printers near our Bethesda, MD location.  \nYour Backing = Earlier Delivery\nWe're ready for production and really need your support to ramp up assembly to get printers to you as early as possible.  We've been preparing for this stage for over a year by buying and testing parts from over 100 manufacturers and talking with hundreds more.  \nBy pre-ordering now you\u2019ll help us reach our last crucial milestone: purchasing the injection molds that will provide us with high-quality, high-volume 3D printer parts we need to assemble the most affordable consumer 3D printer ever.  In return, you'll get one of the first Micro 3D Printers and be an early adopter of this exciting project.  For that we cannot thank you enough.\nWhat's Included with My Reward?\nBesides our eternal gratitude, we\u2019ll assemble a Micro 3D Printer with great care in the US and send it to you along with M3D software, instructions manual, USB cable, country-specific power adapter, and one Micro filament spool.  You can unbox it, install the software, and print right away - it\u2019s as quick and as simple as that.  \nWhy We Need You\nAs far as we've come, we've only just scratched the surface of what's possible using this technology. We need your help to take it further, and make The Micro a reality.\nProduction Timeline:\nThe Incredible M3D Team  \nEveryone at M3D has a single-minded focus to deliver an amazingly fun and fulfilling 3D printing experience for everyone. To get here has been very rewarding, and we've formed an amazing team of gems. We would like to give a special thanks to so many supporters, motivators, backers, team members, and advisors that helped us get to where we are so quickly:\nThanks For Your Support!   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any innovative project, we face several key risks and challenges. The primary risks include:\n\nINJECTION MOLDING \nWe consider this is our only significant risk. Injection molding has very large capital expenses and thus we can only secure one manufacturer. In addition, when making the specification for the seamless frame of The Micro, we demanded only the best quality surface finish. Injection molding is one part science and one part artistic optimization. Thus the mold may take up to 4 months to produce and perfect. For this reason we have put a great deal of careful planning and strategy into the sourcing of our injection molded parts such as working with suppliers in North America to ensure that the long lead time parts are closest to us.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS \nBefore starting we noticed that some projects can encounter unexpected hurdles when going from prototype to production. That\u2019s why we have done so much work to test The Micro with over 100 manufacturers to ensure that our designs are production ready and designed for both manufacturing and assembly. The last pieces to be ordered are the very expensive injection molds for plastic parts. To verify these designs we\u2019ve had them CNC\u2019d and 3D printed so that the injection molds are as close to our prototypes as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Thank you all", "update_content": "Dear Backers,  \n           The entire team here at M3D would like to take a moment to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your continued support.

Players are ostensibly working together to improve their village in the hills of Black Forest Germany, and prepare for the harvest every spring and autumn.  However, one player is secretly controlling werewolves, working against the other players. \nIn Black Forest, each player has a number of Villager tokens, used to take actions on the various tiles that comprise the village.  These actions are executed in the Day phase.  Afterward, players draft cards from the Night deck, to determine who is attacked by the werewolves. \nWhat Games are Like Black Forest?\nThe \"worker placement\" works a little like it does in Agricola or Stone Age.  Each player has Villager tokens that are placed on the different locations in the Village.  Each location performs a certain action or gives a benefit.\nThe \"card drafting\" is similar to 7 Wonders.  Each player is dealt a number of cards one higher than the number of players.  They choose one card, then pass the rest clockwise.  Another card is chosen, and the cards are passed again, etc.  Each player will see some of the cards the player before him or her could have chosen but didn't, and this can help players deduce who the werewolf is (although the werewolf player has some tricks he or she can perform to keep the others guessing).\nThe \"hidden traitor\" is much like the experience in the Battlestar Galactica board game, or Shadows Over Camelot.  Players won't be sure who they can trust, and must use their ability to read people, find clues in the Night phase, or visit the Seer to have visions on the other players in order to sort out who is who. \nWhat comes in the box\nEach 4\"x4\" tile is two-sided (start side, and upgraded side)\nSome of the cards in the Market deck.\nArt for the Role cards\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/102264/black-forest-rules-beta\nNote the rules are still in \"pre-print\" version and will have a slightly different layout, as well as background art and more example images. \nPrint and Play documents available here:\nhttp://redamedia.com/redagames/pnp/\nGraphics in the PnP are not final, and some of the Market cards are not included.  PDFs include the 12 Village tile, Market cards, Night cards, Seer cards, Barricade tokens, Harvest board, and Role cards.  Last pdf has the back art.\nAlso check out the series of blogs I have written on the development of Black Forest, as well as how the mechanics work.\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/blog/3139/black-forest-design-and-development\nRewarding the community for their support is definitely mutually beneficial.  Here are some of the upgrades and add-ons that can become part of the initial release:\n1- Add a 6th Player.  Tokens, Night cards, and some new Roles to choose from will be added if this goal is met.  Additionally, all of the components for Black Forest will be printed with the highest quality possible.  The color used for the 6th player will be voted on by the backers.  40,000\n2 - Additional Art.  Currently there are 10 Upgrade cards in the Market deck that use the same image, and 12 Quiet Night cards in the Night deck using the same art.  If this stretch goal is met, I will commission unique art from the artists for every card, as well as the 2 Villager and 2 Werewolf Roles.  The quality of art has been a very high priority, and being able to bring more of it would be fantastic. 45,000\n3 -Player Aids.  This goal will include a player mat for each player that depicts a Coat of Arms and player color on one side, and the reverse will have a player aid that has call-out boxes for important and/or infrequent rules, like \"What to do if the last two cards you have to draft are both Werewolf Attack\".  Another promo card will also be issued.  50,000\nOther upgrades will include:\n- Additional Roles (Wolf Man, Masons, Travelers, and more). \n- A \"Bone\" die to replace the normal six-sided die.\n- Metal coins to replace the Coin tokens. \nThere are other ways you can help support this Kickstarter.

We design and create exclusive fantasy currencies for use in many different applications.   Being a huge gamer myself, my company and I are dedicated to providing a high quality, true-to-game experience at an affordable price.  We understand how important lore and storyline are to gaming fans and we do everything we can to support and enhance the enjoyment of their game of choice.  Which brings me to our latest project...\nOver the last year and a half, we've been creating 15 new coin sets for use in board games, RPG's, LARP and as costume props.  Each set has 3 different designs based on the fantasy currency system of copper, silver, and gold.   Every coin we make takes about a month of research and development; we set our own high standards and only the very best coins make it to production.\nMaking coins is our specialty and we take it very seriously.  We don't do flimsy - our smallest coin has a 25mm diameter, about the size of a U.S. quarter.  Struck from high quality zinc then electroplated with colored nickel, we add an antiquated finish that simulates actual aging.  With an average thickness of 2.5mm, our coins are heavy in the hand, they even sound and smell genuine, and each one is a little different from the next - just like real coins that have been in circulation for a while.\nPlease let us know your thoughts and help us make this the best fantasy coin Kickstarter project ever!

The historical artwork has been modernized and a border added for greater clarity. The gold commemorates Archimedes on its front with Archimedes\u2019 circles on the back.

The set consists of the gold Koban, the silver Ichibubon and the copper/bronze Mon. For anti-counterfeit purposes, each piece is larger than real coinage and the Kanji has been modified.\nShows darker than it actually is.

The Dram, Scruple, and Grain add a \"face value\" (i.e. weight in precious metals) that can be used in any Steampunk universe.

When splitting it into multiple shipments, you just pay the shipping charges on any shipment after the first.\n\nExample: If you pledge for two dozen dice, you can get 24 of the same design OR 4 each of 6 different designs OR 24 completely different designs (or anything in between). And your reward can be split into as many shipments as you like.\nThese add-ons are available to anyone with a pledge level of $6 or more (anyone actually receiving a shipment). You can include as many add-ons with your pledge as you like.\n\nShipping: No additional shipping charges required for add-ons.\n\n\nRight now, if you want to make custom dice for a game prototype, print-n-play game, or just to customize your old Yahtzee! game, it'll cost you several dollars per die - before shipping.\nWe see a way to provide the same quality engraved custom dice at a fraction of the cost. But we can't do it without your help, we need funds to purchase the necessary supplies and equipment (primarily meaning thousands of dice and a Trotec laser engraver)!\nHere are some examples of people we've teamed up with so far to bring you cool designs:\nWe've teamed up with Potluck Games, the creators of Dungeon Dice, and have some exciting news as a result! They are designing an official die for Dungeon Dice that will be available exclusively through CGL.\nPlus they have agreed to allow us to use a bunch of the official art from Dungeon Dice. The art will be available on our website so you can design your own custom mods, expansions, and house rules for Dungeon Dice and the icons on your custom dice will match those on the originals!\n\nWe've also teamed up with Common Man Games to create a custom dice pack for their award winning game Police Precinct. And if enough people are interested in that pack, they'll receive a mystery die for SNITCH Free of charge! That die will also become available for others to claim with their pledge rewards once it's unlocked. More details on Update #8. Both Police Precinct and SNITCH are available through their current KS project.\nWith the announcement of full-color printing, we also announced a collaboration with Nick Hayes to bring his game Chunky Fighters to the masses.\nTesh of Project Khopesh ran a successful Kickstarter project several months ago for metal Tinker Dice and would like to see those designs made reality in plastic as well. So he has shared with us the designs for d6 Tinker Dice as well as Fudge Tinker Dice. Here's what the design looks like as well as a picture of the finished product in metal.\nWe've teamed up with Sarcastic Robot to make Firewall, a strategy dice game, available.\nP.D. Magnus is working with us to produce dice featuring the suits of his award winning six suit deck of cards, the Decktet.\nCheck out Update #11 for a much fuller list of collaborations.\nThese are just a handful of those that have shown us their designs. And there are many more of our 1,000+ backers with design ideas they haven't shown us.\nThese designs will all be available when the project gets funded, but what should be even more exciting is not the designs I've created, but the opportunity for ANYONE to create their own custom design and make it available to the world. There are literally infinite possibilities. I hope the few I've posted here can help inspire some ideas.\nShipping: Shipping to the US is included with all reward levels, additional $7 required for international shipping.\nSharing is caring! One of the most critical aspects of making this project a success is getting the word out to everyone that might be interested. But we need your help to do it.\n\nIf you help us out by sharing the project URL on Facebook or including it in one of your Tweets, we'll reward all of our backers by unlocking new colors of paint to fill the designs with. We figure this is better than paying for advertising because it allows us to reward even more for your support!\n\nWhile you're at it, feel free to follow us on Twitter @CustomGameLab and like our fanpage on Facebook:\nJust for clarification, these are not new colors of dice, but new colors of paint to fill the engraved designs with. New colors of dice will be unlocked through monetary stretch goals.\nDesigns we can promise to be available upon success of this project, include the following themes: Promo dice, Elvish script, weapons, winner's dice, loser's dice, tetrominoes, moon phases, standard d6, dragon dice, chess dice, ninja dice, card suit dice, crown and anchor dice, fudge dice (standard and outline), text based dice, cheater's dice, binary dice, weather dice, Mayan dice, Emoticon dice, Chinese dice, Roman numeral dice, hexadecimal color choosing dice, RGB color choosing dice, and math constants dice. The Myst based D'ni numeral dice have also received approval for commercial licensing from Cyan Worlds Inc and will be available.\n\nWe also fully expect hundreds if not thousands of other designs to be made available soon after our website launches as our backers begin to create their own designs and make them available for others to order. Rest assured you will have plenty of great options to choose from!\nIn fact during the course of this project, we have already begun working with some designers to announce designs they will be making available on our site. We've been sharing these in our updates, but also plan to add some of them to our main project page.

Each of them is a reputable company and has been very responsive so far.\n\nI've been asked what I will do if this project is wildly successful - will I still be able to deliver? Not only will I still be able to create your dice, but the process get's streamlined even further the more it scales. If it does well enough, I will be able to buy an even faster laser with a larger engraving area allowing me to engrave more dice at once. If necessary, I have room in my shop to add more than one laser as well (plus available help as necessary).\n\nIn short: Overfunding is a good thing, it would allow us to get better equipment, potentially more equipment (which will both speed things up), and more dice options for you!\n\nAs with any Kickstarter, this will be a large time investment not only in creating dice but also in delivering them.\n\nI have worked from home for the past couple of years, and am prepared to dedicate the time needed to deliver your rewards for this project!

This Kickstarter is Soda Pop Miniatures first self-published Super Dungeon product. Its purpose is to deliver an enhanced game experience that updates gameplay for veteran players, while providing a perfect entry point for new players.\nForgotten King is a stand-alone board game that includes everything you need to play your games of Super Dungeon Explore, including: a complete and updated rulebook, 57 preassembled miniatures, 6 beautifully illustrated double-sided dungeon tiles, counters, and game cards.\nThe Dark Consul's power has created spawning points throughout the dungeon that will create endless hordes of monsters to ravage Crystalia. The Heroes must journey through the dungeon and destroy all of the spawning points in order to summon and defeat the dreaded dungeon boss. The Consul must destroy all of the Heroes before they succeed.\nOver the course of a game the Heroes and Consul take turns activating models. As monsters are destroyed the Consul will spawn reinforcements from spawning points. This power is not to be used lightly. Each spawning point has a finite amount of power and every spawn will drain its energy, and the Heroes will attempt to hasten their destruction with all their skill and strength.\nWith each spawning point\u2019s destruction a powerful mini-boss will spawn. One by one the Heroes will seek to defeat them earning loot, treasure, and valuable princess coins. Once the last spawning point is destroyed the dungeon boss will spawn and an epic battle for the fate of Crystalia will commence!\nPlay how you want!\nForgotten King features two game modes: Classic and Arcade.\nIn Classic Mode, one player assumes the role of the Dark Consul and opposes the other players. As the Consul they control all of the monsters in the dungeon, attempting to defeat the Heroes and bring darkness to Crystalia.\nIn Arcade Mode, all players take the role of the Heroes. The Arcade Deck controls the dungeon, issuing the Consul's commands for his minions: how they engage the Heroes, where to attack, and when to unleash their devastating special actions.\nYou can also tailor your dungeon, modifying the difficulty to suit your players.\nBeyond the box, Soda Pop Miniatures features our new PVP Arena Living Ruleset, pitting Hero vs Hero available for free on our website.

Explore cards provide unique discovery effects to every tile your Heroes enter! Monsters are only part of the danger within the Dungeons of Crystalia. Explore cards represent many of the hazards, pitfalls, benefits, or even outright insane moments that can occur as the Heroes explore the dungeon.\nEven under the just rule of the Von Wildings, the Glauerdoom Moor was never a forgiving land. Under the curse of the vampire lord, Von Drakk it is a deadly one. The land has grown sick. The once healthy moors and wetlands have become disease infested, their ancient burial grounds disturbed by grave robbers, witches, and dark creatures. The miserable inhabitants lead miserable lives, knowing that even death will not release them from their service.\nLong ago the inhabitants of the Glauerdoom used pumpkins to carve jack-o-lanterns to trick the restless spirits of the moor to pass by their homes at night. In time the spirits grew wise to this deception and decided to play a trick of their own. Now pumpkin patches are grim, haunted, places where the creatures that go bump in the night lurk, waiting for their prey.\nThe Mistmourn Coast is a dangerous place even for the natural inhabitants of the Fae Woods. Outsiders fear the troll tribes of the Mistmourn, but those familiar with this perpetually shrouded wood know that the fae creatures are the true danger. Primal and unearthly, what motivates these creatures is unknown. Shamans bind them to pillars of salt to stay their wrath or do their bidding. Yet these magics have a dark consequence. When the spells of binding are broken the magics of the formerly bound fae are trapped with the shattered salt pillar. Their essence infuses new life within the Salt and they are reborn as elemental golems. Driven only by blind instinct these Salt golems lash out at any who are near.\nThe Claws of the Wyrm enforce the Dragon Priests' will among the unruly Kobolds and bring death to their enemies. The Dragon Blades are sworn foes to all draconic creatures. They are ruthless foes and particularly skilled when facing their most hated foe\u2014dragons. \nWhat happens when a good soda goes bad? Tricked into imbibing a cursed Shadow Soda the Dark Consul has captured a shard of Candy's essence and spun it into living shadow. Now this dark Nether Shadow terrorizes Crystalia, sowing discord and confusion wherever she goes.\nDungeon Tiles! Add even more variety to your games of Super Dungeon Explore with this pack of six, all new, double-sided dungeon tiles! Featuring stunning art and 12 unique layouts, the Dungeons of Crystalia tile set is designed to look fabulous no matter which monsters lurk within its depths!\nThis is another much requested item\u2014unique treasure and loot art! Once we reach $475k all treasure and loot cards will feature unique art representing the card's equipment. We mean all of it, including the treasure cards from previous expansions and mini-bosses that will be included in the upgrade decks. You'll be swimming in new treasure art just like a certain wealthy duck through treasure!\nNever underestimate an angry creep swinging an onion! Wherever Goro is there is sure to be a pack of Giri. Like their capricious master, Giri are at times both blessing and boon. It is said that a crop blessed by Giri is sure to be plentiful as long as their bellies are full. Unfortunately, like most creeps, Giri tend to come in packs and it is not uncommon for their feeding to devour the entire crop no matter how plentiful it was. Many farmers choose to not invoke these spirits at all, and place shrines and offerings to Goro and Giri on the edge of the Fae Wood, hoping to keep the spirits within its borders.\nThe Emerald Valley is a difficult place to find even among the inhabitants of the Fae Wood. It is home of the dragon, Glimmerwing and she protects her realm with powerful glamors and fae magic that conceal it from the rest of the Crystalia. Glimmerwing rarely leaves her secluded vale preferring to spend her time among the Kodama and Kinoko that flourish there. Her reclusive nature should not be mistaken for a desire to live peacefully. Indeed, she guards her domain and its borders ruthlessly. She is often known to leave the Emerald Valley to strike out against any who journey too near, even if the travelers do so unknowingly.  \nThe Silver Chevaliers have long sought glorious causes across Crystalia. Finding and destroying Glimmerwing proves to be just such a cause. After all, what gallant knight could resist the lure of traveling deep into an enchanted forest to slay a dragon?\nYou've all asked for it, so now it's time for some Dark Heroes to join the cause of Crystalia! No one truly knows what motivates these desperate individuals. In truth, it matters little so long as they remain loyal to the party for the adventure at hand.\nWith a new Dungeon Boss on the loose, Heroes are sure to need lots of wound counters!\nThe forest spirit Goro has always been a mercurial and fickle creature. Even in times of peace Goro has relished challenging mortals with puzzles, tricks, and cunning traps. That these tests and pranks occasionally turn deadly is of no concern to Goro. Whispered to be as old as the Deeproot Tree itself, it is likely that Goro does not even truly comprehend mortality.\nKeep track of your potions in style! \nThe Lunar Elves were driven from their ancestral home in the Dragonback Peaks by the dragon Starfire. Now, scattered across Crystalia they earn their living as best they can as sell-swords and entertainers. \nSlime Time! Creeps are an ever present threat in a dungeon. Based on the Explore Card you draw when entering a tile you may encounter one or two creeps or an entire Creep Factory! Slimes like to get close and personal, oozing onto their favorite colored equipment and preventing its use.  \nThe Royal Wardens are charged with maintain the King's peace, as well as executing his warrants, and collecting outstanding taxes. His powerful crossbow combined with his ability to hold felons immobile and pull them to him, ensures none can escape the King's justice.\nKingdom Death's, Twilight Knight Pinup, comes to Crystalia! No stranger to battling evil the Twilight Knight has joined the brave defenders of Crystalia to banish the Dark Consul once and for all.\nThe fickle nature of the fae creatures of the Mistmourn Coast makes them difficult to control and it requires powerful spells cast upon crystals of salt, which are naturally anathema to all fae, to bind them to the Consul's will.\nThe Deeproot Wolf Riders patrol the dangerous borders of the Fae Wood. Their spirit wolves are renowned predators of the Mistmourn Coast. Only the bravest and most skilled Deeproot Elves can hope to befriend one to carry it into battle.\nA dungeon can be a dark and scary place, and that's why even Brave-Mode Candy never travels without her intrepid sidekick Never-Lost Cola. His magical compass allows the adventuring party to redraw their Explore Card when entering a new tile\u2014Super! \nTabbybrook Mages are powerful water mages. Their ability to manipulate this vital element is unparalleled, able to use it to heal their allies, push back opponents or even unleash it in deadly lances of scalding heat or numbing cold.\nPets are an all new unit type. At the beginning of the game the adventuring party can add six pet cards to the treasure deck. If a pet card is drawn, you've rescued the pet! A Hero can then become the pet's master, gaining the pet's help through the rest of the adventure.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSoda Pop Miniatures has been involved in a number of successful Kickstarters, from which we have learned a great deal about managing the scope of large projects.

I keep hearing the warnings over and over again\u2026\u201ddon\u2019t go in there.\u201d \u201cThe last expedition never made it back out.\u201d ... \u201cThe temple is cursed.\u201d\nYou and your colleagues are adventurers that have found a temple full of precious gems. Unfortunately taking the gems has triggered the wrath of an ancient Idol curse that wants to seal you in the temple forever! Provisions and oxygen are limited. You and your fellow adventurers must fight the fear and panic overwhelming you so that you can locate and follow the path out of the temple. \nMayan Calendar\nThe Mayan Calendar is a two sided board on which players must activate gems in a certain order to put calendar tiles onto the calendar track - or face the consequences! \nThe calendar board with 9 spaces is placed to one side of the table (the reverse side of the calendar board has only 6 spaces, and is used when playing an easy game or if using less than 9 gems). The spaces on the track have alternating symbols: Sun, Moon, Star. Whenever you discover a room with a gem spot, place one calendar tile FACE UP in that chamber. When you activate a gem in a chamber with a calendar tile, you may put the calendar tile on the next vacant space on the calendar board provided the symbol on the tile and the space matches. If it doesn't match, put the tile next to the calendar track. \nOn the calendar track there are two bars: If, at the end of the first countdown, the players have not reached the first bar (or, at the end of the second countdown they have not reached the second bar), all players must place one of their dice onto the calendar board. This die can be retrieved if the player visits the calendar chamber. \nTo leave the temple, the players must have reached one of the last four spaces on the calendar track. If they are on the 8th space, they need 1 extra key to use the exit - on the 7th space they need 2 extra keys, and on the 6th space they need 3 extra keys.\n\u201cSuperstition\u201d, I said. \u201cCurses aren\u2019t real\u201d I said. \u201cThe last expedition were a bunch of amateurs. I am a professional with the latest tools and toys\u201d I said. Newsflash \u2013 you get lost in the dark and your \u201clatest toys\u201d aren't working, it doesn\u2019t matter how many degrees or pedigrees you have. Lost is lost. And I am trying really hard not to think\u2026 gone is gone!\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple is a real-time, cooperative game in which all players must escape from a temple after awakening an ancient curse. Players navigate through the temple by rolling dice and matching symbols to rooms, thereby gaining entry and visibility into adjacent rooms. So the temple \"map\" randomly unfolds as you explore further...every game is different! But as you explore, don't wander too far! All players must find the exit before the curse seals the adventurers in forever! The real-time aspect is enhanced by a soundtrack that can be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, \"lost\" players lose one of their dice.\n                                                                5 dice for each player\nThe initial layout consists of a row of three square tiles. Each tile shows a combination of two symbols, for example two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile \u2013 the safe room \u2013 and each player starts with five dice. Each die has five symbols:\nA cursed mask \u2013 this die is set aside when rolled.\nA golden mask \u2013 each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.\nA red torch or blue key \u2013 these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.\nA green adventurer, which appears twice on the die \u2013 you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.\nOnce the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.\n                                                                    Gems\nThe base game of Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the \"Treasures\" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the \"Curses\" module, some tiles \"curse\" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!\n                                                 Treasure and Curse icons\nEscape - Illusions (Expansion 1) contains two new modules: \"Illusion Chambers\" and \"Special Chambers\", confronting the trapped adventurers with new challenges. Illusion chambers vanish at the end of the first and second countdown. This may result in gaps within the temple, so in order to continue exploring, those gaps must be filled by discovering new chambers. But even then, the new chambers might not connect to old areas, so you better make sure your explorations there are done! Also included are linked chambers, double chambers and the treasure chamber. Linked chambers contain gems which can only be activated simultaneously, when there\u2019s an adventurer in each chamber. To reach the magic gems in a double chamber, adventurers must create a path to its rear entrance. The treasure chamber contains a massive golden chalice that needs to be recovered before the temple collapses. Escape: Illusions also comes with a new curse, a new treasure and material for a sixth player.\n                                             Illusion Tile and Special Chambers\nEscape - Quest contains another two modules which can be combined with the basic game and any other expansions. The module \"Quest Chambers\" contains five new chambers, each of which confronts the players with a new task they must master before they can escape from the cursed temple. The module \"Characters\" introduces six different characters for the players to choose from, each of which comes with two unique abilities. After choosing their characters the players have to decide whether they pick their character's permanent or the activatable ability, which is even more powerful but has to be used more sparingly.\n                                                                      Characters\n\"Had to ditch the tools and supplies. Stopped working as soon as I entered the first treasure room. That should have been the warning\u2026 how can this much treasure still be here? Grave robbers should have ransacked this temple long ago. But in my haste I did not make the connection. Staring at an emerald the size of a man\u2019s fist will do that to you. And right now\u2026 I would give 100 emeralds just to see the sun again. Something is happening, and I cannot figure it out. It is almost as if the walls are moving. My rational mind tells me that this can\u2019t be happening. But the reality is I am lost and time is running out. Only have a few more minutes to escape.\"\nEscape 3rd Expansion - Traps\nThe retail edition of the 3rd Escape Expansion will have two modules. As a thank you for ordering the 3rd expansion as part of this campaign, 2 additional trap rooms will be included as well as the mini module personal items (these will not be part of the retail edition). The personal items add a new twist to the journey. Each player has a personal item they must retrieve before leaving the temple. The items are distributed face down in various locations throughout the temple. When a player enters a room with a personal item, he or she can look at it, but if it is not their item they have to return it where they found it (don't take my lucky whip!!!). Expected delivery of the 3rd expansion in March 2015.\nStretch rewards are based upon the number of backers who have pledged for the base game or higher.\nThe Chaos Room - The Chaos Room is a new Quest tile that players can choose if they are using the Quests expansion. For the Chaos Room quest to be completed, every adventurer has to be in the room at the same time and draw one curse each to complete the challenge.\nMind Control (curse) - When you are suffering from the curse Mind Control, you continue to roll dice as you would normally, but you are unable (not allowed) to move your own adventurer, another player must do that for you.\nPortal (treasure) - The Portal is a new treasure that permits you to move your adventurer through a wall (allowing you to move from one room into another).\nThe Mirage Room - When the Mirage Room tile is revealed, it replaces the starting room tile (and the starting tile is placed where the Mirage Room would have gone). This moves the safe haven quite suddenly...this could be a good thing or a bad thing!\nThe Trickster (character) - The Trickster is a new character that has two new abilities: The permanent ability is that the Trickster can physically change dice with another player. The 1 shot ability is that the Trickster can change as many dice as you like with one other player anywhere in the temple.\nPitfall (curse) - When an adventurer is hit by the curse Pitfall, he/she is immediately returned to the starting room.\nClone (treasure) - The Clone is a new one time use treasure that allows the player to double the icon count on every die (so if one of your dice has three torches, it would count as six torches).\nThe Gear Room - For the Gear room, players must roll two keys to slide one row of chamber tiles one space in one direction. (You have to move every tile).\nMammut - Stretch reward eligible backers will receive Kristian's Mammut! Here is the game page on BGG - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/95613/mammut\nThe Snake Pit (room) - Once the Snake Pit is discovered, place a snake token with each player in their chamber (so two players in one chamber would have TWO snakes...uggghhhh!!!!!). Players cannot move outside of their current room until they have rolled 2 torches for each snake in their respective chamber(s). They have to fight the mother snake inside the snake pit with 5 torches.\nMagical Bond (curse) - Players must hold hands with another player the whole time the curse is active.\nShort-cut (treasure) - When players discover a new room, instead of randomly exploring, the players can go through the whole deck and choose any tile to place and then reshuffle the remaining tiles and put them back.\nThe Dungeon (room) - Players cannot get back through the entrance, just through the other exit.\nVoid Runner (character) - The Void Runner is a new character and his/her permanent ability is that the Void Runner can take another adventurer and go through any open doorway and enter somewhere else through an open doorway The one shot ability is to take every adventurer in the same chamber with the Void Runner and enter all together through an open exit.\nWeakest Link (curse) - If the player does not get back to the safe room at the end of the first and second countdown, everyone loses the game. You cannot get rid of this curse.\nFreeze Time (treasure) - Players can pause the timer/soundtrack and discuss what to do next, (no dice rolling when time is frozen). Once the discussion is over, hit play and start rolling again.\nNarrow Passage (room) - The narrow passage has 4 entries; roll 3 torches to get in, 3 torches to activate a gem and a treasure.\n\nSHIPPING   \n!!!Please note!!!

All additional costs that may occur because of custom duty or local charges are the backers responsibility.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEscape Big Box is the third game in our Big Box series to appear on Kickstarter and the previous two (Fresco and Kingdom Builder) have been very well received. We are very excited about this campaign because Escape in particular lends itself to fun stretch rewards so we are taking full advantage of that and working closely with the designer to bring exciting and engaging new elements to the Kickstarter backers.\n\nFor Escape Big Box, there are different European manufacturers involved in the production process (for example the dice are manufactured and painted by hand and in England) and this requires our ongoing attention to ensure that we hit our production release schedule. Even with our best efforts, sometimes circumstances beyond our control happen. For example Fresco Big Box is ready to ship, but due to a stretch of bad weather in the US, shipping has been delayed three weeks as we wait for an available container. \n\nFrom our previous projects what remains to be shipped is the new expansion characters for Dark, Darker, Darkest and that looks to be a May/June release.

If you discover Tuscany after the project ends, you can order the retail version of the game (it\u2019s the same version you see here) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of Euphoria bring you Tuscany, a pack of 12 expansions to Viticulture that unlock (\"uncork\") every few games as determined by the previous game's winner. What story will you tell as you create the most successful vineyard in Tuscany?\nViticulture is a 2-6 player game in which you create a vineyard by planting vines, harvesting grapes, making & selling wine, building structures, and hosting visitors. \nTuscany adds asymmetric starting resources, new visitor cards, an extended board, special workers, Arboriculture, and more (see rules and playtest PnP).\nTuscany cannot be played without Viticulture, which is available in several reward levels and as a $49 add-on. To learn more about Viticulture, you can download the rules, print and play it, watch videos about it, read some reviews, or view it on BGG.\nPrototype meeples created by PiasaPro.com\nYou can use the handy Fundafull pledge calculator to figure out your total pledge cost. Euphoria will remain on sale on our website until this project ends.\nAll stretch goals are fully playtested and are included in every copy of Tuscany (Kickstarter and retail).\nThanks to the worldwide fulfillment system explained on our Kickstarter Lessons blog here and here, we have very cost-effective ways of shipping Tuscany to you.\nWe can ship games to you in bulk if you coordinate a group purchase. Just choose your reward level and add the cost of each additional game to your pledge. Only pay the shipping fee once per pledge (any # of games, reward level, or country code).\nBackers in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand are likely to get their games a little earlier than everyone else because we'll ship their games from China (bulk or direct).\nFind all media mentions of Tuscany on our website and join the discussion about the game on BoardGameGeek.\nGeekDad prototype review by Dave Banks\nBoard Game Quest written preview\nThe Cardboard Republic written preview\nLeague of Gamemakers written preview\nTheology of Games written preview\nThanks to the multitude of amazing playtesters around the world who gave us their feedback on Tuscany! Anyone who playtests the game and gives us feedback will get their name in the rulebook.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don\u2019t like Tuscany within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund (see FAQ for details).\nEarly-Adopter Discount: Every copy of Tuscany ($45) comes at a 36% discount off MSRP ($70) as an appreciation of your early support.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusives anymore, but we'll only print a limited number of certain rewards based on the final pledge totals.\nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators\u2014we really value your input, and we promptly and transparently address all questions and concerns.\nBecause We Need You: We\u2019ve covered the cost of graphic design and art for Tuscany, but we can\u2019t manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nRough sketch of the collector's edition cardboard box (illustrated to look like wood). It measures approximately 10.5x8.5x8 inches and can sit upright or on its side.\nUncork all expansions in each tier in any order before opening the next tier. Here are the playtest rules and PnP (no graphic design on PnP).\nTier 1\nMamas and Papas: These cards give each player different combinations of starting resources to create varied priorities in the early game.\nPatronage: These cards give each player an incentive to make wine and a secret goal to accomplish, encouraging a diversity of strategies from game to game and a grand reveal at the end of each game.\nAdvanced Visitors: These cards offer players a variety of abilities that are good at all times of the game (most of these cards are in the format \"Choose 1: A or B,\" where A is good early in the game and B is good late in the game).\nProperty: These tiles overlay the fields on all vineyard mats and feature different maximum vine values and the ability to sell unused fields for money.\nTier 2\nExtended Game Board: This is a full game board with a new wake-up chart that creates a continuous flow from season to season and year to year, an influence map that lets players grab resources early and points late, and full worker-placement options in all four seasons, including several new actions.\nSpecial Workers: Similar to the grande workers, the special worker meeples are regular workers with one special ability each. This gives players the ability to not only choose where they place workers, but also which worker they will place.\nNew Visitors: Many of these cards let players break the rules of the game or generate interactions and tough choices for opponents to make.\nStructures: Flip over the extended board to side 2 and you'll find a number of orange card icons on it. They represent a new set of 36 structures that you can build on your vineyard and your new construction mat. They're drawn from a deck of cards (just like visitors or vines), and you build them with the build action. Every structure offers special ongoing bonuses and new action spaces, forming your strategy in a different way each game.\nTier 3\nArboriculture: This expansion gives players the ability to plant and harvest tomato vines, apple trees, and olive trees, create refined goods, and sell those goods with wine orders for points. Due to the extra strain on your workers, you have to keep an eye on their morale, which can either benefit or hinder you.\nFormaggio: The cheese expansion give players access to cows and four types of cheese to age in a cheese cellar. Several types of cheese experts are available on each player mat to impact the value of your cheese.\nMafia: In the mafia expansion, players are trying to present the best gift to a retired capo who is building his holiday home in Tuscany. Each grande worker carries your hidden gift, but if two grande workers end up on the same action, they have to switch gifts.\nThe Automa Expansion adds a set of cards to the game that lets you play Viticulture and Tuscany solo in campaign mode with varying degrees of difficulty.\nPhotos include prototype components. The final Farmer meeple (pictured with a staff) will not have a staff.\nWe faced a key decision when we started designing expansions to Viticulture: We could release expansions over the course of several years. That's what most game companies do, and we respect that strategy. Or we could do something different.\nWe decided to try something new: create an entire expansion experience while also offering people the best value for their money. Thus the idea for the Tuscany expansion pack: 12 expansions in one box.\nIt is a little odd for Tuscany to have a higher MSRP than Viticulture, but Tuscany costs more to make than Viticulture. To be fiscally responsible, we have to account for the fact that distributors purchase games at 60% off MSRP.\nIMMORTALE ($149): There are 32 new visitor cards in Tuscany, and we've divided them into two groups of 16 for gender equality. If you choose this level, you will need to take a photo specifically for your digital painting by Beth Sobel. \nEach visitor represents an adult who contributes to the needs of the vineyard, so the person on the card must be an adult (one person per card). These Immortale cards will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Tuscany.\nWe like to support game stores and wineries around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our games to retailers during the campaign. If you're a retailer, please see our retail guidelines here and contact Jamey directly about your pledge.\nThis project is specifically to raise funds to make Tuscany. Independently, we are also printing second-edition copies of Viticulture--those files have already been submitted to the printer for pre-production. \nIn August, Viticulture will reach retailers, people who pre-order through our website, and backers who select Viticulture as an add-on (instead of the consolidated $79 and $99 rewards). We're able to offer those low prices by shipping Viticulture and Tuscany together in November, but if you want Viticulture in August, you may add it to any reward level (even the $1 level) for $49 or pre-order through our website.\nThe 2nd edition of Viticulture incorporates several rules changes, including the addition of the grande workers. These updated components are standard in every second-edition copy of Viticulture, and we will provide them for free in the Tuscany box for any current Viticulture owners (we'll ask you in the post-KS backer survey). We're trying to limit the number of upgraded components we mail individually to current Viticulture owners because of the expense and logistics involved, but we'll try to accommodate everyone as best as possible.\nphotos used with permission from boardgamegeek.com reviewer EndersGame\nEuphoria (retail version) is not available as an add-on, but you can order it from our website for immediate shipment during this campaign at a discounted price while supplies last (sorry, we only have copies in the US and Canada at this point, so shipping elsewhere is expensive). The Kickstarter version of Euphoria is not available. We will be offering special \"realistic\" resources in the near future\u2014you can subscribe to our e-newsletter for notification.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTuscany is a first for us in that it is our first attempt at an expansion to an existing game. Fortunately we have an ever-growing number of local and worldwide playtesters who offered us feedback over the course of the development process.\n\nThe main challenges we experienced with Euphoria that we will learn from are:\n\n(a) Amazon fulfillment isn't perfect, and occasionally a box might arrive slightly damaged (this happened on about 20 out of 5,000 copies of Euphoria delivered via Amazon fulfillment). For Tuscany we'll print replacement boxes to send to backers if needed.\n\n(b) In games with a myriad of components, sometimes a component doesn't make it into the box for a small percentage of the games. Thanks to a number of helpful Stonemaier ambassadors worldwide, we are able to get replacement parts to backers within a few days, and we've worked with our manufacturer to reduce the chances of missing parts for the future.\n\nThanks to our experience with Viticulture and Euphoria, we know exactly what goes into creating a high-quality game and delivering it on time. Stonemaier Games now has a worldwide supply chain set up to ensure punctual and cost-effective delivery to backers in almost every country. We're still learning, but we're slowly adding to our track record of success from Viticulture and Euphoria. We're also working with the same manufacturer again (Panda GM), so we know exactly what they need to produce quality product on schedule.\n\nWe tend to invest everything we earn from Kickstarter into making the best game possible. Any extra cash flow we have is from retail sales, which we are funneling into the second printing of Viticulture.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisors to point us in the right direction.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 80+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Viticulture Moor Visitors Expansion", "update_content": "Hi!

Thanks to that, you will receive your products on time, and you will not pay additional taxes or handling fees.\nCanadian Backers: The shipping fees we have calculated in the pledge level are based on delivery via Fedex. That means the ship fees are much less than USPS BUT most of the packs will be subject to customs so you may pay more. Of course we can change that and send your order via USPS but you will have to pay more ship fees ($10-$35) depending on the order and the final size. If you want us to use USPS just contact us before you pledge.\nAustralian-Asian Backers: Shipping fees takes place from China via courier in order to keep as low as possible the ship fees. This way you will not have to wait anymore much longer to receive your goods + there will be a safety regarding the products' delivery at your door.\nAll other Backers: This one includes people who live in countries like Brazil, Peru etc. In these regions as well as few more we use USPS. You don't have to pay any customs or taxes etc BUT shipping fees are much higher.

The ship to USA has arrived at the port, now we make all the paper work so we can release the goods and send them to the warehouse and from there to you.\nThe ship to EU arrives in 2 days and we will follow the same procedure. Now some info for you. We were well prepared for this production but we had some really unexpected factors that delayed the delivery of the game on time. First our manufacturer had made a mistake on the board, regarding the grid of the board and they had made it smaller, so they reprinted the board and the second time they did it again. Finally they printed it correctly the third time. We made the shipping papers and we knew that the ship left from the beginning of September.

The wooden components are quite good, nice wood weight, they do not smell, their color is nice, the shape is good, are not damaged, so I think the components of Hoyuk will be in good hands in Shanghai.

No assembly required, all miniatures come pre-assembled!\nHere's everything in the Guildmaster pledge for $100!\nIn Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces. Through the branching scenarios of the campaign, the heroes gain awesome new weapons and abilities, and the game remembers the heroic deeds of players from one session to the next, unlocking exciting new possibilities in future scenarios!.\nArcadia Quest is a miniatures boardgame for 2-4 players.  Each player controls a Guild of 3 Heroes, competing to be the liberators of the city of Arcadia and, more importantly, becoming the richest Guild in the land!\nArcadia Quest is a lot like a World of Warcraft raid on a hapless NPC city, with Heroes working as a team, except that you're not the only Guild after the loot!\nGameplay Features  \n2-4 players\nEach scenario plays between 45 to 60 min\nNo Game Master, everyone gets to play the Heroes!\nPlay with 3 Heroes as they fill their boots with monster Gold!\nModular campaign system - Multiple linked scenarios will eventually see the Guilds reclaiming the city of Arcadia. \nLevel Up and customize your Guild between scenarios with Loot and Equipment! \nPlayers are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.\nScenario objectives. Go Pandas Go!\nThe rules in Arcadia Quest are fast and furious, and every player can focus on using their heroes\u2019 abilities and equipment to achieve their goals, without the need for anybody to get stuck with the role of solely controlling the monsters.\nMonsters are \"aggroed\" when Heroes attack them or come too close to the areas they are guarding. Once activated, monsters then follow simple rules and are controlled by the player on the right.  This gives the perfect balance between an automated environment with a little intelligence, without bogging down the rules with complicated \"if-then\" game logic, or requiring a Game Master.\nA Guild of Heroes (?)\nJogando Offline's Arcadia Quest Gameplay Video:\nInformative Gameplay Updates:\n1.

Ignore the sword. Watch the girl.\u201d CHOP! WHACK! HACK!\nAs a young Guildswoman, Sonja heard about the renowned Armor of Invulnerable Offense. It was said to convey superior protection to its wearers, and had helped more than one warrior woman to achieve fame and glory. Sonja relentlessly sought this legendary suit of armor, and eventually tracked it to a dungeon not far from Arcadia. But, when she found it, she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes! It was little more than a golden chainmail bikini! \nIncensed and annoyed, she figured she might as well try it on. Alas, the Armor of Invulnerable Offense proved all too true to its name. The cursed armor could not be removed! Thus, Sonja discovered the true secret: The worst defense requires the perfect offense. Many years later, she has proven the truth of these words. \u2026 Though she\u2019d still really like to get rid of that armor.\nThe Nameless Campaign\nLord Fang fled and the victorious Guild threw their Heroes a party (and let the losers attend to drown their sorrows). The party went long. Perhaps, a bit too long. For, when they all awoke after a drink or ten, they\u2019d been banished! The sun was gone once more! And monsters stood on the walls and jeered.\nThe Nameless' plan was simple: drug the enemy with strong spirits and bedazzle them with festive party favors. The Nameless\u2019s mighty horde descended from the mountains and piled the snoozing heroes beyond the gates. Eternal Night fell once again!\nNow, in this darker time within the darkest time, the heroes must face this despicable Nameless Threat in yet another Arcadia Quest!\nMore monsters! More loot! More glory! (And, perhaps just a nice dinner party afterwards this time, hmm?)\n6 exclusive figures and rules - an alternate boss and minions for your Arcadia Quest campaign!\nThat's a sexy wand you have there fella...\nShipping information - Please take note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship.  We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign concludes.\nThis is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.  \nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world).  As a rough estimate, the game will cost about $11 to ship in the USA, about $20-$25 in the EU (due to VAT), and $11 to Hong Kong all the way up to $40 for Australia, but this may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we might unlock and your carrier choices.\nOptional Buys\nIf you'd like The Beyond the Grave Campaign, just add $48 to your pledge by clicking Manage Pledge from the Arcadia Quest Kickstarter page and we'll sort it out after the Kickstarter ends with our pledge manager.\nBeyond the Grave is an expansion to Arcadia Quest that takes place after the overthrow of Lord Fang.

You will receive both games in one box.\nMigration is now officially EU Friendly. I will be conducting EU fulfillment through Ship Naked who have a facility in the UK.\nBy the hundreds, creatures are emigrating from the Old World in search of hope and prosperity. The New World offers endless opportunity, but only to those who arrive first. In this clever game, players seek out territories to conquer and compete for the most fertile properties, making critical decisions to gain the advantage.\nMigration is a land-grabbing game in which players play unique pieces on a board in order to claim territory. Each piece is treated differently, ignores certain rules or creates new conditions according to its type. Players continue to settle in regions while remaining careful to not upset opponents, walk into traps or restrict one's own growth options.\n\"If you play with people who like quick and intense games with lots of simple but important decisions, then by all means pick up a copy of this game... It's tons of fun.\" -JT, co-founder of The Game Crafter\nThis is the same video as above.\nThe full live Migration Rules Document is here.\nIt seems simple enough, and it is, but there's a real depth to each decision and no two games play the same. At the beginning of each game, each player selects their own team of 12 pieces out of 30, carefully choosing abilities that work well together and counter the opponent's anticipated strategy. The map is then constructed from land plates (which takes less than a minute) and the adventure begins. With hundreds of thousands of possible team combinations, and millions (seriously) of possible maps, Migration is a nearly endless game.\nThe rules of Migration are learned very quickly, but mastered over time. They are designed to be understood by young children (kids as young as 4 have played successfully) and to open a wide variety of meaningful options without imposing analysis paralysis (kids as old as 60 have begged me to play it).\nAbove is the game Matt Jones and I created with the components available from The Game Crafter. In the Kickstarter version of Migration, we will be responding to the desires of the Migration community to improve the game dramatically. We are working closely with our manufacturer QPC to include 6 more unique explorers, twice as many game pieces, a modular board with limitless potential, and a more compact, thematic box.\nThe game will include 120 WOODEN explorer pieces, reminder image cards for basic gameplay and for each explorer (11+ explorers), 7 double-sided high-quality punchboard land plates for constructing the board, 8 terrain modifiers to further customize, 4 pioneer spirit tokens, and 2 game manuals, illustrating both basic and advanced play. \n As voted by our fan base, the final explorers will resemble the style of these examples. Those Explorers will be screen-printed on wooden tokens and feature the detailed artwork of Matt Jones.\nThe box will open like a book and fasten with a magnet, enhancing Migration's storytelling theme. Its dimensions were designed to fit inside the USPS Small Flat Rate Box in order to save you money on shipping. This snug fit also makes Migration very portable.\nThe Red Box is a Kickstarter Exclusive Collectible Box. Any boxes not ordered through Kickstarter will be the Brown Box. Both of these are works in progress. UPDATE: It is possible to chose either box for your order. It is also possible to get a mix of boxes for a multiple order.\nThis artwork is a draft of what the island plates would look like on the punch board. These plates would get punched out and separated to later construct the board. Some of those smaller islands would become terrain modifiers, further customizing the board. Three such double-sided punch boards would come with the game.\nMigration represents over a year of dedicated work and our first step into professional game development. Matt and I have spent hundreds of hours brainstorming, drafting, illustrating, play-testing and heading back to the drawing board to get this game to you.\nThe concept began as a curiosity. As a game designer, I draft prototypes for many, many games, but Migration was unique in its cohesion, modularity and replayability:\nIt had to be made.\nI found The Game Crafter, an American small-scale game production company and employed my college roommate Matt Jones to complete the artwork. I could afford to pay him much less than he is worth, but we decided to risk this project together.\nOnly a few months after the January launch, Migration became one of the best-selling board games in The Game Crafter history, earning a Staff Pick, a 4.8 (out of 5) star rating and an endorsement from Father Geek.\n\u201cHighly stylized, exceedingly professional, and wonderfully thematic ... What\u2019s bigger than fantastic? Ubertastic?... Migration has 'WIN' written all over it.\u201d -Father Geek \nFollowing through on my promise to expand Migration, I began working on more characters and environments soon after its original launch. Hundreds of play-testing hours later, I'm certain of their perfection. This time, however, Migration is ready for the big-leagues. I've reached out to QPC to print a huge number of games provided I am able to raise the funds.\nI've selected Kickstarter for the rest. Without Kickstarter, we won't have the funding to order a print run. So we've come to rely on our devoted community and the curiosity and support of strangers to make Migration a reality.\nAfter years of toil, I am proud to present Migration to the world. I hope you love it as much as I do!\n\"The art ... doesn't so much grab your attention, as punch it, take its wallet, and bundle it into its car. I love it.\" - fan\nThere is no doubt that Migration would be incomplete without the fantastic artwork of Matt Jones. Matt's illustrations bring to life the creatures and stories of our world.\nYour purchase helps him put the finishing touches on his work.\nThis art needs touching up.\nThe Sparrow is a proud and proper  military gentleman who should not be underestimated. He has a deep respect for the rules and insists that his neighbors observe his personal boundaries. Though he is not quick to anger, if he finds that he is not heeded, he will fly over and let you know exactly how he feels.\nThe Sparrow may Migrate over established Towns.\nThis art needs touching up.\nThe fly is a curious fellow with, some might hint at, vulgar tastes, though it would be impolite to say so. He lives off the scraps of others and doesn't mind solitude. Despite his peculiar preferences, he is a valuable member of society and should not be ignored. This off-putting gentleman is able to develop towns in places that others would find repulsive.\nThe Fly may establish Towns on Wasteland.\nThis art needs touching up.\nThe Oak is a wise old sage. He has seen fortunes rise and crumble, nations flourish and fall. This antiquated arborian has little interest in the frenzied expansion displayed by the other explorers, but he thinks he had better come along in case anybody needs a good story told. When people feel lost or run out of ideas, they always come back to the Oak to start anew. Some days he wishes they would stick around, but he doesn't let it spoil his day.\nAt the beginning of your turn, you may move your Pioneer Spirit to your established Oak.\nThis art needs touching up.\nThe Bass is a fellow who is hard to pin down. He has no interest in the laws and customs of the land dwellers, though he is happy to make a profit off them. Like a good sailor, he prefers the open sea with its crisp winds and endless quiet. That isn't to say he wouldn't accept some nice company if someone were to offer.\nYou may establish a Bass on any coastal region without needing a Pioneer Spirit.\nThis art needs touching up.\nThe rats are a kindly young couple, though they've grown old fast through a lifetime of hard work. They might not feel like they have much to contribute to all these adventurous types, but their virtue and general goodwill don't go unnoticed. After all, someone has to plow the fields or the citizens won't get their lovely cabbages and onions.\nAt the end of the game, Rats are worth two points.\n\nThe below artwork is for the expansion which will come bundled with the original game at all pledge levels. Though the illustrations are beautiful, they still need a few finishing touches before they can be called complete.\nThis art is incomplete.\nVicious and snarling, the wolf hides in the shadows waiting for his prey to approach. Seeming to appear from nowhere, he employs pack tactics to take down those foolish enough to encroach on his territory.\nThe Wolf may establish towns on a Forest Region without needing a Pioneer Spirit. At the end of your turn, if two of your Wolves are adjacent to any enemy piece, flip that piece to its Wasteland side.\nThis art is incomplete.\nTwitching about the desert, the lizard knows what is under every rock and bush. He is difficult to find, but when he appears he offers shortcuts and wisdom to guide travelers.\nYou may choose to establish your Lizard Town as a Wasteland. If you do, you may take another turn with that wasteland as your only Pioneer Spirit.\nThis art is incomplete.\nThe Jackal is a cunning and independent nomad of the desert. Accustomed to surviving on little, she thrives in lands that others would pass by.\nThe Jackal is worth a number of points equal to the number of Wasteland Regions adjacent to her.\nThis art is incomplete.\nPoison Oak is the beauty of the New World. Creatures travel for miles just to see her. She doesn't mind company and, let's be honest, they don't mind her.\nAt the end of each of your turns, remove all enemy Pioneer Spirits in regions adjacent to Poison Oak.\nThis art is incomplete.\nSurly and burly, the cactus is doing just fine on his own, thank you very much. He doesn't need friends, or even enemies. This prickly pickle just wants some space. And some quiet. And maybe some lemonade.\nWhen you establish a town with your Cactus, do not move your Pioneer Spirit to it. All towns adjacent to the Cactus are worth one less point. \nThis art is incomplete.\nThe skunk doesn't have a lot of experience making friends. Sometimes he's too shy even to talk to his stuffed acquaintances. Tonight he's traveling around looking for some company, but there's none to be found. Perhaps everyone else is just as timid.\nAs long as the Skunk has your Pioneer Spirit, enemies may not establish towns in adjacent regions.\n1.

To enhance the nautical theme of Migration, I will have linen ocean maps printed. Backers who increase their pledge by $10 will have this Kickstarter Exclusive added to their order. During play, this map is used to help align the island plates and provide an attractive backdrop. The map will be printed on linen and treated for protection. It will have the Migration logo and the Hexagonal Compass from Book I.\nBuyers of two copies can have two maps for $18, while buyers of 6 can have that many for $40.\nStickers\nOur second add-on is also available only to backers at the $34 level and up, though backers at the $99, $500 and $1000 level get it for free. As you know, The Migration Tokens will feature screen-printed symbols for ease of play and recognition. Some backers have expressed an interest in having the illustrations available as stickers as they were in the TGC version of Migration. Because this represents an increase in cost and the minority opinion, I have decided to make those stickers available as an Add-On.\nIn order to facilitate ease of recognition, which was a reported problem of the TGC version, The illustrations have been modified to highlight the portrait. Here is a sample.\nThe background colors will match the color of the team and help the illustration pop. In order to add these 120 high resolution 1\" stickers to your game, simply add $10 to your pledge.\nBuyers of two copies can have two sets of stickers for $18, while buyers of 6 can have that many for $40.\nThere is no extra shipping charge for EU or International backers who want to include Add-ons.\n$15k FUNDED! \nEveryone gets exactly what they have ordered with plenty of polite customer service (courtesy of yours truly) all day long.\n$20k Wooden Pieces UNLOCKED!\nIt's true! A combination of fixing those shipping issues and working some things out with QPC has made this possible at a much lower price than before. I now think that wooden pieces are truly within our reach! It's hard to express how excited I am about this, because this is how I dreamed the game would be produced :D\n$25k Expanded Game Options UNLOCKED!\nIt's hard to be specific about this because it will require a lot of playtesting. I will include at least 3 new play modes in the manual which are designed to elongate the fun-factor of Migration for experienced and advanced players. My goal is to perfect a set of rules for a draft-style of play, a balanced random ban, and other limited formats. \nAt this level, I will also include a series of Age cards which are used to introduce an element of randomness for casual or varied play. These Age cards will be drawn at the beginning of each round and impose a new rule or grant a new ability that is universally applied to all players during that round. These would include cards like \"Age of Bloody War,\" possibly allowing players to establish Towns on other Towns for that round. I have also mentioned \"Age of Harsh Winters,\" and \"Age of Low Tides\" in the comments. My aim would be to include about 15 so that not every one comes out each game and there is sufficient variety. \n$30k A New Explorer Approaches\nAs we approach this level, I will be heavily playtesting and critically selecting 3 Explorers that fit the theme and tactical environment of Books I and II. I will release their early PnP information so that players can get a taste of who they are. At $30k, I will allow all backers to vote on which Explorer is preferred and include that one in the game.\nI will only be able to release one at this level because the art and character development involves a huge investment of the limited time of my artist.\nMatt and I met in college and immediately recognized each other's talents. We have dreamed for years of working on a project like this. Though the fates have conspired to keep us apart, the internets have allowed us to come together to bring Migration to you.  \nJoe Cannon Game Designer, Writer, Special Educator\nI got into designing games when I realized that so many of the big lessons I learned as a kid came from my gaming experience. My vocabulary, critical thinking, adaptation, creative problem-solving, spatial reasoning and much more came from hours in front of my favorite board games.  \nBy playing these games, I was unknowingly priming my mind to succeed in many scenarios. I also spent many hours in front of meaningless games that promote addiction and lack substance. As a designer, writer and teacher, I strive to pursue games as a storytelling and learning medium. Games can divert, but they can also build community, develop perspective, enhance creativity and deliver those cherished aha! moments. After all, people already like games. Let's make them mean something.  \nMatt Jones Artist, Photographer, Prop Designer, Eye Candy  \nFans asked for proof of \"Eye Candy\" status, so here.\nMatt Jones is the artist and graphic designer for Migration. Matt earned his Bachelor's in Fine Arts and did some further study in the Atelier schools. He likes to draw people, robots, and animals engaged in various acts of adventurous battle or battlesome adventure, and is working on an original space comic. He spends most of his time building custom hardwood guitar gear, prop sci-fi and fantasy weapons, and interior furnishings in his hometown of San Diego. \nMatt hates it when people describe themselves in the third person and sincerely hopes that you've enjoyed the preceding exception.   \nThe future of Migration depends entirely on the community supporting it. After Book 1 came out, the community played it, loved it, and stayed in touch with us, encouraging us to create more content to enjoy. If history repeats itself, then we will have no choice but to make Migration even awesomer (it's a word).\nA successful Kickstarter also means that we will have more resources to work with for future projects, allowing us to purchase better materials and equipment, while better justifying our time. The more we exceed our goals here, the more quickly games will be coming out in the future.\nWe would love to extend our thanks to the entire Migration community. Our friends, family and fans have been so supportive over this year. We have enjoyed all the likes, calls, play-testing parties and experienced advice. There's no way we could communicate just how grateful we are for the amount of encouragement you all have given us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is a challenge.

Visit our website for details, and thanks for stopping by here!\nLagoon: Land of Druids is a game about forging the destiny of a world. Players lead circles of druids in search of enchanted sites that offer magic powers and the energy you'll need to bend Lagoon's destiny. Each site belongs to one of three different energies that compete to dominate Lagoon:\nEvery action you take alters the balance of power among these three energies. The energy with the most sites on the board at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny. Position yourself on the winning side of destiny, and you win!\nLagoon: Land of Druids supports 1-4 players. Most games are completed in 60 minutes or less. A game with 4 is a team game. \"The team actually works really well,\" says UndeadViking in his video review below (\"What People Are Saying\" section).\nThe recommended starting tile setup for new players is shown below. Like all setups, it includes one site of each energy to ensure the game begins in a place of balance between the three energies.\nGame setup for two players.\nPlayers alternate turns, using their druids to perform various actions. Common actions include exploring a new site from the bag, moving around the world, summoning a fellow druid back into play, and unraveling a site to remove it from play. \nAdditionally, every site on the board offers a unique magic power. If your druids occupy a site, you can use its power. A fun twist is your druids share their site powers with one another. So if you have five druids on different sites, each of them could use any one of the five site powers. This opens up a lot of tactical play and fun combos.\nMidpoint of 2 player game. Each player has a stack of unraveled sites and acquired seed tokens at bottom left and right.\nThe heart of the game comes down to manipulating how many sites of each energy are on the board, and this is where you'll be trying to outmaneuver your opponents by making better use of all the site powers to carry out your agenda. Explore new sites aligned with an energy you want to support, and gain a seed token matching that energy. Unravel and remove from the board the sites of energies you wish to oppose.\nAt the end of the game, the energy with the majority of sites in play becomes Lagoon's destiny. If you supported that energy better than any other player, you win! The game tracks loyalty to the dominant energy as follows. Seeds of the dominant energy remaining in your supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it's removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.\nUndeadViking Video Review\nGame play explanation begins at 5:35.\nTestimonials\nAdam P. McIver, Designer of Coin Age: \"Lagoon is a board game oxymoron. It somehow manages to feel immediately familiar while also being fresh and different. It simultaneously seems like a classic game and the hot new thing. The rules are easy to teach, learn, and understand but they combine to give you seemingly endless combinations and countless strategies.\nDavid has done something really extraordinary here. He's effortlessly walked the line between Eurogame elegance and Ameritrash atmosphere, blending theme and mechanics so perfectly that it should make every game designer jealous. I really hate him. (JK, I love him but reluctantly.)\nMy impressions of Lagoon were solidified while the game was still a prototype with no real visuals to speak of, and now that I've seen the artwork, my eyes have exploded right out of my head. I have no idea how I'm managing to type this right now, but convincing you to support Lagoon is that important. It's that good. Trust me.\"\nJason Tagmire, Designer of Pixel Lincoln: \"Lagoon feels like Magic the Gathering meets Summoner Wars meets a very thinky game of rock, paper, scissors. A very subtle, beautiful game.\"\nBen Pinchback, Co-Designer of Fleet, and Eggs and Empires: \"Lagoon is a gorgeous looking game and a real brain burner under the hood. Each decision is meaningful and fun. This is the type of game you think about long after you're done playing.\"\nDarrell Louder, Designer of Compounded: \u201cLagoon is a fantastic game where options and gameplay grow as the game goes on. It\u2019s a brilliant puzzle that I love to unravel every single time I play. Probably the best game I played at BGG Con 2013.\"\nMichael Mindes, Founder of Tasty Minstrel Games: \"Lagoon is fun, intriguing, and as you can see the artwork is amazing. I will be an excited backer on day 1 and I expect great things for this game and its designer David Chott.\"\nKyle Hendricks, Game Designer and Player Extraordinaire: \"There is a damn good chance that Lagoon will end up being in my top 5 favorite games of all time.\"\nThe components included in one copy of Lagoon are listed below. Every single one of the 54 sites has a gorgeous, unique illustration to vividly bring the world of Lagoon to life on your table! The hex tiles are a large 3.5 inches wide (as big as Eclipse tiles for those familiar with that game).\n1 rulebook \n1 round-bottomed drawstring bag for randomizing site tiles \n1 token draw bag for solo mode\n4 player reference cards \n4 player markers / exploration aids\n16 Elemeen seed tokens \n16 Vowelon seed tokens \n16 Deonin seed tokens \n40 cardboard druid tokens (5 each of Mushroom, Hare, Stag, Fern, Owl, Dragonfly, Turtle and Moon)\n40 WOODEN, screen-printed druid tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n36 WOODEN, screen-printed seed tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n24 double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n3 advanced double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n1 BONUS site tile!\n* Prototype components, graphics may change in final version. Forthcoming art will replace gray placeholder illustrations.\nI believe in Lagoon, and want you to believe in it too. So I've made a FREE print and play version of Lagoon: Land of Druids available for anyone to download. Print a copy and play at home today!\nDownload the Lagoon Print and Play\nDownload the Lagoon Rulebook\nI've worked hard to ensure my first board game design will be produced to a high standard of quality. The art will enchant you, and you'll have fun exploring all the possibilities of Lagoon's rich game play. But I have plans to make Lagoon: Land of Druids even more alluring if the project overfunds.\nMy philosophy for stretch goals is that they should make the game better without jeopardizing the schedule or the ultimate success of the game. There's a ton of exciting enhancements we can do within these parameters, and I have a succession of sweet options in mind! \nThe most effective way to achieve upgrades to the game is by sharing this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Please share Lagoon far and wide the world over!\nFirst Stretch Goal - $22,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nA 5th druid circle will be included in the game! \nBackers chose the Owl to be the emblem of the 5th druid circle! This provides an alternate art design for the emblem representing your druid circle, as you boldly forge Lagoon's destiny.\nThe initial four druid circle designs included in the base game are shown above, and the owl design will be completed early this coming week!\nPlease note, however, the addition of these tokens does not allow Lagoon to support 5 players. The balance of Lagoon's game dynamics is excellent with 2 and 3 players, but it does not scale well to 4 or 5 individual players. This is why the 4 player game is played with teams, which feels different but truly makes for a very fun, balanced experience.\nSecond Stretch Goal - $25,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTHICKER COMPONENTS! \nThe Lagoon: Land of Druids punchboards will now be 2.5mm thick instead of the original 2mm. This will make all site tiles, druid tokens, seed tokens, and player markers/exploration aids thicker! Thicker components are more durable, are easier to pick up, and feel more substantial and satisfying to use. They also look a lot more impressive on your table.\nThird Stretch Goal - $30,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSOLO PLAY MODE!\nLagoon: Land of Druids will now be playable for a single player! This will be a great way to play when you're a druid circle of one, or when the game first arrives and you're eager to learn it on your own. More details on this experience will be added soon.\nFourth Stretch Goal - $35,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nCHUNKY THICK COMPONENTS!\nThis enhancement will increase the thickness of the punchboards once more, from a thick 2.5mm to a chunky 3mm! That's right, we're on the threshold of magnificence, where .5mm tips the scales and pushes us into chunky land!\nThis is the thickness every prototype of Lagoon has used for its tiles, and I'm thrilled that this upgrade is well within reach. Considering most board games use 2mm or even 1.5mm thick chipboard for components like Lagoon's tiles, I think you'll love the heft of 3mm tiles in your hand and how impressive they look on your table!\nFifth Stretch Goal - $40,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTWO ADDITIONAL BACKER CHOSEN DRUID CIRCLES!\nA 6th and 7th druid circle design will be included in the game. Note this does not increase the player count above 4, as explained in the first update.\nBackers are nominating nature-themed emblems on the comments page now! To promote druid diversity, the two new emblems will be non-plant, non-fungus, non-bird, non-mammal emblems, as those are already represented. Lastly, I reserve the right to filter out suggestions that aren't thematic.\nSixth Stretch Goal - $50,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSIX ADVANCED SITES ADDED!\nSix \"advanced\" sites will now be included with Lagoon! That's three additional site tiles. Check out Flaming Lotus below, one of the advanced Vowelon sites! \nThe six advanced sites offer potent magic to your druids. They didn't initially make it into the base game because their usefulness is less straightforward, or they're a little tricky to use. But exceedingly useful they are! Now you'll be able to swap out three tiles from the base game for the advanced tiles, or play with all 27 tiles if you want a slightly longer game.\nSeventh Stretch Goal - $60,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nWOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nEvery Kickstarter copy of Lagoon will now include FOUR player sets of wooden druid tokens. That's 20 total druids, which is the full complement for the largest player count of 4. The tokens will be 4mm thick wooden discs, 1mm thicker than the punchboard druid tokens. Also included will be emblem stickers to label the members of each circle of druids.\nThese wooden tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter. I want to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, and that's why these wooden components will not be standard equipment in the retail version of the game. They won't be exclusive to Kickstarter backers, but they will be free to you.\nEighth Stretch Goal - $65,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSCREEN-PRINTED WOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nThe four wooden sets of druid tokens added previously will be upgraded from stickers to screen-printing. The druid circle emblems will be painted directly on the wooden discs. More attractive and durable than stickers, screen-printed wooden druid tokens make a classy and refined addition to Lagoon. And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nNinth Stretch Goal - $75,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nEIGHT SETS OF SCREEN-PRINTED DRUID TOKENS!\nA full eight sets of screen printed wooden druid tokens are included with every backed copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids. That's a total of 40 wooden druid tokens! This includes the four original emblems (Stag, Hare, Fern, Mushroom) as well as the four chosen by backers: Dragonfly, Owl, Turtle, and Moon.  And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nTenth Stretch Goal - $80,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nLAGOON ART DIGITAL WALLPAPER 3-PACK\nThree digital wallpapers of Lagoon art have been unlocked! If you can't wait until then, the sixteenth update has a nice treat for you!\nEleventh Stretch Goal - $90,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n16mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nRendering of seed tokens. Final design may differ.\n36 wooden seed tokens with screen-printed seed designs on both sides are now included with backed copies of Lagoon. This is in addition to the 40 wooden druid tokens unlocked previously, tricking out your copy of Lagoon with a grand total of 76 wooden tokens! This will complete the upgrade of all tokens from punchboard to painted wood.\nSeveral things to note about these tokens:\nThey will NOT be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter!\nThe game will still include all the punchboard seed tokens.\nThese seed tokens (16mm) are smaller than the punchboard seed tokens (19mm). If that saddens you, please take a look at the next stretch goal.\nThis goal provides 12 wooden seed tokens in each energy, whereas there are 16 punchboard seed tokens in each energy. Twelve tokens is actually the number all prototypes of Lagoon have used, which is plenty. We're doing more punchboard seeds because having extras may be handy and we have space for them.\nTwelfth Stretch Goal - $100,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n19mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nAll 36 wooden seed tokens are now upgraded from 16mm to 19mm. The larger size is the same as the punchboard seed tokens.\nAchieving this stretch goal makes every Kickstarter copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids a deluxe experience with a full 76 wooden tokens that will not be included in the base retail version of the game. That's 40 druid tokens in 8 different designs, as well as 36 seed tokens in 3 different designs. \nThirteenth Stretch Goal - $125,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nBONUS PROMO SITE!\nEach backed copy of Lagoon will include a bonus site tile! This promotional tile will introduce a new site type to Lagoon, the totem. Totems are game changing sites that don't behave like the others. Just one totem can completely change the feel of a game, so this bonus site will pack a punch! \nThis promo tile will NOT be included in the base retail version of the game.\nFourteenth Stretch Goal: $150,000\nWEEKLY LAGOON LORE!\nI will lovingly write and share with you a new chapter of Lagoon's lore and history once a week until the game goes out to backers.\nThe first chapter would be delivered by the first week of April, so we're talking at least 18 chapters! Each chapter would profile a new character, give background on a significant location, or cover some overarching topic in the world of Lagoon. We're not talking book sized chapters, but there'll be enough meat on these bones to flesh the world out.\nI could not produce Lagoon without the faith and support of Kickstarter backers. To respect this trust placed in me, I promise that backer copies of Lagoon: Land of Druids will be shipped out before the game is available for purchase at conventions or retail stores. \nI also pledge to keep my backers well informed at each step in the process of producing and delivering Lagoon: Land of Druids. If you ever have any questions or concerns about this project, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nLastly, I'm pleased to announce Lagoon: Land of Druids is now an EU Friendly project!\nIf you've made it all the way down here, thank you for giving my game your attention! Lagoon is the culmination of a dream going back many years to publish my own board games. My favorite games have evocative themes that are tightly woven into the mechanics. I love opening a game box and discovering an entire world beckoning me inside. When I sit down to play a game, I want to feel like I'm exploring a living system filled with mysteries to be solved and dynamics that grip me but aren't easily mastered. To me, that's magic in a box. That's what I want most when I sit down to play a game. \nI've put a lot of love into this game, and I hope when you sit down at your table to play Lagoon that your experience has a handful of these sparks pulling you in and creating memorable experiences with your friends and family.\nI have a big vision for this game and its future, and a dream to publish other outstanding games that are also set in the world of Lagoon. If this world resonates with you, I'm delighted that we've connected! I believe so strongly in what I'm doing that I actually quit my job four months ago to devote most of my time and energy towards building Three Hares Games. It may sound crazy, but I'm taking a leap forward towards forging my own personal destiny, and I'm grateful to anyone who plays a role in it.\nI started a blog to document this wild journey, and invite you to follow along if you like.\nCheers,\nDavid\n Three sizes available in three designs.\nGrizznant, Ancient Forest Lord\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\n Jokulmas, Trickster\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\nElixona, Queen of Dreams\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks for this project are possible delays with art, manufacturing, shipping and fulfillment. The schedule includes several weeks of buffer time at different stages in order to absorb a decent amount of unforeseen delays without jeopardizing on-time delivery.\n\nMost of the art has been completed already, and the remaining pieces are scheduled for completion before this campaign even ends. My graphic designer has worked in the board game industry for many years and has the experience to ensure the pre-press phase goes quickly. \n\nThe game will be produced by Panda Game Manufacturing, a very reputable company I've established a good working relationship with going back to August. I'm working with a well-recommended and responsive freight company to manage the logistics of getting the manufactured game from China to warehouses in other countries.\n\nI've analyzed several different fulfillment scenarios to get games to backers, and have evaluated three vendors to handle most of this process for me. I believe I've settled on the most efficient approach for fulfillment. As the project proceeds, I will continually monitor this aspect and shift my strategy if a more efficient approach is possible.\n\nAnother factor I want to disclose is that I will be on a family trip to Alaska at the beginning of August, which could overlap the timeframe that rewards are being distributed to backers. Fortunately, I am not planning to directly handle fulfillment myself, so I don't anticipate this causing problems with that process being carried out by my fulfillment vendors. I do mention this though because problems could arise in that timeframe that require my attention. I have verified that internet access will not be out of reach where we are staying, so I should be able to work productively while on this trip if required.\n\nI am prepared and motivated to meet any obstacles along the way, and diligently resolve them.

You can order the game on the official webpage!\nAbout Province\nProvince is a two player game where you must manage your resources and workers to build, complete goals, and score the most victory points to win! It features eurogame strategy and only takes about 25 minutes to play. It also fits in a 4\" x 4\" bag, so it's easy to take with you.\nTo succeed you need to manage a communal worker pool representing the available workers in your town. Players move their workers to generate resources (Labor and Coin) that are used to build the various Structures, which in turn effect resource generation. But your opponent can also move the workers leaving you without the resources you need! \nIf you want to know more you can download the current draft of the rules here. A number of fans have also provided translations of the draft rules into other languages: German, French, Spanish (Spain), Italian, Czech, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), and Mandarin Chinese. More are coming!\n(Now that the campaign is over the rules above will not reflect the final version, please check the official website or BoardGameGeek for updates!)\nOr for a quick fix, check out this \"How to Play\" video!\nThere are also a lot of subtitles options for the video, so if English isn't your first language, give those a try!\nWe've had offers for translations into Norwegian and Portuguese. So check back soon for those!\nCurious what other people think? We sent a the game to TheOneTAR to get some feedback, and she decided to make this video:\nWeaponsgrade has also put together a preview with a more in-depth overview:\nStill not sure about something? Ask a question in the comments!\nWe\u2019re no strangers to designing games with an economy of means. Last year we made a single card game called Shift that boiled down the essence of a Japanese style dueling CCG. This is a big box game with a small footprint. We\u2019ve designed and laid out all of the components to make it affordable and quick to deliver to everyone! The design work is done, and this game will go to press and out to backers as quickly as possible. By keeping the game small, we'll get it to you faster and spend more time making new ones. We\u2019ve got a busy year planned, and we\u2019re ready to print! \nWe care about how games are made and how they get to you. The game will be manufactured in the United States, so you're also funding proper living wages for the people making your game.\nYou\u2019ll receive a fresh slice of chipboard with all of the pieces ready to punch out and a bag to keep everything in. You might get even more! See below!\nWant more copies than we have on offer? Just back this project at the 4 copies tier, and add an additional $5 (+$2 for international) per copy.\nWe\u2019ve carefully picked stretch goals that stick to improving the quality of the final product. So please share this widely with your friends and family! The more people who support Province, the more awesome it will become!\n\n  Shift was our first Kickstarter project, and we learned a lot doing it. Sam designed the game to go on the back of his business card.

While our current product line has slowly grown to include more than 30 Character Meeples, we have received tons of requests for more!  Rather than releasing only a few of the ideas at a time, slowly over the course of the next few years, we want to work together with you, our backers, to make far more characters available right away!\nWith your help, we can make all of this meeply awesomeness happen! We started this project with an amazing 50 characters, but the potential was there to unlock even more choices via our stretch goals, which is exactly what we did! As a backer, you've had a say in what some of those extra characters would be!\nWith rewards from simply one set of your absolute favorite character, all the way to levels that include a complete 8-piece set of EVERY character released in this Kickstarter project, we have something for everyone!\nDown below are the Character Meeples that you can currently choose from, when filling out the backer survey at the end of the funded project. Any unlocked characters from the many stretch goals will give you even more to choose from. Or don\u2019t choose. Just get \u2018em all! :-)\nThis number DOES include the \"Character Germs\", but not the TEK tower token, as it is not part of the pledge level choices. Nor does it include meeples from our existing inventory, as they were released long before this Kickstarter.  Backers at the 1-of-each and 8-of-each pledge levels have seen their reward value go up with each unlocked stretch goal! :-D\n\nWhat about the characters that already exist?\nCheck out Update #17 to see which Character Meeples from our existing stock can be chosen as your reward for this Kickstarter project.  There is also a list of which ones are not available in this way, due to limited stock.\nPLEASE NOTE: As these Character Meeples were not released in this Kickstarter, they are not included in the \"1-of-each\" or \"8-of-each\" pledge levels.  If you want these as well, you can do an add-on based on which ones / how many you want. Thanks!\nCan I add-on 1-of-each of these 25 Character Meeples from existing inventory?\nDefinitely! It is actually convenient to do so, as there are 25 of them, and we already offer an add-on for any 25 individual meeples. You will have an option in the backer survey to simply state \"all 25 from MeepleSource.com\", instead of having to name each one separately.\nWhat are Character Meeples used for?\nAnything you want! Our 8-piece sets are the most popular size because that is how many meeples each player needs for a standard game of Carcassonne. Our Character Meeples are used to upgrade pawns in countless other games, representing workers, warriors, and more! How many games do you have that have some kind of marker for each player?\nDon\u2019t be \u201cgreen discs\u201d, \u201cyellow cylinders\u201d, or \u201cred tetrahedrons\u201d. Be pirates and princesses! Be zombies or werewolves! Be anything you want. Also, I know that many of you already have Character Meeples lined up on your desk at work. Because you can.\nHow big are Character Meeples?\nSimilar in size to our \"Mega Meeples\", they are approximately 19mm tall. Characters do vary some, particularly those with hats, wings, etc. As we have stated on our website since the inception of the Character Meeples, we have no intention of offering these characters in the smaller, \"standard size\" (16mm) meeples. The level of detail that we are able to achieve on 19mm meeples is very difficult, but impossible at a 16mm size. Thanks for understanding!\nRisk-Free Guarantee! \nIf for any reason you would like to return your Character Meeples, you\u2019ll have 30 days after receiving them to do so and get a full refund. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nYou Can Influence Characters That Are Still Undecided/Locked!\nAlthough we could have selected every character ourselves, we didn\u2019t, because we know how much you love to get involved in the process! As a backer you can vote on characters that are not yet determined, and be involved in other choices along the way.\nMore Pledges Help Everyone Unlock Even More Characters! Even after the project is funded, continued support will unlock more and more stretch goals, which will give all backers more Character Meeples to choose from. We will continue to add stretch goals as long as you continue to support us by pledging, spreading the word about this project, and participating by voting for our backer-chosen characters. We can\u2019t thank you enough!\nWe Need You! We have worked very hard to get this far, and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of our finished art. But we still need all of you to make this dream a reality!\nWant to add on extras of one or more characters? These handy add-ons should do the trick! Simply click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button and adjust your pledged amount to account for any add-ons from the list below. Remember that you do not need to change which backer level you are at (unless you want to do that as well), just the dollar amount of the pledge itself.\nALL pledge levels are also available as add-ons! To help you figure out how much to pledge to get all the goodies you want, please use our nifty...\nA NOTE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FOR ADD-ONS:\nIn an effort to simplify this crazy long project page, we have consolidated many of the pledge levels and add-ons, as secondary pledge levels can be added to ANY OTHER pledge level, if you wish.  Please use the pledge calculator to determine how much you should pledge for your desired combination.  The total that it will give you, including the appropriate international shipping, is correct.

We regularly collaborate with our loyal customers, bringing to market their own ideas as well as our own. We want to take great games and upgrade the boring bits to impressive ones, enhancing the player experience.\n If you are not already familiar with our existing line of Character Meeples, you may be wondering how close to the original art (pictured above) will the actual wooden bits be? We elaborate on this question in the FAQ down at the bottom, but here are a few recent comparisons from our existing product line that can demonstrate this.\nWe had the pleasure of meeting many of you at BGG.CON this past November, and despite already having over 30 different Character Meeples, we received many requests for more! Once we added your suggestions to the growing list of our own ideas, we realized that there were way too many great concepts for us to release in a single year. Heck, maybe not even over several years.\nThis is what led us to our first Kickstarter project.

Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic micro games.

Among those people was Jay Cormier.\nHe showed us Belfort, which we picked up and through extensive development efforts it became the game that it is today.\nAt that time, he showed us several \"games on the go\" as he called them.  They were very small games without many components which has good to great gameplay.\nThe best of them that we played was called, \"This Town Ain't Big Enough For The 2-4 Of Us.\"  We played it then, and we loved it then.  Of course, at the time, we were mostly clueless and did not even have our first games published.\nOur first games were only finished designs with artwork being made.  So, we had no clue how to make and sell such a game.  Of course, a couple of months ago, we figured it out.\nThankfully since that time, Jay and Sen both reminded me that this game would fit into the line.  So, they dusted the game off, reviewed it and then sent it to us.  We played it and loved it.\nSo, now we are bringing it to you.\nCheers,\nMichael", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are pleased to be bringing you the game This Town Aint Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us.

PWYW"}}, {"backer": "Martin Looij", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: Villagers and Werewolves. The Villagers don\u2019t know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time.\nThe game is incredibly simple: Each player gets a card which indicates their team and their special role, while one of the players acts as a moderator to keep the game running smoothly. Each day and night, the number of players gets smaller and smaller until either all the werewolves are voted out, giving the victory to the village team, or the werewolves equal (or exceed) the number of villagers, allowing the werewolf team to win.\nWhat results is an incredibly engaging game of lies, deception and trust. Most people who play Ultimate Werewolf once can't wait to play again. And every game is different, as there are dozens of special roles for both teams which can help out their side in a variety of ways.\nUltimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition was universally praised as the best version of werewolf ever produced. Here's the review posted by Tom Vasel on this version (and this new Deluxe Edition is even better):\nAnd here is a detailed review on BoardGameGeek.com. \nUltimate Werewolf has been the best-selling, highest rated version of Werewolf of all time. But we weren't satisfied.\nA new artist, Jade Holt, was commissioned to do the background of the cards to give them just the right feel for the game and also to provide diagrams for the rules. And the graphic design of the cards was totally redone to make them feel more modern, yet still capture the right atmosphere for Ultimate Werewolf.\nThe rules have been rewritten and reformatted to make them easier to read and reference. The scorepad has been redesigned. The backs of the cards have been entirely redone. The card stock has been upgraded.\nHere's what you can expect in the box:\nDozens of unique roles on standard-size sleevable cards. Each card has the name of the role, a concise description, and a positive or negative number that helps you to balance the game.\n The following cards are included in every backer's set of Ultimate Werewolf Deluxe Edition (some artwork may change in the final version):\nGetting Started Guide: The quickest and easiest way to get started playing Ultimate Werewolf.\nThe Ultimate Werewolf Rules with advanced and optional rules, details and alternates on all the roles, tons of scenarios, a Team Building guide, Moderator guide, and much more!\nModerator scorepad for keeping track of players and roles\nThe brand new Wolfpack expansion (see details below)\nYour choice of ArtPacks (see below).\nThe Wolfpack Expansion contains six new wolf character cards that are included in EVERY reward level:\n Who are the most famous werewolves? Ultimate Werewolf: Wolfpack has them all, in ways you\u2019d never expect. This expansion for Ultimate Werewolf has six new roles for your werewolfing fun. Think werewolves are too meek? That\u2019s because your villages have never had The Big Bad Wolf, who leads the werewolves to eliminate villagers twice as fast while he\u2019s in the game. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the terrifyingly-confused Fruit Brute, who is, of all things, a vegetarian. And every game you\u2019ll want to know who in your group is actually afraid of Virginia Woolf. And there are 3 more famous wolves, including one that coincidentally shares a name with one of the X-Men.\nThe artwork on the cards is stunning, but we've gone a step further: we've commissioned artwork from some of the world's top artists, in several different styles, which can be added as an \"ArtPack\" to your game. You might recognize some of the artists: Debbie Ridpath Ohi (\"InkyGirl\" on BGG) is the best-selling, award-winning children's artist for I'm Bored and Naked!. Klemens Franz is the artist for a few popular boardgames, including Agricola and Suburbia. George Patsaurus is the artist for Agents of SMERSH and Flashpoint: Fire Rescue. The most famous boardgame illustrator of all, Doris Matth\u00e4us (El Grande, Tigris & Eurphates, Carcassonne, Primordial Soup, and dozens more) is supplying an ArtPack in her signature style. And finally, Gus Batts, the children's book artist who illustrated One Night Ultimate Werewolf has an ArtPack too!\nThese ArtPacks contain at least 10 cards: 1 Seer, 2 Werewolves and 7 Villagers, allowing you to swap out the standard artwork for something a little different. You get one ArtPack of your choice with the base game for free. The different reward tiers allow you to have either your choice of 1, 5, or ALL of the available ArtPacks (up to 16).\nYou'll notice that several ArtPacks have additional special role cards (in addition to the 10 cards you're already getting in each ArtPack).\nEach backer will receive a copy of the Deluxe Edition before it is available in stores, including the brand new Wolfpack expansion and an ArtPack of your choice.\nYou can also pick five or even ALL 16 of the ArtPacks. And there's even an Everything Werewolf tier that gives you all of the ArtPacks and all of the other Ultimate Werewolf games/expansions!\nIf you'd like more than one of any of these rewards, just add that amount to your pledge (for instance, if you'd like 2 Games and 2 ArtPacks, pledge $50 at the $25 Game & 1 ArtPack reward level). You'll be able to choose which ArtPacks you'd like when the survey is sent out after the project is funded.\nIf you love Ultimate Werewolf, you know, really love it, so much that you have almost a restraining-order-kind-of-obsession, then you might be interested in these reward levels:\nVANITY CARD - get everything in Everything Werewolf, plus YOUR image and name on a card (both subject to approval) that will be included in an ArtPack. Choose from one of three special roles, and choose which of the Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition artists you want to create it. Your card will ship with the ArtPack of that artist! You\u2019ll also get 25 additional copies of that ArtPack to share with your friends.\nNARCISSIST CARD - get everything in Everything Werewolf, plus YOUR image and name (both subject to approval) on a card that will be included with ALL Kickstarter copies of Ultimate Werewolf Deluxe Edition. Choose from one of three special roles, and choose which of the Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition artists you want to create it. You\u2019ll also get 25 additional copies of that card to share with your friends.\nArtists available for these reward levels are:\nMirko (ArtPack #2)\nAzzedar (ArtPack #3)\nSarah (ArtPack #4)\nWitek (ArtPack #7)\nBrianna (ArtPack #9)\nChris (ArtPack #10)\nErica (ArtPack #11)\nKlemens (ArtPack #13)\nGeorge (ArtPack #14)\nTiming is critical on this kickstarter, and files need to get to the printer pretty much immediately after it funds. Therefore, anyone backing at this level must get in touch with me right away to supply an image and to choose an artist and role. If this is something you want to do, please change to that reward level sooner than later so that the project doesn\u2019t run a risk of delay.\nBackers will be able to review sketches of illustrations and provide feedback, but the final decision on the art will be with Bezier Games, Inc. Of course, we\u2019ll do our best to make the cards (and you) look as good as possible!\nThe great thing about these reward levels is that each person who backs them is making more cards available for the rest of the backers! The ArtPack lists will be updated before the survey goes out so everyone will know which ArtPacks have those extra cards, and what those roles are.\nUltimate Werewolf Artifacts is an expansion that can be played with ANY version of werewolf (though you should play it with Ultimate Werewolf, of course). This redesigned version is going to match the new Deluxe Edition design stylistically, and come in a nice solid box (the previous version comes in a very tiny tuckbox). And, it will have a few new artifacts, including the amazingly awesome Shroud of Shame, which has been an absolutely huge hit with playtesters.\nSo, what is the Artifacts expansion? It's an expansion that allows all players to have a special ability in the form of an artifact. Each player chooses to reveal his Artifact whenever he or she chooses to activate it.\nWhen Artifacts was first introduced, we did a little promo video for it, and Mad Men's Rich Sommer gave us several great quotes (he loves Ultimate Werewolf, which is so very cool):\nDo you need Artifacts to play Ultimate Werewolf? No, but it's a whole lotta fun, and will shake things up a bit from \"regular\" games. Here's Tom Vasel's ridiculously-glowing review of Artifacts:\nThere are still many copies of the current version of Artifacts available, and this version will not be in stores until those other copies are gone, so you'll have this version before anyone else!\nYou'll get 44 Artifacts in the new version, including 4 brand new Artifacts: The Shroud of Shame, The Amulet of Protection, the Skimmer of the Cursed, and the Vote from Beyond. Here's a quick look at all 44 cards:\nEveryone at the EVERYTHING WEREWOLF level will get this new version automatically instead of the old version now that we've achieved this stretch goal, and all backers at every level can add it as an add-on for $15 (plus $5 for international shipping).\nThere are all sorts of amazing Stretch Goals that have been unlocked for this kickstarter campaign. Everything from additional artwork packs to new alternative artwork cards to entire expansions. All unlocked expansions will be included with EVERY backer reward level. ArtPacks can be selected (after funding, during the survey process) if you chose them at those reward tiers. Additional character cards are added to specific Artpacks. If you back at the EVERYTHING WEREWOLF or GAME+ALL ARTPACKS levels, you'll get all the ArtPacks and all the extra cards.\n You can add on additional items to any reward level from $25 up:\nDoubling the reward level results in two of everything in that level. Tripling gets you three, etc.\nExtra copies of the Deluxe Edition: $25\nExtra Artpacks: $10\nUltimate Werewolf: Inquisition: $25\nOne Night Ultimate Werewolf: $25\nOne Night Ultimate Werewolf Player Mat: $20\nOne Night Ultimate Werewolf t-shirt (sizes S M L XL): $15\nOne Night Ultimate Werewolf t-shirt (sizes XXL, XXXL, XXXLT): $18\nUltimate Werewolf Artifacts: $15\nExtra Wolfpack expansions: $10\nShipping is included for US backers. International backers, please add $5 for each additional item.\nThere will be a section on the survey to indicate what additional items you wanted (including which specific artpacks) after the project is funded.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBezier Games is an established publisher.

And a hand of ingredients that allow them to manipulate their mixing line, or add ingredients to the stew from every mixing line.\nOn a cooks turn they may sample the stew, taking one ingredient of their choice from the stew into their hand.  Or they may spend an ingredient from their hand to divide their cooking line, gaining access to more of their ingredients, or to add ingredients from their line into the stew, but be wise because if you add an ingredient that other cooks are ready to add, they too can add to the stew on your turn.\nWhat if multiple cooks are done at the same time?  Well, every good Burgoo cook knows, \"Ingredients in the hand are better than 12 in the stew.\"\nHOW TO PLAY BURGOO VIDEO (Prototype Components Shown)\nPLAY\n\n     Burgoo will be printed to TMG's typical quality standards.  The ingredients that make up Burgoo are:\n96 ingredient tokens (16 of each Beef, Carrots, Onions, Celery, Potatoes, and Herbs/Spices)\n1 Rulebook\n1 Baggie to hold everything.\nStretch Goals\nWith more funding, we are able increase the size of our print run which means that we have a lower cost per unit.

Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic micro games. Not just micro components and a micro footprint, but also a micro price.\nIt wasn't until about September of 2013 that we figured out a viable method for providing games like these at a quality level the fans of TMG have come to expect.\nSo, we have embraced a pay-what-you-want methodology with one modification, a minimum support level which covers our costs. At the suggested pledge level of $5, then we (TMG and the game designer) make a decent amount from your pledge.\nMost of all, we want to be able to bring these great tiny games to you, your friends, and your family. If this project goes well, then we will be able to bring more like this to you in the future as well. So, please share this project with your friends.\nHello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to check out my game called Burgoo! It is one of my favorite designs and I thought I'd give you a bit of history about the game: \nThe game of Burgoo started out as a design challenge that I proposed for my local game design group way back in 2007. The challenge was simple: \"Design a game using only glass beads. The quantity and color are up to you. No board, no paper and pencil, nothing but the beads\". Restrictions like that always get my creative juices flowing and I got to work. \nThe resulting game was something that was portable, simple to teach, quick, and fun to play! Everybody loved it and I ended up winning that challenge hands down. After many playtests and a lot of feedback, I felt it was the time to pitch the game publishers. Unfortunately, publishers at that time weren't ready for the concept of a micro game - \"too small to publish\". So, I decided to try my hand at publishing my own game. \nI made around 50 copies of that game and sold them at the BGG.CON flea market under the poorly-titled name \"Chains of Fenrir\". The game sold out, and I was happy leaving the game on a positive note to pursue other designs.\nI thought that that was the end for the game. So it lied dormant, or at least it tried. The game kept popping up. Friends were teaching friends. People were making their own copies. I thought maybe it was time to give it another go with the game. After coming up with the perfect theme (soup, of course!) I showed it to the great guys at Tasty Minstrel. They loved it and thought their \"pay-what-you-want\" would work perfect for a game of this size.\nI am really looking forward to you trying out Burgoo because I know you and your friends will enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for your support!\nDan Manfredini is the designer for the games Island Siege, Venture Forth, and Monkey Lab. For the past five years, he has run a charity game convention called \"Give to Game\" to raise food for local pantries. He lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife and two board game loving sons.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are pleased to be bringing you the game Burgoo.

Size, color, and material still To Be Determined.  They will be also available as an add-on. Below are bags Ningbo Lijia offers.  I have requested more samples to touch and determine full range of options.\n----\nHelp enhance a global icon.  Throughout the world, the classic six-sided dice (d6) symbolize not only gaming, but also play and luck. \nSome say dice originated from the ankle bones of hoofed animals. But once the die developed into the pipped cube, the d6 stopped evolving.\nIsn't it time for a new spin on a classic? By making the d6 a dodecahedron, the die will not only roll better, but be more weight-balanced as opposing sides have the same number of engraved pips.\nDoublesix Dice can also be the perfect gateway accessory: Swap in your Doublesixes for the stale dice in your non-gamer friends' games (like Monopoly and Backgammon), and soon they will be wanting to take on Advanced D&D.\nIf you pledge to get your own Doublesix Dice and help this humble intiative, I pledge to provide you, in return, detailed transparency of the process, and satisfaction guaranteed (or your money back).\nWe will start with Black engraved pips on Ivory. Other colors will be added as stretch goals.\nHere are some preliminary details:\nWhy $3246?\n\nProduction: $2000\nShipping: approx $1000\nFees (Kickstarter at 5% and Amazon at about 3.2%): $246\nNot included:\nLogo design: $299 (via 99designs.com, where you can help vote for the final design)\nAdvertising on Boardgame Geek: $500\nGift to Ronald Larson (expired patent holder): $300\nVirtual Assistance: $300 +\nPRODUCTION\nThese 19mm ivory-colored acrylic dice will be custom molded with engraved pips painted black. Current likely producer: Ningbo Lijia Industry Co (they specialize in game components) http://www.cnlijia.com.cn/\nCost of mold: $1300.\nCost of minimum production run (10k units): $700\nCost per dice (first 10K including cost of mold): $0.20\nWholesale cost per dice: $0.40\nMSRP: $0.80\n\nI used the wholesale cost to calculate the reward tiers.\nPer order of 12 dice:\nCost for dice: $4.80\nCost per envelop (bubble mailer): $1.49\nCost to ship in US: approx $2.50\nCost to handle (ie. pack and label): $0.25\nKS and Amaz fees: $0.82\nTotal cost: approx $9.86\nSHIPPING TO CANADA AND MEXICO: Kickstarter groups Canada and Mexico in their \"to ship Outside the US\" additional cost in the reward tiers, though it is cheaper. I plan to compensate Canadians and Mexican somehow (likely extra dice).\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThough I thought of the idea myself, I discovered an expired patent (filed in 1982) on the exact same idea:\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US4465279\n\nAs a measure of good faith, I had originally planned to donate 10% of the Kickstarter goal amount ($300) to the original patent holder, Roland Larson (or his charity of choice), if we were successful.  EDIT: Turns out that Kickstarter forbids this, so this will not be happening.\nBecause the patent is expired, no one, including myself, can patent the idea again, so it is fair game to all.  Therefore, others can start producing d2x6, and probably will.  However, there will be the one and only original brand: Doublesix Dice.\nPROTOTYPES\nThanks to Eric (http://www.ericharshbarger.org/) for making the prototypes for the video (he used blank dice from Chessex manufacturing and engraved them with a laser cutter).\nClick Kicktraq image below to track this project's trending.\nADD-ONS and COLORS:\nWill be $5 for a 6-pack. Colors are approximate.\nKickstarter Green with Black\nSolid Black with White\nSolid Black with Red\nSolid Purple with White\nSolid Yellow with Black\nSolid Blue with White\nSolid Red with White\nSolid Red with Black\n MARBLE COLORS (effects and colors are approximate):\nMarble Red with Gold\nMarble Green with Gold\nMarble Blue with Silver (though pictured with gold)\n FUDGE DICE:\nMarble Orange Fudge with Black\n TRIPLEFOURS\nAll 8 will be produced and available as 6-pack add-ons.  For the TripleFour Tier, you get to choose 2 6-packs.\nThe 4ier\n1a) The Fourier (Black with Orange)\n1b) The Fourier (White with Purple)\nThe Jazzy Bear (Black with Yellow, and Marble Yellow with Blue)\nThe Monty (Marble Purple with Yellow, and Turquoise and Black)\nThe Monty (Marble Purple with Yellow)\nThe Monty (Turquoise and Black)\nThe SableFox (Solid Yellow with Black)\nThe SableFox (Black with Turquoise)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPotential risk: there is the risk that the product itself is unsatisfactory.

Backers on Council of Verona paid $4 for it but this was used to help us hit some Stretch Goals not really sell it as a product.\n2. We want as many people to play WATR as possible so removing the pricing barrier is hopefully a way to do that.\n3. WATR is a great advertisement for Council of Verona.

In the shadow of the Copper Peaks, a battle for control of the realm has begun. Will you further the expansion of The Royal Kingdom of Heads or will you help The People\u2019s Republic of Tails fend off the threat of an invading empire?\nIn Coin Age two players attempt to control the land of Agea using a single card map and a handful of pocket change. Players take turns placing their forces (coins) on the map to control spaces, outmaneuver their opponent, and score victory points.\nCoin Age is a quick-playing area control game with lots of player interaction that uses an innovative \"coin slap\" mechanic to determine available actions. On your turn, you will take one of each of your remaining types of coins into your hand (1 quarter, 1 nickel, 1 penny, and 1 dime), shake them up, then slap them down on the table. \nDepending on the number of coins that match your \"side\", you are then able to either place coins on the map, move previously placed coins to an adjacent space, or remove them altogether. \nWhen placing coins, you may also place your coins on top of your opponent's coins if your coin's size/rank is smaller, so while a quarter will give you the most victory points at the end of the game, it is the easiest for your opponent to cover.\nI know that it can become confusing with Stretch Goals what exactly you might be getting for making this pledge.  First and foremost, you get the awesomely fun game play of Coin Age.  \nThe materials in the envelope however are:\nOriginal Coin Age map card\nDurable \"credit card\" like material with original Coin Age map.\nDoubloon Lagoon Map\nFrozen Assets Map\nLave Map (Cool Name Pending)\nRules\nCardboard coin tokens.\nStickers to apply to real currency if desired\nZip baggie to hold all of the stuff.\nWant to try Coin Age before you support this campaign? (Or want to play it while you eagerly await delivery of the official version?) Download the Print & Play version from BGG or by clicking here. It\u2019s free!\nOr just read and check out the rules at those links above.\nAt TMG, we REALLY love games and publishing games.  Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic games that are also micro.  Not just micro components and a micro footprint, but also a micro price.\nIt wasn't until about September of 2013 that we figured out a viable method for providing games like these at a quality level fans of TMG have come to expect.  Sure, we could provide fancy print-and-play games, but that doesn't scream high quality and high value.\nSo, we have embraced a pay-what-you-want methodology with one modification, a minimum level.  $3 is very close to our actual cost to get the game to you.  At the suggested pledge level of $5, then we (TMG and the game designer) make a decent amount from your pledge.\nMost of all, we want to be able to bring these great tiny games to you, your friends, and your family.  If this project goes well, then we will be able to bring more like this to you in the future as well.  So, please share this project with your friends.\nWe want Coin Age to be as good as it can possibly be, but that requires us to make more copies of the game, which means that we need more funding.\nSo, as we pass certain levels of funding, we will unlock the following increases in the quality of the final game that EVERYBODY will be getting:\n \"If I want to mail a simple letter in Demarks it costs me a dollar and a half. Creating a game and shipping it worldwide for 3 dollars is some kind of super power.\" - Potential Coin Age Backer\nHi everybody! Thanks so much for checking out my game. Coin Age has been a passion project of mine for the past year, and I\u2019m blown away by the overwhelmingly positive feedback I\u2019ve received since debuting it at Gen Con. \nI wanted a way to get the game in front of as many people as possible, and when Michael approached me with his \u201cPay What You Want\u201d idea, I felt like it was a perfect fit. I love Kickstarter. I\u2019ve backed over 70 projects with no sign of stopping. I think Kickstarter can be an incredible tool for games like Coin Age that would otherwise never be published by the traditional model.\nI didn\u2019t set out to make money with Coin Age. It came out of the desire to always be able to carry a small, engaging game with me and be able to play it wherever I go. Something that could fill the time before everyone showed up at a game night, or something I could play with a friend while waiting for our dinner at a restaurant. \nI started with the idea of \u201crolling dice\u201d with coins, playing with multiple uses for their double-sided-ness, and evolved these ideas into an area control game with a fun/silly theme. Coin Age has been playtested over and over and over and over, then again and again, and after that more and more and more to make sure it was as tight, streamlined, and as minimal as possible while maintaining enough choices to make it interesting. \nI have a special place in my heart for the game, and I really hope you will see it the same way.\nAdam was the illustrator for the hit microgame Council of Verona, and won the Boardroomers 2013 game design contest.

Based on votes from our supporters, the SCIENCE FICTION and FILM 101 expansion sets will soon be made real. \nThe Metagame is a card game about everything: comics and literature, fine art and tv, architecture and videogames. It\u2019s a way to show off your cultural smarts and get into ridiculous arguments with your friends. Arguments like:\nWhich feels like first love: Pride and Prejudice or Hungry Hungry Hippos? \nWhich is responsible for the fraying of our moral fabric: Tupperware or Das Kapital? \nWhich should be required in schools: Dungeons and Dragons or the Bible?\nSample Metagame cards.\nWe\u2019re asking for your support to print our game.

Each expansion set will include 40 illustrated culture cards and 10 discussion cards, in a snazzy thumb-tuck box.\nFirst expansion - FREE - at $40,000. Our first expansion set will go out as a FREE reward to everyone who supported the Metagame at levels of $20 or more.\nSecond expansion at $50,000. At $10,000 more, we'll print a SECOND expansion set! Anyone who supported the Metagame at the $40 level or higher will get BOTH expansion sets for free. (For each $15,000 beyond that, we'll print another expansion set - up to 5.)\nHelp us choose! All Kickstarter supporters of $20 or more get to vote on their favorite expansion set.

But our players wanted more. So we're expanding the Metagame to include all kinds of culture! We have spent the last few years playing the Metagame with people of all ages. And our players love the game! Here is what a few of them have said:\nI love The Metagame, it's a great tool for talking about games and art. -- Max Temkin, co-creator of Cards Against Humanity\nFinally, I can use my rhetorical wiles to dazzle and confound all my friends! -- Naomi Clark, Game Designer & Culture Guru\nThe Metagame was a huge hit with our readers, and one of the best contributions we've ever included in the magazine. -- Tod Lippy, Editor, Esopus\nSince we started the campaign, we've already gotten some good press. The cool kids at Attract Mode wrote a super-nice review of the Metagame. And Sean Duncan, Professor of Education and Metagame fan, wrote this smart piece about the history of the Metagame and its potential for good in the world.\nWhy are we Kickstarting? We're currently in the middle of developing the new edition. The design of the gameplay and rules is finished. Illustrations and card captions are complete for about a third of the deck. Funds we raise will be used to pay our illustrator, print the cards and rule booklet, design and manufacture the game box, and ship all of the games from our printer. \nThe Metagame includes 250 high-quality, smooth-finish, poker-sized cards in a beautifully packaged box. There are two kinds of cards: culture cards and discussion cards.\nEach culture card has a different work of art, pop culture, or entertainment: MAUS to the Big Mac; Pong to Playboy; the Sistine Chapel to Sexting. Discussion cards ask questions like Which is responsible for the fraying of our Moral Fabric? or Which best represents America? Want to see more sample cards? Take a look at this PDF. \nUPDATE: We have now made a 50-card prototype deck available as a \"print and play\" PDF! It only has a fraction of the final game's 250 cards - but you can now try out the Metagame RIGHT NOW at home! Click here for the cards, rules, and cutting instructions.\nSo how do you play? Below, Colleen explains how to play the basic game. WARNING: We were trying to keep the video brief and focused on the rules, so we made really short and stupid arguments! In a typical game, we're much smarter. Honest. \nPLAY\n\nHere's one more below. Eric leads us through a full game of Head to Head. (And it doesn't end well for him.)\nPLAY\n\nBut the Metagame isn't just one game. It is a deck of cards that can be played in a variety of ways. The box comes with rules for four of our favorite games - listed below. But we know our players will invent more. \nDebate Club. (4 or more players) A chatty game of elimination: a \"critic\" player draws a discussion card each round and you play the best matching culture card from your hand. One by one, players reveal their cards, explaining and defending their choices. The top player gets bonus cards - but the bottom is knocked out and joins the critics. The last player left standing wins.\nCritics Circle. (3 or more players) The twist in this version is that you\u2019re not allowed to debate or discuss: the critic has to pick the best card for each comparison without knowing who played which one. The role of the critic rotates each turn and the first player to win four rounds wins the game.\nHead to Head. (3 players) In this strategic game, five discussion cards are placed on the table face-up. You and your opponent have to carefully deploy content cards from your hand, putting one on each comparison. The critic decides the winner of each head-to-head matchup, without knowing who played what. Check out our second update for a video of a full Head-to-Head match! \nMassively Multiplayer Metagame. (10-1000 players) Great for big parties and events. Everyone gets a small hand of cards, and you challenge other players to a quick match - any nearby bystanders act as judges! The winner takes a card from the loser and the goal is to have the most cards at the end of the game. \nWinning the Metagame requires a crazy mix of geeky cultural smarts, strategic thinking, and the ability to sweet-talk your friends. Journalist Heather Chaplin wrote about one of our playtest sessions for Filmmaker Magazine.

Benedetto, Max Temkin and Esopus Foundation, Ltd.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk with the Metagame is time\u2014more specifically, the time to get the printing just right. We are working with a well-respected printer who does lots of big card games, so the quality will be awesome, but it will take time to make sure that we are going to have the quality we want. \n\nThe most time-consuming part of the process right now is creating the unique illustrations for each page. They typically go through several rounds of revisions. Getting the card text to be the right combination of informative and humorous also takes multiple rounds of brainstorming and editing. So one risk is that the remaining cards take longer than we had thought to complete.\n\nWe have created a very conservative schedule by promising decks to our backers by March. But due to the time it will take for the printed cards to be shipped internationally and get through customs, it is possible that the schedule could slip.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "A new Metagame expansion!", "update_content": "Greetings Metagame Backers!\nThe last time we posted an update on this page, the world was very different, but you were there way back in 2013, supporting our indie card game The Metagame!\nWe\u2019re pleased to announce that we have just launched a Kickstarter for a new expansion\u2014all about games\u2014with the twisted and brilliant minds at Shut Up & Sit Down.

Unlike Werewolf, Templar Intrigue does not require a moderator, has no player elimination, and plays VERY fast.\nIn Templar Intrigue there are two teams, those loyal to France (and thus the King) and those loyal to the Templars, which start with asymmetric information. And of course, you might not know who is on your team...\nStretch Goals\n@ $16,000 - We will upgrade the quality of the cards that these will be printed on. The current card stock to be used is good-high quality. The upgrade will be to the absolute best card stock my manufacturer offers. \n@ $25,000 - We will pay the great artist Rob Lundy to paint/color the cards. Don't worry though! I really like the brooding look of the black and white here. He will not paint these in bright pastel colors. It will still be dark and you might only barely notice that they are in color!\nWhat Is Different And Interesting About Templar Intrigue? OR Why not just play Werewolf?\nTemplar Intrigue doesn't need a moderator, player elimination, or lengthy discussions.  Templar Intrigue is played quickly over a series of hands with the first player(s) that win 3 times being the winners of the game.\nAlso, there is some information that is public and perfect information in addition to hidden information and information that is revealed over the course of the hand.  \nFor example, everybody knows who the King of France is, because, well, he is the King of France!  Additionally, all of the players know who is a Knight Templar and who is a Monk. But of course, not all of the Knights are loyal to the Templars...\nThe Templar Traitor is loyal to King Phillip, but knows who the Grandmaster is.\nThen, again, not all of the monks are loyal to Phillip...\nOver the course of the game as directed by Phillip, each monks will look at the role of another player in the game.  This is how more information is revealed and more discussion is sparked.\nDid I mention Templar Intrigue plays quickly?  And there is no waiting around for hours after being eliminated (no elimination) to discover the end result of the game?\nWhat You Will Get:\nTemplar Intrigue will be printed to TMG's typical quality standards.  You'll get:\n10 role cards\n1 Rulebook\n1 Cardboard sleeve to hold it all together\nThis is not a print and play game.\nFrance - Friday, 13 October 1307\nHundreds of Templars in France are simultaneously arrested by the loyal subjects of King Phillip IV.  Phillip transferred the deeds of French lands to the Templars in exchange for cash, and spent the money on an extravagant lifestyle, efforts to place family members on other thrones in Europe, and a war with England.\nKing Phillip IV\nPhillip wants to be rid of the Templar menace and recover his previously enormous wealth.  Phillip was successful in breaking up the order of the Knight's Templar through arrests, torture, and executions.  However, he never recovered any of the enormous wealth of the Templars, and that might change in your game...\nWhich brings us to the events leading up to Friday the 13th.  When Phillip is trying to find the Temple Grandmaster and his Archivist (or accountant in modern terms).\nHow To Play\nCURRENT RULEBOOK - Subject to more editing for clarity.\nTemplar Intrigue is played in a series of quick hands, after dealing out the cards you will go through a series of information reveals.  Then you start playing, and that just means starting the discussion.\nTrying to sway Phillip to believe what you want the King to believe...\nAfter a certain amount of discussion and at the discretion of His Majesty King Phillip IV (good to be King), one monk will look at another player's card.  Then more discussion and then another monk looks and reports back.\nOnce all of the monks have spied on another play and reported back, there will be some more discussion and once again at the discretion of His Majesty, 2 players will be identified.  \nThe Archivist and Temple Grandmaster. King Phillip's goal is to find them so that his team can win the hand.\nIf Phillip finds the Temple Grandmaster and the Archivist, then Phillip and those loyal to France (blue team) win the round.  If not, then those loyal to the Templars (red team) win the round.\nAnd you play until one person has won 3 times.\nWhy Pay What You Want?\nAt TMG, we REALLY love games and publishing games. Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic micro games. Not just micro components and a micro footprint, but also a micro price.\nIt wasn't until about September of 2013 that we figured out a viable method for providing games like these at a quality level the fans of TMG have come to expect.\nSo, we have embraced a pay-what-you-want methodology with one modification, a minimum support level which covers our costs. At the suggested pledge level of $5, then we (TMG and the game designer) make a decent amount from your pledge.\nMost of all, we want to be able to bring these great tiny games to you, your friends, and your family. If this project goes well, then we will be able to bring more like this to you in the future as well. So, please share this project with your friends.\nThe monk REALLY wants you to share this project with your friends.\nDesigned by Michael Mindes - Why Publish Your Own Design?\nI, Michael Mindes (who started and owns TMG), am on the record consistently saying that I think that publishing my own game design would be a bad idea.  The main reason always comes down to me potentially thinking that my game is better than it really is.\nIt has also been a way to keep me from designing games so that I can concentrate on the areas of running the business of TMG which I am best at.\nAlso, it is a factor of understanding my own limitations.  For a long time, we almost exclusively published larger euro games.  I know that I do not have the personal fortitude to go through the development process on a consistent basis and  get a euro game to a state where I think it is a TMG publishable game.\nStill, I have been working on development of our games since I started TMG in 2009.  Also, I did a sizable amount of development work on Dungeon Roll.  When it comes to smaller and more simple games, I think that it is possible for me to design games good enough to put the TMG logo on.\nStill, I am wary of publishing my own game design.  That is why I have played the game with several different groups and have found them to be liking the game.  Without that feedback, this would not see the light of day.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am pleased to be finally bringing to you a game that I in fact designed. As the game only has a handful of cards and the artwork is already complete the risks associated with this project are low.\n\nTo date, TMG (and me) have delivered numerous games throughout the world. Some that were funded on Kickstarter and some that were not, at this point in time, we know how to deliver the product.\n\nThe biggest risk is if you will like it.\n\nCURRENTLY RUNNING PROJECTS (as of launch)...\n\nDungeon Roll Winter Promo is currently funding on Kickstarter and we expect to be able to deliver this small and simple project on time to backers. The risks here are low.\n\nPREVIOUS PROJECTS...\n\nCity Hall and Captains of Industry are both currently in the pre-press process and we expect to be able to deliver by our targeted time in the project of May 2014. After pre-press we will move onto manufacturing and once that is done it will go on a ship. Once the Ocean Freight arrives, it will be onto delivery.\n\nTwo of our previous projects recently finished on Kickstarter: Eminent Domain: Escalation and Belfort: The Expansion Expansion. Those are on their own timeline, but we felt that it would be important for you to know how the delivery of those is being handled.\n\nBoth Eminent Domain: Escalation and Belfort: The Expansion Expansion have completed the pre-press process, and are currently being manufactured.
