We now pass on these savings to you.\n\nBy supporting our projects, you will be helping us share the cost of mass production and allow more enthusiasts and even professionals to experience the value of quality products that are made in China.\nIn 1847, J. N. Hofzinser invented the Shell. \n\nThis was a clear indication to all magicians that Coin Magic from that day forth will be forever changed. \n\nDuring the last 170 years, magicians have built endlessly upon this genius invention. Transpositions, vanishes, appearances, Penetrations. It's hard to imagine that one could create the most incredible miracles with something so simple\n\nIn the field of Coin Magic, where sleight of hand is inevitable, the Coin Shell is undoubtedly the best tool. \nEven after over 170 years, the Coin Shell is still one of the must-have gaffs for any coin magicians. What's more, there are as many coin shells as there are different types of coins.\n\nThe question is, what makes an excellent Shell?\n\nWe have proposed four criteria to measure the quality of a coin shell.\n\n Closeness: The gap between the edge of the Shell and the edge of the coin. The smaller the better.\n Fit: The degree of adhesion between the coin case and the surface of the coin. The better the fit, the better the quality.\n Coverage: The degree to which the edge of the coin shell covers the edge of the coin underneath. The more coverage the better.\n Degree of deformation: The coin needs to be flattened in order to expand the coin shell. During this process, the deformation of the pattern is as minimal as possible.\nTo improve each criterion requires consideration of many factors. The reason being there are contradictions between each of these criteria. \n\nFor example, if you want more coverage, you must make it deeper. However, if you make it deeper, it will cause losses in the degree of deformation. In the production process, it is very likely that to enhance one criterion, other criteria will be affected. There is a delicate balance to be struck here.\nWe spent a year of continuous testing, scrapping, and retesting, and adding manual processes into the production, to make these four criteria to the most satisfactory level. \n\nHere we are: Artisan Coin Expanded Shell.\nPLAY\n\nIn addition to the craftsmanship, the value of an Expanded Coin Shell is also reflected in the performance. The Artisan Coin series entire line of products is accompanied by, what we believe to be the most comprehensive and original instructional videos ever.\n\nIn the instructional videos, there are six complete routines that have been tested across numerous actual performances: Coin Across, Table Coin Across, Coin to Glass, Coin Through Table, Three Fly, Half Set Routine. [You will need 4 regular Kennedy half dollars, which are NOT included, to perform the routines in the instructional videos.]\n\nWhat you see in the promotional trailer is just a small part of the full instructional video. The instructional video will help you quickly grasp the essence of the Expanded Shell, and also allow you to perform wonderful coin effects at a moment's notice.\nWe have also included a section on repairing your Shell which will allow you to easily repair a slightly damaged coin shell.\n\nThe coin shell can be said to be the foundation of modern coin magic gaffs. It is because of the coin shell, that all kinds of amazing coin gaffs were created in the century that followed.\n\nThe Coin Shell is also where the Artisan Coin series begins. \n\nWe hope that each meticulous detail will bring you a brand-new experience, and have more people experience the charm of coin magic.\nPoetic routine.\nHigh-precision gaff coin, the appearance is almost the same as a regular coin.\nRe-milled Half-dollar edge, allowing for a more simplified handling and can more routines.\nComprehensive instructional video, which includes six routines and new techniques.\nAlthough the Sun & Moon Coin was only circulated within a small circle of coin workers, it has also been favored by many coin masters.\n\nCurtis Kam once said, \u201cThe Sun & Moon Coins allows one to perform one of the most impressive and memorable coin magic ever created.\" The Sun & Moon coins in the hands of masters such as Geoff Latta, David Neighbors, Roger Klause, etc. also create all kinds of marvels.\n\nThe changes between the sun and moon, sunset and sunrise. This is the unique romance of The Sun & Moon coins.\n\nCheck the Video:\nPLAY\n\n- In the original version, due to the size, the penny shell could not fit over the half-dollar. Hence, some coins could only be concealed using sleight of hand.\n- For the Artisan Coin series, we have specially made a half-dollar, which is trimmed and re-milled. The appearance is no different from a regular half-dollar. However, because it can fit into the penny shell, the difficulty during the performance is greatly reduced and can be easily controlled, even for a novice.\n\nEven the producer of the trailer commented that it was no different from shooting a regular coin.  Hence we have added the split after the coin roll, in order to dispel any comments that we are using a regular coin for the trailer.\n\nThis should be the highest praise for our Sun & Moon Coins.\nAgain, for you to fully extract the value of the Sun & Moon coins, the instructional video will be more compressive than you imagine.\n\nIncluding 6 complete routines that have withstood countless actual performances: Sun & Moon, CBH1, CBH2, Hopping SM, CS Transposition, Three Colors Fly, and Shell Repairing.\n\n We believe you will enjoy this.\n\nJust use a romantic and poetic routine to conquer your audience.\nIn 1967, a magician from Scotland named Jim Boyd invented the prop called \u2018Confusing Coins\u2019.\n\nHe would not have imagined that the \u2018Confusing Coins\u2019 would become one of the world's most popular magic coin gaffs half a century later: The 'Hopping Half\u2019.\nImagine having two coins, one silver, and one copper, in your hand. You take one of the coins cleanly and put it in your pocket. Then you open your hand and find that both coins are still there.\n\nAfter repeating this three times, you then slowly place the copper coin in your pocket and open your hand. Where the audience expects to see two coins, the coins have now disappeared.\n\nIn our minds, we might think that performing such an incredible coin effect may require a lot of complicated sleights. However, whether you have practiced magic prior to this or not, when you pick up this gaff set, you will be performing the same effect in 3 minutes.\n\nCheck The Video:\nPLAY\n\nSuch an unexpected effect and its easy operation had made the Hopping Halves one of the most famous gaff effects in the world. \n\nHowever, its strength goes far beyond that.\n\nThe Hopping Half is a set that consists of multiple gaffs. if these were used separately, it also encompasses the functions of a variety of other gaffs: The Expanded Shell, original Sun and Moon coin, and 3CM.\n\nThe Expanded Shell in Artisan Coin Hopping Half set is the Artisan Coin Expanded Shell, which is a must-have for every coin worker.\nThe 3CM consists of two shells and one coin, allowing you to perform the vanishes and appearances of three coins. The 3CM included in the Hopping Half set has a double-sided coin, so it also includes a color-changing effect.\n\nThis is the Hopping Half. \n\nWith apparently only two coins, numerous routines are possible.\nA good set of props must not only have an ingenious design but also must have exquisite craftsmanship to be usable. \n\nThe Artisan Coin Hopping Half has undergone long-term experimentation and trial to ensure that the coin shells have a high degree of closeness, fit, and coverage.\n\nIf you want, you could toss and catch not only the USA coins but also the entire nested group of copper coins.\n\nThe Instructional video includes 7 routines that have been refined through countless actual performances: Hopping Half, CBH1, CBH2, Sun & Moon, Hanging Coppers, CS, Three Colors Fly.\n\nIt includes the presentation of two classical routines (the routine, Back in Time requires two additional regular coins), as well as very practical routines such as the Sun and Moon routine...\n\nWe believe that Artisan Coin Hopping Half will reap unexpected benefits.\nEven if you do not have an in-depth knowledge of coin magic, you would have heard of the Flipper Coins a bit.\n\nDuring the Spring Festival Gala of 2010, Lu Chen shocked the whole of China by performing Dean Dill\u2019s coins through table. And Eric Joes also use Oxy-Clean to fool Penn & Teller.\n\nBeing chosen to be performed by these top coin magicians is enough to prove its value.\n\nWhether it is penetrations or vanishes, The Flipper Coin can achieve these effects in a super-visual way. Whether it is penetrations or vanishes, The Flipper Coin can achieve these effects in a super-visual way.\n\nCertainly, the prerequisite of all this is for you to have a great quality Flipper Coin.\nAnd we think we made it.\nIn order to produce the most ideal Flipper Coin, we have mustered the best craftsmanship that was initially used only on high-end silver coins, and instilled them into the Artisan Coin Half-Dollar Flipper Coin, and chose what we believe to be the best structure.\n\nDue to the different workings and principles of The Flipper Coins, they are further segregated into gravity, magnetic, elastic, and Pro Elastic... Even many coin enthusiasts are unclear of the differences, let alone those that have never heard of them.\n\nWhat we have used is an internal groove and also re-milled the edges. The use of a shim allows for it to switch between gravity and magnetic mode. High-precision wire cutting produces gimmicks that are hard to decern even at close range. The shell and coin nests perfectly, almost no different from a regular coin.\n\nThis coin can be said to meet all of your flipper needs.\n\nCheck the Video:\nPLAY\n\nHigh-precision cut. Probably the most undetectable at present.\nInternal groove with re-milled edges. Almost identical to regular coins.\nProbably one of the easiest Flipper Coins to maintain.\nGravity and magnetic dual system.\nIn addition to the craftsmanship, we have also prepared an original and comprehensive instructional video.\n\nIt contains works that have never been published and teaches a total of 6 well-designed routines that have gone through countless actual performances: Coin Across, Coin Through Table, NOXF 1&2 (Need Ex-Shell), COXF, Coin Through Glass, Flipper Three Fly. \n[You will need 4 regular Kennedy half dollars to perform some of the routines in the instructional videos.]\n\nDetailed explanations will allow you to quickly master these routines.\n\nThe routines also include new handlings of opening and closing the gimmick, displays, and other convincers. Hence, if you want to build your own Flipper Coin routine, this tutorial will also give you all the techniques that you need.\nAnother \"Century-old Classic\"\uff1a\nDue to the development of machining technology, coin gaffs have gradually formed over the past hundred years. Those that can have remained till this day are all treasures of Magic. \n\nThe Artisan Coin series is committed to redefining these \"Century-old classics\" coin gaffs with modern technology and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Tri-fold Coin is undoubtedly an indispensable classic.\n\nReferring to its earliest record, in \"Modern Magic\" in 1876, Professor Hoffmann hid it in a magic wand and used it to conjure a coin. Since then, the Folding Coin was developed for more usage and has gradually become one of the more popular coin gaffs in the world.\nThe Choice of Masters\nThe signature usage of a folding Coin is well known to most, the \u201cCoin in Bottle\u201d and \u201cCoin Bite\u201d are seen frequently on TV and Street Magic specials.\n\nFamiliar masters, such as Michael Ammar and the late David Roth, also have their own routines using the Folding Coin.\n\nExpert Coin Magic records the coins across and coins through table effects by Roth using the Folding Coin. The World's Greatest Magic video teaching series has also released a magic compilation on Folding Coins.\n\nMeticulous Craftsmanship\nThe structure of the Folding Coin is very simple. However, there are two important details that affect the user\u2019s experience.\n\n*Precision cuts:\nAlthough regular cutting is not a problem for everyday performances, we still utilized a more precise cutting method. Hence, the cut marks on the coin are difficult to detect even at very close distances. The eagle on the Tail side of the coin can be observed up to a close distance of 30cm. The Head side can be observed at a close distance of 80cm or further for maximum safety.\n*Deeper side grooves:\nIf you have ever performed the coin through bottle effect using a Folding coin, you would encounter a common problem. That is, the folded-coin will sometimes fall apart. This minimizes it.\nArtisan Coin HD Folding Coin\nLet's go with the video first:\nPLAY\n\nPrecise cuts. Probably the most concealed tri-fold coin.\nThe side grooves are deepened to 2mm+ to increase stability.\nOnline instructional video includes basic handling, as well as new techniques, and coin through table routine.\nIn the instructional video of the Artisan Folding Coin, in addition to the classic effects of the coin in bottle and coin bite, Jay Wang will show you new techniques of using Folding Coins:\n\n- Double-sided display during coin bite.\n- Visual coin productions and vanishes.\n- A very visual three-phase coin through table effect, which makes the routine extremely thought-provoking.\n\nGo and enjoy : )\nLast of the Six works released in the Artisan Coin HD Series.\n\nThis is also the one with the most complex craftsmanship and the highest precision requirements among the six items.\nArtisan Coin HD CSB\nCSB is one of the cleverest inventions in coin gaffs. It is also one of the most powerful transposition effects in coin magic.\n\nNo matter how deep your knowledge is regarding coin tricks and coin gaffs, a good CSB routine will short-circuit your brain in an instant.\n\nEven if you open and laid out the secret in front of your eyes, you will surely be stunned by its simple structure, and then suddenly realize it and applaud in awe.\n\nThe CSB originated from the two copper coins and one silver coin transposition routine by Conrad Haden. Presley Guitar invented the CSB by replacing one of the copper coins with an ancient Chinese coin on top of the foundation of Conrad\u2019s routine. The hole in the middle of the Chinese coin gives the audience the impression that the coin is not replaced, so the whole effect is completely refined and elevated.\n\nIt is not a simple task to make the ancient Chinese coin look identical to a regular coin when nested. Therefore, the built-quality of the gaffed coin is the foundation for achieving such a powerful effect. And making the gaffed coin look as much as possible like a regular coin is the ultimate goal when crafting the CSB.\n\nThe usual process of most mass-produced CSB sets was to directly stick the Chinese coin on the silver coin shell after being thinned. Therefore, the edge of the coin would be composed of two parts, one is the edge of the silver coin, and the other is the edge of the copper coin. This is the same for the double-sided gaff coin. This process is a common practice and is easier to implement during mass production.\nHowever, For the Artisan Coin, this is far from satisfactory.\nFor the Artisan Coin CSB set, we adopted a process that was only used for high-end coin gaffs:\nNo layering on the edge of the coin. After more than half a year of experimentation, finally, the coin shell and double-sided coin can be been merged into one at the mass production stage.\nThe gap of the gaffed coin is completely fitted, making the surface of the gaffed coin no different from a regular coin.\nThe matching regular coin also has a very intricate design. In order to make the regular copper coin and the double-sided coin appear the same in size and appearance, we have specially made the copper coin a hair smaller.\nIn addition,  as always, in order to let you get started quickly and extract its full value, we have included 4 routines that have passed countless actual performances: CSB Routine, Hopping CSB1, Hopping CSB2, Three Colors Fly.\nThis includes content that has never been published. In addition to the visual transposition effects, it also includes interactive routines with the audience. In addition, the original handling methods will absolutely inspire you.\nCheck the video:\nPLAY\n\nNo gap between the double-sided coin and the shell.

The chance for you to design your own customizable game screen. Purchase the components you want to make the screen you need. Use it for your favorite game, or switch it up and use it with ALL of your favorite games. There's no limit to what you can do with the right tools!\nWith this Kickstarter you'll be able to buy a screen in one of two orientations in up to 9 colors. You'll be able to add inserts to it in different configurations depending on your needs. You'll be able to clip a binder of inserts to it if you want. You'll be able to add magnets to some panels, track character conditions, add initiative cards to the top of the screen, and SO MUCH MORE!\n\nThe Kickstarter\nAt Hammerdog Games we believe DMs and GMs should have the best tools at their fingertips. That's why, for over a decade, we've been producing and selling The World's Greatest Screen, a 4-panel, 8-pocket customizable game screen. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and every year we hear from customers who own multiple screens, and whose screens have lasted them for years.\nAs a result, it has not been easy for us to find a reason or even a way to improve the screen itself. It's sturdy, durable, reusable, and washable. It works with wet and dry erase markers. And our fans love it. It's a hard act to follow!\nSo with this Kickstarter we decided to give you the tools to trick it out. You can\nAdd inserts as needed for your game system, adventure, or individual encounter.\nAdd a Tome of Inserts that you can flip through in-game so that you have the exact tables that you want when you want them.\nAdd magnet receptive inserts so that magnets will stick to the screen. \nUse magnets to track initiative, status conditions, results you rolled on certain tables, and so on.\nAdd art packs to the outside of your screen to project your game, your personality, or both.\nMake the screen you've always wanted!\nWe just need a bit of help from you! We've set a super low monetary goal because all the hard work for this Kickstarter is done. We just need to know how many orders we have so we can get to shipping them!\nAs a result, we've turned this Kickstarter into a Blitzstarter. We are running a super short campaign with just a few stretch goals. We will begin to fulfill shortly after the Kickstarter begins, with the goal of delivering to all backers in the USA within 30 days of closure.\nThe World's Greatest Screen \nPLAY\n\n\n The World's Greatest Inserts \nPLAY\n\n\n Magnet Power\nPLAY\n\n\n Tricking Out Your Screen \nPLAY\n\n\n\n\nWith this Kickstarter we are introducing a whole new product for Hammerdog Games - The World's Greatest Inserts, short name, TWGi. These inserts are jam packed with information on one side, and a nice piece of art on the other. Fill the pockets of your screen with any combination of inserts, and change them mid-game if you like.\nThere are two kinds of inserts presented in this Kickstarter - Art Packs, and Fantasy RPG Inserts. Future Kickstarters will be launched for inserts that can be used with other games.\nArt Packs \nThese packs contain 4 double-sided full color inserts. There is high quality art covering both sides. Art packs are themed and can show standard RPG imagery - like fairies and dragons, or other imagery that reflects the personality of the screen's owner - like cats and dogs.\nArt Pack - Classic Characters (Contains 4 double-sided inserts)\nTWGi Set 1 - Fantasy Pack\nThe primary release for this Kickstarter is for our first fantasy series, 25 inserts that contain high quality fantasy art on one side, and themed random tables on the other. The themes and tables make them compatible with DnD 5e and Pathfinder 1e. However, they contain so much good information that they can be easily used with or adapted to other game systems.\nJust a Sample of All the Wonderful Tables and Charts Available to You\nYou can fill your screen with any combination of inserts, or store them all in the Tome of Inserts. You can clip the Tome to your screen, replacing or adding a panel to it by doing so. As you flip through the binder, that panel \"changes\" to be exactly what you need. You can of course, always use the Tome like a normal reference book.\nThe World's Greatest Inserts Set 1 - Fantasy Pack can be used to generate the bulk of an adventure, either before you begin play, or randomly during it. The inserts are designed to work together to fill the most common needs of GMs and DMs, whether they are running a premade adventure or a sandbox campaign. \nHere is a simple example of how you can combine these inserts to create an entire story quickly and easily. Note that the Owlbear insert is part of Stretch Goal 1, and is a sneak peek at a future product.\n\nLair of the Feather Bear\nIt's a cold and rainy night, and your players want to throw some dice. You agree even though you have nothing prepared. That's OK. They're not the greatest at staying on track anyways. So you grab your screen, your books, and your favorite inserts. You decide to put your friends up against an Owlbear, and decide that it would be fun if it was an arctic variant. You check your inserts and your options, and within minutes, have the backbone of an adventure ready to go.\n\n The adventure begins in a tavern. \nOn the cold steppes of a northern town.\n\n The tavern is filled with interesting characters, one of which has a quest. \n\nThe group leaves the tavern and travel south to the hills.\n\n Exploring the hills, they find a cave. \n\nThe cave is guarded by an Owlbear.\n\n Whose lair contains several valuable treasures. \nFantasy Pack 1: Table of Contents\nThe complete list of 25 inserts in this Fantasy Pack is as follows:\nDM Aids: Group Tracker\nRules: DnD 5e or Pathfinder 1e\nEnvironments: Arctic, Coastal, Desert, Forest, Grassland/Plains, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underground, Underwater, Urban\nLocations: Cave, Dungeon, Market, Ruins, Tavern, Huts, Homes, Hovels\nDiscovery: Food & Drink, [Mushrooms, Berries, Fruit], Treasures - Tier 1\nPeople: NPC (two parts)\n\n\nVirtual Tabletops\nTWGi Will Be FoundryVTT and Roll20\u00ae Compatible\nWith VTTs surging in popularity and many of us spending all of our RPG time online, it became an obvious choice to officially support them. We are proud to say that The World's Greatest Screen will be produced for Roll20\u00ae and FoundryVTT!\nThese modules will allow you to generate all results from an entire sheet in three clicks or one table at a time with the use of sleek macros and a comprehensible user experience. TWGi on virtual tabletops are very easy to use and understand, so they will always be viable tools for quick adventure generation as seen in the example above!\n\nAll of the items in this Kickstarter are available individually, or in bundles. Bundles tend to have more value than purchasing items individually.\n\nThe World's Greatest Screen - $25\nOur classic screen is the foundation of this project. Its sturdy construction ensures that it will last through years of use. It boasts 4 panels with 8 pockets that hold inserts up to 8.5\" x 11\" in size. It is available in 9 colors and 2 orientations. It works with wet and dry erase markers.\n\nOrientation\nTall/Portrait/Vertical\nAvailable in Silver, Gold, Black, Red, Pink, Blue, Green, Purple, and Orange\nOrientation\nWide/Landscape/Horizontal\nAvailable in Silver, Gold, Black, Red, Pink, Blue, Green, Purple, and Orange\nTWGi Fantasy Pack 1 - $20\nOur flagship product in this line boasts 25 inserts with a fantasy theme.

Want free stuff? Please help spread the word about this Kickstarter so we can unlock as many stretch goals as possible. \nART PACKS - Some stretch goals unlock art packs that can be purchased as add-ons. Each art pack contains 4 double-sided pages with a single theme, such as dragons, undead, and furry friends.\n\nENCOUNTER INSERTS - Some stretch goals unlock encounter inserts which are added to the Tome of Inserts for FREE. These special inserts offer a series of tables to use when encountering iconic monsters. These tables might create a unique lair for the creature, allow the GM to create a new version of it, or even control its behavior.\nFor example \"Encounter an Owlbear\" contains tables and information that allow you to\nGenerate the creature's lair and treasures within it. \nReward players that successfully harvest the creature's body. \nGenerate a new kind of owlbear such as a giant owlbear, a winged owlbear, or an alternate creature like a ravenbear.\nPit the group against a skeleton or zombie version of an owlbear.\nUse the \"Fighting\" table to keep players on their toes. Each roll makes the owlbear do something interesting in combat, keeping the fight exciting and fresh even for players who have been fighting owlbears for years!

Check the top of the Kickstarter for our FREE x-mas themed inserts you unlocked so far!\n\n\n\nAt Hammerdog Games we believe that DMs and GMs should have the best tools at their fingertips. Every product we make echoes our core design philosophies by being customizable, reusable, and affordable. We are extremely proud to bring this Kickstarter to you, as it is a shining example of our beliefs.\nWe had meant to bring this Kickstarter to you earlier this year, but like so many other businesses, we were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now as the year comes to a close, we hope this Kickstarter will add some much needed lifeblood to our company, so that we can make even cooler stuff for you in the future. \nHammerdog Games is a virtual company with no employees. We do however, have a couple of mutts that work very hard to bring solid products to customers just like you.\n\n\n\n\nCaring for The World's Greatest Screen\nThe  World\u2019s Greatest Screen was constructed to be durable, and sturdy, and to last for years. Still, it is not invulnerable. Here are some tips for keeping it usable for a long time to come.\nPRINT YOUR OWN INSERTS ON CARDSTOCK\nCardstock makes it easier to put inserts into pockets and to remove them again.\nAVOID EXCESSIVE HEAT\nThe World\u2019s Greatest Screen is a vinyl product. Excessive heat can make the pockets loose. It can also cause some toners and ink to stick to the inside of the pocket, which will mar its appearance.\nAVOID EXCESSIVE COLD\nBeing made of vinyl, The World\u2019s Greatest Screen can crack and split if it freezes.\nAVOID EXCESSIVE WEIGHT\nDon\u2019t store your screen at the bottom of a stack of books. The pressure can  cause some inks and toners to stick to the inside of the pockets.\nAVOID DARK MAGIC\nAlthough it is considered unwise to expose The World's Greatest Screen to magic of any variety, dark magic is especially hazardous. Not because it harms the screen, but because The World's Greatest Screen kind of likes it.\nWASH IT IF NEEDED\nIf your screen gets dirty, you can clean it with wet wipes or with a cool soap and water. Make sure you don\u2019t use anything that could scratch the screen.\nDO NOT FEED IT AFTER MIDNIGHT\nThe World\u2019s Greatest Screen is happy to pull an all-nighter any time. But if you feed it after midnight we can\u2019t be held responsible for what happens next.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done our best to mitigate the risks in this project. The World's Greatest Screen is already fully designed. The inserts are ready to be printed, we just need to know how many of which to print. We have some small concerns with the virtual tabletop inserts simply because they are time consuming and may take a bit longer to construct than hoped. And we have another small concern that if the Kickstarter blows up, we may be a bit slower to fulfill it than we'd hoped. But otherwise we believe we've done what we can to ensure that this Kickstarter runs very smoothly for you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe World's Greatest Screen is made of strong cardstock and virgin vinyl for years of use. We have had dozens of customers tell us that their screen has lasted them 10 years or more. The inserts will be usable as long as their RPGs are relevant which historically, has proven to be decades.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe #1 feature of The World's Greatest Screen is its reusability. Owners can utilize it in countless configurations and for any RPG in the world. The inserts are designed to be used over and over in endless game sessions, configuring and reconfiguring them to suit each particular game or session.

We wanted to create the ultimate deck for card workers. That's why we spared no expense, and printed on the legendary USPCC WEB PRESS, using a custom formulation of Premium-Casino Crushed Bee Stock, a traditional cut and an air-cushion finish. \nWHAT DOES USING THE BEST PRESS & CASINO CRUSHED BEE STOCK MEAN TO YOU? \nSimply put, there are no words to describe how well these cards handle. These cards shuffle like a dream. The CC Club Deck is light and airy, with a density that makes the cards rest comfortably\u2014but spring quickly into passes, palms and double-lifts. And for card workers, here's the best news of all: no matter that you put these cards through in training or performance, they snap back into shape time and time again.\nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n\n THE DESIGN: Backs, Faces, Aces & Joker  \nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n The Faces \nOur goal at all times was to great a distinctive deck that promotes  Powerful Card Magic above all else. With the exception of the Ace of Spades and Jokers, we chose to emphasize clarity and contrast. Classic faces ensure your audience can experience every moment of your magic in high definition\u2014like watching card magic in a 'lossless' format.\n The Backs\nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nFrom Aaron Fisher, on discovering the 1907 USPCC 808 Model II Back Design:\nRecently, Lee Asher showed Adam Grace and I a full collection of USPCC 808 back designs, We realized that apart from two or three designs, we'd never even seen most of them.  That made us feel like kids again\u2014and it was a GOOD feeling. \nWe had been looking for a distinctive, elegant design that would highlight great magic.  When we saw the rare 808 Model II Back Design from 1907, we knew in an instant we'd found 'the one'. We said, \"This is it. This design deserves to be SEEN. People who like cards will LOVE this design.  \n\n Note for Collectors: When the United States Playing Card Company was purchased by Cartamundi, the company stopped granting licenses for their classic artwork. Even so, the CC Club Deck was printed by USPCC with full permission to use USPCC back designs, the Ace of Spades, the Joker, and the Box for our CC Club Deck.\nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n THE JOKERS \nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nThis incredible image was first published by the United States Playing Card Company in 1894\u2014where it commemorated the playing card competition at the 1878 Worlds Fair Exhibition. This was a landmark event in the history of playing card history. \nThe image of the king riding the bicycle, and the book on which it appeared, has been the envy of antique card collectors everywhere. Best of all, the graphic has NEVER been used as an actual 'Joker' before now. \n ACE OF SPADES \nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nOur elegant Ace of Spades features a stalk of wheat and comes from a rare Whist design produced by USPCC in the 1920s. This timeless choice emphasizes the organic nature of living communities\u2014like the communities you find on Kickstarter and CC Club. \nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nPhoto by Paul Richardson\nSTRANGER JOKER & RED/BLUE DOUBLE BACKER:\nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nOur 2020 CC Club Deck was designed from the start with the exacting specifications of expert card magicians in mind.\nOpen a fresh deck and perform any one of 10+ miracles immediately Out of the Box \nThe Daily Cary Custom Configuration (Bottom) Red-Backed Joker with a Blue-Backed Matching Joker Beneath it. \nThe Daily Cary Custom Configuration (Top) Red-Backed Joker with a Red/Blue Double Backer above it, blue side down.   \nThis is the Daily Carry Custom Configuration, and as you'll see in the Out of the Box Experience Live Events\u2014it puts a world of miracles at your fingertips. \nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n SUPER SUBTLE ONE-WAY BACK DESIGN: \nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nYes, if you look close you can see this subtle feature built right into the back design.\nMagicians know why a very subtle one-way design will allow you to adapt the hundreds of effects that have been published on the one-way principle.

This is our first Kickstarter card project. However, we\u2019ve released many other magic-related projects before\u2014including premium Live Online Events\u2014and we have a solid reputation for delivering great results and customer service.\n\n2. We have a proven track record in regards to production, fulfillment, live online events\u2014and customer support issues in real-time.\n\n3. This project is proceeding on schedule. The most delicate part of the project (the deck itself) has already been completed.\n\n4. We have the experience, staff, and resources to go above and beyond for our backers.\n\n5. Finally, we foresee no issue that could prevent us from delivering this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur CC Club Deck is printed on the highest grade, most durable card stock available. 'Bee' card stock yields the longest-lasting playing cards available. We wanted cards that stay in good working order for much longer than other decks.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe United States Playing Card Company doesn't send waste to a landfill. The waste product of the card production process is shredded baled and recycled to become tissue or toilet paper.\nSustainable materials\nOut of the many kinds of playing cards on Kickstarter, the large majority are printed on thin paper stock. Central to the core mission of the CC Club Deck is the idea that the most durable, Casino Grade cards last the longest. That's why we pay a large premium to use the most durable card stock available.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe chose the United States Playing Card Company, in part because it's twice been recognized by the state of Kentucky for energy conservation and recycling efforts in an otherwise wasteful industry.\nSustainable Distribution\nYears ago, we made a decision to get rid of print and printed media for all our training materials. The CC Club Deck Project involves 15-20 hours of instruction, all of which will be created, stored, and delivered digitally. We do not print so much as a single DVD to deliver our products.\nSomething else\nConjuror Community has been engaged in sustainable meeting practices and green initiatives long before COVID. Our members recycle, not only in their personal lives, but we conscientiously share and recycle our magic materials as a matter of pride and a belief in sustainable meeting practices for the future. For 5 years, our online meetings have conserved every kind of energy, and we find that our online meetings are MORE satisfying than the magic meetings we used to pursue using planes, trains, and automobiles. This is a big reason for our success\u2014and how we've become the fastest growing magic company in the world.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "\ud83c\udf81 Aaron Fisher Card Magic Collection", "descp": "KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE COLLECTION--5+ Hours of Aaron's celebrated card magic and training.\n3 (or more) handpicked Aaron Fisher Workshops from the CC Club Vault\u2014Lifetime Access On-Demand, valued at over $50.

Magic should make people dream and we hope the quality of TCC PRESENTS products will be an exceptional aid for you to bring magic to this landscape.\nHope you enjoy it.\nWe are also looking forward to your attention and support.\nFollow us on Facebook or INS , or leave your email on our Official Website,  to be the first to know about our projects and its progress.\nTCC TEAM.\nHere it is, our second Special Stretch Goal for this project! Please refer to  Update #4 for full update.\nNO ADDITIONAL SHIPPING for these special Add-ons with your existing pledge.\nIf you only wish to back this items individually, we have also created a new reward tier.\n[Reminder: If you already backed this project. Please DO NOT select the individual reward. Or you will lose your current reward. You can add on to your current reward. The instructions see below.\nThis will be one of the best T-shirts that incorporates a magic effect you have ever seen.\nReally cool and very easy to do.\n'The Card Pickers'\nPLAY\n\nRemember the feeling you had when you first picked up your playing cards off the floor?\nWhen I first saw \u2018The Card Pickers\u2019, I recalled the above experience, which brought back awkward memories. Then, as I snapped back to the present, I came to appreciate the art of combining a classical oil painting with modern trends. I saw that the people who were picking up the ears of wheat in the painting were gathering the familiar-looking Bicycle Playing Cards. A perfect blend of history and fantasy.\nExcept its deep meaning. Believe me, this will be one of the best T-shirts that incorporates a magic effect you have ever seen(really cool and very easy to do).\nMost things done by a magician will somehow be tied to a magic effect. You could say that it is a tradition ingrained in us. A \u2018beginner's mind\u2019, if you will (i.e. having an attitude of openness when studying a subject just as a beginner in that subject would).\nThe basic effect that can be performed with \u2018The Card Pickers\u2019 is: A card selected and remembered by an audience member. You point to a face-down card in the painting on your t-shirt and tell the audience member that this is the card they are thinking of.\nYou then remove the card from the painting for the audience member to confirm that it is indeed they card they were thinking of. After that, you return the card back into the painting, face-up! The audience can then confirm that the card is indeed back in the painting.\nThe effect had a similar feel to the \u2018hamburger from signboard\" and \u2018Rubik\u2019s cube from shirt\u2019 effects. No difficult sleight of hand is required. It is clean, and the audience can examine it at the end.\nFurthermore, there is more than one face-up card in the painting. So, you can have more variety when performing your routine.\nWith the \u2018The Card Pickers\u2019 You will receive 112 stickers, which include 56 Seven of Clubs, 52 a full deck of 52 playing cards, and 4 \u2018The card you are thinking of\u2019\u2019 cards. Each sticker can be used at least twice, resulting in over 200 performances. Refills can be purchased separately.\nYou can still feel the ingenuity of the makers ingrained into the fabric, the hot stamping process, the sewing process, and even the packaging.\nTo summarize the materials used and workmanship:\n- 210g heavy cotton fabric.\n- Seamless barrel stitching. Pressure creased shoulders.\n- Thermosetting ink printing technology gives a sense of realism.\nWe offer 6 sizes, and the below is the information.\nIf you need the size to be bigger, please contact us.\nFor this special Kickstarter campaign, you just need to add-on HK$229 (US$ 28.90) to your existing pledge.\nOnce the campaign has ended on 24 September 2020, we will send a reward survey to you and you can tell us what you have added on, as well as the size and shipping address details.\n [Reminder: If you already backed this project.

[Reminder: If you already backed this project. Please DO NOT select this reward. Or you will lose your current reward. You can add on to your current reward. The instructions see Update #3]\nToday we want to show you the first one,  it's pure visual effects that break the boundary between reality and fantasy.\nWe call it 'The Moon' .\n'The Moon' by Kiyoshi Satoh\uff08\u4f50\u85e4\u559c\u7fa9\uff09\nWhen the boundary is not so clear, when you can't distinguish the reality from fantasy. Inside and outside the mirror, it's the same world.\nIf you can't tell, does it matter?\n\u2014\u2014 Westworld\nReality is fantasy. Fantasy is reality.\nThe legend that is Paul Harris and Tayari Casel published a set of lecture notes in 1979, and in it was fantastic coin routine called \u2018Twilight\u2019.  \nThis is the introduction\uff1a  \n\u300cTwilight is an unparalleled close-up discovery that transports an innocent half dollar into the twilight zone of its own mirrored reflection. While in this dimension the coin is visibly condensed, dematerialized, recreated, and reproduced-building to the spectacular \"Twilight\" finale in which the mirror's reflected images are instantly transformed into four genuine half dollars!  Twilight is a close-up masterpiece that destroys an audience's ability to distinguish between illusion and reality. It is unlike any coin effect you've ever seen, read or heard about. Twilight is as close to real magic as you'll ever get! \u300d  \nFewer and fewer people know of this lecture notes 40 years later. It has gradually become the treasure of a few select coin magic lovers. However, as long as you have seen it, you will surely agree with the high praise this routine has garnered.  \nIt seems to be as close to what real magic would look like.  \nDuring the past 40 years, Twilight has also evolved through many versions, and just a few months ago, we were fortunate to have encountered the version that is by far the cleanest and most poetic\u2014\u2019The Moon\u2019.     \nThe Japanese underground magician, Kiyoshi Satoh\uff08\u4f50\u85e4\u559c\u7fa9) is now well known amongst China\u2019s magic enthusiasts. We have just published his card magic book \u2018No Man Land\u2019 recently, so that our Chinese friends can appreciate the beauty of Mr. Satoh's packet tricks.  \u2018The Moon\u2019 is a lesser-known treasured routine of Mr. Satoh. It is a new interpretation of \u2018Twilight\u2019. Based on the original effect, Mr. Satoh changed the handling of the whole routine that even makes you totally unaware of the existence of any sleights, and have perfected the entire illusion.  \nA mirror, a coin, a fantasy journey.  \nThe mirror in the routine needs careful handwork that was described in the original lecture notes. To allow everyone use it immediately, we have already made this special mirror in advance and finished the edges to achieve the best feeling. \nWhen you are performing \u2019The Moon\u2019, you are not only performing this effect, but also the 40-year evolution history of \u2018Twilight\u2019. So, we made a high-grade soft leather bag for the mirror, which is easy to carry and adds a sense of ritual to the routine.  \nAn expanded shell and a soft performance surface will be used in the routine. Considering that most of people already have an expanded shell, we have decided NOT to include an expanded shell.  \nYou can learn this legendary effect right out of the box.      \nNo difficult sleights.  \nPure visual effects that break the boundary between reality and fantasy.\nDetailed online instruction.  \nEach gimmick mirror is handmade and fully polished. The surrounding edges are smooth and neat, which provides protection allows for smooth sleights.  \nIngenious gimmick design makes your magic more fantastic.  \nWith the included soft leather case, it is easy to carry, making the routine more ritual, and can fully protect the props and extend its service life.  \nWith the microfiber mirror cloth, you can clean the mirror anytime and anywhere.  \nContents: A special handmade gimmick mirror + cleaning cloth + soft leather carrying case. [Coins and Expanded Shell are NOT included]  \n'The Moon' will retail for HK$ 349 (US$ 45), but for this special Kickstarter campaign, you just need to add-on HK$229 (US$ 28.90) . [Reminder: If you already backed this project. Please DO NOT select this reward. Or you will lose your current reward. You can add on to your current reward. The instructions see Update #3]\nP/S: You will also need a soft performance surface for this routine. We recommend the leather close-up pads by TCC Presents.   \nAll the best & Stay Safe \nTCC TEAM\n\nToday we present to you three AMAZING magic products.\nThe first one is a levitation device.\nWe wanted to create a really good levitation system, that is easy for you to carry around.\nThat is why it took us three whole years on and off to complete the very first prototype. It took a further six months of constant refinement and research, and three changes in form factor, to make it more compact and more practical. The result is what we now call the Unseen Force.\nUnseen Force is essentially a levitation gimmick.  We believe the soul of this levitation gimmick lies is where it is \u201chidden\u201d, once the audience suspects the existence of a thread during the performance, the magical atmosphere is gone, no matter how good the performance is.\nWe think we have done it.\nWe are proud to present to you, Unseen Force: A brand new way of levitation.\nIt's 100% mechanical\u2026This means no battery is needed for fear of it dying on you.\nIf you want to move and levitate small objects seemingly by just the power of your mind.\nIf you want Possess the ability of telekinesis and perform amazing levitations, animations, and balance effects.\nUnseen Force is for you, all your need is only your presentation.\n Video Frist:\nPLAY\n\n\n Hook up system \nUnseen Force has a new concept and system we have been developing for the last sixth months, with this system you can do many powerful effects with borrowed objects (Playing Cards / Rings / Cigarettes / Bills...et)\nThe all-new unique hook-up system and position greatly minimize the possibility of the IT getting caught on other objects on your body.\nSet up is easy. Once it is set up, the gimmick stays inconspicuous, secure, and out of the way when not in use. Providing peace of mind as you are able to go about your day normally (except when undressing, for obvious reasons).\nNevertheless, you are ready to perform at any moment.\nThe position of the hook up allows you to obtain the gimmick in an easy manner and using a completely natural action. It is highly versatile and adaptable, allowing for flexibility when performing.\nClothing & Management\nPerforming with a jacket may not be practical in most situations, especially in summer, or in hot and humid environments.\nUnseen Force allows you to perform in a short-sleeved Polo T-shirt, even without a jacket.\nYou would be able to perform in the majority of conditions; whether strolling, close-up, parlor, or even on social occasions.\nIt takes up no pocket space, and it has no plastic clips that could break or come loose.\nOnce it is set up, the gimmick is highly concealed in addition to being secure, stable, and reliable.\nHand-built\nThe gimmick is easy to operate. And you do not need any batteries.\nEach one is hand-assembled, to ensure the highest quality.\nTutorial\nIt doesn't matter if you are a beginner or have no prior experience with thread work. Unseen Force comes with a 1 hour-long expertly-shot tutorial video that clearly explains the concepts and effects.\nWith some practice and familiarization, you will be performing miracles in no time.\nThree years of research and design. and six months of hard work and refinement of the routines, resulting in a brand new way of levitation.  \n A set of systems that provides an almost threadless feeling as well as a high degree of freedom.  \nThe unique winding method makes the movement more efficient, which means a movement of 1 cm of your hands can dispense 3-5 cm of IT.\nApart from being able to accomplish a wide range of classic IT effects, the main emphasis of Unseen Force is the robustness of its applications,.\nThinking outside the box, and breaking away from the traditional IT effects, as you can see from the promotional trailer. This is very cool.\nExtremely fast set-up\nAlthough it can be safely worn on your body at all times, if you don't want to wear it all day, you can easily set it up just 5 seconds before your performance\nMost IT workers like yourself would be the most concerned about the IT itself.\nThe default IT that comes with Unseen Force is one of the best in terms of strength among ITs of the same thickness. It allows you to easily accomplish the effects shown in the promotional video.\nHowever, if you prefer ITs of other brands, the tutorial includes instructions to replace the ITs.\nUnseen Force is totally different from other thread systems. \nThe all-new way to carry and hook-up not only allows you to accomplish most other IT effects but also new innovative effects unique to Unseen Force.\nA new concept, and new effects\nInfinite possibilities\nStable to carry & extremely concealed\nPerform in any conditions, anywhere\nExpansibility & easy to operate\nBrand new levitation effects\nSuperior quality & handmade\nDetailed video instructions.\nSponge Ball Magic is a modern classic that exists in most magician\u2019s repertoire.\nIf you have ever performed Sponge ball magic, you know that it never fails to bring joy and astonishment to audiences no matter young or old.\nMaybe you have been performing sponge ball magic the same classic way as everyone else.\nThere is no doubt that there are countless masters of sponge ball magic that have come before us.\nThis time, we want to show you something special with Sponge Balls.\nIt is 2 Products, the first is what we call Sponge System. They are brand new concepts and techniques for Sponge Balls.\nThe other, we call Pure Cup. It's a clear cup with Sponge Balls.\nVideo First,\nThis is the Sponge System:\nPLAY\n\nAnd this is Pure Cup:\nPLAY\n\nThis is the creativity of the TCC team, and this is the story from the Creator,  --- Wicky.\nThe following is written in his own words\uff1a\nAll the effects presented in the promotional trailer you see originated from competitions. I participated in magic competitions in various places.\nAt the time, playing cards and coins were all the rage. Almost 80% of the competitors used playing cards and coins as their main props. From then on, I pondered about what uncommon items that I could use as a theme to create my own competition act.\nAfter trying out many themes and not finding anything suitable, I continued pondering and searching.\nBy a coincidence, I performed a sponge heart routine to an audience member during one of my performances (This effect should be familiar to many magicians, and is one of the earlier magic effects that a beginner magician would have come in contact with. So much so that I almost forgot it).\nWhen the audience opened their hands and the two sponge hearts appeared in the hands of the audience member, I saw an exaggeratedly astonished expression on the audience member\u2019s face. I thought that that moment was real MAGIC!\nFrom that moment on, I began to wonder, would it be more creative to enter a competition with sponge ball magic?\nFrom that moment on, I officially formed an indissoluble bond with Sponge Balls.\nI started to focus on absorbing all the knowledge related to sponge ball magic that I could find. I watched every magic video relating to sponge ball magic.\nHowever, deep down I thought is that most of the performances were more or less the same, once you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. The techniques for sponge ball magic itself were not difficult and not many. I felt that I would do a different kind of sponge ball magic, hence I started to create my own sponge ball magic.\nI continued to explore and refine, from the most basic techniques to advanced techniques. Every move is the result of continuous polishing, practice, and actual performances. From the selection of sponge balls. (different sleights actually require sponge balls of different materials), to whether you will be standing or sitting during your final performance (when performing sponge balls at different heights, your posture when holding the sponge balls is actually completely different). I meticulously crafted every detail and strived to create good sponge ball magic.\nAs I continued to improve my sponge ball magic, I finally created a competition act with sponge balls as the theme. I am honored to have won several awards with this act when I was still a student. However, what makes me happier is that today, I finally made it into a tutorial video to share it with you here. (the techniques taught in the video are all extracted from my competition act, I hope you will like it)\nAs for Pure Cup, my performance of the Sponge System was already quite mature at the time, but I wondered if I needed to add more elements to it. Thus, I sent out to do so. I initially added a bowl, which was the commonly seen bowl and balls routine. Later, I felt that it was not good enough, and added cups. At first, there were three cups, but the routine as a whole looks too much like the classic cups and balls, the only difference was that I used a sponge ball. I then got rid of two cups, only one cup was used. Then, I wondered, what if the cup was transparent?\nWould it be more magical if the same effects can be achieved using a transparent cup? I could no longer restrain my brain, and I started to imagine various scenarios. It was not smooth flowing at first as I had nothing to refer to and only relied on my own trial and error. Initially, I did not know what type of cup was the most suitable, but I persevered. I tried different materials, created logical techniques, step by step, and finally completed this Pure Cup routine. As mentioned above, what makes me even happier is that this was also made into a tutorial video to be shared with you.\nP.S: It has been four years since I wrote the above article. Much of the details have been blurred in my memories. Originally, this should have been a work published four years ago, but it was only published today. There were various reasons. Perhaps I failed to convey the story behind this to you, nevertheless, you will see it again one day back in the field, and then, I will have a better story to tell you.\nThere are no gimmicks. \nEverything you see in the trailer is performed using pure sleight of hand. \nAll moves and techniques are modular and can be easily assimilated into your existing sponge routines.\nTCC Presents Sponge System\uff1a\nEight (8) techniques + one (1) bonus\nInnovative and visual moves\nPure sleight of hand, no gimmicks\nIncludes Two (2) Red and Two (2) Green Goshman Sponge balls\nAcrylic sponge ball case\n\nPure Cup by TCC Presents comes with an entirely translucent cup, made from resin.

I am very excited. And hope to be able to make something different that people have never seen before. I hope that this Playing card can catch people\u2019s eyes and can be a classic like Card College book. After a whole year of hard work. I think we made it happened.\nWhat I hope to create is not only a superb product, but also an aesthetical pleasure and a moment of great emotion when you see and touch it. This is what I want, what I pursue, and the reason why I am willing to invest all my passion and effort.\nThe extra cards in the deck\nLimited release, extremely rare, never reprinted.

We devote our efforts and passion to the product much more than you imagine. It's a revolutionary deck that was unseen before. It will definitely be worthy of being put in your collection list.\nThe card box dynamic structure\nThe walnut deluxe box sets\nThe black gold box set\nThe gilded edge playing card in the deluxe set\nThe Card College Playing Card using a revolutionary structure\nCard box design:\nLooking at what an important and influential work the Card College books have become, we thought that the design of card box should reflect precisely those qualities: elegant, classic, and friendly. When you get to hold this deck in your hands, you will definitely love it! Next, let\u2019s focus on the revolutionary structure of the card box\nThe demo of the opening and closing process ( Wine Red )\nThe card box structure:\nThis is a brand-new, unprecedented card box structure. It took us half a year from conception to production.  After dozens of experiments, we are proud to present you with the final version.\nAt the same time, we also think deeply about what kind of special card box structure can be considered as a fine card box structure? It needs to have the following two features\uff1aOrnamental & Enjoyment\n Ornamental:\nWe have designed the card box as a little mechanical masterpiece. When you open the card box, you will be shocked by the visual impact of this structure and experience a sheer thing of beauty. The entire process of opening the card box has a ceremonial feeling to it.\nThe demo of the opening and closing process ( Deep Green )\n Enjoyment:\nWe felt the box should not only be ornamental but also provide a unique moment of playfulness and joy.\nIn order to achieve our goal, we have done hundreds of experiments, repeatedly adjusted the mechanism of opening and closing. We have also tried out dozens of different papers and created numerous prototypes, the entire process having taken us over six months. Finally, we found the perfect solution: The folding part will rotate 180 degrees and pop up when the front of the box is lifted. The whole process is of great sophisticated elegance, and a lot of fun to operate\nBelieve us, when you get the real deck, you will love to open and close the card box over and over again. The process will be fun and enjoyable.\nThe demo of the opening and closing process ( Indigo )\nMade of 300 gsm high-end art paper board, colored with ancient methods\nAll sets contain 3 Color: Wine Red/Indigo Blue/Dark Green, low profile but luxurious\nHigh-Precision Copper Foil and Embossing. Elegant foil pattern on both sides.\nThe box uncut sheet contains 6 parts, all assembled by hand.\nThe inside full-page foil pattern of the card box\nThe elegant full-page foil pattern on the back\n (due to the entirely hand-made, some card boxes might not open smoothly at first, but will gradually become smooth after repeated opening and closing).\n\nThe Face & Back design:\nPrinted by USPCC.\nClassic Bicycle Stock.\nMetallic Color printing on both sides.\nSuch a classic magic book as Card College, We think it's exclusive playing card\u2018s face design should follow the classic poker face. We only redesigned the ACE and JOKER. In order to improve the luxurious touch of the deck, we used metallics color printing.\nThe back using metallic color printing\nThe back design\nThe JQK design\nThe Ace design\nThe Joker design\n\n\nAll the Walnut Box Sets and Black Gold Box Sets have been completely sold out and will not be available again. Much thanks for all the love and support!\n\nThe Walnut Deluxe Box Set\nExtremely rare, limited to 100 sets, Retail value  $300, KS price  $150\nThe playing cards are only sold in sets\nAs an extremely high-end and rare collection, we wanted the packaging to be as luxurious as possible. Black walnut was the perfect choice when it came to select the material for the storage case, as black walnut is considered the first choice for many luxury products. When you see and feel it, you will be stunned by its dazzling look and the luscious feel of the wood.\nAfter more than 20 proofs, endless optimization processes and after months of trial & error, we finally proudly present the definitive product:\nHandmade with black walnut solid wood.\nCovered with fine decorations printed with full-page metal ink.\nThe smoothly and silently running drawer is lined with fine flannelette for better protection of the decks.\nBeautiful polished copper handle. \n\nThe polishing copper handle\nThe full-page foil collection certification\nThe certification is sealed with an envelope.\nThe Demo of Gilded Edge\n The deluxe package includes:\nContains 3 color decks\uff1aWine Red / Indigo Blue / Deep Green ( with Gilded edge by USPCC ) \nLuxurious and elegant black walnut wooden box.\nFinely customized certification.\n Extremely rare:  limited to 100 sets, each set has the same code.\nSpecially customized label (Each deck in the set has a unique limited code on the seal from 001-100 ) \nThe Demo of The Certification in The Box\nSpecially customized label numbered from 1 to 100\nThe black gold box set - limited to 500\nExtremely rare, limited to 500 sets, Retail value  $120,  Kickstarter price  $60\nThe playing cards are only sold in sets.\nIn order to be different from the wooden box of the Deluxe Box Set, we decided to use a paper board to make a creative packaging box. In the process of design exploration, we are inspired by the auto sunroof of sports cars. The goal we want to achieve is designing an extremely cool structure suitable for the card box. Finally, we did it\uff01\nThe process of opening the package and taking out the deck feels so cool and special.\nThe inspiration comes from the auto sunroof of sports cars.\nThe demo of the black gold box set\nThe Upper GIF shows the box of the Black Gold Collection Set. The biggest challenge was to use only paper sheets to achieve this mechanical structure. In order to ensure the rigidity of the package and the smoothness of the opening and closing, we tried dozens of kinds of paper and finally made the ideal come true.\nMade of 500 gsm High-end matte black cardboard.\nThe box is entirely made of paper, six individual pieces, all assembled by hand.\nThe surface of the paper box is covered with a full-size foil pattern.\nThe foiled collection information on the front\nThe full view of the black gold box set\nAbout the black gold box set:\nContains 3 decks: Wine Red / Indigo Blue/ Deep Green.\nCool and elegant dynamic packaging. \nLimited to 500 sets, each set has the same code. \nSpecially customized label (Each deck in the set has a unique limited code on the seal from 001 - 500)\nSpecially customized label numbered from 1 to 500\nThe box set contains three decks: Wine red / Indigo / deep green\nThe Luxury Acrylic Set  (Limited to 500 sets)\nAll the Walnut Box Sets and Black Gold Box Sets were completely sold out in 78 minutes.\nThis will be The Last Chance to get the wine red / indigo blue / dark green Card College Playing Cards.\nThe acrylic surface has been treated with unique craft, high-end and luxurious.\nContains 3 Decks, each deck has a brand new red seal label\nLimited to 500 sets, each set is individually numbered.\n\nOnce these 500 sets of Acrylic sets sold out, there will be no more  wine red / indigo blue / dark green Card College Playing Cards.\n\nThe card college playing card regular edition\nWe also designed a regular version of Card College Playing Cards at an extremely affordable price, especially for Kickstarter: only $3.95 per deck.\n\u00b7 Printed by USPCC, on Bicycle Premium Stock.\n\u00b7 Classic & Clean Design, perfect for professional card magic and card playing.\n\u00b7 Slim white borders.\n\u00b7 The back design reflects the drawings in the Card College books.\n\u00b7 Two specially printed cards (double-backer red/red or blue/blue and red/blue)\n\u00b7 Standard USPCC face design and indices, special Ace of Spades and Joker.\n\u00b7 Matches trick cards from the standard Bicycle Trick Card Deck\n\u00b7 Two-color options: Red / Blue.\n\u00b7 Highest quality at a low price.\n\u00b7  Retail Price 7.95 USD   KS price 3.95 USD  Save 4 dollars! \nThe card college playing card regular edition - Red\nThe card college playing card regular edition - blue\nThe face design - 10 J Q K\nThe face design - Ace & Joker\nCard College Playing Cards are manufactured and marketed with the full approval and support of Roberto Giobbi\nRoberto Giobbi is the author of Card College, a five-volume work considered worldwide as the standard text on sleight-of-hand card magic.

Starting with this Kickstarter, and continuing with future campaigns, locations in this setting will be brought to life as richly detailed 3D printable models, and an accompanying pdf will feature information on each location as it is released, including designer notes and development history over the years. This Kickstarter will feature locations such as the village of Dragonshire, excursions into the depths of Shadowgrove, unholy shrines deep within Vallis Mortis, the wight infested barrows of Barrowdeep, and much more! \nDRAGONLOCK\u2122 is an interlocking terrain system that allows you to create fully modular, multi-level 28mm scale village terrain for your RPG or wargame on your home 3D printer. Each set is delivered in a downloadable .stl format via our online distribution partner DriveThruRPG.com, and once you have the set, you can print as many pieces as you like and never run out or need to purchase more. These terrain sets represent the culmination of over fifteen years of gaming terrain design experience.\n PLEASE NOTE:\n All models optimized for printing on FDM 3D printers and do not require slicer  supports.  \nA starter 3D printer begins around $220 (see F.A.Q.)\n Each pledge level includes all previous pledge levels (each individual level delivers per its stated delivery date.) \nEach set delivers as a downloadable .stl file via DrivethruRPG.\n The optional Add-On sets shown below can be added to any pledge level by adding the appropriate amount to your core pledge. When the campaign ends, you will get a survey where you will select which add on sets you pledged for. \nWe do not use an after-campaign pledge manager. All pledges must be in by the end of the campaign. \n\nAll models shown below were printed on Creality Ender 3 and Ender 5 3D-printers. \nPreview of the upcoming Baba Yaga reward which is an EXCLUSIVE for campaign backers!\nLED illuminated Dracolich stretch reward\n\nBonus 3D-printable airbrush stencils for the timber frame buildings included!\n\n\nVALLIS MORTIS is Tom Tullis' home campaign world that players have explored (sometimes even surviving!) for over thirty years. For the first time ever, behind-the-scenes info for this fantasy campaign setting is being made public. As Vallis Mortis terrain sets are released, information about those locations and inhabitants will be added to the Vallis Mortis information pdf. Future Vallis Mortis Kickstarters will grow the terrain offerings for this setting, and the setting pdf will grow as well, expanding with each new Kickstarter campaign. This pdf is a FREE offering available to all backers. \nVallis Mortis cover painting by legendary TSR D&D artist Jeff Easley!\nVallis Mortis\u2122 map \u00a9Thomas A.

EXAMPLE: To get the $99 dungeon bundle shown below, you would need to add $99 to the total amount of whatever pledge level you wish to receive.

One or two poorly selling sets could hurt our company severely. By putting potential projects up on Kickstarter, we can be sure if there is demand for that subject before devoting our resources to it. We also get to connect directly with our customers, rewarding those who are early supporters for a set with cool stuff like exclusive pieces not available to customers who purchase the set later on, and free stretch rewards. We have been in the print-and-play terrain business for over 15 years, having released more than 200 terrain sets, and have had ten previous Kickstarter campaigns successfully funded and delivered so supporters of this project can feel completely confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality product as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur clip system was specifically designed to put all stress and wear on the tiny clip itself, not the terrain piece, so the terrain models will last an incredibly long time after years of use with no degradation of the clip port that would result in loosening of the fit.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe PLA plastic the end user will utilize to create these models at home can be broken down in an industrial composter as it is a bioplastic made from plants.\nSustainable materials\nWe only recommend the use of renewable bioplastics in the 3D printing process like PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) which is made from corn or sugar cane plants (thus not using oil like other plastics) and is a renewable resource.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nSince our product is produced by the consumer at home on a 3D printer, there is no factory required for the creation of these models. This eliminates the extensive amount of fossil fuels normally utilized in the mass production of products like this such as steel mold creation (large carbon footprint in the manufacturing of the steel) and the oil used in the injection molding process, plus shipping of final product is eliminated as well saving fuel and eliminating the carbon emissions of both container ships and land-based shipping trucks.\nSustainable Distribution\nFulfillment is digital, thus eliminating all carbon footprints related to the trans-oceanic and over-land shipment associated with physical products.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "DRAGONSHIRE STREETS", "descp": "This pledge features 26 street and sidewalk tiles delivered as a downloadable .stl file.

In the past few years, magicians all over the world have made various changes to its effect, size, quantity and even name, and we have seen many versions of the four links. In any case, they all reflect the fundamental charm of Linking Rings.\nAs a Chinese professional magician, and a team that hopes to create value, we have also producedour own Close-up four ring set 2 years ago, to express our respect and tribute.\nMaybe you have seen this pictures before, For those who understand, it explains what is detail and persistence:\nAnd now, we have come up with 3 new stunning colors for you.\nThis is the promotional video we shot for our existing rings:\nPLAY\n\nWe are proud to introduce our New Close-up Linking Rings.\n Three brand new colors. Brand new look and feel. \n Four rings are included in each set. \nOuter diameter about 10.5cm (4 inches).\n Each individual ring weighs approximately 48.1g (1.7 ounces). \nThe mouth of key ring has been treated specially. Reduces pinching of the skin.\nA soft black carrying bag is included. (weighs approximately 11.5g)\nBasic instructions included.\n Enter a whole new realm of the Signed Card to Wallet. \nThe wallet has long been regarded as a daily tool for storage of currency. The wallet can be traced back to the Xia and Shang Dynasties in China at its earliest. No matter the country or region, basically everyone has one or more wallets that they prefer. The wallet has undergone thousands of years of changes in design and functionality throughout history. It has been integrated into our daily lives just like our food, clothing, housing and transportation.\nNevertheless, with the development of e-commerce, it seems that the trend of using a wallet is gradually decreasing. As currency becomes digitized, electronic payments can be made on mobile phones. This made the wallet appear less and less common. However, this does not mean that the wallet is obsolete. Rather, this has further drove the development, upgrade and evolution of the traditional wallet. The wallet is now gradually becoming an accessory, a symbol of style.\nIn the field of magic, wallet-based magic props are constantly being upgraded and innovated. From different sizes and colors, to the design and structure. Allowing the magic to be performed more directly or visually. Wallets or card holders are now more tastefully chosen, not only for function, but for design and aesthetics.\nAnd this is our wallet: TCC PRESENTS The Edge Wallet\nThe TCC Edge Wallet will open a whole new realm of the Card to Wallet for you.\nYou do not have to worry about the complicated design structure of the wallet inhibiting the magical workings.\nYou do not have to worry about the design of the wallet is suitable only for magic performances and cannot be used as an everyday wallet.\nYour wallet will look modern and fashionable.\nThe TCC Edge Wallet will let you re-experience the awe of performing the Card to Wallet. It will also get your creative juices flowing as you come up or adapt it with your own Card to Wallet routines.\nSee videos here:\nPLAY\n\n Dimensions: 132mm \u00d7 87mm \u00d7 13mm (\u00b1 2mm) [5.2 x 3.4 x 0.5 inches].\n Weight: 79g (\u00b1 5g) [2.8 ounces].\nColor: Black / Tan.\nConfiguration: One exquisite wallet, a card compartment with window, card compartment.\nIncluded: Five white envelopes and five red envelopes.The size is refined and concise.

Probably the best and the most cost-effective leather Chop Cup in the world.\n\nFirst, we want to present our promotional video.\\. This may the best Chop cup video you have ever witnessed. A balance of beauty and impact!\nThe video begins with a line from the movie <The Curious Case of Benjamin Button>.\n\u300cOur lives are defined by opportunities, even the ones we miss.\u300d\nYou maybe have been looking for a good leather cup or ball set for years. You also may have missed many opportunities to obtain a quality leather cup or ball set these years, The reason may be that the price is too high, or the quality is too poor, or some other reasons.\nHowever, it is precisely because you did NOT purchase those expensive and average quality Leather Chop Cup that led you here.\nSearch no further, as we have what we believe to be the best Leather Chop Cup on the market, at an unbelievable price.\nWe highly recommend that you click on the video below, you will not be disappointed:\nPLAY\n\nAs a classic and signature effect amongst all magic effects, the Cups and Balls routine has birthed many different versions and handlings throughout the history of Magic, but its core, method, and concept never changed.\nIt includes many types of magic effects in one routine----  Vanishes, Productions, Transpositions, even Transformations. The entire routine is presented on the desktop, thus it looks extremely elegant. To a certain extent, elegance should be an idiosyncrasy all magicians should adopt.\nMost professional magicians have their own version of the Cups and Balls routine and deeply believe that it is the path to becoming a true magician (Michael Ammar's Cups and Balls is genius). Each magician will try to add different seasonings to the routine to create his uniquely tasting dish.\nStudying the Cups and Balls routine can help you understand magic better as a whole.\nThe minimalist form of the Cups and Balls is a single Cup and Ball. And the sharpest weapon available in the single Cups and Ball armory is the Chop Cup (the inventor of the Chop Cup is Al Wheatley, here's a tribute).\nThe core point of the Chop Cup is that, it is very easy to get started. However, at the same time, it does not diminish the magic, rather, some believe it is even more magical - if you do not have much time to practice, it is a great choice.\nThat is why we are here today\u2014\u2014Enter the TCC leather Chop Cup.\nMaterials and textures\nThe TCC Leather Chop Cup is crafted from full-grain leather. The vegetable-tanned leather fully exhibits the retro-style. Each cup develops a unique texture after having been used for a period of time.\nWe have carefully selected the colors. Both the cup and the balls are all handmade. We strive to bring classical beauty with every detail.\nIt is worth mentioning that the balls are specially treated and are tested and matched one by one by the TCC production team.\nThe ideal weight, the perfect magnet, the best experience.\n And also brand new packaging texture. \n100 % handmade leather balls, also great for use with your Cups & Balls.\nOur Leather Chop Cup comes with two balls (1 normal with 1 gimmicked), We understand that many magicians would like to have their own set of leather balls to be used when performing cups and balls.\nSo for this Kickstarter we project, we introduce you to the Leather Balls.\nLike we did on the balls in leather chop cup, to ensure the best touch, each ball is handmade with the full-grain leather, and inspected layer by layer.\nDue to the intricate workmanship, strict quality standard and low output, we only have limited quantity available.\nFour leather balls set\uff083 normal and 1 gimmicked\uff09, can be used in cups and balls routine or as an additional ball to chop cup routine. Extraordinary and stylish. \nUses full-grain leather and sewn by hand\uff0cfit and neat.\nIt weighs about 15g and measures about 26mm (mm)\u22481inch (in)\nSimiliar with our Leather Balls Set.\n100 % Handmade Final Leather Load Ball. The perfect ending for Leather Chop Cup.\nIt comes with one 5.7cm (~2,25 inch) baseball and one flannel bag.  Exquisitely made, extraordinary and stylish.\n`\nWe offer basic instruction for all Leather Chop Cup, that's free and you can understand and learn Chop Cup quickly. \nIf you want to learn the routine in our promotional video, we also offer a reward for you at a cost of about $50(Including a set of Leather Chop Cup).\nWe also put tremendous effort and time into our video. There are many new moves which look pretty convincing and surprising. This is our new routine in combination with our amazing Chop Cup.\nWe love the routine. If you want to learn every detail of the routine in our video, this is for you.\nThis will only be on Kickstarter (no longer available after the funding), as we also do not want too many people to know the secrets inside. ^ ^\n Pledge for an Add-On all you need to do is: \n(1) Go to the project page and click on the \"Manage Pledge\" button;\n(2) Scroll down until you find the pledge that you have backed;\n(3) Add HK$*** to the amount that you have pledged, including postage and change the amount in the field to this new amount, making sure to erase the original amount first;\n(4) Click on the Next button, and continue as you did the first time you pledged.\nWe will send a reward survey to you and you can tell us what you add on and the color then we can ship to you.\nStarted in 2008 and was founded in 2011, TCC is one of China's most well-known and trusted magic companies.\n\n    Over the past decade, we have been insisting on selling genuine playing cards and magic products in China, we started a few difficulties in the year when pirates were rampant, but we have always believed that this is the right thing to do.\nToday, more and more Chinese enthusiasts respect and support copyright.\nIn 2016, we established a product development team, and the TCC PRESENTS brand was created to develop high-quality, cost-effective magic products and peripheral accessories.\nHere is our slogan: Extreme quality, extreme price.\n\n  From material selection, to the materials, to the production processes, TCC PRESENTS focuses on producing the world's best magic products and accessories. We strive to reduce costs as much as possible, while at the same time ensuring good enough quality. The price is always unbelievable.\n\n  In the past few years, in the Chinese market, all of our actions have been based on this value, and all our achievements have come from here. This is also what we see as the best reward for the trust of the users who support us.\n\nWe have always believed that the pursuit of one-time profits, the pursuit of the product itself experience more promising;\n\n    It's also our team's dream and we work very hard every day and want to make it happen.\n\n    Magic is our true passion and the driving force that brings us to perfection.\n\n    Now, we want to bring these positive effects to the world. \n  This our first magic project on Kickstarter.\n\n    Thanks to Kickstarter's crowd-funding features, we were able to be more demanding on the product itself and further lower the price.\n\nBy supporting our projects, you will be able to help us share the cost of mass production and make more and more enthusiasts feel the higher cost vs performance quality products that are made in China.\n\n    Looking forward to your support and sharing.\nChoose your rewards tier above, Ger your Leather Chop Cup today.\nClick the picture or here to know more about TCC.\nThis our first magic project on Kickstarter.

And this year's #zinequest is the perfect event to drive development and get this GM resource into your hands and campaigns:\n Done-For-You. Pre-built flexible short adventures you can run quickly and easily.\n Segue Adventures. Use the 5 Room Dungeons to organically transition between campaign milestones.\n Drop-In Adventures. Use a 5 Room dungeon when you need something fast because players should've made a left at Albuquerque.\n Raid For Parts. Sometimes you need ideas to help build out your epic plots. Steal the new monsters, magic items, locations, maps, and NPCs from your 5 Room Dungeon zine.\nWhat Are 5 Room Dungeons?\nEvery issue of the zine will contain a complete 5 Room Dungeon (get my free guide via that link) for you to use as standalone adventures, side quests, one-shots, or campaign linchpins.\nA 5 Room Dungeon is an efficient and fun adventure template that generates a complete adventure for a game session. It combines The Hero's Journey literary story structure with RPG game design best practices.\nDespite the name, 5 Room Dungeons can be used for roleplaying, combat, wilderness, city, and underground.\nFor example, there will be one pure NPC roleplay 5 Room Dungeon in the first six issues to demonstrate to you the awesomeness and flexibility of the 5 Room Dungeon format.\nThe Zine\nEvery 5 Room Dungeon Zine issue will contain brand new, custom content to surprise your players with.\nSaddle-stitched on good paper\nColor cover and black & white interior\nAbout 24 pages\nA custom map for GM and a player-friendly version\nA tricky new monster\nA detailed new magic item with lore\nAn exciting new adventuring location\nAt least one new NPC for roleplay\nIn addition, I'm developing each 5 Room Dungeon to have at least one unexpected hook or clever twist to drive interesting new gameplay with your friends.\nFinally, I'll be adding Designer Notes in each zine edition with tips, advice, and ideas on how to run that issue's 5 Room Dungeon for maximum game table impact. Getting into the designer's head goes a long way to helping you run great adventures.\nAbout #zinequest\nNow in its second year, and inspired by classic zines like Judges Guild and Alarums & Excursions, Kickstarter invites creators to launch their own RPG-inspired zines in February 2020.\nI'm taking this opportunity to launch a brand new premium zine that features an original 5 Room Dungeon each issue.\nI'm asking for backing on the project to pay for the zine's initial fixed costs for cover design and page layout, plus fund the first six issues' art and editing.\nThe final product for you will be six books (one per zine issue), approximately 24 pages each, with each issue focused on a brand new 5 Room Dungeon with custom designed game elements.\n5RDZ #1: The Sunken Tower of Angry Shadows\nIs this secret worth dying twice for?\nThe first issue of the 5 Room Dungeons Zine features an ancient tower with a dark secret in its cellar, below the foundation.\nBuilt to guard this secret, the tower seemed impregnable with its thick stone walls, cadre of skilled guards, and deadly defenses.\nBut stealthy assassins struck one dreadful night. Bloody battles and screams echoed throughout the tower until the killers dispatched the final guard.\nThe surviving murderers succumbed to the last wicked trap, however, and failed to penetrate the cellar's secret.\nBecause of this near miss, the Powers That Be decided to bury the tower and hide its existence. Rumours became legends, and legends faded to dust as 1,000 years passed.\nA recent flash flood has exposed the tower top to sunlight once again, offering up the secret to the first souls brave enough to plunder the dark, water-filled levels haunted by grim horrors and deadly traps.\nCan your players navigate the layered dangers of the Sunken Tower of Angry Shadows and discover its ancient mysteries?\nWhat's Inside 5 Room Dungeons Issue #1\nThe sunken tower offers you a unique adventure location. Each level is flooded with water.\nSmart players might figure out how to drain the tower on level three.\nMeantime, this is a fantastic opportunity for your group to master the swimming and underwater rules through fun gameplay.\nThis 5 Room Dungeon also contains layered threats. Characters must first face the dutiful spirits of assassinated guards bent on protecting the secret even after death.\nThen your players must deal with the murderous souls of slain assassins who still seek what's hidden beneath the cellar.\nDefeating these creatures will require teamwork and skill as the undead are well-suited to the close-quarter, inky dark halls, and flooded chambers of this dreadful place.\nLong-time readers of the Roleplaying Tips Newsletter for GMs will know I always like to offer players two paths.\nThe first path, Combat, is sure to challenge even experienced players. Battling incorporeal foes in small spaces while trying not to drown is no light task!\nThe second path, Roleplay, allows clever players to negotiate their way past guards and assassins if they can piece together the clues to understand what the tower dwellers want and would accept in exchange for letting the characters pass.\nAnd then there's the secret in the basement. What riches await those strong and clever enough to bypass the tower's deadly traps and defenses?\nPOD & PDF Supplied By DriveThuRPG\nBoth PDF and Print on Demand version of 5 Room Dungeons Zine will be fulfilled by DTRPG.\nIf you back a Print Tier, you will just pay for printing and shipping.\nHere are the estimated shipping costs.\nAnd estimated cost for a saddle stitched book is $3-$4.\nI will send you a DTRPG Coupon to redeem for the POD version when ready.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter.

But that was before Beazt slew the Children, and Abominous, his creator, broke the world. Scattered, the remaining Children struggled for survival, trying to tame a paradise that had turned against them.\nFor millennia they have been separated from one another by Sorogoros, the worldwyrm, which wraps it's huge serpentine coils around each continent on the planet. Controlling the sea and sky, the Sorogoros ensures that no fish, no fowl, no ship can cross from one \"coil\" to another. And so have the Children been trapped on their continental islands, the knowledge of their brethren fading with each passing day, their desire to travel the open sea long all but lost.\nBut things are changing.\nThe Children are thriving. They are restless. And they once again hear the calls of their ancestors from across the churning seas. Tales abound that the Sorogoros has by tamed. Ships are appearing in ports outside of the safe harbors and the inland seas. Their destination - new lands. Their guarantee - Adventure.\nAre you brave enough to board one today? Are you brave enough to discover what lies beyond the horizon? Are you brave enough to explore Denoa? \nBehold The Doorway To Adventure\nDenoa is a world built for storytelling. It contains a rich mythology and history that inform adventures without overwhelming them with detail. An official campaign story plays out in real time, with key events hosted at kitchen tables and game stores around the world. However, DMs and players can take things at their own pace, and choose to play the meta story, or use it's ideas to tell their own stories.\nBehold a world that feels like home. Whose paths and plains, forests and fields, cities and landscapes feel familiar. Like something you know, and understand, because you've been there before. \nBehold a world that feels fresh and new. Where familiar ideas and common tropes are upgraded, updated, and never stale. Where the familiar is just different enough to excite your senses, and invite you to explore it.\nBehold a world that is strange, and magical, and unlike any world you have seen before. A world where the unfamiliar and uncomfortable clash with the fantasy that you know. Where any - and every - fantasy idea has a place to grow. Where continents, cultures, monsters, and magic have evolved separately from each other. Where each location is amazing, wondrous, and completely unique.\nBehold a world made up of worlds, where all of your favorite settings come together - and clash. Imagine a green world, where humans, elves, and dwarves band together to fight a common foe. Imagine a savage world, where tan, magic-hating barbarians tread the land on sandalled feet. Imagine a frozen world, where snowbound creatures draw magic by singing to the northern lights. Imagine a fairy world where fey folk and talking animals are commonplace. Imagine a burning world, where hell has literally come to earth, and demons, devils, and insect races dominate the harsh landscape.\nBehold Denoa. The world where these worlds - and others - are on the edge of discovering each other.\nDenoa and it's official campaign will bring modern technology to bear in it's story telling. Through the use of in-store-only events, online surveys, and a dedicated app, we hope to gather your experiences and use them to shape our story. What you share with us could shape our official campaign, our next official event, or even a future product! \nUnofficially you can shape the world in any way you choose. We've even built it so that you can add your own world TO Denoa. So if you like worldbuilding, there's no need to abandon your work to play Denoa. Use one of the provided options to put Denoa into YOUR world, or YOUR world into Denoa, making the story you tell uniquely yours.\nDenoa is in every way a collaborative effort. Designed by Danny O'Neill, it will be created by some of the best talent and game companies in the industry (for a full list, see the bottom of this Kickstarter). And that design is guided by YOU and the actions you take during Organized Play events.\nOne of the key collaborators on the project is DGNFOG who will help us build all the maps for Denoa. Another is the community we hope to build around World Anvil and our Organize Play efforts. If you are a retailer, a designer, a writer, or interested in contributing to Denoa in ANY WAY, reach out to us through our social media. We might not have room for your particular talent or idea, but we'd love to include you any way we can. \n There are three major components to this project - the Book, the Denoa App, and the Organized Play. We have set a low goal in order to help with internet marketing algorithms. For the book to reach it's full potential, this Kickstarter will have to earn approximately $15,000. \nThe Denoa app has 3 Tiers. Tier 1, the Basic App is already funded. Tier 2, the Advanced App is our true goal. We will need this Kickstarter to fund between $25,000 and $30,000 for this app to be fully funded. \n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDenoa is a broken, magical world. In the time before time, it's continents were separated by a titanic sea serpent know as the Sorogoros. As a result, the ecology of each land evolved without the others. Each now sports it's own peoples, it's own cultures, it's own magic styles, it's own monsters. Your job is to uncover them all. But for now, things are secret, and information is purposefully made scarce.\nTo discover as much as you can about Denoa, head to World Anvil.\nColarwyn\nOur story starts in Colarwyn, a region which acts as a hub for this project and future ones. Colarwyn is one of 5 regions in the continent known as Ostarwyn.

An incredibly powerful and inspiring tool that will help you organise your notes and never lose a fact again! We are excited to work with World Anvil to present the Denoa world wiki! The small team behind World Anvil is constantly making their service better, and proved time and time again that they are some of the most passionate storytellers, artists and web developers out there. With World Anvil, take your creativity to the next step.  Throughout the campaign and beyond we will be updating our World Anvil world for Denoa with extra content you can explore at your own pace outside of game sessions. \nPartnering up with World Anvil makes us very proud creators and we encourage you to try the same! \n\nWe've saved the most boring for last! Denoa will be fulfilled via professional services TBD.\nPlease note that freight will be added to all pledges through the use of BackerKit which will launch immediately after the Kickstarter. We will add a freight estimate chart below as soon as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of this time, the risks to this project are minimal. The primary artwork for the book is already completed, and writing has begun. We're in a good place with how the capsules and OP work, and we'll be playtesting within a few weeks.\n\nThe largest challenge we have is making sure Denoa fulfills it's potential by fulling funding the app. The basic version will be enough to stay connected and play Denoa events, but the full version will allow for players to integrate their characters into the storyline with ease. That will allow a lot more players into the collective story we are telling. So although Denoa will survive with even the Basic app, the Full App is what we are truly shooting for. The goal for this is high - we need this Kickstarter to hit $40K to be able to get to this plateau. And that's why we consider this our largest challenge.\n\nThe next challenge we have is to get enough stores into our network hosting Denoa events. If your local game store hosts role-playing games, and if you think they are interested, please tell them about us! With their assistance we can tell a bigger and better story.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Danny O'Neill - Hammerdog Games\n5 created \u00b7 23 backed\nDanny has been organizing, creating, promoting, hosting, selling, and distributing games for over 30 years.

Jing has been preparing for your arrival for quite some time. First he built a temple to himself, a magical labyrinth, that he placed somewhere between space and time. Next he stole countless treasures from kings and men, gods and emperors - even the plants and animals. These he placed inside his temple so that any visitor could discover and take them. To challenge the bold, he surrounded those treasures with tricks, traps, and an array of deadly monsters. And finally he sent invitations to people everywhere, entreating them to visit his temple - and take whatever treasures they can carry. You are reading one of Jing's invitations right now. Do you accept it? Do you dare enter the Grande Temple of Jing?\nThe Grande Temple of Jing is a megadungeon designed in the spirit of old school RPG adventures - but with modern rules and sensibilities. It is no-holds-barred dungeoncrawl of truly epic proportions, where almost anything can be found. There are *65* themed dungeon levels - ranging from character level 1 to 20 - so there is something for every group and style of play. Some levels are heavy in combat and tactics, while some are filled with riddles, puzzles, or other challenges. Some levels are quick, others are huge sprawls that harken back to the dungeon days of old. Some levels are deadly serious, and some are almost frivolous. Best of all the levels are completely modular, meaning they can be torn apart and arranged any way you see fit. Plus, there are rules for adding your own content easily, and even for connecting the temple to your favorite 3rd party dungeons.\nThe *500* pages that make up the Grande Temple of Jing contain more dungeon goodness than you can shake a +1 stick at. Strange creatures, powerful weapons, and wondrous magic are just the start. Riddles, poems, quests, and campaigns make this more than just a megadungeon - it's also a sourcebook, a toolbox, and one heck of a paperweight. And with levels and fiction from celebrity contributors, there is sure to be something for EVERYONE within its fabled halls. \nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to update and reprint the Grande Temple of Jing to be compatible with 5th Edition. It will remain compatible with Pathfinder, and will work with Pathfinder 2.0. Also it will still be easy to modify for systems like 13th Age and all other versions of the world's most popular roleplaying game. Layout and design will be improved. Miniatures and electronic player-friendly maps will be produced to improve options for gameplay and immersion. \nFor this we are asking for $15,000 in pledges from our backers. This is the bare minimum needed to cover the layout and reprint of the book as well as the molds for some miniatures. Stretch goals will allow us to develop more miniatures and other rewards. \nFeatures include\n 500 pages of epic dungeon crawl adventures.\n 65 levels from tiny to huge. Each level is themed, with challenges keyed to that theme (adventure, comedy, horror, etc.). Levels include classic dungeon style, wilderness levels, and \"meta\" levels.\n Celebrity Contributors - Levels by RPG masters Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, Skip Williams, Ed Greenwood, Jim Ward, Chris Pramas, Stan!, Grimtooth, and Matt Mayhew. Fiction by Dave Gross and Kevin Andrew Murphy.\n Dozens of adventure hooks, stories and quests that allow you to experience the temple in whatever way the DM wishes - anything from a one-shot to an entire campaign. Internal quests that create motivations to explore even the most dangerous and strange parts of the temple.\n Amazing art, cool maps, and everything else you would expect - strange monsters, fantastic treasures, new spells, and so on.\n A toolbox approach to megadungeons that allows the DM to construct and present the temple in any way they desire. Rules are provided for DMs to add their own content and to shows ways to link to their favorite published adventures!\n Wonder on every page, around every corner, and behind every door. The kind of wonder that can only be brought to you by a trickster god.\nYour torch burns red against the darkness, illuminating the strange door in front of you. A thousand times you have passed this way - how did you not notice it before? Round doors are rare enough, but this one is painted gold, so shiny that you can see your reflection in the torchlight. Your torch flickers - and for a long moment it seems as if your reflection reaches towards you, beckoning you to come inside. You realize it's just a trick of the light but notice for the first time - the door is cracked open. You step closer to peer inside when a familiar voice calls out your name. \"Come on in! I've been waiting for you.\" Disarmed, you walk through the door and into pure darkness. The door closes behind you, and you are elsewhere. \nBehold the Grande Temple of Jing.  An adventure like no other. This megadungeon is the temple home of a  trickster god. And he\u2019s feeling very tricky indeed.\nCome on in! Try your hand at Jing\u2019s  deadly labyrinth. You are more than welcome to enter the temple,  explore its vast halls and twisted dungeons and take whatever loot you can carry.\nWho knows? You might even find your way out\u2026\nThe Grande Temple of Jing is the dungeon home of a trickster god. It is the ultimate deathtrap dungeon, capable of hosting anything a DM could possibly desire from the epic to the ludicrous. Jing is the archetypal trickster - the first of his kind - and he spent a millennium adventuring, pranking, and plundering at will. Everyone tried to stop him. They placed guards. They made locks. They devised traps. They created vaults. Nothing stopped him. Jing took anything he wanted, even stealing life itself from the gods of creation.\nEventually he tired of the game, as none could defeat him. And then he struck upon an amazing idea. A creatively wondrous idea. Yet a troublesome and deadly idea.\nHe flipped the script.\nIn short order Jing created his own palace - a temple dedicated to himself. He filled it with all the treasure he had stolen. And then he protected them with the same things he had seen on his journeys - guards, locks, traps, even vaults. He began to send out invitations, beseeching heroes and commoners alike to come to his temple and raid it. To this day anyone, who can find the temple is welcome to enter and plunder it's magical halls. To this day few manage to do so and escape.\nOver time Jing's temple and it's fabulous treasures passed from fact to legend. It became a story, then a set of tales that parents told to scare their children. To this day few believe they will ever find the temple - or return from it, if they do. Most knowledge of Jing and his amazing temple have been reduced to a poem - a canticle - that some children know by heart.\nNow that you know the Canticle of Jing, you are well prepared to enter the temple. Please prepare yourself accordingly and notify your next of kin. We are looking forward to your visit.\nSince the book is primarily a reprint, some rewards are already completed, and our stretch goals are somewhat limited. When stretch goals are hit, they will do any of the following: (1) Unlock one or more miniatures in one of the sets, increasing the value of that set, (2) add content to the DM Treasure Box for free or (3) improve the Deluxe Version of the book. \nTwo stretch goals are driven by the number of backers. If we get 100 backers, we'll add a free set of invitations to the DM Treasure Box. If we get 200, we'll add a free set of Bookmarks. Please help spread the word, so we can get as many backers as possible. Thank you so much!\n\nReward Chart\nEstimated Freight\nFreight will be added in Backerkit. These are estimates only, as add-ons can significantly alter the cost of freight. \n\nThere is so much to the Grande Temple of Jing, that it's hard to describe in a few paragraphs. For those of you who like to know more, we present several sections to allow you to dive as deep as you like. If there is anything you would like to see us add to this section, please don't hesitate to ask. \nThe Grande Temple of Jing features several celebrity contributors.

Sculptor of the GaryCon 2019 special convention figure, and more!\nFor players, The Grande Temple of Jing represents the ultimate dungeoncrawling experience. Magic permeates  the temple and being a trickster deity, Jing weaves it for his own  purposes and merriment. He is a major god and wields supreme power in his home. As a result, a room or area can contain virtually anything -  and often does.   \nDo your players like caves full of orcs, and classic dungeons filled with mythological monsters? The Grande Temple's got that. Do they like labyrinths set in sewers, forests, and maybe even a coral reef? The Grande Temple's got that too. Do they like adventures set in taverns, towns, and deep dark forests? Got it. Do they like gauntlets filled with traps, an entire level based on board games, or an arena where they can fight to the death? Check. Maybe they like dragons sitting on huge hoards of treasure, undead rising from their graves, and artifacts that fill them with awe. The Grande Temple's got that and more.  \nPlayers will be enthralled by the many wonders of the Grande Temple and challenged by its many clever tricks. Magical puzzles, devious riddles and wondrous magical effects will keep them entertained  for hours and allow them to experience the height of dungeoncrawling  fun.\nPerhaps the best example of Jing's trickery is the resurrection mechanic. You see, Jing draws great amusement from the trials of his guests. So much so, that if they entertain him\u2026 but die in the process\u2026 he will typically resurrect them so that they can continue. What does this mean to the average player? It means they can seek and find incredible treasures and artifacts - things, which they normally only see in their dreams. And if they die in the search - but amuse Jing in the process - he just might grant them a do-over.\nFor the DM, the grande temple represents the ultimate expression in dungeon design. Levels are modular, so DMs can pull them apart, rearrange them, and add their own content easily. They can even connect the temple to their favorite 3rd party dungeons!\nDespite its size, linked quests keep players moving along, so that the adventure is not just a series of endless rooms. The Grande Temple of Jing can be run as an epic dungeon campaign, as a group of themed dungeon levels, or even as a series of one shots. And since it's the home of a trickster god, the DM is freed up to run the game any way they choose - and even add content that would not be appropriate in any other dungeon.\nPerhaps most importantly, DMs are free to tweak the rules to suit the play style of their group. For example they can modify the dungeon to make it more or less deadly. If the resurrection mechanic is considered too broken, it can be ignored or altered. Also, the treasure level can be set to low, medium, or high. At the high level, the game can be run \"Monty Haul\" style, allowing groups to blow away rooms full of creatures with ease. At the low level it becomes a deadly grind, that will challenge even the most experienced players. \nAnd finally, the DM can set the mood of the game simply by choosing to play levels of a certain theme. Some levels are filled with beasts, others with undead. Some levels host villages and towns, and others are little more than a gauntlet filled with traps. Whatever the mood of the group and  the GM, there is a world of adventure waiting for them in the Grande Temple of Jing.\n The format of the book is another thing that sets it apart from the everyday megadungeon. We try hard to eliminate filler text and get right to the heart of a dungeon adventure. Detailed maps, concise writing, and informative icons allow us to pack a  lot of information into a small space, without losing the details you need to run the game. Many rooms have their own map near their description, so the DM can see important details at a glance, including scale, terrain, hidden objects and initial position of creatures. \nIn fact, The Grande Temple of Jing has been specifically designed, so that GMs can just pick a level and jump right into the game with little or no preparation. Maps are detailed appropriately. Sidebars, icons and minimaps help the GM jump right into the adventure with almost no preparation - and keep play going for hours and hours.\n Here is a detailed description of what you can find inside the book. Details are here for the first few sections. More will follow as the campaign gets underway.\nEntering the Grande Temple\nThe book opens with a 36 page Introduction that explains the temple, it's history, and it's key features. It also contains 8 pages of storylines, adventure hooks, quests, endgames, rumors, myths, legends and facts.\nThe Introduction Covers\nJing and the Temple\nThe Temple in a Nutshell \nCore Ideas and Philosophies\nHow to Use This Book\nTithe, Experience, and Gaining Levels\nTreasure\nArchitectural and Magical Features\nSpecial Rules Within the Temple\nMagic in the Temple\nJing's Favor\nThe Die of Fortune and Misfortune\nLife in the Temple\nIt's YOUR game\nIt also containes 8 pages of \n\nThe Entry Chamber\nOnce inside you will discover the META Levels which include the Central Chambers, These chambers form the infrastructure of the temple. Many players will find their journey starting in The Entry Chamber, where they may learn about Jing and his temple.\nThe Meta Levels\nThe Central Chambers are part of the Meta Levels, a number of areas that have no fixed spot in the temple. They can be placed literally anywhere the DM wishes. They often connect to the temple in various ways and there are often several doors in the temple that connect to the same Meta Level.  \nMeta levels include:\nThe Central Chambers (C) - The entrances and welcoming areas of the temple, as well as the Great Central Elevator, which moves between the 10 \"Grande Levels\" (clusters of levels) that make up the temple.\nThe Grande Jing Highway (H) - One of the main arteries by which temple residents move between it's levels and Grande Levels.\nTrials (T) - Short levels with a specific goal that must be completed to escape.\nGauntlets (G) - Short linear levels used as short cuts to move between \"Grande\" levels. The challenges of a gauntlet get more difficult with every room and players often have a short amount of time to complete them.\nArenas (A) - There are 3 arenas in the temple where players can fight to become Jing's Champion - and win their freedom from the temple.\nVaults (V) - These are special levels where Jing hides his favorite treasures. They are well guarded, and their doors cannot be opened unless the players collect the proper items to use as \"keys.\" \n\nGrande Level 1\nGrande Level 1 contains 7 levels (so far). It is dominated by two tribes that exist in a \"Balance of Power.\" The first tribe are the Lickspit Kobolds - the janitors of the temple. The other tribe are the Gnashteeth Orcs, cursed to grind their teeth by the Jing-tainted weapon that their leader wields. The players enter this level with the ability to sway the confrontation one way or the other.\nGrande Level 1 Includes\nC1: The Entry Chambers - A wondrous dungeon that teaches key concepts of the temple. \n1.1: Kobold Caverns - Caverns that host the temples most famous denizens.\n1.2: Halls of Deep Darkness - Halls of darkness where the undead await the unprepared\n1.3: Gnashteeth Orc Halls - A tactical assault against a horde of nasty orcs.\nG1: Green Gauntlet - A green themed gauntlet that leads deeper into the temple.\nH1: The Upper Road - An introductory journey down a strange section of road.\nT1: Trial of Copper - A copper themed dungeon and simple introduction to Trials.\n\nGrande Level 2\n\nGrande Level 3\n\nGrande Level 4\n\nGrande Level 5\n\nGrande Level 6\n\nGrande Level 7\n\nGrande Level 8\n\n\n\nGrande Level 9\n\nGrande Level 10", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Grande Temple of Jing was our first ever Kickstarter project. It had a handful of rewards that were not realized, primarily because a lack of interest in them made them uneconomical to produce. Project creep and bad luck caused delays on the book.\n\nFor this Kickstarter we've kept the number of rewards to a minimum so that we can ensure they are all produced. Since the project is a simple conversion of existing materials, there are no anticipated project creep or delays anticipated. Should any delays occur, we'll do our best to be open and honest about them.\n\nThe primary risk lies in print times for the book or miniatures taking longer than anticipated.

These miniatures are optimized for FDM-type 3D printers and do not require slicer-added supports to successfully print, as the sculpts are designed to self-support or in some cases have pre-designed supports built in. All of this means you can print highly detailed miniatures easily without having the hassles often associated with printing miniatures at home. Best of all, the miniatures in the photos you see are all printed on a $220 3D Printer (Creality Ender 3 available on Amazon HERE and from Creality) and a standard 28mm miniature only costs around 6-8 cents in plastic to print!  \nAll miniatures are delivered via DrivethruRPG as a downloadable .stl file, no physical minis are included.\nWe do not use an after-campaign pledge manager.

Those are the 3 differences in aware of between the two versions, and if you decide later on to buy these 3 upgrades, the MeanWell power supply is $45-$50USD, the magnetic build mat is about $18, and not having to worry about pieces of material falling into your control box (or just printing the fan cover and installing it) is more or less free, but nice. Also, the SD card insertion and removal is easier with the control box flipped on the Pro in my opinion, Bavaria on the regular version the slot for the SD card is nearly on the desk or table surface, where on the Pro, the slot is on the top edge.

Ten Pre-Generated Player Characters will also be included in an appendix. \nTaking inspirational cues from Sherlock Holmes, Ripper Street, Auguste Dupin, The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, and The Incendiary's Trail,the book takes a mature look at the horror of Mythos machinations and the many dark corners in the seat of empire. \nFunds for this Kickstarter will go towards commissioning more art and the hiring of more writers and creatives of quality to expand the book.

Names and occupations may also be co-opted for use in the scenarios, at the authors' discretion (let us know if you expressly don't want this and be forewarned that they may die horrible deaths or end up incurably insane). PDF copies of the Main Book and All Unlocked Stretch Goals are included. Physical Add-ons are allowed. This version of the book will not be available for purchase after the Kickstarter.  \n Initial Scenarios\nAll of the scenarios are written so that they may be played as standalone scenarios, but they were designed to be run together, as one cohesive campaign. They are:\n\"Living, Dead, and Yet to be Born\" - A couple of large steamer trunks belonging to the just-deceased Second Lieutenant Charles \u2018Charlie\u2019 Townsend arrive at 33 Golden Square for Captain \u2018Harry\u2019 Hudson. Markham, the Investigators\u2019 newly acquired Butler, directs the two labourers as to where to put the items, some of which already match the late Captain Hudson\u2019s decorating tastes. A month or two passes and then the first attempt against the Investigators\u2019 lives is made, by the Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum orderly who arranged for the H. J. Cave and Sons trunks to be shipped to 33 Golden Square. After his death, strange, poltergeist-like occurrences begin to happen at the maisonette. A short time later, a second deadly attack, this time by one of the labourers who moved everything in, is made against the Investigators. And things only escalate from there...\n\"Making a Lasting Peace\" - The second scenario, Investigators travel to the Ashanti Empire. Starting out in the coastal British Trading Forts, they'll discover that things from the past are best left buried. From there, they'll journey into the heart of the Ashanti Empire and seek out a city lost a millenia ago if they're to have any hope of a lasting peace.\n\"Orphans of Antiquity\" - The final scenario in the trilogy sees the resurgence of the cult with powerful new allies from within the government itself, and it threatens to topple the world-wide supremacy of the British Empire. Shifting alliances and a thin veneer of noble civility will leave Investigators increasingly on their own in a dangerous race to prevent the awakening of a Great Old One that threatens all of humanity.\nStretch Goal Scenarios\n UNLOCKED! \"The Colonel's Due\" - Adding tension to the events in \"Making a Lasting Peace\" military offices are turning up dead in the British coastal forts. Can diplomatic ties be restored if the murders are solved, regardless of who is responsible?\n LOCKED \"The Cost of Empire\" - Set in Ashanti 10 years after the events in \"Living, Dead, and Yet to be Born,\" this scenario brings the Investigators face-to-face with the consequences of their actions.\n UNLOCKED! \"The Devil's Castle\" - by Chad Bowser\nAdd-Ons\nTo purchase any add-ons, you must back at a Physical Reward Level or Higher (London Library Subscription+).

Grimtooth the Troll here. You sorry souls have been dying from my traps for decades. And in all that time, not one of you miniscule mortals has attacked me in my lair! Well, I\u2019ve decided to take pity on you. For the first time ever, I\u2019m going to show you my realm. You\u2019ll finally get to see \u2013 Trapsylvania!\nThis Kickstarter supports the publication of Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania, a 144-page campaign setting and sourcebook! It will be available in print (softcover or hardcover) and electronic (PDF) format. It is fully illustrated, with color cover and B/W interior art. The publisher is Goodman Games, under license from Flying Buffalo. The book is written in a systems-neutral style like all Grimtooth books, with DCC RPG stats compiled in an appendix at the back.\nGrimtooth's Lair\nThis Kickstarter also offers a rare collectible treasure: the \"lost 8th Grimtooth book.\" Flying Buffalo published a total of 7 Grimtooth books. At the Origins Game Convention in 1983, an independent publisher released their own unauthorized bootleg adventure called Grimtooth's Lair. Today, only a single copy of this adventure is known to exist. Thanks to collector Bill Meinhardt, we have been able to scan the adventure for publication. It is being offered as an add-on for this Kickstarter (see below).\nThe only known copy of Grimtooth's Lair - now available as a reprint exclusively through this Kickstarter!\nAt last \u2013 the legendary locations of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps revealed!\nFor over 30 years, Grimtooth\u2019s numerous Traps books have horrified players and inspired game masters with hundreds of dangerous devices, deadly deathtraps and hilarious hijinx! Now Grimtooth (with a little help from kid sister Grimtina) will take you on a personally guided tour of his realm and the central hub of his vast Traps empire.\nRun your own Grimtooth campaign, or pick and choose locations you can use in your own adventures. Explore Grimtooth\u2019s caverns, visit his Inner Sanctum, escape the Deathmaze Testing Center, attend Warthog\u2019s School for Trolls, take a ride on Grimtooth\u2019s Airship, tour Grimtina\u2019s Petting Zoo or get lost in many more gigantic places of doom, like the Infinite Corridor of Hallways. Each of these infamous locations includes maps, descriptions, non-player character details, scenarios, and lots of art. Plus there are more traps (of course) and plenty of things with which to endanger your characters.  \nLike all Grimtooth books, Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania is written in a systems-neutral format, and published in a way that it is fully compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG). A series of appendices at the back provide quick and easy stats for DCC RPG games, covering all the creatures, characters and items described in the book. It\u2019s very easy to fill a graveyard with the corpses of your DCC player characters! (Because once you enter Trapsylvania \u2013 you won\u2019t leave! Suckers.)  \nTrapsylvania is written and illustrated by S. S. Crompton, the legendary \u201cvoice of Grimtooth\u201d who has been working on Grimtooth products for Flying Buffalo for more than 30 years. We\u2019ve rounded up the entire roster of historical Grimtooth contributors to illustrate the book, so you\u2019ll find art not just by S. S. Crompton, but also by Liz Danforth, Micheal Von Glahn, Scott Jackson Phil Longmeier, and Jeff Dee \u2013 all the artists who have contributed to Grimtooth products over the years! The new traps are written by Grimtooth alumni S. S. Crompton, Ken St. Andre, Bear Peters, Rick Loomis, Paul O'Connor and Debora Kerr. The DCC stats are provided by Terry Olson, with editing by Jen Brinkman.\nTrapsylvania is chock full of useful gaming material! How much is there? Well, here's the exact count!\n1 whole country! (Grimtooth's, that is!)\n15 large locations, all described and mapped\n48 scenario ideas\n60 traps or trapped items\n86 creatures (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n26 NPCs (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n23 items (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\nAnd loads of laughs!\nWhat is Grimtooth\u2019s Traps?\nOriginally published by Flying Buffalo, Grimtooth\u2019s Traps is one of the most popular RPG accessories ever produced, with more than 250,000 copies in print since 1981. Flying Buffalo published seven Grimtooth\u2019s books, all of them usable with any RPG. In 2015, Goodman Games compiled all of these into a massive hardcover compilation, and also published two additional DCC-compatible Grimtooth adventures. Grimtooth remains an eternally relevant character and his popularity has only grown since then.\nThe hallmarks of Grimtooth-style traps are wacky humor combined with deadly danger, plus, of course, extremely useful material that can be integrated into any dungeon-crawling RPG!\nWhat\u2019s in the book?\nEverything you need to run a game in Trapsylvania! Whether a single session or an extended campaign, you can give your players a fun time. Here is a preview of the Table of Contents:\nWhat's the Status of the Book?\nTrapsylvania is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. We are in final proofreading stages at the time of the Kickstarter. It will be ready to go to the printer shortly after this Kickstarter ends.\nPledge Levels and Shipping\nThe basic pledge levels are for a PDF, softcover, or hardcover edition of the 144-page Trapsylvania. \nWe are also offering a leather-bound edition. We have 50 copies that will also include a piece of original art by Steve Crompton. The remainder do not include that original art.\nShipping costs are as follows. International shipping is via Priority Mail International. The good news is this means international packages will arrive very quickly, but due to recent rate changes these charges unfortunately must be more more than we have charged in the past.\nUSA: softcover $6.00, hardcover $7.00, both books $8.00. \nCanada: softcover $15.00, hardcover $20.00, both books $25.00.\nUK and EU: softcover $20.00, hardcover $25.00, both books $30.00.\nAustralia and rest of world: softcover $25.00, hardcover $30.00, both books $35.00.\nIf you add on items, please use the \"both books\" shipping - i.e. add +$5 for additional shipping cost. The additional $5 is a flat fee whether you add one book or many.\nStretch Goals\nThe last time Grimtooth ran a Kickstarter, it took off like wildfire. (I love fire!! \u2013 Grimtooth) This time around, we want to keep the Kickstarter simple and easy to fulfill. But we\u2019re still adding a couple stretch goals in case you humans want to throw even more gold at Grimtooth!\nAt $20,000, the books will have fancy printed endsheets! CLEARED!\nAt $40,000, we will include a poster map of Trapsylvania! CLEARED!\nAt $45,000, we will include a new Grimtooth mini-comic by Steve Crompton! CLEARED!\nAt $50,000 we will include cards featuring NPC portraits and stats! CLEARED!\nAnd above that, we have other ideas. Grimtooth said he wants a sticker with his face on it, and a poster map of his airship, plus scenic postcards that can double as player handouts, an art print, and more!\nAdd-On Items\nGoodman Games has published many RPG products, including quite a few that are perfect additions to this project! You can add on additional funds to include these items. All add-on items count toward achieving stretch goals, and those published by Goodman Games are in print+PDF format!\nTo add on an item, simply increase your pledge amount to cover the cost. After the Kickstarter we will send out a survey where you can specify what the \u201cdollars\u201d are for. The add-on items for this Kickstarter include the following:\nAdd On Another Copy of Trapsylvania: You can add on another softcover (+$25) or hardcover edition (+$40) by simply adding on the cost of that pledge level. \nGrimtooth's Lair ($10): This is the legendary \"lost 8th Grimtooth book.\" It contains a tournament adventure centered around Grimtooth-style traps, originally released at Origins 1983. The adventure is systems-neutral and designed to be played with any fantasy RPG. Goodman Games has arranged access to the last known copy in existence, and we have scanned and digitally restored it for exclusive publication via this Kickstarter. The original format was a digest-sized, 12-page publication.\nGrimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps Collection, softcover format ($40.00): A 460-page tome collecting all five of the original Grimtooth\u2019s Traps books! More than 500 traps in a systems-neutral format, suitable for any fantasy RPG.

There are no refunds for this tour!\nGrimtooth\u2019s Tomb of the Warhammer ($10.00): A level 4 Grimtooth adventure compatible with DCC RPG. Written by Tunnels & Trolls creator Ken St. Andre. Can you go where no troll dares to tread? Long ago, the elves killed Grimtooth\u2019s father in a great battle. They hid the troll leader\u2019s body and his mystic warhammer somewhere in the vast plains beyond Trapsylvania. After years of searching, Grimtooth has finally located his father\u2019s tomb, but the elves have magically rigged it so that no troll can enter. Now Grimtooth is looking for a party of foolhardy adventurers to enter Grimfang\u2019s Tomb and return with the legendary warhammer\u2026 \nDungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game: The core rulebook for the most popular old-school RPG on the market today!

These maps are being created on a twice-weekly basis throughout the creation phase of the project (April 2018 - March 2019).\nEach map will be provided to those who pledge $20 (or more) in digital format (JPG) for integration into any tabletop RPG with alternate virtual tabletop (VTT) versions provided simultaneously with each map release.\nMost maps will be geared towards a futuristic setting, though a few will likely have potential of crossing genres. The focus of this collection will be various science fiction locales such as space stations, planetary outposts, asteroid mining colonies, futuristic cities, science labs, spaceship deck plans, alien locations, and interplanetary waypoints, but will also include offerings for subgenres such as cyberpunk, science fantasy, and neo-noir.\nThere are several rewards available with content to be delivered to backers at every pledge level!\nTry it out! Click Here for a free download of Starship Builder Kit #1!\nNote: Due to backer request, the add-on options from the Volume 1 kickstarter are available for the original add-on price ($7 each). If you want either, just increase your pledge to cover them.\nHow do I increase my pledge for add-ons?\nIncreasing your pledge is easy. All you have to do is click on the \"Manage your pledge\" button located at the top of this page. Then click on the \"Change your pledge\" button on the bottom of the next page. There you will be able to change your \"Pledge Amount\" and then click on the \"Continue\" button to confirm.\nCheck back during the Kickstarter campaign as additional sample maps will be released every week!\nStart benefiting from your pledge almost immediately! Rather than waiting until the entire project is completed to release content, all of the maps created for this collection will be released to backers who pledge $20 (or more) on a continuing basis via a planned schedule of two maps per week throughout the project creation phase.\nThe first of the maps will be provided to applicable backers tarting the day after the campaign funds are collected (usually about two weeks after the Kickstarter ends). Future map releases will continue with a minimum of twice-weekly updates throughout the creation phase until all the maps for the collection are completed.\nBackers who pledge $20 (or more) will be provided with an URL and unique login information to a special website they can visit to access and download the most recently released maps and all previously released maps for this project.\nScreenshot of the Digtial Distribution Tool (DDT) website.\nA finished book including all of the non-VTT \"Gamemaster\" and \"Player\" versions of the maps will be provided as an indexed PDF to all backers who pledge at the $10 (or higher) pledge levels. The estimated PDF release date is around April 2019.\nBackers at the $20 (or higher) pledge levels will also have the option to buy either hardcover or softcover print copies of the book at the price of production cost + shipping cost when the print version is released to the general public later in 2019. The estimated print release date is planned to be around April-June 2019. More info on pricing for print copies will be provided nearer to the project completion.\nShipping Costs for Print Book Purchases:\nThe print versions will be distributed as print-on-demand via DriveThruRPG.com. Domestic and international shipping charges will be handled on their end with purchase of any print copy of the book.\nVolume 1: Fantasy Adventure was released in hardcover print last week. The following video is a 2-minute flip-thru of the book. We are trending steadily towards Volume 2: Science Fiction being just as huge!\nPLAY\n\nEvery digital map in Volume 2 is created at 600 dpi resolution.\nAll of the digital maps scale up as crisp-and-clear print at poster size. This includes printing at the 1-inch scale popular for use with tabletop miniatures.\nThis project is not producing any physical poster map prints.\nCheck out the demo video below from the Volume 1 Kickstarter to see a sample map printed on premium glossy laminated paper.\nPLAY\n\nFor more information on the poster-print quality digital maps, check out this update from the Volume 1 Kickstarter that explains it in more detail.\nWho is Justin Andrew Mason? I am a professional tabletop role-playing game designer, ENnie Award-winning author (Adventureaweek.com Blog 2014), graphic designer, and professional cartographer (AAW MapMaster 2014 winner).\nI am also the creator and cartographer of the first volume of this series, The Big Book of Maps for Tabletop Roleplaying Games - Volume 1: Fantasy Adventure.\nThat Kickstarter funded with over 1,000 backers raising $24K, and (with unlocked stretch goals) produced 230+ maps, 650+ map icons. It was completed more two months early and fulfilled to all backers months ahead of schedule.\nWatch this project's intro video at the top of the page for a slideshow with several hundred examples of my cartography.\nMy various works have been published and commissioned by multiple game publishers and game-related companies including AAW Games (Into the Wintery Gale, Rise of the Drow, Snow White, Aventyr Bestiary, Underworld Races & Classes, and the Mini-Dungeon Tome), AetherCon Online Gaming Convention, EN Publishing (EN5ider; Friend of the Children, The Mystery of Mordecai's Monster, and Dia de los Dinosaurios Muertos), Dark Naga Adventures (Confronting Hastur, The City of Talos), Kobold Press (Southlands, Advanced Races Compendium, Tome of Beasts, Book of Lairs, Demon Cults, Midgard Campaign Setting, New Paths Compendium, and Creature Codex Kickstarters), Legendary Games (Hypercorps 2099), Mythoard (Adventure Hook Cards), Playground Adventures (After School Adventures), Rogue Genius Games (Veranthea Codex), and TPK Games.\nI maintain a professional blog, Paths to Adventure, where anyone may keep track of my current projects, finished commissions, the latest releases of my work, and several free RPG-related web apps and generators I've developed (like the Tavern Sign Crafter). I even do a bit of self publishing through the platform as well.\nWhat is the difference between VTT and non-VTT maps?\nBackers at the $20 level (or higher) level will be provided digital access to both a VTT (Virtual Tabletop) and a non-VTT versions of every map produced for this project via the weekly releases via the Digital Distribution Tool website.\nA VTT map contains no scaling grid, room numbers, icons, or hidden room contents (such as secret compartments). A non-VTT map includes  these features. The final PDF and printed book will include only the non-VTT maps.\nThe purpose of the VTT version of every map is provide a convenient import to Virtual Tabletop software platforms. In addition to access to the twice-weekly released downloads, at the end of the creation phase of the project all backers at the $20 (or higher) level will be provided a link to download a package (ZIP) containing both versions of every map in digital (JPG) format.\nThere are two non-VTT versions available of every map in this project. The \"GM\" version which includes numbers and labels. And the \"Player\" version which does not include numbers or labels. All downloadable sample maps on this page have been updated to include all three versions of the digital map for reference.\nNot interested in science fiction maps? There\u2019s still something for you here! As an incentive for folks who may not need science fiction maps for their games, I am adding in a THIRD BOOK full of all-new fantasy maps as a reward for reaching a special funding goal.\nWhen this new Kickstarter meets or exceeds the funding met for the previous Kickstarter project ($23,562 US), I will create a third book in the Big Book of Maps series that focuses on fantasy-themed \"Mini-Dungeon\u201d maps.\nWhen unlocked, this extra book will begin production immediately after the science fiction maps for Volume 2 are completed and released to backers.\nThis third collection of maps will be provided as a indexed PDF and released to all backers of this Kickstarter. Backers who pledge $20 (or more) will also get the high-resolution digital files and  VTT maps for the Mini-Dungeons, and a voucher to buy the print copy of the third book at production cost + shipping cost.\nExamples of Mini-Dungeon cartography I've crafted for other publishers.\nWhen unlocked, the third book will include over 100 fantasy mini-dungeon maps.\nWhereas Volume 1 - Fantasy Adventure focused on massive maps that sometimes included as many as 70-100 rooms, this bonus book will focus on dungeon maps consisting of around 15-25 rooms each (great for those one shots, or smaller locales). It\u2019s the perfect fantasy map companion to the first Big Book of Maps!\nNote: If this special funding goal is unlocked, the Mini-Dungeon book is considered a bonus. It's completion is not tied to the estimated timeline for delivery of Volume 2. It will likely take several months after this Kickstarter has been completed and delivered to backers before the bonus book becomes available.\nLicensing Note: The Stock Cartography license provided by the $295 pledge level of this Kickstarter does not extend to the 100+ Mini-Dungeon maps. If you have backed at this level, and would like to extend your license to cover the 100 extra bonus maps when it is unlocked, please increase your pledge by $50.\nEvery week a new Featured Addition will be added to the project. These additions are bonus material, and just my way of saying, \"Thank your for all the support!\" Be sure to check back every Friday during the kickstarter to see what new goodies have been added!\nThe Week #1 Feature Edition is Planet Portfolio 1 and Planet Portfolio 2! Originally created as a print-and-play tabletop solution, Planet Portfolio has now been updated with full VTT support! Every asset of the book has also been provided as a 300 dpi PNG image with transparent backgrounds. You can download it here for free right now!\nPlanet Portfolio 2 is being created as a bonus for this kickstarter project, and will also be added for free download when it is completed. Estimated delivery is 1-2 weeks after funds clear for this project.\nCombined, the Planet Portfolios provide over 100 VTT assets for your spacefaring adventures including: stars, rocky planets, terra-like planets, gas giants, moons, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, and more!\nThe Week #1 Feature Edition is Starship Deckplan Maps! A series of 20 detailed starship deckpans has been added to the collection. Like all other maps, these will include GM, Player, and VTT versions.\nAlso, for each stretch goal bonus map or mini-funding goal bonus map added to the campaign an additional starship deckplan map will be added as well!\nThe Week #3 Featured Addition heralds the arrival of an all new Add-on option! The Starship Builder Kits. Want to try it out? Click here to download it right now. If you want the rest of the kits, you can get them as an add-on by increasing your pledge by $25.\nEach kit includes 20 ship sections that allow you to easily create your own customized starship deckplan!\nThere are 5 core kits, and for every $5k this kickstarter funds, another 5 sets will be added. That means right now there are 25 kits (500 starship sections) with more to be added to the add-on as funding continues to increase!\nDesigned to allow you to utilize various stylized starship sections to compile your very own custom starship deckplan. Each kits is designed to allow you to mix-and-match any of the sections included with sections included in other sets in the series.\nStretch Goals: For every 50 backers that pledge to this Kickstarter campaign, one full-page, full-color bonus map will be added to the collection. This even includes the $1 backer level count, so get your friends to back for a buck and get more maps into Volume 2 of the Big Book of Maps!\nThese bonus maps will be included in the final book and will be released via the backer-only website on a staggered schedule as time permits.\nPlease Note: Should this project result in a very large number of backers, the process of creating the bonus maps could delay the final release of the PDF and Print versions of the book. However, there will be no delay in the twice-weekly release schedule of digital maps to applicable backers.\nIn addition to the bonus map stretch goals based on the number of backers, an additional series of stretch goals based on overall amount pledged to the project can be unlocked.\nStretch Goals ($1k - $14k): When the project is funded, and for every $500 pledged beyond the project's $1,000 funding goal up to $14k, a series of 10 all-new map icons will be unlocked for backers.\nSuper Stretch Goals ($15k +): When the project reaches $15k funding, and for every additional $1,000 pledged beyond that, an additional map icon is added to every previously unlocked map icon set. That's 27 new map icons for every super stretch goal unlocked!\nBonus Stretch Goals: There will periodically be threshold-based bonus stretch goals that are in addition to the planned recurring stretch goals. This include special bonuses that are unlocked at the $5k, $10k, $15 and $20 funding levels.\nThe icons will be released in themed packs as they are created, and made available to all backers via \"backers only\" updates here on Kickstarter as well as the Digital Distribution Tool.\nAll of these unlocked map icons will even be available to $1 backers -- so everyone who shows support for the project walks away with something worthwhile!\nMap icons are the various elements that can be placed onto a dungeon map via a virtual tabletop (VTT) platform or graphic editing software. This includes objects such as doors, treasure chests, furniture, traps, treasure, etc.\nFor the purpose of this project these map icons will be provided as PNG graphic files with transparent backgrounds (to allow easy import and placement via VTT software).\nExample of how map icons will be released in sets.\nThe map icons will be released to all backers in themed sets as they are created. A \u201ccomplete collection\u201d of the map icons in a single download will also be made available for backers at the end of this project\u2019s creation phase.\nThe map icons produced by this project are super-high 600 dpi resolution and especially created to properly accompany the matching high resolution digital maps offered. This means the map icons will also scale up to poster-map quality.\nThe planned release schedule for the map icon sets is once weekly starting the day the project funds clear. These sets will be made available to all backers via the Digital Distribution Tool.\nEach map set initially includes 10 totally different map icons (not just color/texture variations). The number of icons in each set can be increased via unlocked stretch goals beginning at the $15k funding level.\nResources: Music used for intro video: Ambient Music 6 by Essa.

However, I have years of experience with designing or running successful Kickstarter projects for various publishers (including some of the most successful Kickstarter projects by AAW Games and Kobold Press). This isn't my first rodeo, and I have already learned many of the \"difficult lessons\" that many first time project creators face.\n\nIn comparison with some of the more complex Kickstarter projects I've assisted with, this project is very straight forward. I foresee no likely hurdles in providing backers with the completed product as promised.\n\nHowever, as with any project in the making, there are inherent risks. As the sole producer of this material, if something where to happen to me that prevented continued content creation the project could become delayed. Even in that unlikely event, backers would still have full access to all of the content that was created for the project up to that point and a contingency is in place to release any pending and completed maps to backers should the gods choose to cast lightning to strike me down.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please drop me a message in the comments section for this project and I'll get an answer to you as soon as possible (as well as updating the FAQ here if deemed necessary).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Keep Me Updated", "descp": "Interested in this project, but not yet ready to back at a higher level?

The adventure is the result of two years of research, writing and play testing. The real history is fascinating and flows right into the mythos world with very few changes. The more you discover, the deeper you are drawn toward your own insanity.\nThe Star on the Shore is written by Ben Burns, features the artwork of Evgeni Maloshenkov, edited by Alex Burns, and cover layout by Stephanie McAlea.\nJoin me in completing this great adventure, so that we can share it with the world. Please back my Kickstarter today to help make this adventure a reality.\nThe funds will go toward the artwork already commissioned, allow for even more artwork (stretch goals), commissioning of the cartography for the maps, the editing, printing and shipping.\n         $10 Print 8\" x 10\" of your choice\nOr $20 for Both\nFront Cover Art\nBack Cover Art\n $15 Cthulhu Insanity Dice\n $24 An extra Soft Cover Copy ($25 level and up)\n $39 An Extra Hard Cover Copy ($40 level and up)\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is almost no risk at all unless we sell a million or more, then there might be some delay in shipping, but I am willing to take on that challenge. Otherwise I do not see any real chance for any delays barring real life tragedy, or perhaps the stars aligning and Cthulhu rising. \n\nThe module is mostly finished. We are just beefing up some of the lesser encountered NPCs. The initial art is complete and the artist, Evgeni, is standing by ready to draw any stretch goal art and, the cartographer is ready to start on the maps as soon as we fund. I have worked with the Printer for the soft cover version and never had any problems. This will be my first time creating a hard cover print, so there is a risk there, I hope it is small.\n\nI have published 5 other modules before this one, so I am very familiar with the process, and do not expect any surprises. I have also run 6 successful Kickstarters before this one. All have been successful and either delivered on time or are on schedule.\n\nI look forward to completing this project with the same efficiency and quality that I put forward with all my projects.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The King In Yellow", "descp": "On the edge of your seat as you watch the play unfold.

They focus on the darker aspects of horror roleplaying and, as such, are recommended for a mature audience.\n\nMore inspired by True Detective and Hannibal than Pulp Horror, these adventures involved mythos corruption of the Human psyche and many feature direct contact with entities from outside space and time.\nIdeally suited to one evening's play, they have been written with a compact adventure style and Keepers will need a minimum of preparation time before being able to run them. Each scenario will also have tags in the header image so they can make quick decisions on what to run and then deal with dinner, family, or relaxing before their players arrive. \n\nFor example, a scenario might state: \nMissing FBI Agent-Innsmouth-Deep Ones-Dagon. \nSo the Keeper may think \"Well, we ran a deep one adventure last week, let's try another scenario.\" and then check another header for a scenario more suitable to that evening's play rather than having to skim the scenario.\nGeorge Cotronis' cover\nThe same team who worked on the critically acclaimed book 'The Things We Leave Behind' are also behind this anthology along with a motley crew of mythos tainted individuals who are serving their secrets to you in the form of horror scenarios. \nWhat People Said About Our Previous Modern Call of Cthulhu Anthology 'The Things We Leave Behind'.\n\n\"At times genuinely unsettling ( without ever being exploitative) It is one of the best collections I've seen, and I've played and collected CoC scenarios since 1983\"\nChristian Lehmann, contributing Author to 'Horror on the Orient Express'.\n\n\"Having read through the scenarios now I can say this is probably my favorite release of the year [...] its done with flair, excellently plotted, tightly written scenarios, simple but evocative images, and a overall aesthetic and style rarely seen outside of professional circles.\"\nDriveThruRPG Customer (Name Witheld by request)\n\n\"There is not a bad scenario in Things We Leave Behind, but \u2018Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away Home\u2019 and \u2018Forget Me Not\u2019 both stand out as fantastic scenarios, whilst \u2018The Night Season\u2019 is both fantastic and fantastically absurd. This is a good anthology and a good anthology of scenarios for the modern day, quite possibly the best anthology since the publication of Chaosium, Inc.\u2019s The Stars Are Right. Perhaps the highest praise that can be paid to Things We Leave Behind is that is not hard to imagine Miskatonic River Press publishing this collection, but what is definitely true is that Things We Leave Behind is the first great release for use with Call of Cthulhu, Seventh Edition.\"\nPookie, Reviews From R'Lyeh.\nJeff Moeller is the Editor, Stephanie McAlea will be doing the maps, Badger McInnes will be master of layout, and the art will be from a variety of artists to give each scenario the flavour it deserves. The full list of current writers (which we hope to expand for you) is listed below.\nHidden secrets in the countryside\n  The adventures deal with squalor, dark secrets, underground vice, and a host of other environments and elements. Gangland criminals, psychopaths, cultists, and Great Old Ones can all be found within these pages. Horror stretches its tendrils across the globe and, as such, please be aware that some of the themes are quite mature and are suitable for adult gamers only.\n1. Separation Anxiety, by Jeff Moeller. Disappearances of distinctive looking people stretching back decades leads to an \u201cagritourism\u201d self-pick farm in rural Ohio\n2. Undertow, by Simon Brake.

Pulvis Et Umbra Sumus, by Matthew Sanderson. Out of the blue, the investigators are invited to the reading of the will of a wealthy recluse in Maine. However, none of them have ever heard of this person, but they definitely need the money.\n7. The Great God Awto, by Jo Kreil. Several individuals who are working on a new concept car are killed in strange and suspicious accidents.\n8. Spilsbury #9485, by Adam Gauntlett. A butchered murder victim stuffed in a steamer trunk and left on a train in 1932 keeps turning up again and again throughout the decades, and whenever it appears disaster follows as time bends, breaks, and opens up to alternate dimensions allowing the things From Beyond through.  \n9. Lights Out, by Joe Trier. Investigations into a teenage girl's murder reveal she had been using a ouija board to contact her dead boyfriend in the weeks before her untimely death; but who had she really been talking to?  \n10. Bone Deep, by Allan Goodall. A killer who makes off with his victim\u2019s body parts leads the investigators to The Bone Collectors, a cult of Mordiggian collecting lost knowledge etched into the bones of living humans.  \n11. Do Not Call Up That Which You Cannot Put Down, by Brian Courtemanche. Investigators discover the Monster of Martin\u2019s Beach, as first described by H.P. Lovecraft and Sonia Greene in their story \u201cThe Invisible Monster\u201d (Weird Tales, November 1923 issue).  \n12. Hit and Run, by Tyler Hudak. The PCs get drawn into the aftermath of the hit and run death of a child; a grieving family member has turned to the Mythos for revenge.  \n13. Remaking the Hatteras Reef, by Andi Newton.

A missing person case in the North Carolina mountains is not all it seems.  \n16. Resurrection, by Stuart Boon. A long-dead college friend returns from the grave prompting questions and leading to a gruesome and terrifying revelation.  \n17. Waiting To Be Born, by Christopher Smith Adair. A network works the will of Yidhra, spreading and then horribly reincorporating genetic material in her hunger for diversification.  \n18. Unland, by Scott Dorward. The investigators are drawn to an abandoned amusement park, now a holy site where lies are stripped away.  \n\n19. The Focus Group, by Simon Yee.

You are all invited!\nThe Tashmere Family Thanks You For Your Service\nThanks to you, our amazing backers, ALL Stretch Goals were unlocked. You assembled the Tashmere family, unearthed Eldritch Tales, and discovered Dark Secrets. You have expanded the Dread House to around 150 pages, and the Large Floor Tile Pack to 95. Those of us working behind the scenes to bring this project to you are honored and humbled by your generosity. Thank you so much. - Danny\nDry leaves crackle under your feet as you make your way up the hill towards the dark manse, your path lit by a bold harvest moon. The taste of rain is in the air and you hear a distant peal of thunder. The townsfolk begged you not to come up here. Not tonight. Especially not tonight.\nYou reach the grounds as storm clouds slip across the moon, darkening the yard. You make your way carefully to the front door but find it barred from the outside. It would take a crowbar and some muscle to get in this way. The windows are high off the ground but seem breakable. You test your theory with a large rock, and the glass shatters as the first bolt of lightning slashes across the sky. You climb up and through the broken pane, carefully turning and lowering yourself to the floor of the room inside. The townsfolk may be afraid of this place buy you aren\u2019t.\n\u201cGood Evening\u201d says a deep strong voice that makes you whirl with shock. Your eyes search the darkness but you see nothing. A flash of lightning verifies to your eyes that you are alone.\n\u201cI trust you will be staying?\u201d says the voice. \u201cExcellent, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had company.\u201d Lightning flashes again. The drawing room is empty of everything but old furniture. You turn and scramble to the window, ready to leap through it and to the ground below. But the window isn\u2019t broken any more. Somehow it\u2019s healed.\nYou stop to puzzle this impossibility for the briefest of moments. That\u2019s all it takes. The voice in the darkness gets you, and nobody hears you scream. You should have listened to the townsfolk. You should have come better prepared\u2026for The Dread House.\nGhostly RPG Adventures in a Haunted Mansion of Epic Proportions. Fully realized with floor tiles, miniatures, terrain, and music.\n  Immerse Yourself In the Dread House!\nMusic: A haunting melody by German composers Erdenstern sets the mood for this epic adventure. The suite is inspired by the Dread Wedding. It is provided free to all backers who pledge $10 or more.\nFiction: Ghost stories by professional authors Kevin Andrew Murphy and Richard Lee Byers allow GMs to enjoy the backstory of key adventures in a fun way. These \"Ghost Stories\" can be enjoyed by players after the adventure concludes.\nGM Screen: A custom version of The World's Greatest Screen - Mini. This vinyl 12 pocket screen comes with 12 4\" x 6\" cards that have game stats on one side and spooky art on the other. Customize your screen to set the mood for your players.\nArt Goes On The Players Side - Secrets Go On Your Side\nFloor Tiles: Presented in two sizes, the small pack and the large pack, this accessory allows the GM to BUILD THE HOUSE AS THE PLAYERS EXPLORE IT! When combined with miniatures from this Kickstarter, it amplifies the game experience. NOTE: reward Tiers only contain the SMALL Floor Tile Pack. To upgrade to the LARGE, please add-on $10 to any Tier that rewards the SMALL pack. You can add EITHER pack to any pledge level as an add-on.\nFloorplans Come With Carpets To Decorate Rooms\n  This is the size of the 1st Floor (Work in Progress)\nThe Dread Wedding Adventure Pack: Up your game with this collection of 28mm miniatures. These 8 miniatures are specific to the Dread Wedding storyline, which is the primary adventure in the book. NPCs, villains, and terrain all enhance the experience. When the Kickstarter begins, 4 of the figures are revealed, and 4 are hidden by doors. Stretch goals reveal those hidden figures.\nThe Stars of The Dread Wedding\nDread House Add-On Packs: Master the table and wow your players with this collection of Gothic furnishings packaged in easy-to-buy room packs. All pieces are cast in white resin, are unpainted, and can be used as-is (minor assembly required on a few pieces).\nSet The Scene With 25+ Pieces of Themed Terrain\n    Stretch Goals are represented by Story Packs. When a new story pack is earned, everybody gets new stuff!\n  Each story pack adds two new adventures to the book (thus increasing it's page count). Sometimes a story pack will introduce a new Ghost Story by one of our fiction authors. Every story pack introduces new tiles which are added *as a bonus* to the Large Floor Tile Pack.\nPerhaps most exciting, stretch goals can upgrade miniatures in the Dread House Adventure Pack, the Eldritch Tales Adventure Pack, and the Dark Secrets Adventure Pack, replacing doors with new monsters, NPCs, or terrain pieces!\nThere are 7 pre-planned stretch goals for this project. If all are completed The Dread Wedding Adventure Pack will contain 8 unique figures specific to that adventure, and the large Floor Tile Pack will contain about 100 pages of tiles!\nAll items below can be added on to any reward tier. Note that prices do not reflect freight, which will be handled through BackerKit.\n          Everything is available as an add-on from the rewards charts. Add-ons will be handled with BackerKit.

The final contents of the pack will be determined by the end of the Kickstarter campaign. It will *at least* include party invitations, The Dread Wedding Lay by Erdenstern, and a short adventure playable with Pathfinder, 5th edition, and/or Call of Cthulhu.\nWave 2 - Book and Tiles: all paper products will ship together as soon as the book is complete. Book, tiles, mini screen, and inserts will ship in the same package in early 2017.\nWave 3 - Miniatures: since minis take time to develop, they will all ship together when completed. European customers will be given the option to ship Wave 2 and 3 together to save on freight. These will most likely ship in spring 2017.\nReward Chart\n  If you have questions please contact Danny via Kickstarter\n  Traveling in remote territory in late fall, the characters find themselves in the sleepy town of Sorenton. There they discover that a curse has been plaguing the people of the town for decades. The towns liege lord and protector Jazef Tashmere was long ago destroyed by his old enemies, the Dread Lords. Kaseh Tashmere, the manor in which Tashmere\u2019s family lived for generations is now cursed and haunted. It has come to be known as the Dread House.\nThe group learns that the house fell on the night before the wedding of Tashmere's eldest daughter. A curse was placed upon the home, and as a result, a dark storm falls upon Sorenton each year during the Festival of the Dead. The PCs will be asked to help rid the town of that curse. Radeg, captain of the town guard is just one such soul that will attempt to guide them to the grounds where they will face many supernatural dangers.\nWhen they enter The Dread House, the group will face its curse head on. Trapped between earth and hell, the house hosts hundreds of ghosts, held there by a demon spirit known only as the Pumpkin Man. Every year, these ghosts pantomime the wedding they never attended, hoping for the day that someone will break their curse and set them free.\nThe group will explore the house and uncover its mysteries. They will ultimately do battle with the The Pumpkin Man, the chaotic dark servant of the Dread Lords. Aided by the ghosts of Jazef Tashmere and his daughter Chrissy, the players will seek to break the curse, lay the trapped souls to rest, and return The Dread House to the people of Sorenton.\nWhether or not they succeed is completely up to you, the Pumpkin Man, and all the restless spirits...in The Dread House.\n This project is licensed by Chaosium. \"Call of Cthulhu\" is a Chaosium trademark and is used with permission. www.chaosium.com \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks in every project but we've taken steps to reduce them as much as possible. The Dread House is protected from project creep, and the bulk of the project is complete at this time. Backer options were kept simple and functional. Software advances allow for easier order fulfillment, address changes, and add-ons. Staggered shipping of rewards will mitigate the waiting period associated with some of the components of the project.\n\nDespite these preparations, small projects like this one are vulnerable to life circumstances. The Grande Temple of Jing was plagued by so many of them that at times, it seemed that Jing himself was toying with us. We don't really believe that, but just in case, for this project - we sprinkled salt around the outside of the house, put a priest on retainer, and sacrificed a rubber chicken.

It has been written for Call of Cthulhu and will be updated for the 7th edition of the rules. \nBack in 2007 I answered a call from famed Call of Cthulhu\u00ae writer and editor Keith \"Doc\" Herber to submit ideas for his upcoming The Outer Gods scenario book. He had specific ideas about making the book different from other scenario collections, and he had a high bar he wanted each scenario to reach. We worked together on the scenario over the next 1.5 years until his untimely death in 2009, but before that, he approved Sun Spots for inclusion in The Outer Gods. His specific words were: \"I think we have a winner here, and one with a lot of fun possibilities. Nice job...\" I hope this project will do his vision justice.\nRight now, I have written nearly 28,000 words for this scenario, play-tested it multiple times (both with friends and at conventions), and have commissioned art by seasoned Cthulhu veterans Jason Eckhardt, Reuben Dodd, Caleb Cleveland and Chris Huth. I'm also bringing back most of my team from my previous Kickstarter (He Who Laughs Last): Gregory G. Geiger for design and layout, Jake Coolidge for maps, and Cynthia Douglas Chernoff as my editor. \nThe funding for this project will be used for completing maps and art, finishing the design and layout of the books, and having the book edited, produced and delivered into your nice warm hands! I can't wait to show you!\nHere is an amazing illustration from Mr Dodd!\n   Now that we're funded, let's talk about stretch goals. I've thought carefully about them and want to make sure that they add to your game but will not impact the scope of the project. \nHere are the stretch goals we've got planned:\nFUNDED $7500: More Art -- Add four more b/w half-page illustrations by our amazing artist Reuben Dodd.\nFUNDED $8500: GM Kit Part 1 -- Provide Playtest notes illuminating the various lessons learned throughout the years of playtesting this, as well as provide a full transcript of the first playtest from 2008. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\nFUNDED $10,000: Red Valley Visitor's Guide -- I will work with Gregory Geiger to incorporate Jake Coolidge's hand-drawn map of Red Valley into a 1920s-style visitor's guide handout. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above, and will be provided as a print copy for the Deluxe level ($70) and above.\nFUNDED $12,000: GM Kit Part 2 -- I'll create 6 pre-generated Call of Cthulhu PCs and put them with the playtest notes. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\n$14,000: Headshots -- Reuben Dodd will illustrate 10 b/w headshots for various NPCs to go directly into the book. \n$15,000: Director's Cut -- One really fun and interesting scene that I worked on extensively with Keith Herber, but was cut from the final product, will be added as an addendum, to be used by GMs at will. We'll also have Reuben Dodd add two half-page b/w illustrations to this chapter as well. \n\u201cDave Sokolowski\u2019s Sun Spots harkens back to the classic Call of Cthulhu scenarios that we all love and dials up the danger with a number of intriguing twists including a new take on an old god. Detailed, multi-layered, and engaging, Sun Spots shines with interesting characters, nefarious plots, and ancient evil. Sokolowski has another winner on his hands.\u201d - Stuart Boon, author of the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Shadows over Scotland\n\"Dave Sokolowski submitted Sun Spots to Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber for his planned epic scenario book, The Outer Gods. Doc worked with Dave to tweak, build, and perfect it, and was proud of the final result. Sadly, in a blow to the entire community, Doc passed away suddenly long before the project could be completed. It should be noted that Doc\u2019s vision for The Outer Gods contained the following requirement on the spec sheet, \u201cEvery scenario in this book has to be great.\u201d Those who knew Doc and his considerable work for the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game were aware that nothing got approved unless it was truly excellent work. This was the man behind H. P. Lovecraft's Arkham, H. P. Lovecraft's Dunwich, Keeper's Companion, 1920s Investigator's Companion, Spawn of Azathoth, Trail of Tsathogghua, Fungi from Yuggoth, and New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley to name only a few. Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber shaped Call of Cthulhu and made it a truly wonderful game. And if he thought Sun Spots was great, what\u2019s your excuse?\" - Tom Lynch, co-founder of Miskatonic River Press \n\"In presenting a new interpretation of an Outer God, Sun Spots brings an uncaring and elemental influence to bear down on New England, but this is pleasingly manifest in an all too human a fashion\u2014pride, belief, and religious mania that are as much a threat to the investigators as the Daemon Sultan is himself. Sun Spots is a delightfully balmy investigation into the dangers of sun worship.\" - Pookie, Reviews from R'lyeh (the full review is here: http://rlyehreviews.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/shining-for-cthulhu-dark.html)\nWe have the following levels of pledge available:\nThanks ($1): Any amount of pledge (from $1 up) will see your name on our Kickstarter Supporter list. Many thanks indeed!\nDigital ($10): This level receives the Sun Spots PDF from DTRPG, as well as any and all stretch goals! All levels from $10 up will receive the PDF copy.\nSoft-Copy ($30): At this level backers will receive a soft-cover copy POD Sun Spots book, plus the PDF and Thanks.\nDeluxe Hard Copy ($70): This level of backing will receive a hard-backed copy POD Sun Spots book, signed by me, plus the PDF and Thanks. These backers will also receive hard-copies of the three maps and any handouts designed for the scenario (this is what makes it \"deluxe\").\nCharacters ($100): In addition to everything at the Deluxe level, I will create 6 Call of Cthulhu 1920s-era PC sheets to your specifications, and then give you both digital and hard-copies of them.\nEntitled ($120): Get everything at the Deluxe level, then choose from a list of 20 NPCs and locations in the scenario that you can name to your liking (scenario-appropriate, please). People can choose in the order in which they chose this option (e.g. first backer at this level chooses from the list first).\nClose Traveler ($250): I will travel within 100 miles of San Francisco to run the scenario for you and your friends. You'll get the personalized PC sheets, 1 hard copy (for you), and 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends). It will be a good time. I'll bring snacks.\nTraveler ($1300): At this level, I will travel anywhere in the USA or Canada, bring 1 hand-signed hard-back copy of Sun Spots, 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends), and run a game for you and up to 5 of your friends. I'll also bring snacks and my gregarious personality. (You will also receive the Deluxe handouts and PC sheets).  \nAdd-Ons\nDue to popular demand, I will make additional soft-cover POD books available at the $30 pledge level. And if you\u2019ve already purchased one book, I will subsidize part of the shipping. Here is what you can do if you want to add-on a softcover POD book to your existing pledge:\nIf you live in the USA or UK: Add $35 total\nIf you live outside the USA/UK: Add $40 total \nShipping\nFurthermore, for shipping of the physical books, I have tried to strike a balance for both myself and backers. I will subsidize part of the shipping, as well as streamline the shipping rates to avoid confusion. \nUS backers will pay $5, UK backers $10 and other international backers $20 for the soft-back copy reward shipments. Hard-copies will be a bit more for UK, as I have to ship all the boxes to my house first, before shipping them out (except where I meet you in person). I hope this will be a middle ground where shipping doesn't overwhelm the budget but backers don't have to absorb the entire cost.  \nI have play-tested this game multiple times since I completed the first draft back in 2009, and it has been honed and edited down to a very clean and crisp story. What used to be a very wide sandbox game with very few boundaries for the investigators now has clarity and focus. There is still a very strong sandbox feel, but the scenario now has guides and structure to get the players heading in the right direction before letting them go.\nWith this much playtesting, I was forced to pull a couple of scenes that I had worked on with Doc, but ultimately got in the way of the best possible scenario. With enough funding it might be possible to clean up this content and get it back in the book in an Appendix. We might even be able to do some art for it.\nI have run this game at multiple conventions (Dundracon, Celesticon, and Big Bad Con) as well as with local gaming groups. I believe it is finally ready for you.\nThis scenario has been around a long time and I really want to get it into your hands, to finally realize Doc's vision, but I need help with funding to get it over the finish line. I want the book to look and feel like the Cthulhu gaming books of the 1980-90s, specifically in the vein of Escape from Innsmouth, which Kevin Ross and Doc created with a host of talented artists and writers. Most importantly, I want this book to be something Doc would love.\nI need funding now to finish the book. To finish the art and maps, to get professional design and layout, and then have it edited so it all comes together in one amazing package. If you pledge now, then we can make it happen together. \nFinally, while the Kickstarter project is live, He Who Laughs Last in all formats, as well as the GM Kit and Short Fiction, will be on sale with 33% off on DTRPG here. \nCall of Cthulhu\u2122 is a trademark of Chaosium Inc and is used under licence.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe scenario has been written and playtested multiple times. Multiple art pieces are complete and more are in progress. This leaves design, layout, editing and production.\n\nThe biggest risks have to do with people and life. Right now, the team is working hard at the project and the book is scheduled to be delivered well on time. I spent many years as a professional project manager, and I have the skills and understanding to keep a project on track. \n\nThe key to any good project is communication. Expect at least monthly updates from me, and I will strive to be transparent in all aspects of my business dealings with my backers. Things may and do happen that can sidetrack a project. But with transparency and accountability we'll still get the book in your hands in the best possible manner.\n\nPlease refer to my previous project He Who Laughs Last if you want to see my communication style first-hand.

It will be edited by Jeff Moeller, and written by Robert Grayston & Stephanie McAlea. Art is by Jon Gibbons and Stephanie McAlea, along with numerous period photographs and images. This is the second Call of Cthulhu Kickstarter from Stygian Fox Publishing (The Things We Leave Behind being our first), and our third in total (the other being the fantasy gazetteer; Distant Realms).\nTaking its inspirational cues from Sherlock Holmes, Ripper Street, Auguste Dupin, The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher, and The Incendiary's Trail, the book takes a mature look at the horror of Mythos machinations and the many dark corners in the seat of empire.\nThe funds for this Kickstarter will go towards commissioning more art and the hiring more writers and creatives of quality if the book is to expand. The funds will also go on printing and distribution.\nThe Editions:\nThe Standard Cover\nPDF: The Dark Network (PDF) The PDF will be full colour with the standard cover and will contain the main book material but not the expanded material*\nB&W Softcover + Colour PDF:\nHM Constabulary (B&W Softcover+PDF)\nThe main book will be B&W with the standard colour cover and will come with a colour PDF. Neither of these products will contain the expanded material*\nColour Hardback + Colour PDF:\nThe Hidden Patrons (Colour H/B+PDF) and The Powers (Colour Hardcover+PDF+Naming)\nThis edition will come as a full colour hardback and colour PDF featuring the standard cover. Neither of these will contain the expanded material*\n Limited Edition Spirits Edition The Spirits (Ltd Ed S/C+PDF+Naming)\nThis edition will be limited and will not appear after the kickstarter. It will have white lettering on a minimalist period softcover but will be full colour throughout. It will also contain a section on ghosts and spirits of Victorian London and how to include them in your adventures. The spirits section will not appear in any other edition*\n Limited Edition Immortals Edition\nThe Immortals (Ltd Ed H/C+PDF+Naming)This edition will be limited and will not appear after the Kickstarter. It will have grey/silver lettering on a minimalist period hardcover but will be full colour throughout. It will also contain a section on a small group of Immortals operating in Victorian London and how to include them in your adventures. Whether you as the the Keeper uses them for good or ill or even as pre-generated characters is up to you. The Immortals section will not appear in any other edition*\nLimited Edition Curators Edition (Ltd Ed H/C+PDF+Naming) This edition will be limited and will not appear after the kickstarter.\nThis edition will contain numerous items but the book will be a minimalist hardcover of bronze/burnished gold on black. It will be full colour throughout, Both the PDF and the book will contain the previous 'Spirits' and 'Immortals' sections.\n*The special EXTRA sections of the Spirits & Immortals will be added to the Curators edition but will only be available (for free) to other backers via DriveThruRPG in PDF format. They were never originally meant to be part of Hudson & Brand (and the standard edition is the Hudson & Brand book) but we thought adding them would be a nice touch.\nThe adventure deals with squalor, dark secrets, underground gambling, and a gang of Fenians hell bent on bringing destruction to London ...but all is not as it first appears. As so often is the case, madness or death may take the Investigators and the premises of Hudson & Brand at 3 Golden Square give ample opportunity to bring new characters into the fold with a minimum of fuss. Horror stalks the land and, as such, please be aware that some of the themes are quite mature and are suitable for adult gamers only.\nHudson & Brand, Ground Floor\n  Hudson & Brand, Cellar\nThe Curious Case of \u2018Bare Knuckle Bill\u2019 by Robert Grayston & Stephanie McAlea sees the investigators get an earnest plea for assistance from an urchin who fears his pugilist friend, William Hawthorne, aka 'Bare Knuckle Bill', has been waylaid and may be dying in a ditch somewhere. The case soon reveals itself to be more than a mere missing person case as Fenians, Ruffians, and a mysterious woman all begin to hamper the Investigators inquiries.\n  Robert Grayston (co-Writer) \u2013 Robert Grayston recently wandered into catacombs beneath Istanbul and ever since has had a deep and unnerving interest in the depths of the ocean, the void between the stars and those voices that seep into your dreams. He dislikes the laughter of children, sanctified ground and celery.\nLeigh Woosey (Layout Designer) \u2013 Graphic designer and art worker with 10 years\u2019 experience. He has worked for Games Workshop on \u2018Warhammer: Triumph and Treachery\u2019, \u2018Codex Tyranids\u2019, and designed the packaging and branding for the Citadel Hobby Range.\n\nJon Gibbons (Illustrator) \u2013 a self-taught, UK based Freelance Illustrator who specializes in concept art and illustration for the RPG and boardgame industries.\nGeorge Cotronis (Cover Artist/Illustrator) \u2013 George Cotronis lives in the wilderness of Northern Sweden. He makes a living designing book covers. He sometimes writes. His stories have appeared in \u2018XIII\u2019, \u2018Big Pulp\u2019 and \u2018Vignettes from the End of the World\u2019.\nMatthew Pook (Editor and Proofreader) \u2013 Pookie is English. It is his task to make Spot Hidden rolls on an almost prodigious basis, \u2018tut\u2019 quietly to himself and shake his head, before politely suggesting to the author(s) that they might like to re-work the book.\nStephanie McAlea (co-Writer) - cartographer on \u2018Horror on the Orient Express\u2019, \u20182300AD\u2019, \u2018Call of Cthulhu 7th edition\u2019, and \u2018Cthulhu by Gaslight\u2019.  \nWith our team, we believe we can get your book to you in a timely fashion. Hudson & Brand will be in PDF format and also Print-On-Demand (POD). A code will be given to backers so they can download, the PDF and Stygian Fox will arrange to have a physical copy mailed to them via RPG Now and DrivethruRPG (backers are responsible for any import duties in their own territory).

My goal is always to quickly and efficiently deliver our products so that you can enjoy them without getting into a slog. I mean, remember, no 1980s module was more than 35 pages, and a classic like G2 Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl was only 8 pages, but it was pure genius! Plus, all backers have the option getting PDF versions as well for easy reference on their computers!\nI\u2019ve already created & fulfilled the initial three modules, The Folio #1 Beneath Roslof Keep, The Folio #2 Tremors in the Machine, and The Folio #3 Curse of the Violet Corruption right here on Kickstarter. Now I want to put The Folio #4 in your hands just as fast. At AotG, we are about quality, content, and speed, and I like to think of myself as a time machine that can bridge the gap between things I loved in the past and what technology can bring us today.\nInstead of making gaming anvils, I\u2019ve drilled the artistry of the game down, found the gems of an extended campaign, and delivered it in such a way that both new and old gamers alike can enjoy and play without taxing their life schedules. In the end, isn\u2019t gaming about being fun for everyone, not just the players? The Folio\u2019s goal is to ensure that, and always give folks the very best quality \u2018lean and mean\u2019 adventures we can.\nMy Project: The Folio #4 is a 1st Edition & 5th Edition combined gaming module. It will be produced as an 8x11\u201d, removable cover [11x17\" once removed], adventure with mostly b/w interior artwork. There are two interior booklets, The Gazetteer and The Dungeon, with the final size being roughly 40 pages of content.\nWho\u2019s it for? ALL gamers, both new gamers and old gamers as it is easily expandable or playable as is.The concept is to allow gamers a starting point for adventure that can be modified to their liking while providing excellent reference content and framework.The base mechanic will be for 1st Edition with 5th Edition insets, but I\u2019ve designed it to be readily modified to any fantasy game, and don't forget the PDF!\nInside Dungeon Cover for ROS4!\nWhat\u2019s in it? All original content. It has been written by myself and my OSR compatriot Mark Timm, with incredible cover art from Dragon Magazine cover artist legend Daniel Horne, and interior artwork by skilled black and white illustrators Brian 'Glad' Thomas, Chet Minton, Matthew Ray, Michael Wilson, Janet Aulisio, and Jeff Laubenstein. I'm even going to throw in at least one interior illustrations by Jim Holloway, because I can never get enough Holloway. We are intent on providing a polished and modern design with creatively nostalgic content that transcends a particular age. The Folio #4 will contain a 3-D map, a Gazetteer, a monster section, a new monster unique to the setting, DM\u2019s notes and guides, and a full adventure.\nWhen? The bulk of the module is complete, we only need to be funding so we can begin the full printing process. This means that PDFs will go out after the campaign wraps in September, and the physical copies should be to you no later than November!\nFull 'wrap' removable cover that acts as a DM Screen!\nWhy Roslof Keep? Well, because I loved gaming artist Jim Roslof, have toured his studio, and always thought he should have received more credit for his work in the dawn of RPGs. This tribute is for his work on the cover of B2 Keep on the Borderlands.\nI can\u2019t do this without you: Art of the Genre needs your help! We've trimmed out all excess costs and have a break even amount of $5,000.This covers the printing, shipping, design, mapping, and the incredible story telling artwork we\u2019ll be using in these adventures. We have already devoted countless hours to seeing this product come together, but to make it \u2018real\u2019 and available to all players, we need your help. We believe in this dream, and we hope you do too!\nInterior 3D Mapping for Folio #3, and you'll find the same in all Folios!\nWhat happens if we pass the goal? If we pass the goal, it will allow us to begin production on new stretch additions for the campaign as well as the next adventure in the series [as we did with The Folio #1, #2, & #3 KS campaigns], and our hope is to find enough support along the way to complete the entire six part Roslof Keep Campaign series of modules. Bottom line, our goal is to make a truly fantastic and age-defying piece of gaming history, each penny we receive goes toward that.

We had adventured about two weeks (in those days we'd play 4-5 times a week) and most of the survivors had risen to 2-3 level while the Mage had gotten to 7th because he'd get bonus xp's for \"leadership\". \"I'll throw a fireball and save your sorry butts again\"... \"Magic Missile to the Orc Leader before these guys get toasted\", etc. As you can imagine, we were getting tired of our \"Leader\" and the DM for allowing it. So, when we were looking down into a chasm with 3 Ogres in it and our \"Leader\" was telling the DM how he was going to handle the party (in effect running our PCs and his - again) - we decided to throw our \"Leader\" into the chasm and quit the campaign instead. The next night, I volunteered to be the DM and for me - the game got to be real fun...

That means you can now get 5 adventures when you back at the CAMPAIGN level or higher!\n---\nBack in March I brought the first volume of Dungeons on Demand to Kickstarter \u2013 and was blown away by the response! You guys demanded more dungeons, so here I am!\nDungeons on Demand are instant dungeons you can drop into your campaign, each is designed for 4-5 player parties of specified levels, and each dungeon is complete with a back story, hand drawn maps, traps, puzzles, and reference information to monsters and treasure. You can customize each one to fit in your campaign however you wish, and each one can be played through in one or two gaming sessions (depending upon how long you play!)\nI\u2019ve taken a lot of feedback into consideration going into this next volume. For instance, each module is now edited by the talented Rico Gilbert. Additionally, all the Dungeons on Demand adventures now come with player safe maps, so you can give your players something to look at without giving away hidden creatures, traps, or treasure!\nTwo sets of maps for each encounter area, one for players, one for GMs!\nEach Dungeons on Demand PDF contains the following:  \nA dungeon back story to explain what's going on. You have complete control over what's going on and why in each adventure, but this explanation is used to tie everything together. It also adds some flavor to each encounter, and readies you for questions and actions from your players you may not have anticipated.  \nAdventure hooks and quests to get the PCs to the dungeon. How did the players find themselves here? Are they looking for someone or something? Each dungeon presents three great reasons to bring the PCs there outside of one you might use for your own campaign.  \nHand-drawn maps of the entire dungeon for the Game Master. Additionally, each distinct area has its own map as well, labeled with details pertinent to the encounter. Each map uses handy icons to reference what's going on in the area - hostile creatures, hidden traps, treasure, NPCs, you name it!  \nQuick reference icons used on maps and encounter descriptions\nMaps for each area without labels or icons you can present to the players. This gives the players a visual of the encounter area. They're also useful when playing the game online! \nFull breakdowns of each encounter. Complete with references to monsters and magic items, detailed descriptions of traps and puzzles, monster strategies, what developments come from combat, and little odds and ends to brighten the role-playing experience.  \nCombat Difficulty Gauges rate encounter challenges from 1 (very easy) to 5 (deadly!) stars. This gives GMs a quick idea of how hard a fight is!\nA wrap up guide for you to go over after completing the dungeon. Are any monsters or bad guys still alive? What's their deal? Are all the quests or adventure hooks finished? What experience points and rewards are left to be given out?  \nAn appendix for unique monsters, NPCs, and items. Each dungeon has a unique foe or trinket to give your experience something new and different.\nCAMPAIGN GOALS & STRETCH GOALS:\nDungeons on Demand: Volume Two is a reality!\n Thanks making the next volume a reality!\nThe NPC Codex is coming to life!\nI will create an NPC Codex - a handy guide of NPCs you can drop into your campaign. There's no lengthy backstories or alignments here, you decide whether the NPC is an ally or a villain. This will be released as a free supplement on DriveThruRPG and included in the complete Volume Two of Dungeons on Demand adventures.\nYou can see a preview here with Nezira Darkscale, who also happens to be featured in No Laughing Matter.\nLooks like there's some cities and towns coming as well!\nI will create a supplement of city and town maps. These will include resident NPCs, adventure ideas, and special features that make the town memorable. This will be released as a free supplement on DriveThruRPG and included in the complete Volume Two of Dungeons on Demand adventures.\nDo you hear something ringing? A bell sounding somewhere... somewhere distant?\nEveryone that pledges at the CAMPAIGN level or higher will receive a bonus, level 17 adventure. I'll post a teaser for this adventure in an upcoming update. \nEach dungeon is an adventure site - be it a literal dungeon, plunged into the fiery heart of a volcano, the deteriorating remains of a lost civilization's holy temples, a wizard's study hidden away in the cove, the halls of giants, the lairs of dragons, or any fantastic location you can think of! \nEvery adventure has encounters and challenges appropriate for a party of a specified level, assuming an average of four or five players in the party (although you can adjust the number of monsters or monster statistics accordingly to accommodate your players' party size.) At the end of each dungeon, each player should have accumulated enough experience points to gain a level! \nThe dungeons are presented in full color, PDF format - you can easily print them for reference later or open them on your tablet or smart phone during play. \nFor a 2nd-Level Party!\nThe town of Oallhelm is small and remote \u2013 for years they\u2019ve been prosperous, peaceful, and self-sufficient. That's why it was such a surprise when the hobgoblin Thetch Blindeye led a war band of goblins into town and started terrorizing Oallhelm\u2019s citizens!\n\nThe PCs are on the outskirts of Oallhelm when they learn town square is overrun with the invaders \u2013 the goblins are now feasting in the streets, starting fires, setting traps, and terrorizing anyone left behind. They must drive out these mischief makers to save the town!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM MISCHIEF MAKERS \nFor a 5th-Level Party!\nLaugher\u2019s Gorge occupies a stretch of the canyon that runs through the local badlands, named for the haunting laughter that occasionally erupts from its depths. When travelers using the road past the gorge become infected with cackle fever, it\u2019s up to the party to find out what\u2019s causing the mysterious laughing sickness. Though they find a pack of gnolls infesting the canyon, it\u2019s no joke when they discover who (or what) is pulling the strings!\nLaughter and humor are central themes in No Laughing Matter. The players are met with the will of a prankster god, riddles to solve, and may be forced to come up with some jokes of their own. But this isn\u2019t an adventure to take lightly. If the party underestimates Laugher\u2019s Gorge, they may find themselves infected with cackle fever\u2026 and there\u2019s nothing funny about that!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM NO LAUGHING MATTER \nFor a 9th-Level Party!\nWhen the trade galley Fairmorning fails to make it in to port, it\u2019s up to the PCs to investigate. When their search leads them to the depths of the seafloor and a mysterious underwater shrine, more questions arise than answers!  \nA collective of sahuagin barons, led by their matron Mes\u2019Dal\u2019Umbrak (Sahuagin for \u201cMother-of-the-Deathly-Tide\u201d) is using the shrine to concoct something evil and twisted in the deep. The party (with a little help from the concerned merfolk) must defeat the sahuagin forces to keep the seas safe\u2026 but sooner or that sinking feeling sets in - there's something much more evil at hand!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM THAT SINKING FEELING\nFor a 13th-Level Party!\nYuan-ti sovereign Erut-Ro spent his life enslaving free nations, subjugating masses, and ruling with an iron fist... and continued to do so in death when he became a terrifying mummy lord! Erut-Ro\u2019s reign of oppression ended when a powerful group of warriors sealed the mummy and his pyramid away in another dimension for 3,000 years.  \nNow, three millenia later, the mummy lord's pyramid has suddenly sprung back into existence! One might think 3,000 years spent sealed away from society would settle Erut-Ro\u2019s sadism, but, as they say, old habits are hard to break. The mummy lord intends to start right where he left off... as soon as he recovers his full power. The party must contend with the ancient monsters that await them in his pyramid before they can wrap up the mummy lord\u2019s evil plans for good!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM OLD HABITS \nInterested in getting a glimpse of Dungeons on Demand? Here's your chance! Download this adventure for FREE from DriveThruRPG!\n(To receive this module for free, enter \"0.00\" in the price section before checkout)\nFor a 1st-Level Party!\nA flock of kenku bandit's have discovered the ruined remains of a temple site, and have used it as their hideout while they raid unsuspecting travelers on nearby roads. It's up to the PCs to clear their nest, recover stolen goods, and rescue their hostages. Will the players be bested by these dirty birds? Or will they have the bandits eating crow?\nThe backer levels are grouped into the following tiers:\nThe first thing you should do is pledge! For as little as $5 you can get the best dungeon ready for your players' adventuring party. Once you have your copy, it's recommended you read over the packet and familiarize yourself with the layout and encounters, as well as figure out anyway you'd like to customize the dungeon to your campaign. From there out the rest is all in GM Maaaaagic. Drop the dungeon in the current locale, switch around NPCs, put in your own magic items and plot MacGuffins to be found! \nDan Coleman has been a Game Master for two decades now, first picking up the dice with second edition.

By day he's a humble graphic designer and illustrator, but by night he's a full time role-player and game designer.

I now have two broad campaigns going, and this includes installments in both.  The Dimgaard campaign is an XP driven campaign, and we're at 8th level, so here are the 7th level adventures that we played last month (polished up with sidebars and whatnot).  Here is the first of the five as a preview: http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/153614/DG26-Greenville\nThe Drow Conspiracy Saga is a milestone, fast advancement campaign - one adventure per level.  And we're on adventure 11.  1-7 were in previous kickstarters, so here are DC8, DC9, and DC10.\nThere is a new 1st level Dimgaard adventure that I used for a group of new players recently, and I wanted an additional 1st level adventure to square of the 1st level adventures in the Dimgaard series; there were only 3 1st level adventures, while every other block has at least four.\nThere is also an encounter gallery for 7th level PCs.  These are encounters that serve specific function (Inquisition, or retaliations), or single events that are not part of the storyline.  \nHere are the blurbs (which may revise on final edits):\nDG26 Greenville: Odill is a large city where corruption is rampant. And there are numerous strong organizations vested in preventing reform. Even with a regime change, the Cult of Orcus destroyed, and the drug cartels damaged, the reform of Odill seems a Herculean challenge. Maybe it is time for a different strategy. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The first episode in the Villages of Odill Arc.\nDG27 Shaky Alliance: The communities around Odill are not natural allies. Each was established around different philosophies and work to protect its niche in the economy of greater Odill. Forging them into a political block capable of challenging the overshadowing power of Odill is no trivial task. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level adventurers. The second episode in the Villages of Odill Arc. \nDG28 The Question: Slavery has a history that predates humanity. However, many organizations view it as an oppressive and inherently evil institution that should be opposed at every turn. Some even believe that it is worth any sacrifice to overthrow it. It the divisive issue between the Odill villages that agree with reform and those that support Prince Priogrim. Can the PCs keep the Odill region from exploding in civil strife? A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The third episode in the Villages Of Odill Arc.\nDG29 Allies in Trouble: The Order of Tythia was inspired by the alliance\u2019s determination to reform Odill. With the help of the Order of Metal and the Olidammarans, the Tythians tried to inspire a wave of slave rebellions in the agricultural communities, but failed. And during the attempt several were captured and are in the custody of Prince Priogrim. Can the PCs save their allies? A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The fourth episode of the Villages of Odill Arc.\nDG30 Crusade: Things are coming to a head in the rivalry between Odill and its surrounding communities. With both sides nearly evenly matched, the heroes give the edge to Odill\u2019s opposition. But Odill\u2019s position as the most influential city in the area and the seat of the Inquisition gives it an option with dramatic consequences. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The fifth and final episode in the Villages of Odill Arc.\nDGS14 Natural Balance: One person\u2019s dedicated defense of an ideal is another person\u2019s terrorism. What happens when progress endangers the natural order \u2013 or even nature itself? Can the PCs resolve the differences between the naturalists and the crafters? A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 1st level PCs.\nDC8 War Against the Drow: An agreement reached between the orcs of Fhuu and their neighbors for a coordinated campaign against the Drow Empire. Reserves mustered, weapons sharpened, armor polished \u2013 what could go wrong. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 8th level characters; the eighth episode in the Drow Conspiracy Epic.\nDC9 Drow Island: The campaign against St. Aurelius was thwarted. It is clear that the drow are an imposing force. Rather than an attack on St. Aurelius, a penetration behind aimed at a drow base might have more success. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 9th level characters. The ninth episode in the Drow Conspiracy Epic.\nDC10 Liberation from the Drow: If the capitol (St. Aurelius) can be liberated, it likely would trigger a widespread revolt that the drow could not resist without aid from their Abyssal resources. But the drow cannot draw from their Abyssal resources \u2013 at least for a while. So St. Aurelius is prime for a counterstrike to free it from the yoke of the drow. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 10th level characters. The tenth episode in the Drow Conspiracy Epic.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point, I think we are pretty secure in the process.

They are stand-alone, world-neutral, and easy to integrate into your ongoing campaign.\nDepending on funding levels and stretch goals cleared, the adventures may be enhanced with additional content, including bonus encounters and setting material.\nFinally, we would like your feedback on what YOU want for Fifth Edition. We invite backers to comment on what they would like Goodman Games to publish for our next 5E Kickstarter!\nCover Art to the Fifth Edition Fantasy Line\n  Fifth Edition Fantasy is Here!\nOur new line of 5E modules is called simply Fifth Edition Fantasy. Authored by well-known adventure designers Michael Curtis and Chris Doyle (each with more than a dozen published adventures under his belt), these adventures combine the streamlined game mechanics of 5E with challenging scenarios explicitly designed to appeal to both long-time gamers and neonates alike. Each adventure includes new races, backgrounds, monsters, spells, and magical items suitable for any 5E campaign.\nWhat are the goals of this Kickstarter? We have four goals with this Kickstarter:\n1. Launch the next two Fifth Edition Fantasy modules. These are FEF #3: The Pillars of Pelagia (by Chris Doyle) and FEF #4: War-lock (by Michael Curtis). Depending on stretch goals achieved, they may be expanded with new encounters and even more content.\n2. Offer our first two 5E adventures to Kickstarter backers. If you haven\u2019t already purchased them from your local store, you can add on to your pledge with the second printings of FEF #1: Glitterdoom (by Michael Curtis) and FEF #2: The Fey Sisters\u2019 Fate (by Chris Doyle).\n3. Listen to your feedback on 5E. Each edition of Dungeons & Dragons is different, with different player and DM needs. As you support this Kickstarter, we\u2019d love to hear what you want from us in our next 5E project.\n4. Give away a free 5E module on Free RPG Day. Yes, you read that right! The ultimate stretch goal for this Kickstarter is to create an entirely new adventure, which will be free to all backers and also printed for free distribution on Free RPG Day! Fifth Edition Fantasy #5 \u2013 for free! That\u2019s 5 F words in the tagline and the last is \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 has a good ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\nSample interior illustration from The Pillars of Pelagia\nTell Me About the Adventures! \nCertainly! The Goodman Games web site is updated with detailed information on each printed adventure, including some previews and early reviews. Here are links with art, previews, reviews, and more information:\nFifth Edition Fantasy #1: Glitterdoom\nFifth Edition Fantasy #2: The Fey Sisters\u2019 Fate\nFifth Edition Fantasy #3: The Pillars of Pelagia\nFifth Edition Fantasy #4: War-lock\nHow long will these take to write? The adventures are already written and edited. All maps and interior art are complete, and layout will begin the moment this Kickstarter concludes and we know how much bonus content we can print. Goodman Games has a strong track record of delivering on our promises, and this Kickstarter will continue that record.\nHow can I support the Kickstarter? You can pledge for the adventure modules, of course! Our pledge levels allow for funding of the two new Fifth Edition Fantasy modules, plus add-ons of the two already-published Fifth Edition Fantasy modules.\nWhat makes our adventures special? After publishing more than 100 modules continuously for over a decade, Goodman Games has developed a reputation for a clear perspective on fantasy adventure:\nOur adventure content focuses on unique encounters with unexpected dangers, memorable scenes that conjure strong visuals in the players\u2019 minds, and non-clich\u00e9d plots.\nOur modules are meant to be played, not just to be read. They are structured as short adventures designed to be gamed \u201cin real life\u201d over a few sessions. You can fit these adventures into your busy lifestyle.\nOur adventures are designed to be great adventures \u2013 and not something else. You won\u2019t find our adventures to be thinly veiled attempts to publish an appendix of \u201ccrunchy bits.\u201d Sure, we include some new material, but our primary goal is to ensure that you and your friends have fun playing the adventure. You\u2019ll walk away with great memories of your game sessions. That\u2019s our promise and that\u2019s what we deliver on.\nOur writers are battle-tested and experienced, and it shows in the content. We know that running a published adventure is different from running one of your own creation. You\u2019ll find it easy to integrate our modules into your campaigns because we know how to keep them world-neutral, stand-alone, and easy to ramp up fast.\nAll of our adventures are playtested thoroughly before publication. We believe they play as well or better than how they read. The adventures for this Kickstarter were written months ago, and were playtested long before the Kickstarter was launched. We\u2019re not \u201cracing against the Kickstarter\u201d to write the adventures. \nSample interior illustration from War-Lock\nWhat support is offered? \u201cThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d as the old saying goes. Having published adventures for the third and fourth editions of the game, we\u2019ve learned a few things. Here\u2019s what you can expect as a buyer of our 5E products:\nDownload codes in print products: All of our 5E adventures include a printed code that allows you to download a PDF edition of the module. This allows us to keep the electronic edition current, and you can receive any update seamlessly. (Note: The codes in our first two modules were unfortunately posted to an online pirate site, so future modules will feature randomized codes different in each copy. If you find the download codes from the first two modules don\u2019t work for you, please email us for assistance.)\nContinuous updates: As we learned publishing modules in the transition from 3.0 to 3.5, and the later revisions to 4E, the game can evolve in a way that makes earlier material less relevant. We will update the PDF editions of our modules to stay current (as we have already done with the PDF editions of our first two 5E modules). As a print purchaser, you have ongoing access to these PDF updates.\nMultiple printings: Our adventures have always proven quite popular, and frequently sell out. Whenever we reprint an adventure, we do another editorial pass to correct any minor typos, rules updates, or updated playtest feedback. For the first two 5E modules, you\u2019ll be receiving the second printing, which is already updated with revisions from the first printing.\nOngoing support: Have a question or comment? You can find us. Over more than a decade we have built a reputation for responsiveness to customers. And we love to game with you at cons! Last year, you could find our crew at DunDraCon, TotalCon, Coscon, GaryCon, MepaCon, ConGlomeration, North Texas RPG Convention, Origins, DexCon, KantCon, Gen Con, Tacticon, Pacificon, GrandCon, Necronomicon, Con on the Cob, Gamehole Con, TsunamiCon, U-Con, Post-Apocalypticon, and Marmalade Dog. You\u2019ll find us on the con circuit again this year. Come game with us! And if you have a local con we missed, let us know!\nOne of the maps from War-Lock (players, avert your eyes!)\nStretch Goals\nHelp us make these modules even more awesome! With sufficient funding, we intend to expand our FEF line with a bunch of new stretch goals. Here's the confirmed and still-to-be-decided stretch goals:\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! Starting at $7,000, we will expand Fifth Edition Fantasy #3: The Pillars of Pelagia with several new encounters. These encounters give the PCs more interesting places and creatures to encounter as they explore the adventure site. At $7000 and each $1000 thereafter we will add in one of the five new encounters:\nArea 2-2: The Winding Path STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 2-3: Morella\u2019s Lair STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 3-4: The Laboratory STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 4-4: The Dock STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 4-5: The Hidden Grotto STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! Starting at $12,000, we will expand Fifth Edition Fantasy #4: War-lock with additional encounters. At $12000 and each $1000 thereafter we will add in new material as follows:\nApproximately 10 short random wilderness encounters in the hex-crawl through the badlands STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! ENCOUNTERS ADDED!\nTwo additional monster lairs in the final series of encounters STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! MONSTER LAIRS ADDED!\nA full map and description for the Rusted Gorgon Inn STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! THE INN IS ADDED!\nA mini-gazetteer of the badlands hex-crawl with new locations, lairs, mini-dungeons, outlaw hideouts, and other such things. STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! THE MINI GAZETTEER IS ADDED!\nTHIRD STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! At $15,000, we are adding Fifth Edition Fantasy #5: Into The Dragon\u2019s Maw! This entirely new adventure will be added for Free RPG Day release nationwide. All backers will receive a free PDF, with an option to add on the print edition for +$10. (It\u2019s free on Free RPG Day if you live near a participating store, of course!)\nFOURTH STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! All 7 handouts added! At $18,000, we are adding additional player handouts to Fifth Edition Fantasy #3: Pillars of Pelagia \u2013 up to 7 handouts depending on funding level.  Longtime D&D fans surely remember the classic book of handouts from Tomb of Horrors. Something like that is our goal here.\nAnd for every 50 backers, we are adding a free drop-in encounter! Drop-in encounters were a clear \u201cfavorite\u201d in our unofficial survey, right up there behind adventures. For every 50 backers, we\u2019ll publish a new drop-in encounter useful for any 5E campaign: encounters while traveling on a road, while camping, while at an inn, while in a castle, while exploring the underdark, etc. All backers will receive a PDF copy of this new product, Fifth Edition Fantasy: Fantastic Encounters! (tentative title, may change) \nAs we update this on May 23, we have 574 backers, so the Fantastic Encounters product will include at least 11 new encounters. And that number will grow as we add more backers.\nAnd what's past that? Let's see how the Kickstarter does - and see what other cool ideas you have for adding to it! It certainly seems reasonable to add on a print edition of Fifth Edition Fantasy: Fantastic Encounters...\nShipping & Handling\nFor US customers, shipping and handling is a flat $5 whether you order one module or all four. \nFor international customers, shipping and handling charges will be invoiced at the end of the Kickstarter. International postage can vary widely, and this process allows us to give you the best price for your order. We will invoice the orders via Paypal when items are ready to ship. Here are estimated shipping costs, depending on number of items ordered: Canada $10-$14; Europe, Australia, and rest of world: $13-$20\nFifth Edition Fantasy is here, and this is your chance to be part of it from the beginning. We appreciate your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has published more than 200 games over the last decade, and fulfilled a half-dozen Kickstarters over the last year. We see the biggest risk as being the possibility that we keep adding more awesome content to the books, which may delay their delivery past the original promised date.

While many locations on the map are familiar from old Necromancer Games titles and more recent Frog God Games products, the map itself did little to tell the story of this region and even less to answer questions that it raised: Who rules beyond the Gaelon River? What hazards and ruins await south of the well-known dungeons of Rappan Athuk and Barakus? And, what has led to this land becoming known as the Sundered Kingdoms?\nAs part of the ongoing strategy of Frog God Games to take older and hard-to-find Necromancer Games products and update them not only to new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords & Wizardry Complete rules but also to incorporate them into the Lost Lands setting as a way to introduce them to fans old and new alike, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms takes three classic Necromancer Games adventures: Patrick Lawinger\u2019s Morrick Mansion, Casey W. Christofferson\u2019s Aberrations, and Dave Brohman\u2019s Crystal Skull and integrates them into a continuous plot for an adventure path that takes PCs from level 3 to 15+, perfect for the party that has finished exploring the dungeons beneath Barakus and is looking for the next road to adventure.\nBut Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms is much more than just an update of those three previously published adventures. To the adventure path it adds three new original adventures written by Greg A. Vaughan called The Beast Within, Shades of Yellow, and Vengeance in the Hollow Hills that both tie in with the three older adventures and also move the plot from one to the next to create the continuity of the adventure path. While you could play any or all of the six adventures as standalone sessions, you can also use them as a single contiguous campaign to explore a large region of the Lost Lands.\nThe First Lost Lands Gazetteer\nIn addition to the updated and expanded adventure path, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms includes a campaign guide that expands upon the regional map of the Sinnar Coast. The central portion of that regional map is called the District of Sunderland, known more colloquially as the Sundered Kingdoms. Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms includes a full-color poster map that focuses on the Sundered Kingdoms from Endhome in the north to the southern extent of the Duchy of Southvale in the south, from Grollek\u2019s Grove in the west to the farthest reaches of Ramthion Island in the east. The adventure path takes players from one end to the other with many a stop in between, but the included gazetteer details the dozens of nations, cities, wilderness areas, ethnicities, and geographic features of note within the area as well. It also provides a regional history including more global events of the Lost Lands that had a direct bearing on the area, giving the first sneak peak at the Lost Lands bigger picture hinted at and referenced throughout more than 15 years of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games products alike. This detailed history and timeline extends back more than 3,000, years telling the history of not only a significant portion of the Lost Lands but also the unknown back stories to classic Necromancer Games products.\nFinally the Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms campaign guide also includes a chapter dedicated to the 13 insidious cults that are endemic to the Sundered Kingdoms region and are, perhaps, the true reason for its centuries of strife. This guide includes not only a write up of some of the most iconic and some not-so-well-known evil powers of the Lost Lands (yes, Orcus and Tsathogga are both there\u2026along with 11 others) but also provides details of their individual cults, where they are located, and how they operate in and affect the Sundered Kingdoms as well as the rest of the Lost Lands.\nOld School Bonus!\nAnd as one more bonus for those old-time Necromancer Games fans (and new Frog God Games fans!) who followed all the releases in order to maintain a complete collection \u2014 even the hard-to-find stuff \u2014 we\u2019ve got something you\u2019ve never seen before. When Crystal Skull was first published back in 2005, a secret level was written as bonus material but was never released. We\u2019ve dug back through the Necromancer Games archives and uncovered this gem; we\u2019ve dusted it off, updated its rules, and incorporated it into the book so that it now serves as the climax of the entire adventure path! Now on the 10th anniversary of its original release, you can experience Crystal Skull as Orcus originally intended but with the bonus of it serving to cap off an entire campaign incorporating three classic Necromancer Games adventures, three brand new adventures, and a whole host of Lost Lands legends, lore, and deepest, darkest secrets.\nBe the master of your Lost Lands campaign; buy The Lost Lands: Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms and remind your players that there\u2019s more to fear in the Lost Lands than just the dungeons.\nVideo Review\nShipping Costs\nShipping costs for United States customers is included in the price of your pledge.

Each of the short fiction pieces in these Tales of the Lost Lands looks at some character or location specifically located within the Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms book to give the story behind the adventure. As a GM you can use them as plot hooks to bring in your PCs, as snapshots of the campaign to pique the interest of your players, or as seeds for your imagination as you develop your own campaign within the Lost Lands. Each piece begins with a GM Notes section that will tell how spoilery the story is so you\u2019ll know if you want your players to be able to read it or not before the campaign is underway.\nTales Pack 1 unlocked with this stretch goal brings you the pdfs of the first three of the six Lost Lands tales to be told with this Kickstarter absolutely free with your existing pledge. Don\u2019t miss out on these unique first looks at the hidden tales of the Lost Lands.\n$40,000 (UNLOCKED!)

Written as a travelogue of sorts, let your players see what it is like to brave the lonely roads and sudden violence of the oft-troubled Sundered Kingdoms in a spoiler-free format. Perfect for your players if you\u2019re about to start your first Lost Lands campaign or perhaps look southward after finishing a successful Barakus campaign. Much like the player\u2019s guide released with the Barakus Kickstarter, this player\u2019s guide can be an indispensable asset for your campaign.

It is a realm of dark chaos \u2013 for these creatures of the echoing deeps count each other as rivals and enemies. It is a place without peace, a place without virtues, a place where every countenance of evil is to be found in sluggish torpor, stirring restlessly in dreams of cruelty and hatred. These dark and deadly provinces are known as the Under Realms. \nMost named regions in the Under Realms are quite distinct from each other, whether by geological formation or by the types of inhabitants that have established themselves in strategically important areas. Characters who enter this area expecting to find drowic elves, deep gnomes, and other \u201cnormal\u201d features of the Under Realms will swiftly discover the error of their thinking. The Vaults of the Sunless Sea, located to the north of the Cyclopean Deeps, might fit that description, but the Cyclopean Deeps are a different and decidedly more unpleasant area into which the denizens of the Vaults seldom venture.\nThis series of adventures forms a mini-campaign in the depths of the earth, for higher-level characters. Normally $34.99, get it now through this Kickstarter for only $25!\n$12 - Cyclopean Deeps 1 PDF (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry)\n$35 - Cyclopean Deeps 2 Hardcover + PDF (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry) - The Under Realms below the Lost Lands! Book 2 of the epic \u201csandbox\u201d region started in Cyclopean Deeps volume 1. This series of adventures, by ENnie-award-winning author Matt Finch, continues and completes the Cyclopean Deeps mini-campaign set in the deep and deadly Under Realms below Rappan Athuk. This is the first opportunity to get a copy of this book unless you ordered one in the Rappan Athuk Kickstarter!\n$17 - Cyclopean Deeps 2 PDF (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry)\n$55 - Cyclopean Deeps 1&2 Hardcovers + PDFs (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry) - Haven't had a chance to pick up either of the Cyclopean Deeps volumes? Why spend $70 to get both of them after this Kickstarter is over? With this special offer get them both now for only $55.\n$25 - Cyclopean Deeps 1&2 PDFs (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry)\n$8 - Poster Map of Sinnar Coast Region print edition + PDF - This is the one that was first available with the Lost City of Barakus Kickstarter and includes the area of the Sundered Kingdoms as well. Normally available for $9.99, get it now for only $8. Don't miss the first big peek at the Lost Lands campaign setting that was ever published.\n$34.50 - Vellum Map of Sinnar Coast Region + PDF - Bill has gone mad! He took our full-color poster map of the Sinnar Coast region and had it printed full-size on sheepskin. Was it a mistake? Has he lost his mind? Are all those years of eating mad cow infected cheeseburgers finally catching up with him? Your guess is as good as ours. Available after the Kickstarter (if there are any left!) for $40, you can get yours now at the discounted price of $34.50. Note: this item is not edible nor is it intended for prophylaxis. Use the vellum master map of the Sinnar Coast region at your own risk, because it might just make you think you're Alexander the Great, or Hannibal, or Genghis Khan, or...some other guy who might have a big vellum map of some place... (Map is shipped separately first class rolled up in a cardboard tube for maximum protection. Postage will be charged separately.) \n$55 - Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms Hardcover + PDF (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry)\n$25 - Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms PDF (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry)\n$245 - Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms Leather cover + PDF (Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur only foreseeable risk is if our production facility gets backlogged. Our printer is a large producer of college text books and yearbooks, so depending on the time of year they can have a suddenly busy production schedule. We have been using them for our big books for the last 5 years, and they have always been reliable, but if our order gets caught in a text or yearbook crush it can cause delays in the printing. This has not been a problem to date but is always a remote possibility, and we wanted to be transparent with you about it.\n\nLess likely risks include but are not necessarily limited to: (1) one or more asteroid(s) making violent contact with the planetary crust, and causing a dust cloud blanketing out the sun; (2) a direct meteor strike on a Kickstarter-related production facility, including but not limited to computers, power stations required therefor, alien overlords thereof, and other potential but unknown un-, sub-, or supernatural forces required for the operation of Kickstarter, Amazon, their controlling entities, the controlling entities, thereof, and ultimately the Illuminati or the Knights Templar, as applicable; (3) invasions or incursions in force by cannibalistic humanoids and/or morlocks traveling in time, leading to disruptions in urban transportation, offloading, and/or dispatching operations; (4) printing operations initially tasked to the Kickstarter\u2019s fulfillment being diverted to production of bodice-ripping romance novels, teen vampire romances, or refrigerator user manuals; (5) various individuals up and down the production chain being struck individually, sequentially, severally, or simultaneously by train(s) and/or other such devices; (6) no members of the company have admitted to being in a tontine, so there\u2019s that; (7) disappearance in Amazon rainforests by employees, subcontractors, or freelancers of Wizards of the Coast LLC, whether or not related to those rumors concerning dinosaur rodeos and actual owlbear experiments; (8) Ebola goes aerosol: kiss it all goodbye, people; (9) rust monsters loose in the metal; (10) tectonic shifts; (11) Greenwood captured by fans for extended bacchanal; (12) time-travel paradoxes instigated by third parties; (13) the wrong butterfly flaps its wings in the wrong damn place.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Bard's Gate Kickstarter", "update_content": "Some folks haven't heard about our latest Kickstarter so check out the project page and share it everywhere! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/froggodgames/the-lost-lands-bards-gate-for-5e-pathfinder-and-sa"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "The Borderland Provinces Has Launched!", "update_content": "Please share this project with the world!\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/froggodgames/the-lost-lands-borderland-provinces"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "PDF Downloads", "update_content": "Hi All,\nWe've had a lot of people missing files and I wanted to make sure everyone gets their rewards.

It has adventuring material, fiction and other sundries. All these will be fleshed out and expanded. To give you a taste, here is the tale of the Haunted Valley.\n19K Behind the Curtain\nStephen Chenault pulls back the curtain from way back in 2001 and relates the store of how the contracts with Gary Gygax, Ernie and Luke Gygax, Aihrde, the Canting Crew and Gaxmoor all came tumbling together!\n18K Luke Gygax\nLong long ago, when the Lost City was first explored there were many teasers about the Undercaverns. But no one knew exactly what. But in conversations with Luke, it seems he's a bit anxious to explore them....his adventure, assuming we hit the 18k goal, will be a nice intro piece to what lies beneath the Lost City of Gaxmoor!\nHelp us take a peek into what lies beneath....\nBEER MUG STRETCH!\nWhat would an Ernie and Luke Gygax game be without a beer mug!!

Now begins an ever greater treatment of Gaxmoor. We'll select three of the more prominent Areas in Gaxmoor and create Isometric maps for them. These maps, rendered by Del Teigeler will include room contents as well, making the CK's job all the easier. Also, we'll incorporate Jake Parker and Sean King's ideas, allowing for plenty of room for CK notes. The below sample is what we have in mind: \nNEXT GOAL 11K\nWe've hit the hard cover. We've hit the 18 x 22 inch map sewn in the book. We've hit the additional intro adventure. Now we are up against the Map Book! Your going to want this. With a separate book the CK/GM can access maps far easier and use them as displays during game play. And, it puts us one step closer to the Isometric Map of Gaxmoor!\nThough all these maps are slated to be redone, this is a sample map form the original Gaxmoor and the treatment Peter Bradley is giving it:\nABOUT GAXMOOR\nFifteen years ago Troll Lord Games -- fresh in the RPG market -- joined with Ernest Gary Gygax Jr. and his brother Luke Gygax, to bring to life their amazing city, The Lost City of Gaxmoor. The city, caught up in the ruins of time and under the heels of chaos, proved an instant hit and helped place TLG firmly in the RPG market.\nGoing out of print when TLG moved away from d20, the Lost City returned to the brothers Gygax, where it sat in quiet retirement, leaving only the memories of many blood-soaked adventure hours.\nBut now, after many years, the Lost City returns to the Troll Dens! This time, under the Castles & Crusades banner!\nThe Lost City unleashes all the wild imaginings of the brothers Gygax, bringing them to your gaming table! A seamless blend of the old world's iron grinding action and the Siege Engine, Gaxmoor promises an epic montage of wreck and ruin.\nIntroduction by Frank Mentzer!\nFUNDING GOALS: The Lost City of Gaxmoor is a 120 page book, scheduled to release as a softcover book with the sprawling city map divided up into 8.5 x 11 sheets and set within the book. But it needs a far better treatment.  TLG's goals with this are to bring it out in hardcover format and to release the city map in a full color, 18 x 22 inch poster. Our basic goal is to hit a hardcover book, but the stretch rewards will build the project into so much more!\nJoin us! Join the Fray! Bring The Lost City of Gaxmoor back to the gaming table in all the glory the wealth of its adventure deserves!\nEARLY BIRD: THE EARLY BIRD OPTION IS CLOSED. The first 187 backers have locked in the EARLY BIRD. Trollzah! All early bird backers receive a soft cover edition of the Lost City of Gaxmoor. You must back the 25.00 pledge level or above. This copy ships with your kickstarter package unless you are at GARY CON VII. All Early Bird backers receive a digital copy at Kickstarter close.\nNOTE ON PLEDGE LEVELS, ADD ONS and STRETCH REWARDS: In previous Kickstarters, we've counted a pledger's add ons toward their total Pledge Level. So if you pledge 25.00 and bought 25.00 dollars in Add Ons, we counted your over all Pledge as a 50 Pledge Level. If this edged you toward the next pledge level, you earned the Stretch Rewards from that higher level. Sadly, this policy, as cool as it is, has wreaked havoc in the Dens. It's caused payment confusion, mis-shipped orders, delayed orders and overall frustration from the pledger and hair pulling frustration from the shipping department here. So with that in mind, we are, sadly, going to place the emphasis on your pledge level. If you pledge at Pledge Level X, we will only ship the Stretch Rewards applied to that Pledge Level. If you want the next Pledge Level's Stretch Rewards, bumping up your Pledge Level is easy enough. The add on list will be included in the Kickstarter, but only as an add on.

In order to do this, we must find a printer with the knowledge and capabilities to execute a book of this size and have it look polished and professional, something we take great pride in. This will cost more than usual printing so Kickstarter becomes essential in raising enough capital to give this book the quality it demands and deserves.\n\nWe are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to the world not only as a great resource, but also as a great looking book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "If you liked Gaxmoor...", "update_content": "Greetings from the Dens!\nWe are entering our final few days for the M&T Kickstarter!

How can you bring the catacombs beneath your castle to life as well as in your players\u2019 minds?  Sure \u2013 you could spend hundreds or perhaps thousands of dollars on 3D models or costly digital tools, but in the end - all you really need is a simple way in which to convey your vision to the players.  How can you solve this dilemma on a limited budget?\nEnter the poor man\u2019s version of a 3D sandbox known as MCEdit; a free world editor for Minecraft\u2122.  Using MCEdit, you can reproduce your 2D tabletop map into the stunning 3D visuals you conjured up in your head.  From using simple screenshots as visual reference, to running an entire campaign - the choice is yours for how immerse you use this tool to enhance the play experience of your group.\nThe tutorials include easy-to-follow instructions to build structures one row of blocks at a time as well as a completed 3D model compatible with MCEdit.\nIf successfully funded, I will use any additional funding to produce even more tutorials, as well as giving anyone who pledges $20 or more great stretch goal rewards to say thank you!\nWith your help, anything is possible.

It tells the story of the sorcerer Xon, who was banished by the other members of his order when his ambition and power became too great. Centuries later, he has returned from exile and is looking to reclaim the underground fortresses and dungeons he constructed long ago. However, many of his strongholds have been overrun by creatures of the wild or taken over by power-seeking factions. With only a fraction of his former power intact, Xon needs help.\n\nThis Kickstarter presents \"The Crucible\", a module where Xon puts several teams of adventurers to the test to find a party worthy enough to aid him. Whether his purposes are for good or for ill remains to be seen; The Lost Dungeons of Xon is an evolving story where the motivations of the heroes and villains are shaped by the choices and actions of the players. Nothing is as it seems. An NPC slated to be a villain could end up being a hero instead.\n\nWhat systems will the module support?\n\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon features full support for three popular roleplaying systems:\nPathfinder\n5th Edition\nOld School 1st Edition\nEach system will be supported with its own PDF, which will include both system-specific stats as well as guidelines in the text. For example, only the 5th Edition PDF will reference rules such as Advantage, while the Old School version will be geared more toward combat and non-skill-based problem-solving.\nIn what format will the module be available?\nBecause our module is designed specifically to leverage the capabilities of e-publishing, it will only be available in interactive PDF format. This PDF will have many advanced features, including:\nLandscape format for optimized use on laptops and tablets\nEasy navigation to \"pop-up\" stat blocks by clicking on an NPC or monster\u2019s name\nQuick links from the dungeon map to room and encounter descriptions\nHyperlinks to external spell and monster stats\nProfessionally-narrated embedded audio\nPassword-unlockable player content\nWhat makes The Lost Dungeons of Xon different from other modules? \n\nAll of the dungeons presented in the series are what we call pre-build friendly; the heroes will know the layout of the dungeon in advance. But even with some of Xon's secrets at their disposal, new surprises await them. For the dungeon master, this allows you to present the layout of the dungeon to the players right from the start of the session without spoiling the module.    \nThe Lost Dungeons are designed specifically to make use of two very successful Kickstarter campaigns: Dwarven Forge's Game Tiles and Reaper's Bones Miniatures. If you own either or both of these accessories, the module provides you with specific guidelines on which tiles and/or miniatures to use, including video tutorials showing you precisely how to set up the dungeon. If you don't own them, the PDF will also include printable maps and character stand-ups.\nInstead of commissioning traditional fantasy artwork, our modules feature high-resolution photography of professionally-painted miniatures and three-dimensional dungeons for a unique look and feel.\nWhy is the campaign running for 60 days?\n\nThe main reason we\u2019re Kickstarting the first Lost Dungeons module is to build a community. How many backers we get will determine whether or not we\u2019re able to continue the series with additional modules. The more backers, the better the chances of a successful follow-up.\n\nIf you want to see The Lost Dungeons of Xon succeed beyond just this initial campaign, help us put the word out. Post on roleplaying forums and Reddit. Share a link to our Kickstarter on Twitter and Facebook. If you have a podcast you enjoy, let them know about our campaign. The more people we can spread the word to, the more likely we\u2019ll be able to produce additional modules. With sixty days, we hope to give everyone who's interested the opportunity to jump on board.\n\nWhat do I get for my pledge?\nThis Kickstarter is for \u201cThe Crucible\u201d, the first module in what we plan to be an extended series of modules. The Crucible is a 25-page standalone module for 4 to 6 first-level characters, designed to be run during a single 3- to 4-hour game session.\nFor as little as $1, you\u2019ll receive the entire Crucible module in the supported game system of your choice, along with a companion Digital Player\u2019s Guide that includes background information, maps and clues for the players.\nIf you pledge at the $5 Adventurer level, you\u2019ll also receive extended character write-ups for the more prominent NPC\u2019s in the game, with enough information and stats to use them in other games if you desire.\nAt the $10 Storyteller of Valoria level, you'll get everything from the Adventurer level plus an additional full-length module set in Dwarven Forge's original setting, the City of Valoria. \n* BEST DEAL * At the $20 Completionist level, you will also receive a special side quest \"Moving Dungeon\" module exclusive to this Kickstarter, as well as PDFs in all three formats. You'll also get every unlocked stretch goal and add-on, including the Valoria module, at no extra cost! That's an over $50 retail value for a pledge of just $20. What's more, if you back any of our future projects, you'll get  a special bonus.\nWe've also got the $30 Citizen of Therigard pledge level that lets you name an NPC (in addition to everything in the Completionist level) and the ultimate pledge of $100, which gets you entrance into the Burning Yeti Inner Circle, where you can get directly involved with the development and testing of our content.\n*City of Valoria is created and copyrighted by Dwarven Forge, LLC\nUnless noted otheriwse, unlocked stretch goals will be available to anyone who backs at the $5 level or higher.\nStretch Goals\nUNLOCKED! The Barroom Brawl supplement will be free to all Adventurer-level backers or higher. It will offer a plethora of options (yes, we said plethora) to flesh out and expand an optional encounter in The Crucible, or it can be used separately from the module, to add spice to any game.\nUNLOCKED! All backers at the Adventurer-level and higher will receive Pre-generated player characters to go with the supported system of your choice. These PCs will be a fully-fleshed out and diverse crew of characters, ready to drop into The Lost Dungeons of Xon or any other game.\n*Wilds of Therigard addon is included free with $20 Completionist-level pledge\nUNLOCKED! The Wilds of Therigard will detail the region around the town and the dungeon where the module takes place.

This add-on will be available to all Adventurer-level backers for an additional $5, or FREE to all Completionist-level backers. \nAnd as a special bonus... We'll give Therigard the full three-dimensional treatment, building out the town using pieces from Dwarven Forge's City Builder tiles.\nUNLOCKED! We're developing a web-based, interactive version of The Crucible that lets you go through the entire module from start to finish. You'll face many of the same decisions you'll ultimately be presenting to your players. What better way to prepare for a module than to have a chance to play it yourself?\nUNLOCKED! We'll add more professional audio to the module in the form of embedded sound effects and ambient backgrounds and music. This upgrade will be FREE to all backers!\nUNLOCKED! Now that we've reached 500 backers, we'll give our Adventurer's Guide to Therigard add-on the full City Builder treatment, including photos of the constructed town and instructional videos on how to put together each of the buildings in the town using City Builder pieces.\nUNLOCKED! Grubfinkel's Map Guide, a series of encounter ideas for use in any campaign setting (system neutral). These assorted underground locales will be built out with Dwarven Forge tiles (but also useable without them). Each map will have notes from the veteran spelunker, Grubfinkel, to give you ideas to build out a full encounter. And for every additional 50 backers we get, from now through the end of the campaign, we'll add another encounter idea!\n*Available to Valoria-level and Completionist-level backers\n UNLOCKED! We're pleased to announce that we will be working in conjunction with the folks over at Dwarven Forge to develop a special module set in their original setting, the City of Valoria. This module will be of a similar scope and length to the main module in our campaign, and in addition to all our interactive bells and whistles, it will feature tiles from Dwarven Forge's City Builder campaign. Like The Crucible, this module will be available for 1st Edition, 5th Edition and Pathfinder.\nUNLOCKED! Now that we've reached the big $10k, we'll add quality fantasy artwork to supplement our photography.\nUNLOCKED! We're going to add more professionally narrated audio to The Crucible and to our interactive walkthroughs. More room descriptions, more dialogue, more tone-setting awesomeness.\nUNLOCKED! We'll enhance the Interactive GM Walkthrough with enough features to turn it into a \"Playthrough.\" We'll add more character class options and stats. And while the mechanics won't be system specific, there will be d20-based skill checks and combat rolls. All of these enhancements will improve the interactive experience and increase re-playability.\nUNLOCKED! We'll build the Therigard Almanac, an interactive online repository of all the people, places and things you might run across in The Lost Dungeons modules and all companion setting materials. This will be a wiki-style setup that will be a handy reference for GM's, and players will also be able to use it keep track of their own notes and encounters.\nWhat is Burning Yeti Studios?\nBurning Yeti Studios is a group of highly experienced gamers and creative professionals with a proven record in the gaming and publishing industries.\nJeff Hannes previously worked as Senior Editor for InQuest Gamer magazine and has written material for Iron Crown Enterprises and Wizards of the Coast. \nMichael Searle is Burning Yeti's graphic designer. He was Executive Editor of InQuest Gamer and has written over 50 published strategy guides for video games.\nDave Breen is the owner of GameKnight Products, Inc. and has launched three successful Kickstarter campaigns selling custom chips designed specifically for gamers. \nJoel Lytle is a former owner of the All About Games! retail store.\nNo Surprises Section\nWhile we will endeavor to ensure that all the features of our interactive PDFs work on as many platforms as possible, it\u2019s still a relatively recent technology. We do extensive testing, but we can\u2019t always account for certain versions of software and operating systems. To fully utilize the features of the PDFs, you may have to download a new version of Adobe Reader to your laptop, desktop or tablet, or install the latest system updates for your device.\nDue to the interactive nature of the PDF, the GM should plan to have a computer or tablet on hand to run the module. If the players have technology as well, their experience can be enhanced by using the Digital Player's Guides, but they are not required. All the information in the player's guides will also be available as printable content.\nAlso, note that embedded audio will not work on most tablet PDF Readers, but the PDF will contain clickable links to play the audio off of our website, and all narration audio files will be available as mp3 downloads.

Fortunately, we\u2019ve already put a great deal of effort into \"The Crucible\", and the module itself is nearly complete.\n\nThe remaining materials (including bonus materials and stretch goals) will need to be completed, designed and, most importantly, play-tested. While we\u2019ve allotted an appropriate amount of time for play-testing in our production schedule, there is always the possibility that player feedback could necessitate changes.

We have closed out all 13 stretch goals. (Wow, that's an unlucky number! I guess it's appropriate for Grimtooth.) Thanks to everyone for their support on this wild ride. It's been a great experience and we can't wait until you see Grimtooth's Ultimate Traps Collection printed in all its glory. And with that, we officially close this Kickstarter!\nAll right humans, this is your chance to own the 460-page hardcover compilation of all five of my systems-neutral Grimtooth\u2019s Traps books \u2013 plus loads of extras! We\u2019re talking 500+ traps and maybe me making a guest appearance in a Dungeon Crawl Classics crossover module. I\u2019m Grimtooth the Troll, and I\u2019ll be your guide on this Kickstarter tour, so gird your loins, get your dice and let me tell you a tale\u2026\nThis is what the humans at Goodman Games say you need to know about this Kickstarter event: \nPublished by Goodman Games under license from Flying Buffalo (and with my permission), this 460-page hardcover collects of all five of MY Traps books, including the original eponymous 1981 edition as well as Traps Too, Traps Fore, Traps Ate, and Traps Lite. Every trap from the original five Grimtooth\u2019s books is included \u2013 there are no exclusions!\nThis massive tome is systems-neutral, containing more than 500 traps suitable for all fantasy systems and games. You have never had so many trap options before \u2013 use them well\u2026\nMy book will be available to you mortals in multiple formats: a basic softcover for table play, a durable hardcover for longer shelf life, and a gold foil edition for the serious collector (available in both faux and real leather, and with a slipcase).\nThe book is also available in PDF edition. All print backers will also receive a copy of the PDF edition.\nFace it \u2013 this is a homage to a VERY important piece of gaming history. (Mine!) The book features a foreword by noted dungeon designer Harley Stroh, and also includes an extensive interview with the original creative team, a cover gallery showcasing 30 years of editions (in both English and many foreign languages), and a look behind the mysterious submission process \u2013 including my legendary \u201cGrimtooth\u2019s Submissions Box\u201d that sits majestically on a shelf in the Flying Buffalo offices.\nAnd I have created more than a dozen new traps specifically for this volume. For the first time in a decade, the Grimtooth\u2019s submissions box has been cracked opened again, and more great entries have poured out to an unsuspecting world!\nPlus the humans at Goodman Games are giving you the possibility of several exciting stretch goals to make this epic project even more impressive: printed endsheets, a satin ribbon bookmark, the cover gallery in full color, a custom dust jacket for KS backers, and a gatefold page featuring the Grimtooth board game that was first mentioned more than 20 years ago!\nAnd if you\u2019re really lucky we might do a cross-over with the Dungeon Crawl Classics line, allowing me (Grimtooth) to make an appearance in a special DCC module produced just for this Kickstarter!\nAnd to wrap it all up, primary Grimtooth illustrator Steve Crompton has dug through his archives to find original art from the earliest books. This original art is available as part of the deluxe book pledge levels!\nListen bub, here\u2019s the bottom line - Grimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps Collection: A gigantic collection of over 500 awesome engines of destruction, delver dicers, character crushers, adventurer anxieties, minion munchers, hero harangers, general tricks, traps and other rare and dangerous items for use in defending game master treasures! You want it and you need it.  And if you don\u2019t order one, I\u2019ll have to hunt you down!\nNow as hard as this is to believe, there may be a few of you out there living in a shack in the middle of Mohave Desert, that haven\u2019t actually seen one of my original Traps books. If you are one of those unenlightened souls, read the paragraph that follows. (The rest of you can click that button over on the right and get your pledge in.)\nWhat is Grimtooth\u2019s Traps? Originally published by Flying Buffalo, Grimtooth\u2019s Traps is one of the most popular RPG accessories ever produced, with more than 250,000 copies in print since 1981. There have been a total of seven Grimtooth\u2019s books produced, and all of them are usable with any RPG. Five of the seven volumes were traps-focused, and for the first time ever, these magnificent engines of player-character destruction are collected in an officially-licensed hardback collector\u2019s volume suitable for both presentation and play. If you play any fantasy role playing game, of any edition, this collection will challenge your players in ways they will never see coming! (All right, you got it now?  Let\u2019s move on\u2026)\nOK, so what\u2019s in my new book? Grimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps Collection contains the following:\nExact reproductions of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps, Traps Too, Traps Fore, Traps Ate, and Traps Lite. These five books are scanned from the recent printed editions and collected together in one volume. Collectively these comprise 400+ pages and more than 500 traps.\nA foreword by dungeon designer Harley Stroh, author of dozens of Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures.\nAn interview with the original Grimtooth\u2019s design team of Steve Crompton, Rick Loomis, Paul Ryan O\u2019Connor, and Bear Peters, conducted by Jim Wampler. Learn the perspective of the original creators as to why this book was such a milestone when it came on to the scene as the first book of traps in the industry\u2019s history, and one of the very first RPG supplements to be written \u201cin-character.\u201d Oh\u2026and of course they interviewed me as well.  After all, I am the most important thing about these books.\nA look at the submissions process. For more than three decades, a dusty box atop Rick Loomis\u2019 file cabinet in the Flying Buffalo headquarters has housed the flood of traps submissions. As longtime fans know, many of the original Grimtooth traps were submitted by the general public. This mysterious box is finally documented in photographic form, and several traps that started as fan submissions are shown in their original \u201cfan letter\u201d submission form prior to publication. Then the submissions box is opened up and, for the first time since the late 1990\u2019s, the contents are reviewed and fan-submitted traps are selected for publication! Which leads to\u2026\n\u2026New traps! A bonus traps chapter includes a selection of new, never-before-seen, recently-discovered tragic tricks, devious devices, fearsome foes, complicated calamities and sneaky scenarios from the one and only Grimtooth! (That\u2019s me!) These are collected from fan submissions, as well as new contributions by veteran Grimtooth collaborators, including Ken St. Andre, creator of Tunnels & Trolls.\nThe Grimtooth\u2019s Traps board game. It's a silly idea based on the Candyland concept, and a fun warm-up game while you\u2019re waiting for your RPG group to show up. Originally a seed idea in a 1990\u2019s Grimtooth brainstorming session, this design is now finally fleshed out. With sufficient funding the board game will be presented as a gatefold page so you can actually fold out the board and play Grimtooth\u2019s Game of Traps from the book!\nCover art gallery. Did you know my Grimtooth\u2019s Traps has been translated into French, German, and even Swedish? And the original Traps has been through seven slightly different editions, with a number of cover variations? With sufficient funding, this cover gallery will be presented in full color!\nAnd other behind-the-scenes ephemera. A variety of rare art (including the first publication ever of the Jeff Dee line art used for the cover of Traps Too), a complete index of all five traps volumes, an accounting of every Grimtooth\u2019s print run, and more fun things to better acquaint us all with the history of the Grimtooth family.\nLet me show you what you\u2019re getting here, chum\u2026 Here are three PDF previews of the book:\nThe first 10 trap pages of the original Grimtooth\u2019s Traps.The book that started it all!\nBehind the scenes: An excerpt from the interview with the original creators.\nThe making of a trap: As we uncover the mysterious box of submissions for Grimtooth\u2019s Traps, we also include some examples of fan letters and how they were answered by me (and in some cases, turned into published material). Here\u2019s an excerpt.\nThe book is 460 pages long \u2013 so that ought to be plenty, even for you greedy humans.\nBy the way, this book is done and ready to be printed! My slaves have already completed this great project.  The content for the book is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. What remains is the printing, and that\u2019s where you humans come in. My associates at Goodman Games have set the funding goal to print in hardcover with Smythe-sewn binding. This is a durable process where the spine is actually sewn to the pages, not just glued as with many RPG products. (There\u2019s nothing like sewing a spine into your book!) This binding will last for decades of use. With sufficient funding we can offer a variety of formats, as well as the specialized production values outlined as stretch goals below!\nAdd-On Copies of the Dungeon Crawl Classics / Grimtooth Crossover: Based on the stretch goals achieved so far, we will be creating a Dungeon Crawl Classics module featuring Grimtooth. This will be given in PDF form to all backers. If you would like a print version, add $10 to your pledge! \nTell me about the stretch goals (I love that term\u2026): Certainly! A 460-page hardcover book of my peerless prose and ingenious designs is impressive on its own. But in addition, we\u2019d like to include these features (assuming enough of you bribe us sufficiently):\nAt $23,000, printed endsheets. FUNDED! The endsheets are the 11\u201dx17\u201d pages that are on the inside board of a hardcover. We\u2019d like to print these with scenes of Grimtooth, Grimtina, and their nefarious deeds. (An extra picture of me and Grimtina?  This is a must-have!)\nAt $27,000, a gatefold page with Grimtooth\u2019s Game of Traps. FUNDED! The Grimtooth\u2019s board game requires an 11\u201dx17\u201d page to properly display. At this funding level we will include a fold-out page (a gatefold) in the hardcover so you can read about the board game, then fold out the next page to actually play it!\nGrimtooth's Game of Traps!\nAt $32,000, color cover gallery: FUNDED! The 8-page cover gallery in the hardcover will be printed in full color, allowing a better representation of the history of Grimtooth\u2019s covers in both English and a variety of other languages. (See Traps history in full, bloody color!)\nMore than 30 years of covers, in a variety of languages!\nAt $38,000, a satin ribbon bookmark bound into the hardcover spine: FUNDED! Because with 500+ traps, sometimes you need to save your place. (My sister Grimtina insisted on this idea, so here it is.) Maybe we'll even throw in two bookmarks. Because with 500+ traps, sometimes you need to remember where two traps are! (And my sister likes satin.)\nAt $45,000, a Grimtooth art print: FUNDED! Who says trolls can't be attractive? Decorate your gamer den with this 8.5\"x11\" fine print of a classic Grimtooth trap image, which will arrive tucked inside the cover of the hardcover.\nAt $53,000, a Kickstarter-exclusive retro dust jacket: FUNDED! At this level, all hardcovers fulfilled as part of the Kickstarter will be wrapped in a dust jacket with a retro design that resembles the very first printing of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps \u2013 the original \u201cgray cover\u201d edition, with blue line art on a gray background. (Use it to protect this precious tome!)\nThe original Grimtooth's Traps cover -- inspiration for our retro dust jacket goal!\nAt $62,000, a Dungeon Crawl Classics module featuring Grimtooth: FUNDED! It\u2019s the collaboration you\u2019ve always wanted: a dungeon crawl into Grimtooth\u2019s own domain. Co-written by Dungeon Crawl Classics author Jobe Bittman and primary Grimtooth illustrator Steve Crompton, this DCC module will be produced \u201cin the DCC style\u201d and distributed in PDF form to all hardcover backers at this funding level.  (Don\u2019t worry, though. I\u2019ll be throwing in my suggestions and stellar commentary as well.)\nAt $98,000, a color poster of Grimtina included in the book. FUNDED! As announced by Grimtina herself in her recent surprise update!\nAt $100,000, we will expand the PDF edition of Grimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps (which all backers already receive) to also include Traps Bazaar and Dungeon of Doom. FUNDED! There is a considerable amount of back-end scanning and cleanup work involved in getting this material ready, and we\u2019ll get started on that work the moment we pass $100k.\nAt $110,000, we will insert an 11\u201dx17\u201d folded cardboard game-board into the book: FUNDED! So you can more easily play the Grimtooth\u2019s Traps Board Game! An actual \u201cboard\u201d for the game, if you will. On the back will be game cards and other materials to photocopy and use in play! The gatefold pages will still be included, and this game board should make it easier to actually play.\nAt $115,000, we will upgrade all gold foil and leatherbound editions to include approximately +80 pages of Traps Bazaar! FUNDED! The softcover and \u201cregular\u201d hardcover will still be the existing 460 pages, but all gold foil and leatherbound editions will get an extra ~80 pages at no additional cost beyond the existing pledge cost!\nAt $120,000, we will manufacture a custom-printed, illustrated, corrugated shipping box to deliver the books in. FUNDED! Some of you saw what we did with the Metamorphosis Alpha shipping box \u2013 this will be similar. It\u2019s a really fun way to get a package in the mail, and will only be available to backers of this Kickstarter.\nAt $130,000, we will upgrade all gold foil and leatherbound editions to include the extra +160 pages of Traps Bazaar and Dungeon of Doom! FUNDED! The softcover and \u201cregular\u201d hardcover will still be the existing 460 pages, but all gold foil and leatherbound editions will get an extra 160 pages at no additional cost beyond the existing pledge cost!\nWhat\u2019s beyond that? Don\u2019t worry, we have even more ideas for awesome stretch goals! We\u2019d like to print the DCC module and tuck it inside the hardcover for all backers. We\u2019d love to include a full-length poster of the lovely Grimtina (and maybe her brother Grimtooth) and tuck that poster folded-up inside the back of every hardcover. And I\u2019m sure you have ideas too \u2013 as the project rolls along we\u2019ll solicit your feedback. Let\u2019s blow away all the stretch goals and get into the really fun territory of \u201cwhat else can we add to this thing?\u201d\nI suppose you\u2019ll want to know the pledge levels. No doubt this book will be used in different ways by you humans. Some GMs will use it in games, some readers will use it to reminisce, and some collectors will never open it. Therefore, I\u2019ve ordered Goodman Games to offer several options for pledge levels, which are listed at right. They include softcover, hardcover, gold foil hardcover, slipcased edition, real leather edition -- and even some versions with autograph pages and original art!\nShipping & handling: Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced at the end of the Kickstarter. This allows us to give you the best price for your order. We will invoice the orders via Paypal when items are ready to ship. For USA orders, orders will be shipped via media mail at an expected cost of approximately $5-8, depending on final weight of product. International shipping charges can vary widely. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.\nSHOW YOUR SUPPORT! Use the backer image below for your profile!\nSo there you are \u2013 what are you waiting for?

While I am confident that Goodman will deliver (and I've been happily using the PDF version - which will be what I'll use as a reference generally), it would be nice to get a bit of a touch by way of update. I have the feeling that we're (including Goodman) in the hands of/at the mercy of the manufacturerer(s) at this point, but surely we're at the point that some serious estimates can be made (or at least a better understanding of where printing/assembly stand right now). I'm not stressed out about this as the physical copy for me is more just to have than something to actively/regularly use, and thus is not something I need with any urgency.

Each entry in The Dungeon Alphabet does a great job of getting the GM's imagination rolling to create a devious dungeon.

A call to arms must go out!\n$18,000 Stretch Reward: The Darkenfold...\nThe Darkenfold was part of what once was the Ethvold, a forest which spanned across the entire southern reaches of Ethrum from the Rhodope Mountains in the west to the Ardeen River in the east. From the north, it covered the Shelves of the Mist, and much of Southern Kayomar to lap up against the feet of the Bergrucken in the northeast. Those days were long ago, when dragons were young, and the sentients ruled the soil and men and dwarves were few and unlearned. The Darkenfold is a remnant of that forest, stretching only several hundred miles from the Danau River and the Plains of Kayomar in the east to the doorsteps of the unexplored Rhodope Mountains in the west. In the south, the great Soup Marsh hems in the ancient trees, and the forest continues in wild growth from there to the far-off Shelves of the Mist in the distant north. The Eldwood, to the east, holds the heart of the Ethvold of old, but the Darkenfold holds its dark memories. It is an evil wood, filled with its own wild abandon and creatures of ill intent. Those who live there know that the trees and the soil hold memories of their past glory and do not forget the axes of men, orcs, dwarves, and goblins that have plundered them of their wealth and life.\nRead the full write up from Shades of Mist HERE.\nThe Darkenfold\n$16,000 STRETCH REWARD: WHAT IS INZAE?\nWe are moving toward our next stretch reward, and it occurs to us that some of you may not know what Inzae is. Here's a bit of synopsis.\n What\u2019s next?? The World of Inzae. It\u2019s the inner world.\nIn the beginning the All Father crafted substance from his own being. But in the darkness of the Void he saw a light and there he found the dragon, coiled upon herself, thrashing about. And she rent the fabric of the Void and from the tears came the maelstrom, a madness of elements that spilled into the Void.\nAnd the All Father settled upon the Maelstrom and from it he created the world of Aihrde. But seeing him the dragon thought to make her own world, and beneath the Maelstrom she fashioned Inzae, a grim world, and dangerous. Thus there came to be two worlds, one astride the Maelstrom, one beneath and they hung in the Void for all the long years.\nInzae is another world, apart from Aihrde, yet bound in its mythology. The two are connected through the roots of the Great Tree and the Rings of Brass.\nWhat does this mean for you and your game? There are two worlds to play in, one, Aihrde, more traditional fantasy, the other, Inzae, a dark world of harsh realities, little magic and where death is a constant.\nAihrde was created by Stephen Chenault and Inzae by Davis Chenault.\nWe are only a few hundred from release of the primer for the World of Inzae. In short your getting two for one!\nAbout the World of Aihrde Project\nPresently, the World of Aihrde consists of 2 volumes, the Codex of Aihrde and the Players Guide to Aihrde, with one 27\" x 39\" map depicting the Cradle of the World adventure area. We'd like to expand this, with a particular focus on the maps, improve the content of the book and perhaps make the book full color.\nNOTE:  Both $75 levels come with a PDF copy of the corresponding book. \nA Note on Nomenclature\nAihrde is the name of the world.\nThe Codex of Aihrde is the world setting book. It is divided into two sections: The Andanuth and the Almanac. The book will be printed in hardcover format, is approximately 276 pages long and it's price (depending on whether the map is folded into the book or not) stands around $35.00.\nThe Players Guide to Aihrde consists of player information: racial classes, spells, guilds and orders. This book will be printed in hardcover format, is 76 pages long and its price stands around $20.00.\nThe World of Aihrde Map consists of the entire world, as seen in the image below. There are no plans presently to have this map printed anywhere other than inside the Codex of Aihrde, unless we meet stretch goals as noted below.\nThe Cradle of the World Map (also known as the Lands of Ursal) is that region of the world covered by the Almanac in the Codex of Aihrde as depicted in the map below. It is as you see in the box in the map above. Presently this map is sold separately in 9 sectional maps.\nWant to see a larger preview of the map? Click the one below:\nObjectives\nPresently, the Cradle of the World Map is sold separate from the Codex. We want this bound with the book, folded and fully detachable. This allows for one stop shopping when picking up the book. The max size of this is 39\" wide by 27\" tall.\nBut the Cradle of the World map is too beautiful to keep in such a small form. We want to split the map in half, print two of the same size and ship in a tube. This makes the Cradle of the World map twice as large and keeps it rolled and not folded.\nThe long range goal of this kickstarter is to land the books -- both if possible -- in full color. Printed like the three sisters kickstarter, it will make the whole a far better experience.\nAnd lastly, we'd love to see the Cradle of the World mounted on a spring roller assemble for you to hang on your ceiling, wall, or put on a tripod.\nWHAT IS THE WORLD OF AIHRDE\nAihrde is a complete campaign and world setting for your favorite RPG. Whether your playing Castles & Crusades, Dungeon Crawl Classics or any other RPG, you can find a home in Aihrde.  There is an in-depth history, mythology, descriptions of all the races of the world, from dwarves to giants and elves to orcs, a case by case study of all the relevant kingdoms and peoples and the geographical regions they live. It also includes deities and all the relevant info needed to run them: guilds, orders, significant terrain features and so very much more.  Aihrde is the most complete campaign setting on the market today.\nSee the Full Table of Contents of the Codex of Aihrde here.\nSee a Preview of the Codex of Aihrde here.\nAIHRDE\nThe world of Aihrde spins upon an earth-like axis of ancient civilizations where good and evil have struggled for countless years. It is a world that bears the markings of its past; where ancient evils slumber, stained with the power of eldritch wizardry; where gods dwell in bejeweled halls of wonderment, worshiped by men and women of all creeds; where dragons live in great dens of heaped treasure; where the new stands upon the ruins of the old in beds of ancient glory.\nFor a thousand years and more, the dark god Unklar ruled the world in a terrible reign of Winters Dark. But now, banished to the Great Empty, Aihrde is a world reborn.\nIn the After Winters Dark, heroes tread in iron shod boots and wizards lean on crooked staffs to plunder the buried wealth and power of the ages. Here, the eternal struggle goes on, age after age, for Aihrde is a world of adventure, of undaunted heroes, untainted by the decadent philosophies of those meek who suffer in the shadows of lesser men. For here, the stone columns of history are wiped clean, awaiting the bold to carve their mark and gain entry to the halls of immortality!\nSTRETCH REWARDS EXPLAINED\n$4,000: Unlocked! We are funded.

Just like original Gaming Paper, the rolls are 12' long and 30\" wide, giving you thirty square feet of gaming surface!\nSTRETCH GOAL(S)\nat $3500 we will be making 1\" hexes an option!  Same cost and reward levels as squares.\nWhy an Erasable Version of Gaming Paper? \nBoth online and at conventions, the number one thing we hear as we talk with gamers is the question \"is Gaming Paper dry erase?\" Until now the answer has always had to be \"no, it\u2019s permanent.\" But thanks to this new printing process, we can now give you a giant sized, reasonably priced alternative to the standard expensive and fragile dry erase mat. \nHow Does It Work? \nGaming Paper Erasable is wet coated with a new wax mixture\u2014a mixture that does not easily absorb ink, so the surface can be wiped clean with just a little effort, particularly if you use Quartet Enduraglide Dry Erase Markers. We tested many different dry erase brands, colors, and styles and found the Quartet Enduraglide markers looked the best and cleaned off the best. They\u2019re also easy to find, available online and at most office supply stores.\nQuartet Enduraglide Dry Erase Markers\nHow is This Different than Traditional Gaming Paper? \nThe paper is white with blue squares rather than the traditional tan color. It\u2019s a little stiffer and also more water resistant. The packaging is different, instead of a tight plastic wrap it is loosely wrapped in plastic (because of the wax treatment, the rolls don't hold up well if put in a high heat shrink tunnel).\nHow Many Uses Can I Get from Gaming Paper Erasable? \nWell, it is paper and the wax coating will break down through repeated use, wiping clean, and reuse.  With normal wear and tear, we expect you to get 4-5 uses out of a section of the roll. But each roll has 30 square feet of surface to play with.\nHow Will the Funds Be Used? \nWe have printed a small number of Gaming Paper Erasable rolls already and are using those for promotion. The largest portion of the funds will pay for a full print-run of the product. \nThe next largest cost will be to acquire Quartet Enduraglide markers for the pledge levels that include them. \nFinally, shipping is expensive. The remaining moneys will be used to keep the shipping costs as low as possible.\nLuckily, the manufacturing, packaging, and shipping do not take long\u2014so we should be able to get rewards to most backers before Christmas!

Two years on, it's time to give this game a make over.\nWhat is Amazing Adventures?\nIt is Pulp Siege! The newest core game powered by Troll Lord Games' celebrated SIEGE engine (this is what runs Castles & Crusades). It allows you to create any type of pulp adventure hero you want, and customize them as you like! Be it arcane scholars, mentalists, tomb-raiding archaeologists, Asian martial arts masters, or gangsters and G-Men, this game has you covered. And best of all, if you're a fan of Castles & Crusades, you can pick this game up and get playing in a matter of minutes! Inside this book you'll find:\n\n\u2022 Eight brand new character classes: Arcanist, Gadgeteer, Gumshoe, Hooligan, Mentalist, Pugilist, Raider, and Socialite\n\u2022 Character customization options: Generic Class Abilities, Traits, Backgrounds, Fate Points, Pulp Costumes, Sanity Rules, and more!\n\u2022 The complete SIEGE engine rules, adapted for pulp-modern gaming\n\u2022 Rules for vehicular combat\n\u2022 Guidelines on how to run a pulp game\n\u2022 A rogue's gallery of foes, pre-generated characters, NPCs, and a ready-made adventuring society to get you up and running fast\n\u2022 A complete starting adventure for 4-6 new pulp heroes\n\u2022 And tons more\nThis Can be an Amazing Adventure!\nWe want the Amazing Adventures core rulebook out in Hardcover and Kickstarter is the platform to make that happen. With you on board we can not only put AA out in hardcover but we can, with a little hard work, add  Amazing Monsters to the mix and Jason's next release in the series: The Amazing Adventures Companion, filled with all manner of new material, from classes to vehicles and more.\nIf we hit our funding goal, the core rulebook will be in Hardcover.  We also hope to get both the Manual of Monsters and Amazing Adventures Companion through stretch goals.  We feel very strongly that if we hit $20K we can meet those goals and have all three in Hardcover!\nNOTE: A note on the Manual of Monsters book. This book is taken primarily from the Monsters & Treasure and Classic Monsters books for C&C. You'll see all the familiar faces, now compiled for use with Amazing Adventures, plus a few brand new, never-before-seen creatures from your darkest nightmares!\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:  Please see chart below for shipping prices.

In the depths of space these explorers found millions of star systems, strange planets, and exotic alien races. Centuries later, they form the Known Worlds, a vital region of trade and technology where empires grow and business thrives.\nIt is an unparalleled age. Cutting edge science has opened limitless frontiers of space and consciousness, and has even begun to hint at the mysteries of the universe itself. But to find them, one must travel beyond the familiar, to the last parsecs of reality. \nThe Last Parsec is a science fiction roleplaying game of exploration and adventure. It requires the Savage Worlds core rules and the Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion to play.\nCharacters cross the cosmos under the auspices of JumpCorp, an intergalactic megacorp that contracts exploration, security, bounty hunting, transportation, and everything in between. Adventures take explorers from system to system and planet to planet, finding strange new civilizations, discovering terrifying creatures, and battling pirates, hostile aliens, rival corporations, and stranger things!\nYour hero might be a cynical human, a gregarious yeti, a hot-tempered rakashan, or one of 11 total core races--or you can create your own using the Science Fiction Companion.\nRewards\nA graphic of all the reward levels listed at right can be found at the bottom of this page, but here's what people usually ask us about first--the level that includes \"one of everything.\" That would be the Jump Chief, and it's everything at a discount over adding everything on to a base level separately.\nNOTE: The Jump Captain and Jump Chief backer levels include a set of die-cut Savage Worlds Status Counters on thick cardboard (also available as an Add On). We accidentally left these out of the Pledge levels and can't edit the Reward text to reflect this change, so we're doing it here and on the graphic below. Sorry for the inconvenience!\nWendigo Tales\nIf you'd like to jump into the setting at hyperspeed, check out our short fiction line, Wendigo Tales: Season Three features The Last Parsec, and the first two tales are already out (with four more coming soon).\nThe Searchers, by Shane Hensley, and Scrapped, by Cameron Dayton. Available now!\nBooks\nWe're taking a \"starbox\" approach to the overall setting this time. Races, technology, ships, creatures, and more are all covered in the required Science Fiction Companion, so instead of creating a core book first, we're going to do something a little different.\nThe Last Parsec blasts off with three setting books and several adventures featuring exciting planets, systems, and fantastic events at the edge of the Known Worlds. We'll produce a second wave of books and other material along with an expanded setting book tying more of the background and events together sometime in 2015.\nGet the FREE Last Parsec Primer here!\nIn the meantime, you can get the essential setting information in The Last Parsec Primer, completely free and available now!\nHere are the first three settings for The Last Parsec, written and illustrated by Pinnacle's best. We're only going to sell the books in sets during the Kickstarter--which also gets you the unlocked digital rewards. After the Kickstarter, each book will be available separately as usual.\nEach book contains detailed background on a system, planet, or other location, any new Edges, Hindrances, Gear, Ships, or Setting Rules important to the area, a Plot Point Campaign, Savage Tales, and a Bestiary covering the strange xenos and shady characters one might meet in the distant reaches.\nEach book is full-color, 96 pages, in our standard graphic novel format so everything lines up nice and neat on your shelf. All three settings are available in softback and Limited Edition hardback.\nEris Beta-V: A JumpCorp-employed team of explorers investigates a magnificent ringed gas giant with its numerous moons. Ancient artifacts of enormous power can be found among the rings and asteroids. Every moon is a unique world to be explored. When the system\u2019s valuable commerce is threatened by unscrupulous agencies, the team must root them out and put themselves at great risk on the icy fringes of interstellar space. Written by Matt Cutter (Deadlands Brand Manager).\nScientorium: Hidden away by sheer distance and forever shrouded from the minds of the curious lies a mammoth artifact from the previous galactic age, the library of Scientorium. Its strange experience chambers offer passage to a million histories on a million worlds, secrets and technologies undreamed of. Now abandoned by all but its automated security systems and enigmatic caretakers, its workings are oddly twisted and jealous, meting out reward and punishment in equal measure. This is a classic science fiction saga, an epic journey across space and time in the vein of Niven or Heinlein! Written by Timothy Brian Brown (Dragon Kings, Dark Sun, Traveller).\nLeviathan: Hunt the most dangerous game in the Known Worlds! The jungle planet Leviathan teems with mammoth lacerauns, savage beasts of enormous size and cunning, potential trophies unmatched in any other star system. Intentionally undeveloped beyond a few tourist-oriented settlements, Leviathan nonetheless draws more than just adventure-seeking hunters though, including researchers and those who would see the world left completely untouched. Both are more than willing to turn the tables on any would-be hunters. Written by John Goff (Night Train, Deadlands Noir).\nPoster Maps\nJust like the poster maps we did for Deadlands Noir, Weird Wars Rome, and East Texas University, we're creating two double-sided, dry-erase maps on heavy paper stock. This time out the maps feature four different ships (dropship, freighter, pirate vessel, and research ship) you can use for your JumpCorp team or the treacherous foes who cross their path.\nHere's a peek at the map work in progress--we'll update this with more detailed pics as they near completion.\nGame Master's Screen\nThe Last Parsec GM's screen is a tri-fold, landscape screen featuring gorgeous full-color artwork on one side and all the important charts and tables for the game on the other.\nThe GM's screen also includes The Last Parsec Primer in printed form and an original adventure (that sets up one of our future settings) by Ross Watson called The Enigma Equation.\nMiniatures\nOur friends at Bronze Age Miniatures have created nine exclusive miniatures representing some of the most popular archetypes from the Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion and The Last Parsec.\nThe set contains the aurax, construct, deader, male and female human, insectoid, kalian, Serran, and yeti.\nBest of all, if you pledge for the minis during the Kickstarter and the bonus figures listed under Stretch Goals are unlocked (the Floran, Saurian, and Rakashan), we'll include them in your set free!\nFigures sculpted by Bronze Age Miniatures.\nAdd-Ons\nEveryone who pledges for physical shipments can add additional items to their shipment at no additional shipping cost. (After the KS you can always order these from our store at standard shipping rates.)\nSimply increase your pledge by the amount shown. When we send out the Final Survey, your credit will apply.\nStretch Goals\nHere are the additional digital or physical unlocks we plan on releasing if we exceed our original funding goal:\nRogue Traders (Merchant Level)\nKickstarter's Reward boxes don't allow formatting, so we decided to put the list of items and terms here where it's easier to understand:\nThis Reward level is for \"Brick and Mortar\" stores only and can be purchased as many times as you like. It includes:\n3 x Leviathan in Limited Edition Hardback ($75 retail value)\n3 x Scientorium in Limited Edition Hardback ($75 retail value)\n3 x Eris Beta-V in Limited Edition Hardback ($75 retail value)\n3 x GM's Screen + Adventure ($60 retail value)\n2 x Dropship and Freighter dry-erase, poster-size ship maps ($30 retail value)\n2 x Pirate and Research Vessel dry-erase poster-size ship maps ($30 retail value)\n2 x Double Action Deck ($60 retail value)\nAll this will be shipped freight free to the continental US *BEFORE* general release.\nPlease note that if we cannot verify your brick and mortar store, you will receive the Jump Captain package and a prorated refund instead.\nThe Kickstarter\nThe books and adventures are already in layout, the first wave of miniatures are done, and we're ready to go. We're using Kickstarter so that we can make some of the extras listed in the Stretch Goals above.\nOur last Kickstarter for East Texas University is at the printer and the last of the digital rewards are coming out fast and furious by the 12 to Midnight Crew.\nReward Summary\nHere's a graphical summary of the Reward levels and all you get with each:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPinnacle has been creating roleplaying games and books since 1994.

Necromancer Games re-animates itself bigger, better, and badder than ever before for the 5th Edition of the *world\u2019s most popular fantasy roleplaying game. With the help of Steve Winter and Ed Greenwood, we are going to be creating supplemental books (up to 3 of them!) to play the new edition Old School Style \u2014 the Necromancer way.\n5th Edition Foes - between 200-250 additional creatures, beasts, monsters and titans to challenge your players and enhance your adventures!\nQuests of Doom: X Adventures Worth Winning -12+ adventures worth winning, each written by one of our many iconic authors. (X begins with 12 and increases based on stretch goals.)\nBook of Lost Spells - Hundreds of new spells to enhance your 5th edition spell casters and NPCs.\nJust like we did with the Third Edition, our objective isn\u2019t to compete with the the upcoming 5th edition; it\u2019s to offer resources for playing the game the old way, old school style. In general it\u2019s darker and deadlier gaming than the official recommendations. It\u2019s not for crybabies. Between 1999 and 2006, we racked up award after award, picking up worldwide recognition as a publishing powerhouse... and now we\u2019re back!\nAuthors\n\"To pull this project together and give it the right \u201cfeel\u201d for Necromancer Games, we recruited an amazing lineup of writers. Start with a core of Necromancer Games regulars like Bill Webb (Rappan Athuk, The Lost City of Barakus), Matt Finch (Swords & Wizardry, Tome of Adventure Design), J. Collura (Caverns of Thracia Reloaded, Chaos Rising), Michael Curtis (The Dungeon Alphabet, Realms of Crawling Chaos), and Casey Christofferson (The Tome of Horrors, City of Brass). Throw in a few D&D long-timers like Steve Winter (Tyranny of Dragons, Murder in Baldur\u2019s Gate), James M. Ward (Gamma World, Pool of Radiance, Castle Keeper\u2019s Guide), Skip Williams (Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, The Rod of Seven Parts), and Ed Greenwood (The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, The City of Splendors). The result is a stack of adventures that are guaranteed to break bones, stir long-forgotten nightmares, push heroes to their utmost limits, and cement massive grins on the faces of players and DMs alike.\"\nHere's the Problem\n5th Edition is brand new and we have absolutely no idea how many books to print, so Kickstarter is going to be a very important tool. We're going to let you, our valued customers, tell us how many books to print.\nWhat You Get\nEventually, there will be three books, all library-bound hardcovers made for decades of use, written by the Necromancer Games team of Steve Winter, Bill Webb, Greg Vaughan, Matt Finch, J. Collura, Michael Curtis, Casey Christofferson, James M. Ward, Skip Williams, and Ed Greenwood. \n(Covers shown are mockups; the final covers may differ slightly)\nWe start out with monsters: a book called 5th Edition Foes. It\u2019s going to start with 200 monsters in it, which means it will be about 220 pages. That\u2019s an estimate. As we hit stretch goals, we\u2019ll add more monsters as we continue to raise money.\n(Covers shown are mockups; the final covers may differ slightly)\nThe next book is Quests of Doom, an adventure book we estimate at 180-260 pages, depending on stretch goals achieved. It will contain two updates from third edition books (Demons and Devils, Vampires and Liches) that contained a total of six adventures. PLUS, it will contain 6-12 new adventures under the section titles \"Bugs and Blobs\", \u201cGiants and Dragons,\u201d \u201cMen and Monstrosities,\u201d and \u201cElementals and Lycanthropes.\u201d This is where we bring in some heavy hitters as authors, but we haven\u2019t nailed down which author is going to write which adventure. That information might get settled during the duration of the Kickstarter, but we\u2019re not rushing it. The author lineup might not be finalized until after the Kickstarter is finished \u2014 see below about how this Kickstarter is a little different from our prior ones. For those following the Lost Lands\u2122 Campaign Setting, Greg Vaughan will be making sure that the adventures are all fully compatible with and integrated into the Lost Lands. This book will be $40, that's $3.33 per adventure! If we make all of our stretch goals the price drops to $2.22 per adventure! \n(Covers shown are mockups; the final covers may differ slightly)\nThe third book that comes available as a stretch goal is the 5th Edition Book of Lost Spells. This sourcebook will contain hundreds of spells, and we estimate that it will run 250 pages. The contents will be drawn from several books Necromancer Games wrote for 3rd Edition, but we will also be culling out a lot that doesn't work with 5th Edition, and adding a few new ones.\nThis One's a Little Different\nOur team (through Frog God Games) has run, funded, and fulfilled 3 Kickstarters (Rappan Athuk, Swords & Wizardry, and Razor Coast), and we have 2 more that are in the fulfillment process (Lost City of Barakus and Sword of Air). These 5 Kickstarters raised a total of over $600,000. In each of them, we had most of the work done ahead of time, and the main focus was on raising money for the art, the printing, and so forth. For this one, it\u2019s a little different because we\u2019re operating ahead of the normal timeline. Not all of the game\u2019s rules are known to us at this time, and probably a couple of them are still being finalized in the Crystal Towers of Renton. \nThis means we\u2019re creating a product that has some unknown variables, and it means that you\u2019re backing it more as a patron than as a pre-order customer. We\u2019re going to deliver these books, but it\u2019s going to be an evolving process.\nWhy So Early?\nIt might seem like we\u2019re jumping the gun on this project: after all, why not just wait until the Core Books are published by the Wizards, and start then? Two answers. First of all, to be very selfish about it, if we\u2019re first we can snag all the best artists and authors before someone else does. That gives us a superior product and a reputation for excellence. The second reason is that when a new edition comes out, the game masters want more monsters, adventures, and other resources immediately. Some publisher is going to provide them, and we want it to be us. Our products have a lot of lead time, because our book-bindings are library quality, because we work with A-team authors and artists who have waiting lists, and because good editing and good art take time. If we\u2019re going to put top-of-the-line products out there when our customers want them, we have to start now. \nAdd-Ons\nSome add-ons may be added as stretch goals. Hang tight, keep watching, and don\u2019t split the party. \n$50 Signed Adventure Book - If you'd like your copy Quests of Doom signed by all the authors simply add $50 to your pledge.\n$200 Leather Bound Cover (per book) - We do real leather covers, not composite leather (ground-up scraps pressed into shape).

Page counts will vary depending on the length and format of the material, licensing requirements might alter the content of updated material, and so on. \n\nHOWEVER, from experience in the many Kickstarters that we have fulfilled or are currently fulfilling, we believe that we have eliminated or accounted for the main risks that cause less-experienced companies to fail. We have (a) already priced the products to account for potential increases in the cost of shipping and postage over the course of production, (b) have a sophisticated in-house pledge management software system that has already been used successfully to fulfill large Kickstarters, (c) have backup authors and editors lined up, (d) already have the majority of the art, (e) already have the majority of the non-rules-specific text written, (f) have our own climate-controlled warehouse space, (g) have a long-standing relationship with two printers based on being a customer that places five-digit orders several times a year and (h) have considerable capital available to use in case there are unexpected expenses or cash-flow glitches. \n\nA number of other factors in this particular Kickstarter may be affected by third parties, including the Wizards of the Coast delivery schedule for books and pdfs, and also our freelance artists, writers, and editors. Several details of rules-presentation may affect page count (the number of lines in a monster stat block, for example).

Very professional, well put together, extremely functional.\" - Bryan Stiltz, Production Manager, Reaper Miniatures\n\"Good stuff! Seems like you're getting a lot for your money here...worth checking out!\" - Stefan Pokorny, CEO and Founder, Dwarven Forge\nClick the banner to download a free preview of our first module!\nWhat is Burning Yeti Studios?\nBurning Yeti Studios is a group of highly experienced gamers and creative professionals with a proven record in the gaming and publishing industries. Our team of industry professionals includes a three-time successful Kickstarter, a former game store owner, and two former editors from the monthly magazine InQuest Gamer.\nWhat is The Lost Dungeons of Xon?\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon is an original series of Pathfinder\u2122 compatible roleplaying modules designed to be used with any campaign world. The Adventurer pledge will include three distinct adventures collectively designed to take a party of adventurers from 1st to 6th level.\nWhat format will the modules be available in?The modules and supplemental material will be released in electronic format only, as interactive PDFs.\nWhat is an \u201cInteractive PDF\u201d?\nMost roleplaying supplements available in PDF format are simply an electronic version of the book. The Lost Dungeons of Xon takes this format to the next level by including several features that simply aren\u2019t possible in print form:\nNarrated Room Descriptions - Professionally-recorded audio narration introductions for each encounter area \nPop-up stat blocks for NPCs and Monsters so GMs don\u2019t need to flip through pages to find them\nDirect navigation to room and encounter descriptions from an interactive overview map \nPRD Hyperlinks to full spell and creature descriptions on Paizo's Pathfinder\u2122 online reference document\nUnlockable content - Password-secured player materials such as maps and clues that can be unlocked by a GM-provided password at the appropriate time during an adventure\nWhat else makes this different from other roleplaying modules?\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon is the first series of roleplaying modules designed specifically to make use of the rewards from two of the gaming industry's most successful Kickstarter campaigns: Dwarven Forge\u2019s Game Tiles\u2122 and Reaper\u2019s Bones\u2122 miniatures.\nAll of the dungeons the players will explore in The Lost Dungeons of Xon can be assembled using just two sets of Game Tiles\u2122, and all the miniatures we feature come from the Vampire-pledge level of the first Bones\u2122 Kickstarter. If you backed either or both of these campaigns, you\u2019ll find specific guidelines for which pieces to use in conjunction with the modules.\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon are \"pre-build friendly\". We\u2019ve come up with a unique and compelling backstory that allows you to set up the physical dungeons in advance. Because of the way the stories are designed, the layout of each dungeon is in-character knowledge the players will have right from the start of the scenario. Therefore, you won\u2019t be giving anything away by having the entire dungeon laid out on the table.\nWhat if I didn\u2019t back one of or both of those projects?\nWhile our scenarios are enhanced by the use of Game Tiles\u2122 and Bones\u2122 miniatures, they aren\u2019t required; you can run the modules as you would any other pen & paper RPG. We\u2019ve put a lot of effort into coming up with an interesting story with enjoyable puzzles and challenges for the players, so even if you don\u2019t own the accessories you should consider backing our project. With all the interactive features we have, there simply isn't anything else like it.\nUPDATE: The good folks at Reaper have put together a special package which includes all the BONES miniatures featured in \"The Lost Dungeons of Gold and Blood\". There's a special 10% discount, and you can see the details here.\nAlso, for potential backers who do NOT own Dwarven Forge's Game Tiles... When the modules are released we will have printable copies of the dungeon maps available on our website, which can be used as a substitute for the Game Tiles.\nWhat kind of art will the modules have?\nWhile content is king when it comes to roleplaying supplements, we also recognize the importance of looking good. The art direction is another aspect of our project that is unique. The visuals in our modules feature not only pre-configured Game Tile\u2122 layouts, but high-resolution photographs of professionally-painted miniatures as well.\nHow long are the modules?\nThe first module in the series, \"The Lost Dungeon of Gold and Blood\" is a 25-page PDF. The second and third modules - \"The Stronghold of the Banshee Cabal\" and \"The Endless Dark\" will be approximately 50 pages each. All three modules will have companion Digital Player's Guides that will be 5-8 pages long.\nReward Comparison Chart\nRelease Dates\n\"The Lost Dungeon of Gold and Blood\" will be available to ALL backers (at the Explorer level or higher) by September 2014.\nOur Inner Circle members will receive early draft versions of the second and third modules by December 2014.\nThe final versions of the second and third modules, along with any stretch goals and unlocked add-ons, are expected to be available by March 2015.\nStretch Goals\n$16,500 Stretch Goal [Locked]: Character Pack #0\nThis bonus content, free to all backers at the Scout/Adventurer level or higher, will include full-page character sheets and detailed backgrounds for the arrogant and over-bearing Dirk Dunland and the other members of his party. These complete and in-depth character folios will give you everything you need to fully flesh out these NPC's, and even to use them as player characters in another campaign if you choose.\nOther Stretch Goals\nWe have a lot more great stretch goals planned. Some will be free to anyone who backs at the Scout / Adventurer level or higher, others will be paid add-ons available to all backers. (Note that if you back at the Master or Inner Circle level, you get ALL add-ons for free.)\nPaid add-ons will generally be $5 or $10. Some of the goodies we've got planned include:\nCharacter packs with full-page backgrounds and folios for the main NPCs in the modules\nBonus dungeon encounters that aren't part of the main story and can be inserted into any campaign\nA story-based choose-your-own-adventure online character generator\nAn epic Dragon Battle encounter designed and balanced for high-level characters\nAll of the stretch goals and add-ons will include the same high-quality of photography and painted miniatures featured in our main modules.\nNo Surprises Section\nWhile we will endeavor to ensure that all the features of our interactive PDFs work on as many platforms as possible, it\u2019s still a relatively recent technology. We do extensive testing, but we can\u2019t always account for certain versions of software and operating systems. To fully utilize the features of the PDFs, you may have to download a new version of Adobe Reader to your laptop, desktop or tablet, or install the latest system updates for your device.\nDue to the interactive nature of the PDF, the GM should plan to have a computer or tablet on hand to run the module. If the players have technology as well, their experience can be enhanced by using the Digital Player's Guides, but they are not required. All the information in the player's guides will also be available as printable content.\nWhile we are constraining ourselves to the Game Tiles found in the original two-set Kickstarter campaign for the basic dungeon layouts, supplementary and bonus material can and will utilize pieces that were not available from the base Kickstarter. For example, our tavern brawl - an optional encounter in the first module - uses pieces from the \u201cDungeon Dressing\u201d add-on pack.\nFinally, while the first module is complete, the second and third modules are currently in development and the titles are subject to change.\nAbout Burning Yeti Studios\nBurning Yeti Studios is a team of highly experienced gamers and creative professionals with a proven record in the industry. \nJeff Hannes previously worked as Senior Editor for InQuest Gamer magazine and has written material for Iron Crown Enterprises and Last Unicorn Games. \nMichael Searle is Burning Yeti's graphic designer.

From his GameKnight projects, Dave knows exactly what it takes to run a Kickstarter from start to finish.\nJeff (GM) running a Lost Dungeons play-test with Mike (orange shirt), Joel (blue shirt, red jacket) and friends.

Fortunately, we\u2019ve already put a great deal of effort into The Lost Dungeons of Xon series. The first module is complete, and we plan to release shortly after the end of the campaign.\n\nThe remaining materials (including bonus materials and add-ons) will need to be completed, designed and, most importantly, play-tested. While we\u2019ve allotted an appropriate amount of time for play-testing in our production schedule, there is always the possibility that player feedback could necessitate significant changes to the story.

It quickly went Platinum on DrivethruRPG, and was released in hardcover through voidstarstudios.com and IndiePressRevolution.\nThis new core book will contain the setting information contained in the original Nova Praxis core book, expanded with new material from Machinations: the Nova Praxis GM's Guide. The Savage Worlds rules are being written by Shaintar creator and industry veteran, Sean Patrick Fannon!\nThe Book and PDF\nNova Praxis: Savage Worlds Edition will be released in the same digest format as the Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition. We estimate it to be roughly 250 pages, standard print. We are shooting for an August release in hopes of getting it out to everyone by GenCon.\nIn addition to this book, you will need the Savage Worlds core rules to play Nova Praxis. The Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion is a useful add-on, but is not necessary.\nThe PDF will be a bookmarked version of the print edition. But if we hit the stretch goal (see below), we will also produce an Augmented PDF, featuring a tablet friendly layout and a number of enhancements for improved navigation. You can learn more about the A-PDF for the Fate version here. And we're striving to make sure the one for Savage Worlds is even better.\nPlaytesting\nThe playtest is live! One of the updated visible to backers includes a link to the playtest doc.\nReviews\nNova Praxis was originally released for the Fate system. The Savage Worlds Edition will have different game mechanics of course, but here's what people have said about the original version...\n\u201cNova Praxis has a stunningly realized and fleshed out setting. I mean this in a very good way. The worlds of the solar system, factions and organizations within the world are all well thought out and realized within the game. I think that this is a key to a game that wants to be transhumanist: you have to understand and work out the social structures of the setting. Transhumanism is an evolutionist philosophy (from my viewpoint) that tries to work out how great changes in technology and science will impact not only those sciences but society and people as well. In Nova Praxis, the Void Star Games people have certainly gotten that part right. Thought has gone into the world of their future, and how the advances have impacted it and the people who live there.\u201c \u2013 Christopher Helton, Dorkland\n\u201cMan, it was exactly what I was looking for!\u2026 Needless to say, if you play any kind of Fate, and want sci-fi, transhuman, or cyberpunk elements in your game, then you couldn't go wrong with Nova Praxis.\u201d - Paul M. [5 of 5 Stars]\n[Referring to the Augmented PDF] \u201cQuite possibly the most useful and beautiful PDF ever created for gaming\u2026\u201d \u2013 Seth B. [5 of 5 Stars]\n\u201cI don't do a lot of reviews, but I feel compelled to do so in this case. The game I'm reviewing, Nova Praxis, a FATE-based ruleset, is just that good. And the delivery system, an enhanced PDF, is really amazing in terms of its clean aesthetic and overall usability. Color me very, very impressed.\u201d \u2013 Edgar Johnson\n\u201cIt is a very engaging game with an excellent developed setting that tackles many fundamental issues and themes inherent to the genre itself. Action, conspiracies, ethical and moral issues, social dichotomies, and much more! Basically, this roleplaying game offers us a fantastic playground to develop and create any types of memorable stories.\u201c \u2013 Yohann Delalande\nIMPORTANT! - PLEASE READ!\nIf you back a tier that offers a print copy of the book, when it becomes available, you will be sent a coupon code to get the book at cost from DrivethruRPG. What does \"at cost\" mean? It means the coupon code will cover the cost of the book, but not printing or shipping. Void Star Studios makes no profit at this stage. This is the cost of printing and delivery paid to DrivethruRPG to get the printed book into your hands.\nThe book will be available in softcover and hardcover, in standard and premium color. DrivethruRPG estimates the print costs as follows:\nSoftcover Premium Color - $13.30 to $16.50\nSoftcover Standard Color - $7.50 to $8.80\nHardcover Premium Color - $18.80 to $22.10\nHardcover Standard Color - $12.60 to $14.50\nMake sure you factor this in when selecting your backer tier. This is the amount you will have to pay in addition to your backer tier and shipping costs.\nShipping costs vary by location. DrivethruRPG ships internationally, and estimated shipping costs can be found here.\nTo clarify... After the Kickstarter has ended and the book has been released, you will be issued a coupon code that discounts the price of the print version such that you only pay for the print and shipping costs. How much you must pay at that time depends on the type of print job you select (as shown above) and your location.\nEvolved Backers: As a thank you, your name will be listed in a special \"Thank You\" section of the book. Also, you will get PDF copies of all the books unlocked through the stretch goals listed below as they are released. And if we raise enough to produce an Augmented PDF ($9,000), Evolved backers will get both the regular PDF and the Augmented PDF at no extra cost.\n$8,000 - The Augmented PDF [DONE!] - We will develop an Augmented version of the PDF. Evolved backers will get both the regular PDF, and the Augmented PDF, at no additional cost.\n$8,500 - Game Master's Screen - We will develop a Nova Praxis: Savage Worlds Edition Game Master's Screen PDF. Evolved backers will get this PDF for free.\n$9,500 - Ghosts in Darkness - We will develop and release the introductory scenario, Ghosts in Darkness for Nova Praxis: Savage Worlds Edition. Evolved backers will get this PDF for free when it is released.\n$10,000 - Work Hazards - We will begin developing Work Hazards, a book of alien creatures, biotechnological horrors, combat drones, terrorists, pirates and other NPCs to challenge your players with. Evolved backers will get this PDF for free when it is released. Work Hazards will be released featuring both Savage Worlds and Fate stats.\n$11,000 - Nova Praxis Cards - We will develop a custom set of Nova Praxis playing cards for use in determining initiative. These cards will be available through DrivethruCards around the same time the book releases. Evolved backers will get a PDF of these cards for free.\n$12,000 - Fragmentation - Mike McConnell will begin writing Fragmentation, a Nova Praxis novel. Evolved backers will get this ebook/PDF for free when it is released.\n$13,000 - Galactic Gazetteer: The Sol System - We will begin development on the Galactic Gazetteer: The Sol System. This book, for both the Fate and Savage Worlds version of Nova Praxis, will feature an in-depth look at the planets in the Sol system, with particular emphasis on Earth. Evolved backers will get this PDF for free when it is released.\n$16,000 - The Vantage Strain - We will begin developing The Vantage Strain a massive pre-written scenario for both Savage Worlds and Fate versions of Nova Praxis. Evolved backers will get this PDF for free when it is released.\n$18,000 - Designer Raise! - Contributing writers get a 10% pay raise! RPG writers are woefully under paid, and this lets us better support those who worked hard to bring you this book.\n$20,000 - Digital Initiative - If we come this far, we're going to dive into a new digital initiative.

This is the 21st century and no one wants to admit they\u2019ve helplessly watched a classmate get sucked into the pages of a library book, come face-to-face with an angry ghost, or glimpsed a creature prowling the campus by the light of the full moon.\nCollege is where you make your own choices and find out who you really are. You can keep your head down, hoping to avoid the twisted horrors you sometimes catch out of the corner of your eye, or you can face your fears, fight the darkness, and protect your campus. Everyone starts out as a wide-eyed freshman, but if you survive four years at ETU you\u2019ll be a hero.\nThe Books\nThe ETU line debuts with two, 96-page, full-color books in our graphic novel format. We expect to deliver the PDFs in July. Assuming the Kickstarter is successful, the physical products should ship no later than November.\nThe core book, East Texas University, offers a well-rounded syllabus of character creation, new Edges & Hindrances, gear, Setting Rules, and tours of campus and nearby Pinebox, Texas. For advanced credit, read the section on rituals and talismans. Finally, the Adventure Generator and encyclopedia of miscreants is sure to light a creative spark in even the most humorless campus parking enforcement officer.\nWelcome to ETU. Classes start this Fall. Register now.\nThe second book, Degrees of Horror, includes a full-length Plot Point Campaign designed to take your class from Freshmen to graduation\u2014if they survive! We can't say much about the plot, but suffice to say it's a Big Deal for Pinebox...and maybe beyond. Degrees of Horror also features a full course-load of Savage Tales that work equally well with the Plot Point Campaign or your own epic saga.\nA Plot Point Campaign and additional Savage Tales for ETU!\nThe Game Master's Screen\nThis tri-fold screen features a scene of chaos on campus on the player's side, and all the important charts and tables for the game on the GM's side. It also includes a full-length 32-page adventure by Ed Wetterman\u2014we'll give you details and show you the cover in one of our first updates.\nWhen students at East Texas University talk about surviving college, they mean it\u2026literally!\nAll pledge levels include unlocked digital rewards and free domestic shipping!\nAdd Ons!\nWe have four Add Ons for everyone who pledges at the Junior level Reward or higher (if you order an Add On and only pledged for PDFs we'll refund your Add On pledge since this doesn't cover the shipping).\nThese items will be available as Add Ons after the Kickstarter closes, but at a higher retail price. To get the lower prices reflected below, include them in your pledge (you can tell us exactly what the extra funds are for when we mail out the Final Survey).\nNote that you must pledge at the Junior level or higher to order any of these items as Add Ons. International customers must add an additional $20 if you add one or more sets of Bennies, miniatures, or Go Ravens! dice. There is no extra cost for shipping the maps.\nAll the Add Ons for East Texas University, all visual like. :)\nAdd On Details\nBennies (Pack of 20 high-quality ceramic poker chips): Please add +$15 to your pledge\nAll TEN ETU 28mm Miniatures: Please add +$50 to your pledge\nGO RAVENS! Dice set: Please add + $10 to your pledge\nTwo double-sided dry-erase poster maps (ETU classrooms, the library, off-campus housing, and Pinebox businesses): Please add $25 (Sorry, we aren't selling the two packs separately during the Kickstarter)\nCloser view of the Gals of ETU!\nCloser view of the Guys of ETU!\nUnlockable Digital Rewards\nWe're going with the number of *backers* for this Kickstarter rather than funding levels, so *you* can help us get the word out and unlock more and more cool stuff for everyone.\nPlease note that all unlockable rewards are downloadable PDFs or other digital files.\nHere's the schedule of rewards and the number of backers (in parentheses) which unlocks them. Note that our funding must be successful before any rewards are unlocked.\nSoundtrack (200 Backers): The ETU original soundtrack, \"Trouble in Texas.\" UNLOCKED\nArchetypes (300 Backers): Ten full-color, full-page, ready-to-play archetypes, with Figure Flats.

It includes:\n4 x Limited Edition Hardbacks (MSRP $24.99)\n3 x Regular Editions (MSRP $19.99)\n3 x GM Screen + Adventure (MSRP $19.99)\n3 x of each of our two double-sided, dry-erase ETU Maps (MSRP $15 each; 6 packs total featuring the ETU classrooms, the library, off-campus housing, and Pinebox businesses).\nAll this will be shipped freight free to the continental US *BEFORE* general release.\nPlease note that if we cannot verify your brick and mortar store, you will receive the Master's Student package and a prorated refund instead.\nAdd Ons After the Kickstarter\nWe'll ask for Add Ons before we ship should you wish to add anything, but the prices may be higher, and may require additional shipping charges. We *highly* recommend pledging now if you think you'll want any of the Add Ons (you can always reduce your pledge if you change your mind up until the Kickstarter closes).

We are working with established manufacturing partners, so we are very confident in the quality of the product as well as the delivery time. Still, sometimes there are manufacturing, shipping delays, and even design delays. My only concern is that we hit so many stretch goals that Christopher can't get all the maps done in time (he is a busy working cartographer with a company of his own to run). If that happens we will be open and transparent about any design delays.\n\nChristopher has the first twenty five maps designed and we are ready to have it produced once we hit our targeted funding level.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Sewer Bestiary Receives 5 stars!", "update_content": "Take a look!

Includes additional mini-adventure \"The Rat King's River of Death\" by Steven Bean.\nYou can support this by pledging for the adventure module itself, and also by pledging for other DCC RPG modules, which are on sale for 20% off as part of this Kickstarter.\nThe project includes many fun stretch goals that, if funded, will make this an even more extravagant module.\nUpdate 6/1: Yet another stretch goal beaten!\nFirst, the Chained Coffin will be a boxed set! All Kickstarter orders of silver foil or gold foil will include the box.\nSecond, we have now passed stretch goal #11! The gazetteer will now be expanded even more! And there will now be a THIRD adventure included in the boxed set, in addition to the Almanac, the 0-level bonus module, the Chained Coffin, and the add-on spinning wheel!\nThird, we have posted an update with a variety of new add-on items! Support the project with a T-shirt, flask, belt buckle, or beer cozy!\nFinally, please note that the spinning wheel prop will be printed as a separate cardboard handout for the foil editions.\nDungeon Crawl Classics is the longest-running line of adventure modules currently available for tabletop role playing games, with the 82nd sequential DCC module recently released to game stores worldwide. This Kickstarter funds a special feature in an upcoming DCC module: a player handout that includes 3 spinning wheels on the inside cover of Dungeon Crawl Classics: The Chained Coffin. The 3 spinning wheels form an elaborate puzzle that can be solved by clever (or lucky) players. The wheel puzzle contains a number of strange symbols which can be re-used by the judge in future adventures, and the adventure text includes several alternate uses for future modules. This edition of the module features a unique silver foil cover.\nThe wheel puzzle: can you solve it? This Kickstarter will allow all three wheels to be printed on card stock and turn independently!\nWhy Kickstarter? Manufacturing this customized wheel puzzle requires hand-assembly within the printing plant. Publishing books in a standard format is a well-established process that uses standardized machinery, but customized puzzle manufacturing requires time-consuming, expensive hand assembly. This Kickstarter funds the incremental cost of manufacturing the adventure module with a three-dimensional wheel puzzle \u201cthat really spins,\u201d packaged on the inside cover of the adventure module. \nEven without the successful funding of this Kickstarter, The Chained Coffin will still be published. Without the Kickstarter, the puzzle will be presented as a \u201ccut out and assemble at home\u201d graphic. If this Kickstarter funds, however, backers will receive a version of the module that contains the moving puzzle with physical wheels that actually spin, with a unique silver foil cover. At further levels, there is an opportunity to add more fun features, as described in the stretch goals below. \nThe limited edition silver foil cover\nWhat Lies Within The Chained Coffin?\nThe adventure is designed for level 5 characters. A whispered voice calls from a coffin bound in chains, urging the heroes into the depths of the Shudder Mountains, a place rife with superstition and forlorn secrets. In the shadowy, pine-grown valleys of the Deep Hollows lurk mysteries of a bygone age and a new evil emerging from the ruins of the past. The adventurers must plumb the mountains\u2019 secluded reaches to root out this rising terror before its power comes to fruition. Standing in their path are cackling witches, subtle devils, lingering spirits, and a foul thing that moves in the night. Can the heroes appease that which lies within the Chained Coffin and thwart the dawn of a new and terrible age?\nShown here is a physical mockup of what we plan to manufacture. As you can see, each wheel spins independently. Can you solve the puzzle?\nThe Spinning Wheel Puzzle\nThe adventure includes a number of supernatural locations. The entrance to one is blocked by a supernatural door. It is this door that comprises the spinning wheel puzzle that is the subject of this Kickstarter: \nBeyond the ancient bridge is a 40\u2019 wide, 30\u2019 deep ledge that lies perpendicular to a sheer rock face. Set into the rocky cliff at the far side of the ledge stands a great stone archway sealed by an imposing door. Blue bolts of lightning ripple silently across the door\u2019s face, hinting at magical wards or seals. In the center of the door are three circular dials set one inside the next. Each dial bears several different symbols, no two of which repeat.\nArtist Doug Kovacs has rendered this door in a beautiful player handout (see image above). If this Kickstarter funds, the three wheels will be set on top of each other as physical dials that actually spin. What\u2019s the solution? You\u2019ll have to buy the module to find out!\nTo add additional replay value, author Michael Curtis has also designed five additional game mechanisms that utilize the spinning wheel (more puzzles, magic items, etc.). These are included with the adventure module and can be used in your group's future adventures.\nThe normal color cover for The Chained Coffin (without the physical spinning wheel).\nThe Bonus Adventure\nIncluded in the printed module is a short bonus adventure, The Rat King\u2019s River of Death, written by Steven Bean. Steven was a finalist in our 2012 Mystery Map Adventure Design Competition. The Rat King\u2019s River of Death is a stand-alone adventure that continues the escapades of the Rat King, as originally introduced in DCC #1: Idylls of the Rat King more than a decade ago.\nThe Signature Stickers\nTo commemorate this Kickstarter, the first 100 copies of The Chained Coffin that are pledged will include a signature plate. Illustrated by Doug Kovacs and signed by author Michael Curtis, the signature plate will be in the form of a \"skater sticker\" for you to stick wherever you want. Presumably on the book -- and we recommend the \"open space\" on the back cover -- but what the heck, it's a sticker and you can do whatever you want with it!\nAdd On Other DCC Modules and Save 20%!\nTo support this Kickstarter, we are offering printed copies of the older Dungeon Crawl Classics modules at a special sale price of 20% off. That's $8 each versus the regular price of $10 each. You can also include the DCC RPG core rules for $40, and copies of the newer adventure modules at the regular price of $10 each. All products ordered through this Kickstarter receive a PDF copy as well.\nTo add on these items, simply include the additional dollars in your pledge. At the end of the Kickstarter we will send a survey where you can specify exactly which modules the funds were added for:\nDCC #66.5: Doom of the Savage Kings (2nd printing) ($10)\nDCC #67: Sailors on the Starless Sea (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #68: People of the Pit (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #69: The Emerald Enchanter (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #70: Jewels of the Carnifex (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #71: The 13th Skull, color cover (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #71: The 13th Skull, silver foil cover (20% off: only $16)\nDCC #72: Beyond the Black Gate (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #73: Emirikol Was Framed (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #74: Blades Against Death (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #75: The Sea Queen Escapes (20% off: only $8)\nDCC #76: Colossus, Arise!

Here are the stretch goals for this project. If things go well, we will end up with an even cooler adventure module than we started out with!\n$6,000: FUNDED! We\u2019ll add additional sourcebook material for the adventure module, to be written by Michael Curtis, including a patron writeup for Ol\u2019 Blackcloak (read the module to find out who he is!), a mini-gazetteer on the Shudder Mountains regions, and more!\n$7,000: FUNDED! We\u2019ll add several pages of additional random encounters that can be used in various places throughout the adventure!\n$8,000: FUNDED! We\u2019ll add two full pages of player handouts, to be illustrated by the immortal Doug Kovacs!\n$9,000: FUNDED! We\u2019ll add stats and descriptions for 7 alternate versions of the Bad Lick Beast. That\u2019s the awful monster you see on the front cover. Meet its relatives, hybrids, related species, and other incarnations!\n$10,000: FUNDED! We\u2019ll add two more pages of player handouts!\n$12,000: FUNDED! We'll add another short bonus adventure -- which will be a zero level funnel set in the Shudder Mountains! This will include new zero-level professions and will let you start a campaign that leads to the Chained Coffin. \n$14,000: FUNDED! The additional material will be bundled into a separate stand-alone Almanac Of The Shudder Mountains. This will also include a new Bestiary of the Shudder Mountains. \n$18,000: FUNDED! The Almanac will be expanded to include Magic of the Shudder Mountains. \n$20,000: FUNDED! The Almanac will be upgraded to 24 pages of normal letter-sized pages, and will be expanded to include even more gazetteer material. \n$25,000: FUNDED! We'll add in another mini-adventure in the Shudder Mountains, that fills the gap between your level 0 characters and the level 5 Chained Coffin module. This will be included in all silver and gold foil boxed sets.\n$30,000: FUNDED! The Almanac will be expanded with another 8 pages of gazetteer material further expanding the Shudder Mountain region.\n$35,000: We'll print an 11\"x17\" poster map of the Shudder Mountains region.\nThe Physical Product\nThis Kickstarter funds the manufacturing cost of an adventure module including a series of three spinning wheels on the inside cover. The adventure is already written and playtested. Estimated length of the printed adventure is 28-32 pages.\nThe adventure module will be produced with two covers: a full-color cover, and a silver foil cover featuring an alternate illustration. Both covers are by Doug Kovacs, and are already complete. The cartography is by also by Doug, and is also complete.\nThe adventure module will be illustrated with B/W art, similar to other modules in the Dungeon Crawl Classics line of adventure modules.\nNegotiating with Ol' Blackcloak: a fun encounter in the adventure.\nAppendix N Inspiration\nDungeon Crawl Classics adventure modules utilize the rules of the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG). DCC RPG is inspired by Appendix N, the bibliography of fantasy and science fiction literature which inspired D&D co-creator Gary Gygax. One of the most distinctive contributors to Appendix N is Manly Wade Wellman \u2013 a contributor who is often overlooked.\nThe Chained Coffin is inspired by the mountain-fantasy stories of Manly Wade Wellman. His Silver John stories were set in the dark, woodsy places of backwoods mountain country, where spirits and haunts were a real part of everyday life. As author Michael Curtis described his work on this adventure:\nOne of the great joys of writing DCC RPG adventures comes from the game\u2019s commitment to remaining true to the classic pulp-era fantasy and science-fiction stories that inspired fantasy roleplaying, the so-called \u201cAppendix N\u201d tales. And while \u201csword & sorcery\u201d yarns comprise the lion\u2019s share of Appendix N, they are not the only types of stories found within it. The Chained Coffin derives its inspiration from American folklore, as perceived through the atmospheric works of Manly Wade Wellman. You\u2019ll find no kobolds and orcs in The Chained Coffin, but plenty of restless ghosts, shunned witches and conjure-men, and devils willing to make a deal at midnight, all set against a backdrop of superstition-filled mountains and secluded hollows where the still air smells of pine trees. Heady stuff, indeed, and a far cry from your traditional fantasy RPG fare.\nThe Chained Coffin stands as my favorite DCC RPG adventure to date. The opportunity to create and then dwell for a time within a region more at home in the eons-old Appalachian Mountains than the fantastical landscapes of Tolkien, Howard, Moorcock, and Leiber was a designer\u2019s dream. Hopefully, my personal enjoyment will be shared by you, the judge and player. So gather \u2018round the fire, friends, pass the jug this way, and bend an ear to the music of the mountains. There are both horrors and wonders waiting in the Deep Hollows and, if you listen close at midnight, you might just hear a tune or two played on a lonesome fiddle strung with silver strings\u2026\nAbout The Author\nMichael Curtis has been playing role-playing games for over thirty years, and has been a freelance writer and game designer since 2008. He has written or contributed to nearly forty roleplaying games, supplements, and articles.

The author of ten DCC RPG adventures including Emirikol Was Framed!, The Sea Queen Escapes!, The Croaking Fane, Frozen in Time, and Intrigue at the Court of Chaos, Michael\u2019s work has also appeared in the pages of Gygax Magazine and he is a regular contributor to Fight On! magazine. Michael\u2019s upcoming projects for Goodman Games include The Chained Coffin, The Four Phantasmagorias adventure series, and The Adventurer\u2019s Almanac. He lives in Suffolk County, NY, with the requisite number of cats for a writer and far too many books.\nAbout Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game\nDCC RPG is an old-school tabletop role playing game that uses modern rules. Its inspiration is Appendix N, and its rules set is derived from the D20 system (which powered the third edition of D&D). DCC RPG is a single complete rulebook with no additional products to buy. It is supported by an extensive line of adventure modules, and a robust community of third party publishers. DCC RPG has been widely praised for its innovative approach to \u201cold-school.\u201d You can find more information at www.goodman-games.com/dccrpg.html\nFAQ\nShipping & handling: Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced at the end of the Kickstarter. This allows us to give you the best price for your order. For USA orders, orders will be shipped via media mail at an expected cost of approximately $5-6, depending on final weight of product. International orders will be invoiced at actual postage cost plus $5 for handling. International postage requires hand-written customs forms, and waiting in line at a post office. International postage also has long transit times, and depending on the destination can be very expensive. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.

More material from The Lost Lands is on the way, and while we finish up the massive Sword of Air, we decided to go ahead and get the next volume of material going.\n\nWinner of the 2004 ENWorld Gold Ennie for Best Adventure, this hardcover book is the original (revised and expanded) work by WDBK Kenower and Bill Webb. The book will be produced in 2 versions, one for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and one for the Swords & Wizardry Roleplaying Game. \n\nFor all you Lost Lands fans out there, this one is canon \u2014 it interfaces with Stoneheart Valley, Rappan Athuk, and Sword of Air, and represents the next of many ongoing chronicles of the Frog God Games/Necromancer Games home world. A MUST HAVE book for any fan of our material.\n\nOur base level of funding is small \u2014 we wanted to keep the price point down on this. We listened to your feedback from our last few Kickstarters \u2014 and we are adding more new material based on stretch goals as detailed below. \n\nThe Lost City of Barakus, designed to take characters from 1st to 5th or 6th level (or higher), is as much of a campaign setting as an adventure. Detailed within these pages is the great, bustling metropolis of Endhome, the Penprie Forest and Duskmoon Hills located north of that city, and, finally, the huge dungeon that is the Lost City of Barakus. Within all these areas are many adventures, NPCs, and locations for the party to explore, interact with and conquer. How and in what order the party chooses to take on the various challenges before them is entirely yours (the GM\u2019s) and the players\u2019 choice.\nThough given specific location names, the adventure herein could easily be modified to fit in any campaign world. As always, change, add, modify, delete and alter as necessary to meet the needs and desires of you and your gaming group.\n\nAdventure Background\nCenturies ago, a race of humans built an elaborate underground city beneath the Duskmoon Hills called Barakus. These were a magic-loving people, and for hundreds of years they dwelled peacefully in their subterranean home, delving into the arcane arts. Eventually, however, one of their number, a necromancer named Devron, rose to great power and transformed himself into a lich. The wizards of Barakus banded together, and after a great struggle, banished him to a prison far below the city. Before his banishment, however, Devron forged the helm of power, which he could use to restore his power at some future point.\n\nThough Devron was locked away in a magical prison, the wizards of Barakus knew that someday he might use his powerful magic to somehow free himself, and so they created a weapon, the sword of Kell, which a mighty warrior could use against him. Because they wanted control over who got and used the sword, it was forged such that unless empowered in a specific room in Barakus with the use of three orbs of power which were themselves powered by three \u201cflames\u201d \u2014 small geometric shapes scattered throughout the city. The idea was that the three elders of the city must agree on a champion before they offered their flame: without complete agreement, the sword was useless.\nHowever, before a suitable champion could be found to battle Devron, the lich played a risky gambit. At great expense to personal power, he summoned a stone of madness, which erupted through the floor near the gates to his prison. This magical stone had the power to drive all sentient creatures mad. This it did, and the good people of Barakus soon destroyed themselves, and the city fell into ruin.\nCenturies passed. The stone of madness\u2019 power diminished and most of the city was freed from its effects. Eventually, creatures from the Under Realms and the surrounding wilderness began moving into the city and using its many halls and chambers for their lairs.\n\nBarakus is now a massive dungeon, filled with creatures that have their own designs and desires. Many of the inhabitants over the years have altered the layout of the city slightly to fit their needs, and hundreds of years of monstrous habitation has left the city\u2019s once-great halls filled with forgotten treasures and un-sprung traps.\nOf course, Devron still dwells deep beneath the earth in his magical prison, and as is the wont with trapped liches, he would like nothing more than to escape his prison and find his helm of power, which would restore the power he lost during his captivity. While exploring the city, the party may decide to find the sword of Kell, empower it, and go after Devron. The battle between the heroes and the lich is likely to serve as a climax to this adventure.\nAdd-Ons\n$15 The Lost City of Barakus Hero Lab Files - Hero Lab files allows customers to modify, print or use our NPCs in their home campaigns, fast and easy. It also allows them to export to online formats such as D20 Pro or other virtual tabletops.\nStretch Goals\nAll stretch goals for this Kickstarter will focus on additional content.\n$20,000 Bonus Dungeon Level 4B (UNLOCKED) - \"Hall of the Shield\" (written by WDBK Kenower, Bill Webb.) This level will add a new and powerful shield that the players will find highly useful during the end game and battle against Devron. Further, after the players leave the environs of Barakus, both the shield and Sword of Kell could take them to the next stage of their adventure in the depths of Rappan Athuk or in their quest for the Sword of Air.\n$22,500 New Wilderness Encounter (UNLOCKED) -  Bill will add an additional wilderness encounter of 2000-4000 words to the book. These encounters will include: mini-dungeons, monster lairs, new monsters, and new magical items never before seen in the Lost Lands. \n$25,000 New Wilderness Encounter (UNLOCKED) -  Bill will add an additional wilderness encounter of 2000-4000 words to the book. These encounters will include: mini-dungeons, monster lairs, new monsters, and new magical items never before seen in the Lost Lands.\n$27,500 New Wilderness Encounter (UNLOCKED) -  Bill will add an additional wilderness encounter of 2000-4000 words to the book.

(Add-On price $4 each for physical copy, $2 each for PDF copy)\n$45,000 Discounted Add-On Books (UNLOCKED) When the project is over we will offer existing Frog God Games books as Add-Ons. Most of these books will be discounted 10-50% off!!!  \n$50,000 Iconic PCs (UNLOCKED) Our existing Iconics will get an overhaul, and a few new ones will be joining the group. Use them as pre-gens, rival NPCs, or whatever you need them for!  \n$55,000 Full Color Region Map (UNLOCKED) This full color map shows a wide expanse of The Lost Lands from the Sinnar Ocean to the southern reaches of the March of Mountains and includes key locations that we've been to or heard rumor of such as Rappan Athuk and the Forest of Hope. An excellent addition to a Game Master's collection! (Add-On price of $8 each, $2 each for PDF copy)\nOur purpose in offering these stretch goals is not to make each one of you drastically raise your pledge, but instead to grow the number of gamers who are backing our project.

It is an old city with a colorful, often tragic history, a place where different races, cultures, and religions meet, sometimes blending and other times clashing. It\u2019s a city rich in the arts, where music and food are celebrations of life. Yet beneath it all, there is another city, a haunted place where mysterious cults worship in the surrounding swamps, sagging plantations hide terrifying secrets, and the sins of the past do not stay silent or unanswered. The dark and dangerous powers of the mythos are woven thickly into the tapestry of the Crescent City; they have always been and always will be.\nGolden Goblin Press is proud to present Tales of the Crescent City\u2014Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans.\nThis collection of 1920s adventures for 6th Edition Call of Cthulhu features scenarios by Stuart Boon, Daniel Harms, C. Michael Hurst, Oscar Rios, and Kevin Ross.  \nScenario Descriptions\nThe Quickening Spiral, by Stuart Boon - Wherein the investigators struggle to find a cure to a deadly plague sweeping across the city. Soon, they find themselves suffering the very same symptoms. As they race against time, they will stumble upon obsession, magic, and an evil mankind was never meant to encounter. \nNeedles, by Daniel Harms - Wild stories of mysterious figures kidnapping and performing medical experiments on their victims might be more fact than urban legend, as the investigators interrupt the shadowy figures known as the Needle Men in the middle of their latest abduction.\nBloodlines, by C. Michael Hurst - The investigators find themselves researching an ancient family, once prosperous, but now in decline. Their investigation leads them to a track of undeveloped swampland, a sinister developer, and a reclusive Indian tribe. The fetid swamps of Louisiana hide many things, like family secrets and deadly predators. \nSong and Dance, by Oscar Rios - Wherein the investigators are swept up in a calamitous event striking on New Year's Eve. Musicians, singers, dancers, choreographers, and composers all over New Orleans suddenly lose the ability to practice their art. Some simply fall dead while others go mad, some attempting to take their own lives. But the mysterious crisis is more dangerous than anyone knows and unless stopped, the world may never be the same.\nand... saving the best for last... Twenty five years ago, Chaosium released The Great Old Ones, and within it was a scenario set in New Orleans. \nIt was called \"Tell Me, Have You Seen The Yellow Sign?\", by Kevin Ross. In it the Most Honorable Krewe of the Swords was infiltrated by Papa Screech and the Cult of Hastur. This culminated in a summoning that allowed Carcosa to merge briefly with a haunted stretch of swamps outside of New Orleans. The investigators (hopefully) thwarted the cult, preventing it from granting the King In Yellow a human form to inhabit and restoring the barriers between our world and Carcosa, the realm of entropy.  \nBut then what happened?  Golden Goblin Press is deeply honored that Kevin Ross agreed to come out of retirement and tell us himself. It brings us great pleasure to offer you...\nAsylum - Return of The Yellow Sign, by Kevin Ross - Several years after the terrifying events in the swamp and the defeat of the Cult of Hastur, a strange figure arrives in New Orleans.  Why has he come, and from where? What does he want?  Why does he spread madness and terror wherever he appears?  What is that strange inexplicable symbol he wears, and why does he don a pale mask?  Is it a mask? It seems that the second act has begun, and for some, it will be a final curtain call.\nArt - We're pleased to have back with us Dean Engelhardt creating our player aids and Reuban Dodd as our cover and interior illustrator.  We're happy to welcome Steff Worthington as our cartographer.  For those of you who were lucky enough to get the bonus scenario from our last Kickstarter, \"Owlglass\", you may have noticed the layout style. That's the work of Mark Shireman, who'll be handling layout for this project.\nTimetable - This book has not only been fully written; it's well into editing and is poised to enter layout. We are determined to bring our backers a finished PDF, if not a physical book, within four months after the Kickstarter closes.  \nWe have nine supporter levels for backers to choose from, each named after a New Orleans neighborhood. Some of these supporter levels have a limited availability, so be sure to act fast if something appeals to you. Also, please note there is a +$15 shipping and handling fee for international backers.\nVisiting Tourist ($1 - $4) - Golden Goblin Press is eternally grateful for your support.\nMilneberg ($5 - $14) - Your name will be listed on the book's Thank You page.\nUptown ($15) -  Digital PDF copy of Tales from the Crescent City - Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans, and your name will be listed on the book's Thank You page.\nAlgiers ($35) -  Digital PDF and physical copy of Tales of the Crescent City - Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans, and your name will be listed on the book's Thank You page.\nMarigny ($50, only 200 available, ONE REMAINING!) - Digital PDF and physical copy of Tales of the Crescent City - Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans, your name will be listed on the book's Thank You page, and a physical copy of Secrets of New Orleans.\nNOMA Level ($50, only 100 available) \u2013 Digital PDF and physical copy of Tales of the Crescent City - Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans, your name will be listed on the book's Thank You page, and 6 high quality limited edition 8x10 art prints chosen from the project\u2019s interior illustrations one from each scenario (if stretch goal #8 is unlocked this will be increased to 7 art prints).

This will be included within Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans, allowing Keepers to really make the city come alive.\n#3 ACHIEVED!!!) $17,500 funded, Black Goat of New Orleans\u2013 Our friends at New Orleans Mythos are planning to publish a campaign set in their beloved city. While it\u2019s still a ways off our backers can get a sneak peak at it. If we achieve this stretch goal all backers at and above the Uptown level ($15) will receive a 24 page digital PDF copy of the initial scenario for their upcoming campaign project, Black Goat of New Orleans. \nBlack Goat of New Orleans, by New Orleans Mythos\u2013 A most unfortunate accident at college football game thrusts investigators to the crossroads of urban legend and Mythos horror. Footsteps from the electric lights and throbbing jazz, as something evil pulses beneath the oaks of City Park. He wants only the strongest, the most cunning, the least merciful. The rest shall die. \n#4 ACHIEVED!!!!) $22,500, Tell Me, Have You Seen the Yellow Sign (GGP Edition) \u2013 Before Kevin Ross began writing Asylum - Return of the Yellow Sign he decided to re-read his scenario Tell Me, Have you Seen the Yellow Sign. Although widely considered a classic which I personally would place in my top five 1920\u2019s scenarios of all-time list Mr. Ross was unhappy. All he could see were the various ways he\u2019d like to improve it. He wanted to do a complete re-write to correct the issues he found and to create an improved, longer, more open-ended version. I told him that Chaosium was doing something similar with certain scenarios in Horror on the Orient Express. Chaosium kindly and generously granted us permission to pursue this as a stretch goal. We are very pleased to offer our backers\u2026\nTell Me, Have You Seen the Yellow Sign (GGP Edition) \u2013 Kevin Ross is doing a line by line re-write of this scenario to improve organization, add new characters, and expand its otherworldly weirdness. This will be a much longer version of the original first printed in The Great Old Ones. This 6th scenario will significantly extend the length of Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans. All of the art, handouts, maps and layout will be completely redone to match the rest of the books aesthetic. Backers will now own BOTH Yellow Sign scenarios in a single book, offering a two part mini-campaign where investigators will battle the abhorrent influence of The King in Yellow across Jazz Era New Orleans.\nBUT WAIT\u2026 That\u2019s not all! Upon reaching this stretch goal every backer at or above the Algiers level will get an set of Official Golden Goblin Press Mardi Gras Beads!\nMock Up, Not Actual Beads\n#5 ACHIEVED!!!!!) $24,000, Legends of New Orleans- Golden Goblin Press is dedicated to bringing the fans new voices and helping develop a whole new crop of authors. Legends of New Orleans will be a PDF collection of non-mythos scenarios based on the historic folklore of the area by talented authors who might not have seen or are just getting to know. We hope to have Legends of New Orleans available in October. It is available free to backers at or above the Algires level and obtained as a $10 add on to any lower backer level. Legends of New Orleans is a semi-exclusive backers only item and won\u2019t be available to non-backers until April of 2015. \nInitially it contains two scenarios; although this could grow as later stretch goals are achieved. The initial pair of scenarios are : \nServa Me, by John A. Almack- Wherein the investigators uncover the haunting past surrounding a young lady's antique chest. Their investigation into local colonial history leads them from the Garden District to the French Quarter, as they seek to unravel a tragic and ghostly mystery in one of the most haunted cities on earth.\nNever Cry Wolf, by Mark Shireman\u2013 Rougarou, the word alone is enough to send a chill up the spines of the denizens of Acadiana; a human cursed to change into a beast that prowls the night, killing the unwary. The investigators respond to a series savage attacks on prominent citizens. Fear and suspicion quickly spreads fanned by sensational headlines and the claims of a respected priest, laying the blame for the attacks on a rougarou summoned by \"The Witch of Bayou Gentilly\".\n#6 ACHIEVED!!!!!!) $26,000, Meet Etienne-Laurent de Marigny- This character was created by H.P. Lovecraft and is one of the most famous New Orleans natives in the Cthulhu Mythos. He is described as \"this continent's greatest mystic, mathematician and orientalist\" and as a \"distinguished Creole student of mysteries and Eastern antiquities\". This important figure, the friend and financial executor of Randolph Carter, appears in multiple scenarios within Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans. This article will give Keepers everything they need to know to quickly drop this expert in the unknown into their home campaign. He is the perfect hook for Keepers looking to involve investigators in local mythos cases and an invaluable resource for advice, assistance, research, or possible rescue. We are thrilled to offer \u201cMeet Etienne-Laurent de Marigny\u201d as our 6th stretch goal, written by none other than the acclaimed Scott David Aniolowski. \n#7 ACHIEVED!!!!!!!) $27,500, MORE Legends of New Orleans- This bonus PDF will now contain two additional scenarios, for a total of four. For more details on the Legends of New Orleans PDF, please see Stretch Goal #5. The two additional scenarios are:\nDeliver Me from Evil, by Jon Hook- Wherein the investigators help an old friend retrieve his prodigal younger sister from the debauchery of New Orleans. However, she may have gotten involved with far worse things than smoking, jazz, gin, or the fellas. Her new friends and employers are not keen on letting her leave, nor are they technically alive. Break out the crosses, garlic, and holy water, boys and girls; it\u2019s going to be a LONG night.\nCurse of the Devil Baby, by Simon Yee\u2013 The story of the cursed Bowes family and their hideous demonic child is a well-known tale in New Orleans. The Devil Baby of Bourbon Street died long ago, and its terrifying story ended there. Or did it? The investigators are called upon by the surviving members of the Bowes family to recover something taken from them. The remains of a child, stolen out of a tomb marked only with an X, must be recovered at all costs.\n#8 ACHIEVED!!!!!!!!!!) $32,000, Five Lights in the Crossroads \u2013 Let\u2019s make Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans a truly massive book, rivaling the size of any scenario collection produced before now. Golden Goblin Press is very pleased to offer this final addition to the core book. This seventh scenario, by Jeffrey Moeller, will round out our collection in epic fashion.\nFive Lights in the Crossroads, by Jeffrey Moeller- What do the missing hand of a hanged convict, whispers from the mouth of a dead man, and the Loa of Voodoo ritual have in common? Tragic consequences, in this intimate, character driven tale of things man was not meant to know, exploring both traditional concepts of New Orleans folk magic and the dark corruption of Cthulhu Mythos.\nBut Wait! If we reach this stretch goal, every backer at and above the Algiers level will receive an 8X10 inch print of the cover art for Tales of the Crescent City - Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans. \n8X10 inch art prints & 16X20 inch posters!\n#9 ACHIEVED!!!!!!!!!!!) $33,500, Even More Legends of New Orleans -  This will add TWO more scenarios to the Legends of New Orleans PDF, bringing it to a total of six. These scenarios are written by Golden Goblin Alumni Tyler Hudak (you may remember him from Island of Ignorance-The Third Cthulhu Companion) and plucky newcomer Nick Nacario, who is trying to fight his way onto the Goblin Horde.  \n#10) $35,000, Photos from New Orleans Mythos - Our friends in the Big Easy have offered to take photographs of the iconic locations used in our scenarios. Many of these will be digitally altered to appear period to the 1920's and used to further augment the art in both Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans and Legends of New Orleans.\n#11) $37,500, A Dark and Deadly Dozen - A collection of four mini-PDF's released over the next four solstice / equinox with detail one dozen original creatures, cultists, mythos tomes, artifacts or places for use in your Jazz Era, New Orleans based Call of Cthulhu game. This will be a Backer semi-exclusive, not released to the public until summer 2015. The authors will be Brian Sammons, Bret Kramer and Tom Lynch.  \nA Few Words About Our Last Project - Golden Goblin Press released our first book last year after a successful Kickstarter.

Players work against one another to be the first to assemble a time machine using turn of the century \"Steam Punk\" inspired components.\nSteampunked is a simple game, made up of 4 different card types: Mad Scientists, Quackery, Components, and Actions. The core set is 60 cards and is designed for 2 players, but is easily expanded to play up to 6 players with the two expansions available through this Kickstarter (see add-ons).\n(2) Mad Scientist Cards - used to give each player a unique persona and special ability.\n(6) Special Mad Scientist Cards - these are 6 new playable characters sponsored by backers. They have new special abilities and an optional build list for a more challenging game experience.\n(12) Quackery Cards - used to give players energy in order to play component and action cards.\n(27) Component Cards - used to build a player's time machine.\n(13) Action Cards - used by players to perform special actions.\nPlayers start the game by choosing a Mad Scientist. Each Mad Scientist has a different special ability. Next, all the Quackery, Component and Action cards are shuffled together. Each player is dealt 7 cards and the game begins.\nEach player has 3 phases during their turn:\nQuackery Phase - If the player has any quackery cards face down on the field, they must flip them face up at this time.\nMain Phase - The player may play any card from their hand as long as they have enough energy to do so. Each point of energy is represented on the player's mad scientist and quackery cards. These cards are flipped face down as the energy on them is used up. Player may also draw additional cards and/or discard cards at a cost of 1 energy per card drawn or discarded.\nEnd Phase - the player counts their cards. If they have less than 7, they draw cards until they have 7. If they have 8 or more, they discard until they have 7.\nThe first player to assemble their 9-part time machine and end their turn wins the game. However, this is easier said than done. This is the point in the game where the fur really starts to fly! Action cards are played in rapid succession as your opponents attempt to break and disassemble your machine in order to get parts for their own creation. The only way to assure your victory is to employ a multitude of strategies including, hording parts, conserving energy, forming alliances, and, of course, breaking said alliances at the most opportune moment!\nMad Scientist, Mad Scientist (Expansion #1), Mad Scientist (Expansion #2) - Work with our artists to have your name and likeness used for one of six new playable characters in the Steampunked Core Set, Expansion #1, or Expansion #2.

Get out your favourite sword, your best magic spells and/or your most-cunning stealth boots and set upon performing the will of the Emperor in solving the mystery of the \"magical accident\" that threatens the whole realm.\nJourney to the epicentre of the magical accident - The City - where your former Magical Masters whom trained you in the ways of magic have unleashed magical energies beyond their control and created forces that threaten the whole Empire. Can you discover the cause of the accident? Can you discover the truth behind the cause? Can you reverse it, or hold its encroach or merely stop its flow? Will you discover the real deep, dark truth and what will you do with this knowledge? Step forward, Hero...\nFeatures\nPlay your way. Do the main quest first or go off and do side-quests or just go off and explore. It's up to you.\nChoose a pre-made ready-to-go character class or create your own character class by allocating points to attributes and skills.\nDeal with adversaries via melee, magic, stealth or a combination of all three - it's up to you how to play.\nLevel up your character by gaining experience in using your skills - grow your character your way.\nExplore and/or loot: most of the world locations will be available to you from the start - just make sure you're not too low level for some of the areas!\nEndlessly extendible via content made by fans of the game. Basic mod tools will be released after the game ships (enhanced mod tools will be part of the stretch goals).\nSilicon Game Engine\nThis is a game engine made by myself. It needs work to polish some things and to finish up other things. Its current state has all the things required for a game engine (in various states of completion) is what is being used to made the launch videos. Expect more game engine videos during the lifetime of this Kickstarter campaign; I'll be putting them up on my YouTube channel and linking them in updates to this page!\nGame Engine Features\nCurrently running on PC. Other platforms possible in the future but not currently within the scope of this game project.\nMulti-core engine. The engine can use however many CPU cores your processors has for enhanced physics, etc. Dual-core processor? Fine. Hyper-threaded quadcore cpu (8 threads)? Fine. Hyper-threaded hexacore cpu (12 threads)? Fine.\n3D engine built on Irrlicht, Ogre3D and 6DX.\n3D engine supports Forward Rendering, Deferred Rendering, Hybrid Rendering and simple Ray Tracing with full Post-Process support.\nMulti-core physics via Bullet Physics.\nRigid body, soft body, fluids, cloth and water physics via Bullet.\nProcedual Tree Generation - make endless varieties of trees.\nPath-finding and steering via OpenSteer.\nHuman-readable data files, where possible, for easy tweaking.\nMassive resolution skies and sky-boxes exported from third-party app Bryce.\nOriginal animation files from Truebones Motions. [Modified for use in the engine.]\nCharacter creation, rigging, skinning and animation via Milkshape3D.\nCharacter rigging, skinning and animation via Ultimate Unwrap Pro.\nOriginal building models and props from Arteria3D.com. [Modified for use in the engine.]\nScene editor: IrrEdit from Ambiera with extensions written by myself.\nMulti-core sound engine irrKlang from Ambiera.\nMost sounds and music are licensed from ArteriaMusic.com.\nAlso using parts of the OpenAL SDK.\nxNormal tool used for normal maps/parallax occlusion maps.\nScripting: Squirrel and LUA.\nOptional Full-scene Anti-Aliasing via FXAA from nVidia.\nStory\nThe story is something I have been putting together over a long period along with other copious notes in my \"Tim Schafer\" style notebook. There are some nice twists in there and the ending is \"interesting\" to say the least, but to give any of that away would completely spoil the game. If you want to know more you will have to back the game. :-)\nBTW The main character of the story is gender agnostic - you can choose to be Male or Female to start off as the Emperor's Champion, and there are neither rewards nor penalties for the choice.\nYour background story details what you did after leaving the University Of Magic many years ago in your youth and basically describes how you got to be the character class that you start the game with.\nYou are sent off on your quest in dubious circumstances. Your initial target is the University Of Magic, where you were taught magic in your youth by the Magic Masters. And since you are travelling to an area that is highly dangerous and in high magical flux you somehow end up waking up in a dungeon with no equipment and Level 1 and feeling weak, both magically and strength-wise. Exactly how and why this came about may unfold during your questing. Anyway, your first order-of-the-day will be to get yourself out of Tutorial Dungeon, looting, I mean Treasure Hunting, what you can in the process and start your adventures!\nQuests\nThe open-ended nature of the game means that you can do quests when you please. Main quests and side-quests will generally be available to-do as required. Also, when the mod tools (SDK) are released there will hopefully be the option of many, many fan-made missions that will enhance the longevity of the game.\nEnemies\nIf you have played any fantasy RPG games before then you will have a good idea of what's going to be coming at you (or maybe aiding you, as a summon). Undead, ghosts, skeletons, rats, goblins, dwarves, etc.\nCombat\nHit stuff with shiny swords, rusty battle-axes and huge war-hammer things. Find out what works and what does not. Edged weapons on skeletons may not do much, for example. Build up your character stats to focus on combat or spread your level-up points to build a more rounded character - it's up to you.\nThere are unique weapons out there for you to loot, steal, find and pry from the fingers of deadly enemies...if you can.\nBTW Yes, I realise that \"melee\" has an apostrophe on the end \"e\".\nMagic\nChange the nature of the world, change yourself or even create matter from nothing (from magical energy actually - the law of conservation applies here).\nExamples: unlock doors; turn invisible; summon climbable crates; summon skeleton allies; throw missiles of fire/frost/stone/etc.; jump over high walls (and break your legs on the descent?).\nFunding Goal\nPlease help get this project made by helping me reach and, ideally, exceed the funding goal. The more money I can raise the better game I can make. If the funding goal is not met then, as things stand at the moment, this project will almost certainly not be made.\nBuy a copy for yourself; buy a copy for a friend; buy a copy for Sunday Best; buy a copy for your cat, as we all know cats love fantasy RPG's; if you think the game sounds rubbish, buy a copy for someone you don't like!\nStretch Goals\nI have ideas for stretch goals, such as increasing the amount and quality of the content, but the details are not really relevant until the initial funding goal is met. If the funding goal is not met then this project will almost certainly not be made. Lets get over the first major hurdle first and then we can discuss stretch goals!\nBacker Rewards\nThe game has been priced in the Backer's Rewards in such a way so that backing the game now will be cheaper than buying the game once it it released. If you want the game at a reduced price compared to retail then back the project now!\nAll backers will have their names listed in a Thank You Backers! section in the game credits or the game website. the eagle-eyed among you will notice that the backer rewards are all things that are easily producible  and deliverable by myself - this is for ease of fulfilment. Some backer rewards have been restricted in quantity in order to ensure that the production and/maintenance of said reward doesn't get too overwhelming.\nOh, and if someone backs the BOSS reward and they want a Dragon boss or a character with an arrow in their knee then I cannot be held responsible. ;-)\nPlease note that I cannot make characters or content that impinges upon the copyright of other games, though I will try my best to comply with backers' wishes.\nBeta, Modding Tools and Steam Release\nThe current plan is to release for PC only on the Steam platform. This will allow those Backers who have chosen to take part in the Beta phase to obtain the Beta version of the game from Steam once it is ready, for delivery of the game, for patches and updates to the game and for the Steam Workshop for a common place to find and download user-made mods.\nA completely DRM-free version of the game may be offered but this will probably be subject to stretch goals.\nOf course, this is subject to the game been accepted on Steam. If we have not been accepted on Steam at the point in time when the Beta is ready then we will have to look at Plan B.\nScreenshots\nIn-game screenshot\n  irrEdit scene editor for Silicon RPG\nIn-game building model with real-time Ambient Occlusion\nAbove in-game building - showing real-time Ambient Occlusion only.\nSilicon RPG scene editor - boat scene\nScene editor showing procedural trees\nIn-game screenshot - Castle\nIn-game screenshot - wonder what lurks in this Dungeon...\nIn-game screenshot: wonder if he'll attack me if I loot that chest?\nIn-game screenshot: there's a black cat named Charl there somewhere in this scene...\nThere's Charl! [internet cookie for you if you know who Charl is]\nI said \"no dragons\"! This isn't the rim of the sky, you know...\nRequirements\nSystem requirements have not yet been finalised, but we are looking in the order of a dual-core 2.6Ghz CPU, Windows Vista/7/8/8.1, DirectX9, Shader Model 3 video card with 512KB of video memory and 2GB of system RAM.

Brian Young explores the Nine Worlds of the northmen, the legends and myths, the magical creatures, gods, heroes, giants and monsters that peopled them.\nAll this is presented as a back drop to the game you are already playing. Expanding upon the core of C&C material Codex Nordica brings a host of new wizardry and enchantments, gods for the characters, warriors and battle craft.

You'll need dice and that's about it to begin your journeys through a ruined Earth. A quick list of what you can obtain through this kickstarter includes:\nThe Fall of Man Corebook with all the knowledge you need to play right at the beginning for Pathfinder with PDF conversions for 13th Age, Fate and Castles & Crusades (SIEGE).\nA Kickstarter Exclusive 32+ page bonus book full of additional \"crunch\" content for your players.\nThe Hunt: Rise of Evil original setting and possible PDF bonus books based on the social media campaign.\nA large number of stretch goal bonus PDF books from an arms and equipment guide, detailed locales, adventures and even possibly additional setting content from Ed Greenwood.\nA Limited Edition book (with glow in the dark cover) with a full color map of the United States post-apocalypse.\nThe ability to get any of the PDF books printed and shipped right to your door.\nOriginal Art pieces from our Artists.\nEven game sessions with the Fall of Man creators.\nThis book will be a 320 page tome with a black and white interior and will include:\n* The entire game/setting created by the ENnie nominated team from Samurai Sheepdog that can be played immediately. The base RPG is compatible with Pathfinder, 13th Age, Fate, and Castles and Crusades (SIEGE)!\n* 11 new races and 11 new classes.\n* Combat tracking and character sheets ready to be copied...everything you need to start!\n* A starting adventure to let you jump right in and start playing.\n* A short story written by Richard Lee Byers based on the iconic Fall of Man characters on the cover!\nWhen the world was to end, inexplicably, it did not.\nThe year is 2061, 30 years since the meteor known as Satan\u2019s Maul slammed into the Atlantic Ocean, causing what scientists predicted should have been an extinction level event.\nHowever, Earth had ties beyond those known to man. When all our technology had failed us and our world was being torn asunder, it was magic which stitched and scabbed the world whole again. Today technology and magic fight a silent war for domination; the One God of Earth battles the many gods of Gothos; the magic world merged with earth to sustain it and humans fight for survival in a world now infested with orcs, dragons, elves and even more nightmarish creations.\nWelcome to the Fall of Man.\nClasses:\nIn Fall of Man there are 11 core (starting) classes to choose from that advance through 20th level. Each has its own unique set of skills and abilities.\nArcanist (ARC): A learned spell caster who studies the arcane arts in order to work magic in the fallen world.\nAsphalt Samurai (ASI): A street smart warrior who wields both blade and gun that follows a strange tradition of ancient Bushido codes.\nCleric of the Many Gods (CLR): A divinely charged spell caster and warrior who is a devout follower and prophet for the many gods that crossed over from Gothos.\nDreamwalker (DRM): A martial artist who has connected with Mindar: God of Dreams and is able to alter reality with their waking dream-state.\nFace (FCE): A gifted and charismatic wheeler dealer who is great at bartering as well as lying, cheating, etc.\nGifted, The (GIF): A strange mutant who is naturally gifted with the powers of the arcane.\nMechanist (MEC): A technology wizard who studies the old tech stuff from before the fall.\nPriest of the One God (PRE): The divinely powered followers of Earth's only God before the many Gods of Gothos arrived.\nScavenger: (SCV): A packrat and thief of the new fallen world. Stealthy and clever with an eye for the value of junk.\nSoldier (SLD): A well trained warrior who is adept at the fine art of modern combat.\nWasteland Barbarian: (WLB): Feral mutant savages who are ferocious warriors.\nThe Fall of Man corebook will introduce Advanced and Master classes, which will be available in future supplements. Both Advanced classes, available after 10th level, and Master classes, available after 20th level, will be able to advance past the normal 20th level of most characters.\nRaces:\nHumans: Humans are the surviving native race of Earth and once dominated the planet with powerful technology. Now, the race of man is in a steep decline and competing with the other newly arrived races for basic survival.\nCanite: The Canites are said to be a creation of the stuff of the dream world.  Anamorphic canines, the proud and loyal canite race now run in packs and are well known for their ability to hunt and track.\nDwarf: The Dwarves of Earth have secluded themselves away underground and only a few venture forth to adventure. Some speculate whether this is because of their desire to live alone or due to some other, darker secrets.\nElf: Many of the Elf race were the first to head the warnings of Midnar and take action to preserve their kind in the merging of Gothos and Earth. However some others either did not heed the call or were unable to prepare and now walk the earth \u201cblasted\u201d with foul spirit and intent.\nGnome (The Twisted): Gnomes were once considered to be a happy race. Similar to Halflings in stature, the gnomes were small but had big hearts. They are now cursed in the transition to Earth with something called \"the bent.\" This has gained gnomes the terrible name \u201cThe Twisted\u201d.\nHalflings: True to form, the Halflings seemed to avoid the various afflictions that occurred to most of the other races in the transition to Earth. In fact, halflings seem to now be able to affect the world itself with their stories and song.\nHalf-Elf: Like most half-breeds, the Half-Elf is a displaced creature, especially on Earth after the fall. Sharing both Elven and Human traits, they seem to not fit in with either race.\nHalf-Orc: The Half-Orc is generally thought of as a down trodden sub-race. They are not as smart as humans and not as strong or robust as pure orcs which seems to put them at a disadvantage but they make up for it in raw tenacity.\nHanites: Hanites are a new species of being which originated from man and who will be further previewed during the Kickstarter.\nMutant (Template): In a world where technology, magic, radiation, and toxic effects exist, mutation was inevitable.  Unlike the other races, mutant is a template which is added on top of another race\u2019s abilities.\nReborn: When the first reborn appeared shortly after all the devastation, no one knew what to make of them, instantly assuming they were zombies or something worse. Their ashen, dead, cold skin and their white dead eyes made them obvious targets for undead hunters. It was not for quite some time before someone figured out the reborn were not truly undead and were not always evil or good, being much like humans in this regard.\nWhat makes this setting different: \nIn Fall of Man, it is a fight for survival.\nThe world is warped, twisted and everyone is severely flawed and conflict abounds, even between players. And through that conflict, both roleplaying and tangible game effects engage the players to interact beyond simple camaraderie around the table; it is you vs. the world (GM) and each other.  \nTechnology vs. Magic; The One God vs the Pantheon; Real vs. Imagined; all of these things collide to make a world both familiar yet new.\nCombat is harsh and gritty, but still allows for long term progression and the capacity for heroic deeds.\nAnd everything is not what it seems...  Even among the characters themselves as they evolve not just in their classes, but in their racial and physical (mutant) features.\nFrom the world's pain, we gain a place in which GM's can explore their darkest nightmares and manifest them for their players while the players themselves have the opportunity to respond in kind.\nGothic Horror and Fantasy in a Post Apocalyptic setting. That's what sets Fall of Man apart. \nSystems: This setting is based on the Pathfinder system on steroids. If you have played in a d20 system you will be familiar with the basic rules. It will also be available for 13th Age, FATE and Castles & Crusades (SIEGE), with specialists in each system doing the conversions.\nInformational Videos\nHere is a video we made discussing the Barter and Trade system that is included in the Fall of Man:\nPLAY\n\nAll backers of + levels will receive a 32 page PDF of bonus player character content including new feats, alternate class and racial features, equipment and other goodies.

Please feel free to have a look through my portfolio and contact me for any further information or samples.\nI'll try and tell you a little about myself without taking up too much of your valuable time! I have always had an interest in drawing and as a result decided that an artistic career was for me. I graduated from the University of South Australia studying Visual Communication. After a brief stint working in graphic and web design I made the move into the entertainment art industry and worked as a professional Concept Artist, Creative Director, Art Director and Illustrator/Designer for a range of clients and companies.\nHerald of Thanato\nGill Pearce My name is Gillian Pearce although I do prefer to be called Gill. I tend to lurk around online using the nicknames Hellion or Kharnate. I divide my time between my day job working in a local school and illustrating on a freelance basis. I also help out as art director for Dark Quest Games. I have been illustrating professionally for approximately 12 years now and I have numerous publishing credits in various fields ranging from book cover and interior illustration, card game artwork, role-playing game illustration and cartography. My artwork is created using traditional methods and very little in the way of computer enhancement aside from map labels and the like. My colour work is produced using a heady mix of watercolour and acrylic paint with a hint of ink and pencil and my black and white work is primarily achieved using fine-liners, although I do occasionally indulge in black and white pencil work. I like to consider myself versatile when it comes to subject matter and will tackle sci-fi, horror, fantasy scenes, figures, monsters and maps with the same enthusiasm.\nCity of Pavis\nWar Dragon\nRoel Wielinga has been described as a \"DREAMER\", a description that suits almost every aspect of the artist.

Portrait, Fantasy, Realism, and Science Fiction Art has always been a big part of Roel's life.\nFoM races\n Jhoneil Centeno is a Filipino/American artist best known for his fantasy cover paintings of several d20 books.

They will do it in their own, unique, fun way! \nScale - Map Flats are sized in inches and scaled at 1 square = 1 inch. Because this is compatible with most tabletop RPGs and 28mm miniatures games, 1 square is roughly equivalent to 5 feet.\nWet Erase-able - I use my Expo Vis-a-Vis pens on these all the time and they work like magic!\nDurable - These maps have a +100 bonus vs. water, milk, soda, energy drinks, baby wipes and household cleaning products. \nHigh Def - Yup, these babies are better than real life! Printed at 1440 dpi. \nSimpler Solution - These bad mama-jamas are tons easier to haul to your next gaming session than 3D terrain and hold up better than any card-stock or cardboard maps that exist on the market currently.\nModular - These maps do not bind you to keep re-playing the same set up over and over. You can arrange and re-arrange the settings as much as you need to.\nAffordable - You've seen a lot of maps out there, and sometimes, as a broke gamer, it's not always attainable to get decent quality maps that will hold up against the vicious battles that will be waged on them. It is our goal to provide not a decent quality map, but a STELLAR quality map at a price that a financially impaired GM can justify. \nD'Nal and the Hathonian Plains -\nHuh??? That's right, we decided to create a world around these maps! We're that cool! \nThat's not to say, or deter you from using them in other known worlds by any means. We simply want to paint the canvas of a new and exciting world for you to throw your unwitting players into! \nD'Nal - is a large continent in the world of Etheros. D'Nal is rich in culture, crops, mystery, and adventure. We start our Map Flats sets with the Hathonian Plains.\nHathonian Plains - The plains on D'Nal take of most of the center mass of the continent. The elevation and climate are perfect for growing crops and raising livestock. Inhabited mostly by human peasants and famers, the wealth is found in the soils of the farmsteads. \nThe plains, however, are also home to monsters of all shape, size and intelligence. Under the Hothonian Empires protection, the vast plains are filled with pockets of unwatched and unexplored territories. \nThe houses and structures found on the Hathonian Plains can act as a sanctuary to weary travelers, or as the setting for terrible acts that only the heroes can face and survive. \nBring on the samples!!\nPLAY\n\nHathonian Tavern: What noteworthy adventure doesn't involve a tavern? A sinister plot, meeting with a new employer, or just looking for a brawl. The tavern has always been a key component to storytelling.\nTavern\n Farm House: A great setting for a side quest, the scene of a dastardly deed, or just a place to catch some shut eye on the road to journeys end.\nFarm House\n What you will get: \nWhat you get solely depends on your pledge level... but we all know that.

It is said that a great fire destroyed the city and all of it\u2019s surroundings. It was a fire so terrible that to this day even vegetation will not grow on the lands. This does not mean that the area is void of life. Many adventurers seek ancient treasures and glory in the crater, but few return. Those unfortunate few, however, return with grim stories of strange and distorted creatures prowling the barren lands, taking refuge in the crumbled remains of a long forgotten city. At this level we will include the following maps: \n(Qty: 1) Surm Kara Crater Terrain Map (3'X5')\n(Qty: 4) Scavenger tent (4X5)\n(Qty: 1) Chieftains domicile (6X6)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 1 (12X10)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 2 (10X8)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 3 (8X6)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 4 (6X4)\nCity of EeSos Teaser:\nThe great city of EeSos is located on the Tounge of D\u2019Nal, a plateau that hangs over the ocean. The city is home to tens of thousands including the King of D\u2019Nal. The city is rich with culture, but also has it's own secrets.\nDeep beneath this city, hundreds of feet under the plateau, are the docks. This is the main hub of exports, imports and black market dealings.  \nThe docks are connected to the city by stalagmites and stalactites that have fused together over thousands of years. The stalagmites are enormous in size, some so large that they hold the homes of the peasants and other merchants who reside under the plateau.  \nThis teaser set will include 10 additional maps including:  \n4 structures from the city\n4 structures from under the plateau\n1 City Map\n1 Map of the 'Pillars'\n*Virtual orders that qualify for stretch goals will be delivered in virtual products. So if you have pledged for virtual maps, you will get the stretch goals in virtual formats. Also if you have pledged for vinyl and virtual maps, you will receive both formats of stretch goals.\nBackground: \nThe Map Flats concept came from Ted's love of high quality graphic game maps and his inept ability to transfer the images in his mind to the mats he was gaming on. An avid Gen Con attendee, he admired the 3 dimensional gaming supplements but immediately recognized the inherent problem of 'easy transport' of the pieces. Also, there is a limit to customizing those pieces during play. When you draw on them, typically the only way to 'erase' the markings is to re-paint them.\nMap Flats was then born. It started with putting together a small collection of commonly used structures and items\nWe're also participating in Kicking it Forward. This is an amazing project where we pledge to give back 5% of our profit to other Kickstarter projects. We have a great community here and we're proud to be a part of it as both creators and backers!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want to utilize Kickstarter as a tool for several reasons. One is to get a strong feel for the market for this product as well as get funding for more map genres and expansions. We also want to raise awareness of these awesome products and try to get them into gaming stores all over. With your help, we can achieve national exposure and get more exciting maps and genres underway!\nWhere's the money going? \nIn short, production, packaging, artwork, shipping and marketing. The goal is to continue producing high quality maps for you to use in all your game genres and create a new world for your gamers to explore. \nRETAILERS:\nWant to sell Map Flats at your store?

All original stretch goals unlocked!\nUpdate: Pledges of $20 or more will now also receive the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\"Honestly, we wouldn't have been able to tell the stories we wanted to tell in Pathfinder without the Advanced Bestiary.\"\nF. Wesley Schneider\nEditor-in-Chief, Paizo Publishing\n\nIn 2005 Green Ronin Published the Advanced Bestiary for the d20 System. It was a monster book that took the idea of templates and ran with it. The Advanced Bestiary featured over 100 new templates and sample monsters built using them. It was a terrific toolkit and added value to every monster book GMs already owned. For years people have been asking us to do a Pathfinder version of the Advanced Bestiary and with your help, we are going to do it!\n  The rules revisions are already well under way. The question is, what will the book\u2019s final format be? We are starting with the assumption that the book will be a 264-page hardback with a black and white interior like the original, and that we\u2019ll keep the book\u2019s existing art. Really though, we want to give you a full color hardback with all new art! That\u2019s built into the stretch goals of this Kickstarter, so the final format is up to you all!\n\nUpdate: Full color printing and all new art are unlocked! \n\nYou Can\u2019t Eat Accolades! \nThe Advanced Bestiary got great reviews as soon as it was released. This was in the later days of the d20 era, when it was harder to impress people and much harder to have a hit book. The critics loved it and sales were solid. Mission accomplished, right? Well, no, as it turned out. The Advanced Bestiary and two other titles (The Black Company and Egyptian Adventures: Hamunaptra) had the misfortune of coming out when our fulfillment company (Osseum Entertainment) was dying and stealing money from our sales to stay afloat. Those three big, expensive-to-print products all sold pretty well\u2014and we saw not a dime of that money. We were, of course, still on the hook for all the associated bills: writing, editing, printing, art, etc. What should have been a triumph thus turned into a disaster. I remember figuring out at one point that for every dollar we paid the designer, Green Ronin lost three dollars. The \u201cOsseum Debacle,\u201d as we came to call it, nearly killed Green Ronin Publishing. We managed to survive though and slowly paid down all of our associated debts. \nThe fact that the Advanced Bestiary became a cornerstone book for Pathfinder development has thus always been bitter sweet. We were certainly flattered that Paizo used the Advanced Bestiary in so many of its own books and we were glad players and GMs got so much use out of it. You can\u2019t eat accolades though, so for years I had hoped we could bring this book back and actually turn a profit on it. \nEarlier this year we did a highly successful Pathfinder Kickstarter for our Freeport city setting. Last month I hired Owen K.C. Stephens to be our Pathfinder developer for Freeport and more. I believe now that the Stars are Right for the return of the Advanced Bestiary! Let\u2019s make it happen, Pathfinder fans! \nThe Stretch Goals \nAs I mentioned, we want this book to be full color and featuring all new art. We\u2019ve baked that into the stretch goals and we are revealing them all so you can see what we ultimately hope to achieve with this campaign. We are also keeping expansion of the book fairly limited by design because we want to have the finished product out to backers next July. The more we might add, the longer this would take, so we are capping the new material at 32 pages. Note, however, that there were originally five web enhancements to the Advanced Bestiary and we\u2019ll be including all of those in the new book. \nd20Pro Add-on\nd20Pro is a Virtual Table Top (VTT) program that allows pen-and-paper gaming groups to play online and now you can buy d20Pro files for the Advanced Bestiary for only $10. Simply add $10 to your pledge and you'll get the files when they are released. They will be available to the public later for $15, so this is a great deal for d20Pro Users.\nFantasy Grounds Add-on\nYou also have the option of Fantasy Grounds support for the Advanced Bestiary! Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table. If you'd like Fantasy Grounds files with your Advanced Bestiary, just add $10 to your pledge!\nThe Rewards\nHere are the reward levels for the Advanced Bestiary!\n\nHISTORIC BEAST: You get a PDF of the original (3.5 d20 rules) Advanced Bestiary. All higher pledges also receive this PDF. \n\nE-BEAST: You get a PDF of the finished Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG. You (and all higher pledges) also get the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\nHEROIC E-BEAST: You get a PDF of the finished Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG, plus Hero Lab files for the whole book.\n\nEARLY BIRD BEAST: The first 300 people to pledge get print and PDF copies of the finished Advanced Bestiary, plus the Hero Lab files, for only $45!  \nFREEPORT E-BEAST: You get a PDF of the new Freeport: The City of Adventure book for Pathfinder (from our previous Kickstarter) in addition to a PDF of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.\n BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG.  \nRETAIL BEAST: This is a special tier for retail stores only. You get 2 copies of the Advanced Bestiary mailed to your US-based store. You must be a confirmed brick and mortar retailer to qualify for this tier (and yes, we will check!).  Add $30 for international stores.\nHEROIC BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary for the Pathfinder RPG, plus Hero Lab files for the whole book. \nFREEPORT BEAST: You get a print and PDF copy of the new Freeport: The City of Adventure book for Pathfinder (from our previous Kickstarter) in addition to a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.\nBEAST MASTER: You get to work with developer Owen Stephens to create a new sample creature for one of the book's templates. Owen will work with you to create an awesome creature/template combo and to name the resulting monster! You will be credited in the final book, of course. Choices are subject to our approval. You also get a print and PDF copy of the Advanced Bestiary and its Hero Lab files.

Our second Kickstarter, Freeport: The City of Adventure for the Pathfinder RPG, is well under way and should release of May of this year. The real risk for the Advanced Bestiary is that Freeport will take longer than finish than we anticipate and push this book back. The two projects share a developer (Owen Stephens) but have completely separate design teams. We thus believe that risk should be minimal.\n\nGreen Ronin has been in business since 2000 and in that time we've published over 150 books.

I can give a monster more actions by GM fiat -- that's not the problem -- but short of converting the monster to mythic I have no guidance anywhere from any authoritative source regarding the CR implications of doing so.

Initial Goal $3,000.00: Rite Publishing will create 4 new issues of Adventure Quarterly including all new custom cartography by Tommi Salama (we will no longer be using computer programs like Dunjinni or Campaign Cartographer to create our cartography, instead going with a hand-drawn style)\nUNLOCKED: 1st Stretch Goal $4,750.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art in issue #5 (we will no longer be using stock art).\nUNLOCKED 2nd Stretch Goal $6,500.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art in issue #6 (we will no longer be using stock art), also if we hit this goal I will include Coliseum Morpheuon PDF (PFRPG) as a complimentary bonus for all $10.00 or higher backers. \nUNLOCKED 3rd Stretch Goal $8,250.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art in issue #7(we will no longer be using stock art), also if we hit this goal I will include The Gift PDF (PFRPG) as a complimentary bonus for all $10.00 or higher level backers. \n4th Stretch Goal  $10,000.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art (we will no longer be using stock art in any issue); aslo if we hit this goal, I will incude 101 Not So Random Encounters Urban PDF (PFRPG) as a complimentary bonus for all $10.00 or higher level backers. \nCartography by Tommi Salama\nCartography by Tommi Salama\nCartography by Tommi Salama\nCover image for Adventure Quarterly Issue #5\n Illustration by Dallas Williams\nIllustration for Issue #5 by Gordon Napier\nIllustration from Issue #5 by Ian Greenlee\nAdventure Quarterly #4\nAdventure Quarterly #3\nAdventure Quarterly #2\nAdventure Quarterly #1", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRite Publishing has already shown it can produce 4 issues of this product with high quality writing and editing as well as beautiful cover artwork. Our challenge now is bringing in high quality custom cartography and after a dedicated search we have chosen a talented professional in Tommi Salama. \n\nOur next challenge is to keep him on schedule, however even if Tommi where to become unavailable Rite Publishing has a history of working with talented cartographers just as the Ennie award winning Jonathan Roberts (George R.R. Martin's Lands of Ice and Fire poster maps, and the Fantastic Maps line) and James \"Devin Night\" Hazelett (Devin Night's Tokens). So even if something were to go wrong we have back up plans. \n\nRite Publishing has been in business for over 5 years and has two current ongoing kickstarters Kaidan and A Novel Set in Dream. We are on track to fulfill these two projects and we have a long track record of fulfilling our crowdfunding projects. \n\nDirect Crowdfunding\nHeroes of the Jade Oath: Fullfilled \nA Witch's Choice: Fullfiled \nTo Kill or Not to Kill: Fullfiled \nRace for the Crystal Fold Fullfiled \nLitorians: Fullfiled \nColiseum Morpheuon: Fullfiled \nCurse of the Golden Spear Trilogy Fullfiled \nThe Breaking of Fostor Nagar: Fullfilled \n\nVia Kickstarter\nThe Demolished Ones : Fullfilled \nLords of Gossamer and Shadow Fullfilled\n\nThis works because no one from an ongoing project is working on the same project. For example Kaidan's author Jonathan McAnulty is not writing for Adventure Quarterly, Kaidan has its own cartographer, layout artist, artists, and editor who don't work on Adventure Quarterly. While author Matt Banach is not working on Adventure Quarterly and is only working on his Novel (he has turned over the intitial rough draft. \n\nRite Publishing believes in weekly updates and transparency. For example:\n\nWith Lords of Gossamer & Shadow we released the PDF to customers on time on Sept 30th 2013, and we released the print version to backers on November 7th 2013. \n\nAdventure Quarterly #5 is already written, we already have a cover image, The first adventurres map is completed, and its in editing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "This Concludes Our Broadcast", "update_content": "Backers!!!\nAll backers have now received the PDF of all 8 Adventure Quarterly Products! \nAll backers that were due a softcover versions of Adventure Quarterly have been sent their products.

Now about once a year I suffer from a spasm that comes from strain put on my lower back (this time it happened while I was vomiting due to illness). This requires that I go on pain meds, muscle relaxer, and bed rest. This makes it near impossible to get work done, due to drug induced fatigue and pain if I try to moderate the drugs. I would rather heal quickly by listening to my doctor than cause a long-term problem. If anything changes, I will post an update.

I am better now, but I wanted you to know what is going on.\nBeyond that, I have had another projects shipping fall in the middle of Issue #8s Shipping, so this has caused significant delays. We have learned in the future we will be using an outside fulfillment service. So unless you have gotten a notice from me that it has shipped, its not the mail its Me.
