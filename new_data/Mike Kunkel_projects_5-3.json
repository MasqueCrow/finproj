Animation is everywhere.\nAnd although most people who enjoy animated content can quickly list their favorite characters, movies, shows or video game, those very same people are unable to name a single individual who worked on or helped create the very thing they love to watch.\nOver the last two decades, animation has grown at an astounding rate, and is now inhabited by thousands of unique and bizarre characters.\nBut I\u2019m not talking about the unique and bizarre characters you see on the screen. I\u2019m talking about the wonderful, unique and bizarre characters behind the scenes, who have devoted their lives to follow a crazy dream, and enter the world of animation, with its infinite creative possibilities.\nUnfortunately, most of the time, the only proof that these people actually worked on a project is their name zipping by, way too fast, on the credit scroll at the end of a movie, show or game.\n\u201cAn Animated Conversation\u201d hopes to change that by introducing to the public some of the incredibly creative and talented people that have chosen animation as their profession, and have enriched the world because of it.\nThis show will give the public a glimpse into a world where the public knows more about the animated characters on screen then about the people who create them.\nEach episode will feature at least five talented and creative animation industry professionals. Some will be new to the industry and other will be seasoned-veterans. The one thing that they will all have in common is an original and personal opinion or point of view about animation and the animation industry.\nThe intimate setting of a round table will create a mood where all the guests can share personal thoughts, feelings and experiences both good and bad about the industry that they've chosen to be apart of. The audience will view the show through five cameras that will surround the guests and the table, giving the viewer a \u201cfly on the wall\u201d perspective of the conversation.\nThis show will give unprecedented insight into the animation industry through each guest stories and experiences.\nThe public has never had access or insight into the minds of these talented animation professionals.\nDuring each episode, the guests will be encouraged to share stories about their experiences at art school, their first jobs in animation, and obstacles that they've had to overcome during their climb to the top of this fields. This show will give these professionals an opportunity to share their stories and hopefully inspire the next generation of animators, creators, directors and designers. And the public will be introduced to the people behind some of the best known and most influential animated programs, movies and video games. For the most part the people that work in animation are only know by a fast moving name on an end credit scroll. This show will give a much deserved opportunity to put a face and voice to those names to the millions of animation fans.\nThe show will include Academy award winners, Emmy winners as well as Golden Globe, Annie, Peabody, BAFTA, People\u2019s Choice award winners, and more.\nEach guest will receive bios on the other guests that they\u2019ll by dinning with. This will provide some background on the guests to help provide a springboard for questions and conversations.\nA wide range of skills and positions will be represented, including but not limited to:\nShow creators\nDirectors\nShow runners\nAnimators\nAnimation Directors\nArt directors\nCharacter designers\nStory artists\nVoice actors\nCasting Directors\nProducers\nWriters\n\nTopics will include but are not limited to:\nWoman in the animation industry with an all female cast\nAll African American cast\n2D vs 3D\nThe future of VR and AR\nAll Latin cast\nAll Asian cast\nAn all Animation Legends Table\nThe power on India in animation\nTV vs Feature animation\nCrossing over from animation to live action\nAnime\nThe Internet and new media's effect on the animation industry\nThe good old days\nStarting out in the industry and how it's changed\nAnimation Enigmas \nThe future of animation\nPay, the dollars and cents of animation. (what people make & the cost of  TV shows & Movies)\nIs talent the most important thing?\nYouTubers\nNew York animation\nDealing with outside studios\nAnimation training and schools\nWriting for animation\nPrime Time Animation\nAnimation Studios\nAnimation in Video Games\nHow to get a job in animation\nPortfolios/Websites\nComic books to cartoons\nCartoons that we grew up watching\nArtists that run a studio\nOutrageous Animation\nArtists as Managers/Supervisors\nStop Motion\nThe four goals that I have for each episode:\nINTRODUCE\nEDUCATE\nINSPIRE\n ENTERTAIN\nIntroduce-The public to some of the amazing people that work behind the scenes in the animation industry.\nEducate-As many people as possible about what it really takes to make an animated Movie, TV show, or video game.\nInspire-Young, creative, talented people all around the world and show them that it\u2019s possible for them to have a carrier in animation. My hope is that viewers will hear stories that they can relate too and it will encourage them to consider a carrier in animation.\nEntertain-The bottom line is that I want every episode to be entertaining.\nWhy this show is needed:\nAs soon as most of us are able to turn on a TV, Computer, an iPad, or go to an animated movie, we find ourselves addicted to those brightly colored characters moving around on screen. And you never question weather or not those characters are real. But the truth is that those amazing, entertaining characters only seem that way because of the thousands of real people that write, draw, color, voice and edit those characters and the shows that they appear in.\nEach and every one of those people that work behind the scenes on an animated project have an amazing story of their own. This show will provide a platform for them to share their stories with the rest of the world.\nAnimation is a special and magical art form, that has the ability to connect, inspire, influence and effect people of all ages in a wondrous way.\nProducer/Director/Animator Randy Myers is an industry veteran with over 27 years experience in feature animation, television animation, commercials, and video game productions.\nRandy attended California Institute of the Arts (Cal Arts) in Valencia California. He started his animation career in the early 90\u2019s doing in-betweens and clean-up for Don Bluth Studios, where he worked on such films as \u201cA Troll In Central Park\u201d and \u201cThumbelina\u201d.\nRandy then jumped to Warner Bros Television Animation, where he worked on Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cTiny Toon Adventures\u201d.\nAfter leaving Cal Arts in 1992, he was accepted into an internship at the newly formed Turner Feature Animation. There he worked his way up from intern on \u201cThe Pagemaster\u201d to an animator on \u201cCat\u2019s Don\u2019t Dance\u201d.\nHe then transitioned to Warner Feature Animation, where he had the good fortune to work with Academy Award winning Director Brad Bird, on the critically acclaimed film \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d. In the late 90\u2019s Randy then went to work with a couple of his Cal Arts classmates, Craig McCracken and Genndy Tartakovsky at Cartoon Network. Randy stepped right in and started directing episodes of the trend-setting \u201cThe Powerpuff Girls\u201d, \u201cSamurai Jack\u201d, \u201cFosters Home For Imaginary Friends\u201d, \u201cDexter\u2019s Lab\u201d, \u201cCode Name Kids Next Door\u201d, \u201cMy Gym Partner\u2019s A Monkey\u201d just to name a few.\nIn his time at Cartoon Network Randy was nominated six times for an Emmy, and he won twice. He has also won an Annie award for his work on Cartoon Networks \u201cWe Bare Bears\u201d. During his time at Cartoon Network, Randy also found time to go back to Cal Arts and teach first year character animation. Several of his students have gone on to create and run their own shows, direct, and a few have even won Emmy\u2019s and Annie\u2019s.\nAfter being at Cartoon Network for nearly 10 years, he left to do story at Dreamworks, where he worked on \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d, \u201cMegamind\u201d and \u201cShrek Forever After\u201d. Then once again he moved back to TV, and became the Supervising Timing Director on Nickelodeons \u201cThe Mighty B\u201d.\nRandy left Nickelodeon after accepting a job offer from the newly formed Hasbro Studios to be the Supervising Director on their newest version of \u201cGI JOE\u201d, \u201cGI JOE-RENEGADES\u201d. The series was critically acclaimed and thrilled old and new fans that saw the show on The Hub.\nRandy then went on to be the Supervising Timing Director at Disney TV Animation season one of \u201cGravity Falls\u201d.\nRandy headed back to Nickelodeon where his friend and show creator Butch Hartman asked him to be a director on \u201cFairly Odd Parents\u201d season 9.\nRandy returned to Cartoon Network once again to be the Supervising Director on \u201cBen 10: Omnivers\u201d, and then the Supervising Producer on \u201cWe Bare Bears\u201d.\nCurrently Randy is working with Cartoon Networks, Talent Development Department in the role of Supervising Creative Producer, and is responsible for talent recruitment, talent training and talent relations.\nHe also consults with current productions on pipeline and process, to help them run more efficiently and to be more productive.\n In most cases, the company providing funding want a voice in how a show is made. We've decided seeking funding through Kickstarter will allow us to produce the show that we want to produce, with the guests that we think the public will enjoy hearing from, in a way that we think the public would like to see and preserve the creator's artistic vision. \nWe'll also be able to produce the shows faster and get them to the public sooner then going through the traditional funding streams. This is also am opportunity for everyone to be a part of this production.\nAn audience is the only group of people that truly decides if a project is a success or not. So I'm putting this project out there for the public to decide if this is something that they'd like to see.\nSo here we are.

Immediately, he knew that he wanted to make a documentary short about George, whose charisma, work and storytelling are all-enveloping.  Nathan began production on the project in 2017 with the working title \"Drawing Life\".\nGeorge Booth with drawings.\nMEET GEORGE BOOTH!\nAt 92 years old, George is among the oldest living New Yorker Cartoonists, and continues to publish regularly in the magazine. Born in Cainsville Missouri (population 200), George launched his cartooning career while serving in the US Marines during World War II, when he was recruited to draw for the Marines publication Leatherneck Magazine.  While George will gladly tell you of any number of humorous misadventures along the way (blowing up outhouses,  being screamed at by officer managers), he would ascend to become a celebrated artist in the golden era of magazines, influencing a younger generation of cartoonists with his wit and imagination. Today George is a proud Brooklynite, working out of  a studio in his daughter Sarah's apartment on a vibrant block in Crown Heights.\nGeorge at work.\n\nTHE ANIMATION\nOne of the elements of Drawing Life that we are very excited about is the use of animation in the project, which is being done working with the animation artist Emily Collins (Emily is also a Producer on the film).  Rather than solely animating George\u2019s existing work, the stop motion animations for the film will be done in collaboration with George, creating unique moments that highlight George's personality, humor and history.  \nGeorge and Emily\nPLAY\n\nTHE MONEY\nThe truth is that filmmaking is expensive work. We've been putting in countless unpaid hours of producing, shooting, editing and animating over the last year. However, in order to really finish Drawing Life the way the film deserves we need resources. We also want to make the final film look and sounds as good as possible, so we need funds to cover those costs. Lastly, we want to be able to pay George for his participation and artistic contributions to our project. Below is a pie chart that shows the breakdown of how we will be spending these funds if we are successful. \n\nSample rewards\n\n\n\n\nHELP US GET THERE!\nWith approximately 80% of Principal photography completed, we are currently in the process of scheduling animation production that will be a significant part of the film. Our plan is to complete the film in the next year, having the film festival premiere in NYC with George in attendance before his 93rd Birthday. \nPlease help us make this happen!\nNew Yorker Magazine 2018 Holiday party.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are deeply committed to making Drawing Life a reality, but that will only be possible with your help!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Animated GIF", "descp": "Animated GIF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["34 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Hi-Res Download of George\u2019s Drawing", "descp": "Hi-Res Download of one of George\u2019s drawings - could be used as desktop backdrop or printed and framed!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["40 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "George Booth stickers!", "descp": "Sheet of stickers of George\u2019s drawings.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Digital Download of the film", "descp": "Digital Download of the film when it\u2019s complete, all updates and sneak peeks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Tote bag", "descp": "Tote bag, Digital Download, all updates and sneak peeks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["93 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Hi quality print | Booth drawing", "descp": "Hi quality print of one of George\u2019s drawings delivered to you, all updates and sneak peeks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["61 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Vintage New Yorker | Signed by George", "descp": "George Booth signed vintage New Yorker.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["60 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "Original piece of artwork from animation", "descp": "Original piece of artwork from the animation.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Invitation to screening of the premiere", "descp": "Invitation to screening of the premiere or a private preview screening (no travel costs covered).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "Dinner with George Booth", "descp": "Enjoy a dinner with George Booth (Only 8 spots available, travel costs not covered).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (7 left of 8)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5,000 or more", "title": "Producer credit", "descp": "Producer credit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (10 left of 10)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10,000", "title": "Executive Producer Credit", "descp": "Executive Producer Credit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (5 left of 5)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "3 signed & framed Booth prints", "descp": "3 signed and framed prints of George's drawings.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "10 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays!", "update_content": "Dear all,\nHappy Holidays, we truly hope everyone is healthy, and doing well!\nBelow is a classic Booth cover to impart some holiday spirit.

So just like your life... only not.\nHere's a few of our favorites.\nThe comic has, and always will, remain FREE to read online at pvponline.com. \nThis Kickstarter will help us collect the first 20 years of PvP comics in their entirety plus an additional tome of never-before-seen content. Designed by famed illustrator and designer Rob Armbrister, with over 2,500 pages collected into 9 full-color, oversized 12\"x10\" hardcover volumes, these will truly be the Definitive Editions of PvP Online. \nThere are lots of different ways you can support this Kickstarter! Grab the 20th Anniversary Retrospective, pickup all 9 Volumes of PvP Definitive Editions, go \u00c0 La Carte and choose just the years you like the most, or go All Digital and get 20 years of PvP delivered directly to your cyberzone.\nHAVE A FAVORITE YEAR OF PvP OR ONLY WANT A COUPLE BOOKS? ADD-ONS ARE FOR YOU!\nChose any reward tier you'd like, then add the amount listed in the chart below for any books you'd like to \"add-on\" to your pledge. Once the campaign is over, we'll ask you which add-on items you wanted and you'll get exactly the combination of rewards you desire!\nWHAT ARE KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE EXTRAS? \nOnce the Kickstarter is fully funded we will start unlocking Stretch Goals! Some will be upgrades to the books that are for all Backers, but many will be exclusive to Backers who choose reward tiers with +EXTRAS in the description. The more we fund the more +EXTRAS you get! \nSHIPPING WILL BE CHARGED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN ENDS!\nBooks are heavy and nine books coming in at over 2,500 pages is a lot of book. This Kickstarter may even require multiple shipments for each Backer! All shipping fees will be charged AFTER the campaign ends, just before we ship the books. By doing it this way we can ensure you are paying the lowest possible cost for shipping. \nWe will ship the books in bulk to a series of warehouses around the globe. Final surveys will then be sent to each Backer requesting their address and calculating an accurate shipping charge. We're going to do everything we can to keep these rates as low as possible.\nBOOK RELEASE PARTY AND REWARD PICKUP!\nFor those located in the greater Seattle area, you will have the option to pick up your books in person at the PvP 20th Anniversary Book Release Party (time and location to be scheduled in 2019). Here you'll be able to pickup your rewards, meet Scott Kurtz, spend some time with fellow comic lovers, and enjoy some delicious snacks. Surely, a good time to be had by all!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe face three major challenges with this Kickstarter:\n\nFirstly, much of the art from 1998 - 2002 was never properly digitized. Finding and scanning or digitally remastering these strips is going to be time-consuming and could affect our print schedule.\n\nSecondly, there's a LOT of content to be designed, edited, and prepped for print. Currently there are two designers, two editors, and three proof-readers working to get these books ready to print. Again, this is a time-consuming process.\n\nLastly, shipping 50+ lbs (22+ kg) of books to each Backer in a cost-effective manner is a huge task. Fortunately, we've got dedicated staff and partners at various printers, manufacturers, and fulfillment centers ready to help us reduce the shipping costs to the bare minimum.\n\nThese are all manageable risks and we're confident we can overcome them with little or no delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "PvP 20th Anniversary PDF", "descp": "PvP 20th ANNIVERSARY RETROSPECTIVE PDF featuring over 200 pages of content in a DRM Free PDF including: Scott's first two comic strips 'Wedlock' and 'Elementary', the PvP 'Sunday Funnies', guest strips, original PvP character designs, sketches, and tons of never-before-seen bonus content from the last 20 years of PvP.\nINCLUDES:\nPvP 20th Anniversary Retrospective PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "PvP Definitive Edition PDF Collection", "descp": "8 volumes of PvP DEFINITIVE EDITION PDFs collecting every strip from 1998-2018 plus the 20th ANNIVERSARY RETROSPECTIVE.

I love creating \u201cfloppies\u201d, in other words, saddle-stitched or stapled periodical comic books. There is an informal quality to the process which I find interesting. It was great fun to put this comic together! \nWORN TUFF ELBOW #2 will be an 8\u201d x 10.5\u201d, 36 page comic book with colour covers and an eight page colour section. It also marks the official return of my characters Shrimpy and Paul. Previously, in 2004, Shrimpy and Paul appeared in a trade paperback all their own, Shrimpy and Paul and Friends (Highwater Books). They resurfaced in 2011 for a short story in the collection Pure Pajamas (Drawn & Quarterly) and Shrimpy appeared on his own (living with a group of green people) in Stroppy in 2015.\nAlso: one needs not to have read WORN TUFF ELBOW #1 to enjoy this issue, these are all new stories~!\nStories included in this issue\nAs you'd expect, especially if you have seen my publications before, WORN TUFF ELBOW #2 is jam-packed with a bunch of goofy stuff. These comic stories are all stand-alone yarns but the situations they set up will spill over into subsequent issues. \"Monsieur Moustache and the Tale of the Baloney\" is an extra special re-printing of a series of comics that appeared in my long lost weekly newspaper strip, Big Pile Presents (Wilder Hobson's Theater Absurd-o) but is new to the book format.\nThe back cover features a diorama created by Nathan Campagnaro\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, there is also a preemptive letters column (some letters I wrote to others), a bonus chapter from EW GAWD brought to us by the lovable Sedberg & Lilycups and an absolutely fabulous back cover: a diorama of Shrimpy and Paul fashioned by Nathan Campagnaro (above). \nI am looking to raise $4,000 Canadian dollars to have this comic printed and in return I'm offering unique rewards to whoever would like to climb on board.\nIf we manage to reach the goal very quickly, by mid-November, it is quite possible that the awards will arrive for Santa-time, otherwise, it will be January 2019. And if this all goes well I would like to consider reprinting WORN TUFF ELBOW issue #1.\nShrimpy awakes and heads to the change-room in his underpants.\nWORN TUFF REWARDS\nHave a look at these nice rewards for all of your Elbow needs:\n(If you look to the right, you'll see a list of rewards and reward configurations. We tried to come up with every possible combination of rewards, so check it out closely for the exact tier that best suits your needs.  Below are the various pieces of the puzzle.)\nREMOTE VILLAGER WOVEN PATCH\nA very nice woven patch with one of your favourite yellow cylindrical characters on it!

This reward will go out to the buyer pretty quickly as it is a standalone, just in time for Christmas.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION\nWe at NO WORLD BOOKS would like to thank you for your kind consideration towards this project! \nFrom the one page strip \"Seemingly Random Street Views (An Aside) A Transition to Full Colour\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks are minor and few. The comic book is complete and ready to be printed. I have proofed the book several times so it's ready to print. I will be using a Canadian printer, one I'm very familiar with, so I have no concerns. I have also used the patch manufacturer in the past and they're very reliable.

Along with our friends Gabriel Mayorga and Lea Jean Badelles, we are artists who love to tell fun stories that inspire the imagination for all ages. Adam has been working as a professional illustrator for over 20 years and this is Makana\u2019s 2nd book.\nAdam and Makana at Alternate Universe in Milford CT for an in-store book signing.\nWho is Punk Taco?\nPunk Taco is a lovable alien taco who rocks out across the universe with his band of misfits, fighting evil and helping those in need. Punk Taco believes in peace and love but has no tolerance for bullies and tyrants, so when he sees an injustice, he can't resist helping and joining in the fight.\nHe loves his friends and considers them family, and will do anything for them. His empathy and compassion for others and his willingness to sacrifice himself to help the downtrodden is legendary.\nDespite his intergalactic celebrity, Punk Taco's origins still remains a mystery. What's his real name? Where does he come from? Is he the only one of his kind? All of these questions will be answered in time, but for now- enjoy the adventure.\nVolume 2: The Story\nPunk Taco and the band were on their way to a gig when we last saw them in the Volume 1 Epilogue, when a giant hand reached through a mysterious portal and whisked them away. Volume 2 picks up immediately after that and thrusts our hero and his friends into a dangerous new adventure to save a planet endangered by a greedy syndicate that is mining not just the resources, but also the very life essence of the planet itself. Punk Taco must join forces with a coalition of tribes to prevent an environmental disaster, but the problem is, they are all ready to give up and run for their lives. What\u2019s a taco to do?\nThe Art\nCheck out these sample pages of PUNK TACO Volume 2!\nPunk Taco Volume 2 Page 1. Uh Oh!\nPunk Taco Volume 2 Page 2. Giant taco eating robots can be pretty scary.\nPunk Taco Volume 2 Page 3. Punk Taco refuses to be anyone's food!\nThe Mission\nPunk Taco Volume 2 is a continuation of Volume 1, and picks up where we left off in the epilogue. The book is penciled and we are inking and coloring each page now.\nWe need to raise a minimum of $15,000.00 to bring this to life. This will cover the cost of printing an 8x12 hardcover with spot varnish and full-color interior pages, as well as production (inking, coloring editing) and shipping costs. Stretch Goals will be added on if we go beyond our initial funding.\nThe art will be completed by the end of December, after which we will ship the book to the printer once it is edited. We are looking to have it back from the printer by May 2019.\nInternational customers - The cost of shipping PUNK TACO Volume 1 from the previous campaign cost me between $28-$40 for a single book. I apologize for the high cost of shipping but it is not something I control. When I originally shipped Volume 1, I had to come out of pocket for a lot of the cost. Because of these high shipping costs I will be including some extra rewards exclusive for international customers.\nMakana and his little brother showing off their copy of Punk Taco Volume 1\nLarger than most large format comics. PUNK TACO Volume 1 is a beautiful, oversized 8x12 Hardcover on 105lb paperstock. Volume 2 will be the same.\nKids LOVE the large hardcover format of PUNK TACO. It just feels GREAT holding this book in your hands when you read it.\nRewards\nI try and keep the rewards simple because I want to focus all my energy on making this the best book possible. Rewards will consist of copies of Punk Taco Volume 1 for those who missed out, sketches, original art, commissions, older books and comics I worked on, as well as stickers and a digital download of the official PUNK TACO theme song. If we can reach our stretch goals I can possibly produce some shirts or maybe even put together custom PUNK TACO Lego sets. For now, I just want to create the best comic book possible and I hope you will join in the adventure.\nIf you don't own PUNK TACO Volume 1, the deal for you is the BOOK LOVER SUPREME for $50. This will get you copies of both PUNK TACO Volume 1 and 2 plus a lot of great extras.\nSample Menu:\nJust a little taste of all of our rewards!\nPunk Taco Sticker #1\nPUNK TACO Button #1\nCustom PUNK TACO LEGO.

The Creators Adam and Makana Wallenta The Fans We\u2019ve been travelling all over the country and are so grateful to everyone that has supported PUNK TACO Volume 1.\nQuotes from Professionals Endorsing PUNK TACO Volume 1\n\u201cPunk Taco is childlike fun at its best! Full of tacos, nachos, aliens and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll!\u201d\n- Franco\nEisner and Harvey Award-Winning Writer/Artist of Tiny Titans, Itty Bitty Hellboy, Superman Family Adventures\n\u201cPunk Taco is like the dream you\u2019d have after passing out from a great Mexican feast while bumping 90\u2019s Hip-Hop through your headphones. Its psychedelic weirdness and social activism could only come from the combined minds of a kid and his dad, cracking up at a joke and then turning it into an entire galaxy. From radio station WKRS to the junk food villain\u2019s plan to \u201cMake the Galaxy Great Again,\u201d its hidden gems sparkle bright. Throughout all the juvenile, hyper-colored fun, you can dig the central theme that love, art and being cool to one another make up the infinite power that runs this mothership we all happen to be traveling on, and that greed, selfishness and fear are all headed for self-destruction. Long live Punk Taco and his secret nachos!!!\u201d\n- Secret Agent 23 Skidoo\nGrammy Award-Winning Hip-Hop Artist for Best Children\u2019s Album and Author of Weirdo Calhoun and the Odd Men Out\n\u201cPunk Taco is a fun, intergalactic action-adventure story full of the kind of love and optimism you\u2019ll definitely want to upload into the brain of any kid you care about.\u201d\n- Chris Giarrusso\nHarvey Award-Nominated Artist/Writer of G-Man, Mini Marvels, Encounter\n\u201cAdam and Makana Wallenta\u2019s Punk Taco is a lush, sumptuous spectacle for both adult and children\u2019s eyes, coupled with a crazy-fun story that wraps itself around important social issues... and nachos. It\u2019s delicious!\u201d\n- Mark McKenna\n2012 Inkwell Awards Hall of Fame. Writer, Penciller, Inker of Banana Tales, Combat Jacks, Batman\n\u201cTruth, justice and the quest for perfect nachos! Punk Taco is a fun-filled comic book burrito... an important tale of optimism wrapped in candy-colored art. Adam Wallenta created Punk Taco with his son, Makana. The result is a rockin\u2019 all-ages book that can be enjoyed by parents and kids alike. All that\u2019s missing is a side of guacamole!\n- Bill Walko\nWriter/Artist of The Hero Business\n\u201cAt the same time it\u2019s a kind of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure meets Axe Cop, Punk Taco is also a book that validates childrens\u2019 emotions in these turbulent times. It's okay to be upset and angry over the injustices of the world, and channeling those feelings into something active is a good way to manage them\u201d.\n- Kelly Sue DeConnick\n2014 Eisner-Award Nominated Writer of Pretty Deadly and Captain Marvel\n\u201cThis Taco goes Hard (shell)! Here\u2019s an intergalactic space adventure that feels foreign and familiar simultaneously. Punk Taco walks that same hero path I grew up admiring in my youth. With some incredibly beautiful colors, very unique character designs and an unpredictably building storyline, Punk Taco is an all-ages Sci-Fi comedy adventure that has a little something for everyone.\"\n- Marquee Mark,  Markellus Ragans\nHost of So Wizard Podcast\nReviews for PUNK TACO Volume 1\nReviews for PUNK TACO Volume 1 on Amazon\n Everyone LOVES Punk Taco!\nKids LOVE Punk Taco!\nParents and Kids LOVE PUNK TACO!\nCouples Love PUNK TACO!\nTeenagers Love PUNK TACO!\nPUNK TACO is for everyone!\nIf you love to read- PUNK TACO is for YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks.

A Hardcover Graphic Novel for All-Ages"}}, {"backer": "Mike Kunkel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Puc the Artist is set in a world where everything that exists, is drawn into existence. If you want a birthday cake, just master your pencil work, and draw yourself a birthday cake. Some are skilled at watercolor, some with charcoal or etchings. Each has their own unique ability to create...or destroy. But in this world of ink and artists something important and vibrant has been lost and forgotten - Color. Our story is about the happenstances of discovering it, and the problems three youths must deal with to return it to the world.  \nPuc the Artist is a story about friendship, learning one's place in the grand scheme of things, and adventure. The story is planned with a complete beginning, middle, and end. This book will be the begging of the adventure. Just like how Star Wars: A New Hope, stand on it's own as a film. So too will the first Puc The Artist book. If we are so lucky to have the support, the story has room to expand into the other two arcs in the future.  \nGarret and I are co-creating this story, so the same art team and writer will be on it the whole way threw. It's a labor of love for the both of us, with Garret being the originator of the character designs and look of this world. And Miles Greb plotting out the story and fleshing out the characters. \nThe main book will be 66 pages, a hearty start to the story, and half of the first arch. However if you look below we have a REALLY great stretch goal in mind. \nIf we reach the goal of $12,000 everyone getting a Puc The Artist comic will get an upgraded copy. Instead of printing the 66 page large size \"Floppy\" comic, we will instead be printing a graphic novel that is the full first arch of the story. I hope we can do this, as it gives everyone more for their money, and we get to tell the whole first arch with just one Kickstarter and with one book! So please be sure to share it around to help us reach this goal!   \nJay, Miles, Garret, Milsea, and Jamie.\nMiles Greb - Writer, Co-creator - Former Bob Dylan impersonator who's obsession with Star Trek is annoying to everyone.  \nGarrett Richer -  Illustrator - Co,Creator - The actual artist for the fictional Artist, non-fictionally. \nJay Bendt - Illustrator- Fantasy loving hoarder of color pencils and coffee mugs. Draws pictures for a living.\nMilsae Kim - Females. Strong females.\" I just love female characters so much :) \nAndrew Pierce -  Editor - Lovable goof. Escaped Kipling protagonist.\n An Orphan from the nomadic tribes of the Cold North. Separated from her family at a very young age Asta has had to learn to fend for herself. She has a quick temper, and picks fights with about everyone. Although some people in town think she is a bit cold, her close friends Tolo and Puc know she would do anything to protect them. She secretly wants to be a start her own Strawberry farm...but she won't ever tell anyone cause she has to keep up appearances.   \n Tolo is a son of a famous explorer and a famous artist. He grew up with stories of far off places from his mother, and watching his father paint images of them. His dream though, was to help others explore the world like his mother so Tolo became a Cartographer. Well, he is training to be one at-least. He carries with him a giant compass that can read the land, but also in a pinch move the ground before him.   \nWell read, and more formally educated then his two friends, Tolo is normally the plan maker of the gang. \n Puc spends his day at his drawing desk in his granddads basement. Introverted by nature, Puc has a good heart and often gets dragged outside by his friends. Even when they do get him to leave his drawing desk, he normally finds something to draw while out and about.  \n He is a Rat Burglar, pun intended. He makes his coin by bounty hunting, in turning in people for petite crimes. He travels with his ally Fink, a husky Mouse who is't the most sophiscated - but he is loyal.   \nRead the first issue for free!\n       Or if you just want a quick look at the art, here are two pages from the first story arch. Note some of the book will be in Black and White and some in color - it all depends on the story line and what powers Puc can learn!  \nThe Book!  \nA beautiful printed comic book! This is actual a sample of a very small print run I did to show the first arch of the story off at C2E2. The actual book will be longer, and have a different cover. It will be printed by Print Ninja, who is one of the best is the bussiness.   \nThe book is designed to be 66 pages, and if we hit out strech goal it will increase to 122! \nThe Actual Cover below.\nArt Prints!  \nArt by Milsae Kim\nArt by Jay Bendt\nThese are the two awesome Art Prints available. They will be printed on high quality stock, and 8 1/2 x 11 inches in size.  \n Enamel Pins!\nPins of Pit the mouse & Puc!\nSketch Cover  \n We are making a story about artists after all so what better reward then a sketch cover? These covers will be coated with a nice paper suited for inking. We wanted to make something of an event of them so, everyone who gets one and does a sketch will have their work shown off! We will be tweeting them out, sharing them on Instagram, and Kickstarter updates. Anyone who wants to their art to be linked back to their account, we will be happy to do that.   \nOr you can buy it and keep your sketch all to yourself, that is totally fine too! \nThere is even an option to have Garret draw a custom sketch for you! \nThese covers will be Kickstarter exclusive. \nArt Commission! \nExamples of The Full Color Commission in the \"Box of crayons\" level\n Any Kickstarter project is ultimately only as good as it's budget and planning.

The pockets are over 7\" wide and .75\" deep\nSturdy & Strong - The 12\" base makes for a small profile but a strong base that supports the weight of the comics, and won't tip over\nClassic Sign Topper - The innovative 4-sleeve topper includes retro inspired signs designed by JG Roshell of Comicraft\nColor Choice - The rack is available in either black or white so you can choose what works best for your space\nSmooth Spinning\nThe Classic Spinner Rack is the perfect way to show off your collection, and it is a natural fit in any environment. \nTo move from prototype to full manufacturing, we need YOUR support to Bring Back the Spinner Rack!

A technical glitch forced us to relaunch this campaign, BUT - please don't be swayed by the lofty % shown - we TRULY need to get as close to $100K as possible. Thanks for your support! - Ron\nThe Animation Show of Shows is an annual event which curates the world\u2019s best animated short films and presents them as a single family-friendly feature-length film to audiences worldwide. By bringing animated short films to the big screen, and showing them in theaters around the world, we hope to shine a spotlight on the brilliance of independent animators, while providing a moving cinematic experience to global audiences of all ages.\nWith proceeds from this campaign, we\u2019ll further raise the profile of animated short films by screening our 19th Annual Animation Show of Shows in more locations - especially schools. We will expose an ever-widening audience to these wonderful masterpieces.\nThis is our 19th annual show. Over the years, we have curated so many remarkable films! It gives us pleasure to bring unknown films of great merit to the general public. And, in fact, thirty-six of the films we presented were nominated for Oscars.\nBut we can only continue to do what we do by obtaining financial support. \nWe are a non-profit and pledges are tax-deductible. Please - pick a Reward that suits you best, and help us preserve and present this wonderful and important art form. Thanks! \n===\n In 1999, animation producer Ron Diamond started the Animation Show of Shows. He wanted to share the brilliant films he was discovering with the wider animation industry.\nFor 16 years, Ron built relationships with animation festivals and leading college programs that enabled him to scout out talent to include in the show. He would then show the final product to the top animation studios, game and technology companies and schools, helping to create greater awareness of budding animators.\nThen, in 2015, he felt it was time to take the show public. As a 501(c)(3) non profit, The Animation Show of Shows has raised over $227,000 on Kickstarter, thanks to the generous support of well over 1,000 industry professionals, students and fans of animation. This allowed The Annual Animation Show of Shows to premiere in more than 70 cities with more than 570 showings\n The Animation Show of Shows is the first of its kind, specifically curated for a wide audience and tailored to appeal to all ages.

That's enough to make a designer out of anybody.\nI tried a variety of mugs, even those giant double-wall tumblers, but that left stains too!\nIt was clear, I wanted to design something beautiful, useful and unique. While the solution was not apparent to me right away, inspiration struck one day as I reached for a tasty banana.\nThe banana hook-holder had an interesting shape that got me wondering. Somehow, the hanger kinda, sorta, looked like a handle. I guess that was the moment. Needless to say, the ensuing prototypes left a lot to be desired.\nIt wasn't pretty, and it was far from what I envisioned as \"the most beautiful mug in the world\"\n573 strangers pledged their support faithfully, with the promise that I would deliver.\nAlthough it was my first crowdfunding effort, a group of individuals trusted me enough to provide me the funding necessary to bring my concept to life.\nToday, I'm excited to tell you about the Floating Mug\u00ae Clear.\nIt's made of glass and now 50% larger than the original. Dare I say, beauti-fuller?\n12ounces (350ml) of hot goodness; it's just what you need to get any day going.\n    Does the coaster work? I say \"YES!\", but...\nyou should definitely keep a napkin handy. There are moments when you'll cause spills that result in too much moisture dripping onto the base.\nSome people like to say condensation causes the coffee stains on furniture. That's inaccurate, specifically if you're describing hot tea or coffee.\nOne reason you might see liquid rolling down the side of your cup is because we sometimes \"dribble\". \nThis is not a scientific fact, but I believe the repetitive sipping from a single point on the mouth of the mug, accumulates to a point where it ultimately has to roll down the side of your cup, it's not a lot of moisture.\nYou may inadvertently spill some coffee over the side of the mug by stirring heavily, or by stumbling while you walk to your seat or desk.\nIn any event, these scenarios will likely see moisture drip down the side of your mug. \nSo, won't the excess moisture spill into your lap as you drink?\nFor the typical use case, the amount of moisture that does make it to the bottom of the Floating Mug, usually evaporates away, or simply clings to the bottom of the mug. \nExcessive moisture accumulation caused by an actual spill can simply be 'dabbed' dry using a small napkin.\nThousands of Floating Mugs (original porcelain version) have sold on online. An overwhelming majority of positive reviews provide feedback addressing this one concern. The mug and coaster is truly functional. \n    So! You may not need a new mug today, but this one is designed with love, and so I hope you'll want it.\n PRESS\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI successfully launched and shipped my first Kickstarter project in 2012. While I'm confident I will be able to deliver the first 4,000 mugs on time. The remainder will be shipped as quickly as possible beyond that initial deadline with the goal of delivering before April 2018. I plan to be diligent and cautious through the various stages of this project.\n\n\nAt the start of this project, the Floating Mug is a prototype. Your pledges will enable me to get me through a few more rounds of sampling before we're ready to start production.\n\nThere are risks and challenges that could impact this project negatively. These include an extended sampling process due to quality and/or logistical concerns. Poor tooling or raw materials can also impact timelines. \n\nQuality control will be an integral part of this process, but that too can identify issues that delay production.\n\nShipping globally is also challenging both for us and off course the backers. \nYour reward may be subject to local and/or international fees or charges assessed in you country.\nIt's possible you would have to pay additional fees and/or charges to get final delivery of your mugs. \nPlease try to research this concern before you back this project.\nThere are a variety of shipping methods at our disposal, so it's conceivable that our strategy to ship will change in order to scale up distribution.\nThis could see your order delayed as well.\n\nI promise to keep you informed with regular updates. While I'll make an effort to answer your queries by email or through comments, I may not be able to respond consistently to every single question that's directed at me.

I chose the bison because, when I started my research, I felt like I had opened a can of worms. This animal\u2019s life is fascinating, dramatic, political, and misunderstood. The Bison today is still struggling to hold on to the two things that they represent to us. That is, Freedom and the true spirit of Adventure. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be equally fascinated by what I've dug up. Sounds all very serious I hear you say? I promise, it will be very entertaining! Writing a story that had to be factually accurate without overshadowing the artistic license was part of the challenge.  \n   Although Roamin\u2019 is a standalone film, it\u2019s also a pilot episode for a possible series of short films about different animals. My goal is to create short films that will inform and rid destructive ignorance.  Also to uncover myths and prejudice that surround many of our animal friends by exposing the truth. But more importantly, to present it with humor. I want viewers to identify with the animal in order to empathize.  And the way to identify with an animal that doesn't necessarily have human emotions, is to admire his abilities to overcome the same obstacles that we do.  Acceptance, food, water, shelter, the need for a companion, and perseverance to survive.The social and emotional threats that we now face in today\u2019s society can easily relate to the physical threats that animals face in the wild. And of course it\u2019s always fun to observe the absurdities caused by our fellow beings.\nThe biggest challenge for any artist that has a story worth telling to the tribe, is giving up creative control in order to get it made.  With your support, this film will have creative direction without the compromise and challenges that come from a large studio system.  You will be supporting the production of a film as it was intended by the creator.  That makes you AWESOME!\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 funding platform.  That means if we don\u2019t reach our goal within 28 days, we get nothing. So if you love independent animation, you love wildlife and conservation, and you have a quirky sense of humor, then please come aboard this journey with me and get this film up and Roamin\u2019.\nI've invested a lot of time researching and developing this story until I felt it was worth sharing with you all.  At this point the film structure is pretty much locked down, the characters are designed, and the visual style is looking good. It\u2019s now time to bring it to life!\nRoamin\u2019 is a 2D, hand drawn animation using digital techniques. It\u2019s a very labour intensive process, but anything made by hand has the advantage of looking and being organic.The backgrounds and textures will be a mixture or acrylic, watercolour and pencil. All the components will then be scanned and composited together digitally. Once all the visuals are in place, we move into post production.This is where the composer and sound designer do their magic.\nSharon Colman Director/Story/Animation   \nMichael Graham campaign manager                                        \nPeter Gosling Composer                                                                 \nRupert Degas Voice Actor\nMore to come...\n I've put together a selection of rewards that I think will appeal to everyone.  These include water resistant stickers made from biostone for spreading good vibes with an eco-conscience, and the limited edition gicl\u00e9e print, signed and numbered for the serious art collector. \n       Here is where your hard earned support actually goes. It will not be paying for new equipment or software licenses, nor will it be used for studio space or trips to the grocery store. It all goes towards the production of the film you want to see made and it's campaign.\n   If this campaign is successful and we meet our goal, then a BIG THANK YOU to all of you! Because of you, the film will exist! Our stretch goal is to help the film migrate around the world.  The festival submissions budget doesn't cover every single festival. As it becomes quite expensive we simply prioritize certain festivals based on prestige, location and past relationships.

Morning. Ever. Mug. is an innovative mug that keeps coffee hotter longer and offers a fun surprise function... doughnut warmer!  For thousands of years the mug has remained relatively unchanged. The problem is that it leaks heat and flavor (less warmth = less flavor) at an alarming rate.  Within 20 seconds a regular mug loses 10-15 degrees F of temperature!  Thermal/travel mugs provide superior insulation, however they're not nearly as comforting as drinking from a warm ceramic mug.  \nWe've provided a solution by integrating a built-in lid/warming plate.  The plate uses the heat from your coffee or tea to provide better insulation than any other ceramic mug on the planet.  It was also designed specifically to hold and warm a doughnut, cookie, muffin, scone, or other treat!  It's fun and delicious! \nFor those of you that have never had a fresh doughnut that's still warm, you need to try it!  This mug is your own personal mini warming oven.  Like cookies that are still warm right out of the oven?  Yep, you got it any time you want.  \nOnly a small part of the pastry is exposed over the sipping holes. After one bite, the entire pastry is warmed by the hot plate and NOT the steam.  You can enjoy a perfectly warmed treat in all of it's glory every time!\nFirst of all, no, the Best. Morning. Ever. Mug does not compete with a thermal/travel mug.  Those are great... for travel.  When at home or in the office, however, there is nothing that compares to the comfort of sipping from a warm ceramic mug.  This is where the Best. Morning. Ever. Mug shines!  Our mug presents a significant improvement in longer lasting warmth and FLAVOR!  On average the mug retains more heat by 9-12 degrees F!  That might not sound like a lot, but crank up the heat in your room right now by 10 degrees and see how it feels.  You'll feel it in your mug too and it's delicious!  \nThe mug is made from porcelain which we chose mostly because of it's beautiful finish.  They say the more attractive a serving piece is the better it's contents taste.  That sounds good to us so we went with this material which offers a truly lovely luster.  Porcelain is also anti-microbial which resists germs and guarantees a nice clean cup every time.  The mug also meets or exceeds FDA and CA 65 standards.  It is also microwave and dishwasher safe.\nHOW ABOUT CLEANING?! That's one we've heard a lot.  We can tell you that the large opening was designed specifically with cleaning in mind.  It allows easy access for a sponge or washcloth with no problem.  It is also large enough for the spray from a dishwasher to clean thoroughly.\nOur mission is to deliver a delightful experience that gives you something to look forward to every morning.  We want to help make the world a better place, and so we're donating $1 from the sale of every mug sold through this Kickstarter (and our website in the future) to the non-profit TO WRITE LOVE ON HER ARMS. TWLOHA is giving people hope to look forward to another day too.  They're a movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, and suicide.  We're not employees in any way, simply supporters.  You are too when you make a pledge!  \nFirst, here's what we've accomplished so far.  We've invested in the prototyping and patenting process (we're \"patent pending\").  We've developed engineered drawings and designs and vetted several manufacturers.  We've landed on a manufacturer that believes in this project and is dedicated to providing a quality finished product.  We have a fulfillment company that will help distribute and ship the mugs efficiently (same business day for most orders!).  \nWhat we need is the investment to have our first run of production completed.  We have to order a rather large quantity in order to keep the prices affordable.  So the funds will be used to fund the production.  Everything else has been done and is ready to go!  \nWe're both thrilled and humbled at the response we've gotten in the media!  As exciting as all of that is, we can tell you that nothing delights our heart more than having YOU, our backers that believe in us, believe in this product, and are supporting this campaign.  Your pledge and help spreading the word out there makes all the difference!  With all of our heart we say, THANK YOU!!!  If you haven't yet joined our fledgling community we hope you do that today.  We need you too! \nBest Regards,\nTom & Alicia Medwin", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge is getting the mugs out to you ASAP.

Clap your hands, snap yours fingers or bang the table, and they will start to Boogie:\n100% smile guarantee: having the dice magically roll on your command makes everyone who sees it smile, and that's what we're here for!\nDesigned to be a universal gaming accessory, Boogie Dice can replace any standard \u2018static\u2019 dice in any and all of your favorite games. But Boogie Dice are jam-packed with unique features and abilities that transform them from simple dice into the coolest gaming accessory.\nBots Battleground is a fast-paced, real-time card game that was designed specifically to utilize the novel properties of Boogie Dice. In the game (3-6 players, ages 8 and up), players battle each other with bot cards, while the Boogie Dice dictate the duration and special rules of each round, and power tokens keep track of the score.\nEach game includes 1 specially designed Boogie Dice, 1 charger/arena, a deck of 60 unique bot cards, 40 power tokens and a rulebook. See below for more details.\nFor this campaign, we are offering additional special Boogie Dice and the first Bots Battleground expansion. You can play the game with any number of expansions and up to 4 different special Boogie Dice at a time!\nBoogie Dice can be programmed to utilize the following features:\nBoogie Dice are packed with features that add layers of fun, excitement, chaos, strategy and interactivity to gaming, and this is just the beginning...\nInside each Boogie Dice there is a vibration motor, a tiny microphone, a microprocessor, a rechargeable battery and 3 LED lights. When the microphone detects a short and loud sound, such as a hand clap or a finger snap, the motor starts rotating, causing the dice bounce and roll.\nDifferent behaviors can be programmed into the dice, such as to \"stop listening\" during random periods of time, or activating the red LED while a turn is in progress, so countless new games can be designed for it. One such game is Bots Battleground...\n  Bots Battleground is a quick and slick player vs. player match game with tons of intense tactics and tenuous treaties. Each of your bots has special specs and you must know when to deploy it for maximum effect. You should also be aware of other players' bots in order to know who to attack and who to solicit for cooperation.\nThe game can be played with one or more special \"iconized\" and pre-programmed Boogie Dice, which \u201cdecide\u201d whether a player attacks or not, and determines special rules for each round. It also sets up, randomly, how long a round lasts. So players must always pay attention to the dice in order to choose the right tactic of the moment, who to ally with, and how much risk they should take.\nAre you fast, cunning and daring enough to win? Click, snap or clap your way to victory!\n          Check out the rules here:\nPLAY\n\nOn a full charge, Boogie Dice can roll up to 30 minutes continuously. That\u2019s about 500 activations!\nEach die is equipped with a powerful 100 mAh rechargeable lithium battery. To charge the dice, place them on the 3 metal charging pins on the charging station. The dice glow red throughout the charging period (approx. 40 min).\nBy default, a Boogie Dice rolls for 2-4 seconds, displaying a blue light, then stops and glows purple for 1 second. After 1 minute without being activated, the dice goes to sleep.\nChanging these settings is super easy. Boogie Dice are programmable with sound, so you can pick from a list of different settings on our app or website and use them to communicate with the dice and reprogram it to suit any game you want.\nWhen programming the dice, they start to blink with red and blue lights, then a blue steady light will indicate that the programming succeeded.\n  Select the reward that's right for you:\nAnd add-on any extra item you'd like:\n  Nimrod (CEO) is an inventor, app developer and crowd-funding rock-star. His first creation, Pressy, was a breakthrough success, and Nimrod has plenty more great ideas up his sleeve.\nSaar (Game Designer) is an inventor, game designer (The Agents, King Down), product developer and patent writer. Saar not only comes up with great ideas, but has the energy, imagination and enthusiasm to make them happen.\nAlicia (Marketing) is a London-raised, international communications expert. She loves writing, story-telling, building brands and communities and making great ideas grab you by the nose.\nNir (CTO) is an expert in all things tech, with a specialism in sound recognition. As a seasoned CEO and CTO of Verbal Machines, he knows how to power both people and computers.\nDuring the last six months we have designed and created more than 100 (!) different models and prototypes.\nWhile the concept of Boogie Dice is simple, bouncing the dice using strong vibration and finding the right power-speed-size-weight ratio was really challenging, but we were determined to make it work.\nLuckily, we were able to fully develop Boogie Dice, ready for manufacturing. But this is only the beginning... Boogie Dice offers enormous potential to build new, innovative games based on the dice\u2019s unique features and abilities. We already have a couple more games in the pipeline, and the ideas are endless. Feel free to take part in the comments section during the campaign to share your own ideas of how Boogie Dice can add flavor and fun to both existing games as well as brand new games!\nBalance\nWe have taken several steps to make sure Boogie Dice will be perfectly balanced: the components are spread equally (weight distribution is even) and the motor is positioned diagonally (maximizing bounce).\nPLAY\n\nFormal optimization will be conducted during final production but we have extensively tested our prototypes and the results have been very encouraging, coming extremely close to perfect balance.\nHelp us roll\nBoogie Dice is definitely the most fun product we have ever worked on and we are excited to share the magic with you.

Let's see if we can reach \u00a328,000 (edited because I REALLY want to do this now!) and I will add extra excitement and Adventure to the game in the form of a sidequest featuring everyone's favourite news-sleuth Emmelina Snoopsworth! She is already going to be involved in helping Bertram extract himself from his predicklement, but if we can reach this goal then she can do some top-notch adventuring of her own! What do you say? Can we do it?\nBertram Fiddle, leading Victorian Explorator needs your help to fund his next adventure and finally discover the true identity of Geoff the Murderer. A comedy 2D Point and Click Adventure Game for PC, Mac, iOS and Android. \nContinuing the adventure from Episode 1: A Dreadly Business, Bertram and Gavin are back!\nA Dreadly Business was the first game we at Rumpus Animation ever made. It was inspired from our collective love of Victorian fiction, Hammer Horror, Lovecraft, Doug McClure, Point and Click games like Monkey Island and Machinarium and terrible, terrible jokes.\nEpisode 1 was released on iOS and Steam earlier this year and got some great reviews. It was featured as a best new game on the US, UK, German, Austrian and Russian app stores and has been published in China and Japan, where it won the Best Narrative Award at Tokyo Indie Fest. \nEpisode 1 on Steam \nDespite our best efforts we haven't quite made enough sales to pay for the full production of the next Episode. We've been toiling away on other projects and have managed to save up some of the money we need, but time waits for no man and we NEED to finish this story soon!\nSeb, the writer, illustrator and creator of Bertram Fiddle, has spent many sleepless nights writing Episode 2 by the light of the moon and is literally itching to get this new game underway. This game has a much more intriguing story which sees Bertram framed for a murdering he did not commit. As he struggles to clear his name he discovers that the mystery goes much deeper than he expected and he really does find himself in a Bleaker Predicklement. We've started building the new puzzles, scenes and characters but need YOUR help to go into full production.\nWe want Episode 2 to be bigger and better and more puzzlier than the first. The mysteries, the intrigue, the dark humour...it's all back and betterer than ever. We're partnering with German game developer Deck13 from the start this time. They made the award-winning Lords of the Fallen and were voted Best German Games company last year. They are lending us their incredible experience and are helping us make the gameplay as strong as possible. They will also be translating the game into German from the outset for all the point and click fans in Germany.\nWe learnt so much from making Episode 1 and have taken on board the comments from you, the players. This game will complete the Geoff the Murderer storyline and is going to be much more involved, with more story, more choice and even more punbelievably bad jokes.\nWe know \u00a325,000 isn't enough to make a 4 hour fully animated, fully voice-acted adventure game from scratch. But luckily we don't have to.\nEpisode 1 cost us \u00a350,000 and took a year to make. Fortunately we are in a much better position this time around. We have already written the story, designed many of the scenes and puzzles and have started building new characters.\nAlso, because of the way Episode 1 was built, we have an event sequencer and timeline system which means adding content is much faster. Good old Alexander Birke, our lead programmer from Episode 1, explains more in this talk at GDC2015. This means Episode 2 will be much easier to make than our first game.\nWe've saved up enough money from the sales of A Dreadly Business to cover the costs of Voice Actors, Recording Studio and a new soundtrack by our talented composer/jazz meister friend Cam Reynolds. So the money raised by this campaign will pay for our trusty animators, Dan Emmerson and Leah Panigada, to work full-time on bringing Bertram and his world to life, background art by myself and Emily Kimbell and additional puzzle programming by Rex Hancox.\nObviously, the more money we raise the bigger and better we can make this game. Help us make this adventure the most fantastic it can be! And if we really capture your imagination and we reach our stretch goals we have loads more Adventures for Bertram planned. Trips to the Centre of the Earth, Voyages to the Moon, Discovering Lost Worlds. He can literally go anywhere!\nWe've got some really splendid rewards to thank you for backing us. Obviously the game is first and foremost and all backers from the \u00a35 tier will receive this. But then we have some exclusive and very lovely other rewards that only the bravest Adventurers will be able to own. Have a little peek at some of them here.\nStickers\nBertram Fiddle Sticker Pack\nWho doesn't love stickers? \nOriginal Drawings\nAll backers of the GOODNESS ME tier and above will receive a signed, original ink drawing of a strange Victorian character from Seb Burnett, the creator of Bertram Fiddle.\nVariety of original ink drawings by Seb Burnett\nT-shirts\nT-shirt mock-up\nExclusive backer only T-shirts featuring Marvo the Hypno-Cat\nArtbook\nArt of Bertram Fiddle book mock-up\nA beautiful, limited edition, 96 page art book, full of sketches, characters and backgrounds from Episode 1 and 2. It will give an insight behind the scenes at Rumpus and show how we developed Bertram's world from rough ideas to final product.\nThere will also be some very special guest artwork from artists that we will be announcing throughout the campaign.\nAdventuring Tin\nTop Secret Book Tin mock-up\n As part of the MEMBERSHIP TO THE ADVENTURER'S CLUB reward you will get this fantastic 8 inch, book-shaped tin, printed to look like a, er, book, so you can hide all your secret Adventuring bits and bobs away. \nThis reward also includes a plush moustache, lovingly sewn by my wife, a letter from Bertram and printed copies of Episode 1 and 2 scripts.\nGavin Figurine\nGavin figurine work in progress\nI'm so excited about this reward! Our good friend David Kirkby, aka CastingsofCthulhu has started making an 8 inch replica of Gavin, Bertram's trusty manservant. Cast in resin, the final model will be hand-painted and limited to only 20. One of which I am totally keeping for myself.\nAll in all we have over 20 individual rewards to help you be the most well-equipped Adventurer ever. These all come with extra love from everyone at Rumpus!\nRumpus is a small Games and Animation studio based in the lovely city of Bristol, UK. Set up in 2011 by Seb Burnett and Joe Wood as a place to make fun, silly stories. They have worked on Children's TV series, music videos, commercials and their own short films and now want to bring their love of character and story to the world of games.\nSeb Burnett is the writer and creator of Bertram and they share many traits. He also illustrates sticker books and is the proud owner of a stuffed otter.\nJoe Wood is the creative director and lead animator at Rumpus. He met Seb while they were working at Aardman Animation and can often be seen wondering what would have happened if they hadn't.\nDan Emmerson is a very strange young man. One peek inside his sketchbook is enough to turn anyone's stomach. However, he is a very talented animator and gifted Unity dev so we put up with him.\nLeah Panigada is our other talented animator. She's not as weird as Dan and is blessed with a keen eye for detail. But don't make her angry, because she will rip you to shreds.\nRex Hancox runs Jetstone Studios and provides us with additional programming expertise. He worked with us on Bertram Fiddle Episode 1 and also with Kitty Powers Matchmaker, but won't say who has the best legs.\nElise Townsend is our production assistant. She is perfectly organised and runs a tight ship, but she doesn't drink tea. Which I find very suspicious.\nCam Reynolds is a Composer and Musician extraordinaire. With over 20 years experience playing in bands, composing and being cool. And he sports the finest Jazz Moustache you will ever see.\nWe want to make Episode 2 the best Adventure Game ever. Any money we receive over our goal will help us to add more content and more puzzles.\nWe are just concentrating on reaching our goal so that we can finish Episode 2 as soon as possible. But, if enough people get behind us we do have some other targets that we'd love to hit.\n\u00a330,000 - What's that you say?\nIf we reach \u00a330,000 we can afford to localise Episode 2's subtitles into French, Russian, and Spanish. We may also be able to translate them into other languages so if you have a preference, please let us know.\n\u00a335,000 - Massive Clock\n\u00a335,000 will enable us to add more scenes and more characters which means more Adventuring for YOU! \nWe will be able to employ more animators, designers and developers to make Episode 2 simply stunning in all it's grandeur.\n\u00a355,000 - Fantastical Journey!\nIf we can reach \u00a355,000 we will make a fantastical new Episode of Bertram Fiddle. The beauty of having the World's Leading Victorian Explorator as your main character is that he can have Adventures anywhere.\nEpisode 3 will be a brand new story, set in a brand new location, with a brand new mystery to solve that all backers from the \u00a35 tier and above will receive with their other rewards. Although delivery on this won't be until sometime in 2017.\nContact Details\nIf you would like to learn more about Bertram Fiddle and his adventures in Episode 1: A Dreadly Business or to poke around at some of our other films created here at Rumpus then have a ganders at\nwww.twitter.com/BertramFiddle\nwww.bertramfiddle.com\nwww.rumpusanimation.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking an Adventure Game is always an Adventure!

To hear more about the people behind this project, check out this video:\nLast year, your support made the initial print run of SILVER Volume 1 possible--remember this video?\nLast year's campaign--no pun intended--kickstarted an incredible chain of events, which included a huge convention presence, an exploding fan base, amazing reviews across the board, distribution on the direct Market through Diamond (which now perennially keeps Silver in stock),  and to a general audience through Amazon Prime, with international licenses on the way and more. To round it up, SILVER Vol 1 was nominated to the 2014 Russ Manning Award at San Diego Comic Con, it is currently in play for a 2015 Geekie Award for Best Comic/Graphic Novel, and it made ComiXology Submit's Essential Reads list.\nBut for all this, the most rewarding aspect has been to meet thousands of fans, and to feel their passion for this story and these characters.\nAND NOW, THE STORY CONTINUES WITH SILVER VOL. 2!\nIn a nutshell: Set in Bram Stoker\u2019s original Dracula universe, 50 years hence into the pulp era of the 1930\u2019s, SILVER Vol. 2 continues the adventures of master thief James Finnigan, Rosalyn \u201cSledge\u201d Van Helsing, and their team of talented but troubled individuals, as they endeavor to steal an ancient treasure hidden in Dracula\u2019s castle. Suspense, humor, intense character moments and enthralling world-building ensue as the team reaches the castle, and the veil continues to lift on SILVER\u2019s rich and unique mythology.\n\nAS SILVER VOLUME 2 BEGINS, the team boards the Orient Express, which is filled with Vampires travelling to Dracula\u2019s castle. Romantic tension builds between Finn and Sledge, but she may have an ulterior motif for being on the team. We also learn more about Finn\u2019s broken past, as it quickly becomes clear that Tao needs a role-\u00admodel in Finn...something that Finn is not equipped to provide. Nonetheless, the team succeeds in pulling off the first steps of the plan in spite of Hamilton having a panic attack at the worst possible time. The team reaches the castle, and we find a powerful, but broken Drac, who never got over the loss of Mina Harker. What happens next.... well, I'm just not going to spoil that for you!\nCHECK OUT THESE ENDORSEMENTS!\nAs with the first volume, some of my comic book heroes came out to support this new volume:\n\"Silver is so big, bold, and juicy! I absolutely love this book!\" \u2014 BILL SIENKIEWICZ (Stray Toasters, Elektra: Assassin)\n\u201cWith SILVER, Stephan Franck cuts right to the bone of the story and masterfully drives his narrative home. A breath of fresh air in the world of comics!\u201d \u2014 TOMMY LEE EDWARDS (Marvel 1985, The Question, Turf)\n\u201cWhy was I not reading this before? Why? Why? Why? It\u2019s everything I love about comics. And everything I miss about a lot of comics these days. Hey Stephan Franck, I want more.\u201d \u2014 JIM KRUEGER (Earth X, Justice, The Runner)\nThe press too, which has reviewed the release of some of the single issues compiled in SILVER volume 2 was also top notch!\n\u201cStunning. Excellence in comic book storytelling.\u201d\u2014 NEWSARAMA\nAnd weaved into the \"world-building\", are some fun little Easter eggs and cameos for the pulp fanatic, so go look for them, it's fun...\nSO WHY  KICKSTARTER?\nWith all the Volume 1 success under our belt, you might wonder why we are Kickstarting volume 2, and not just continuing on the series' own momentum. Well, that's because Dark Planet is 100% independently funded, and while we make our money selling books, ALL OUR COSTS ARE UP-FRONT, and they fall into 3 categories:\n-PRINTING: that's the price of success--the print runs keep getting bigger, and before we can sell, we need to pay for printing.\n-MARKETING: publishing is marketing. We market to the retailers, and to the readers, who range from super fan to casual reader--which mean all separate campaigns.\n-CONVENTIONS: The conventions are tremendous opportunities to connect with old and new fans, and a great retail outlet for Dark Planet. However those need to be booked and paid for sometimes up to a year in advance.\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT--We need your support to stay ahead of the game!\nREWARDS--WE HAVE THEM!\nFirst and foremost, THE BOOKS: Silver Vol 1 & 2. These trade paperbacks are 112 pages, rated teen +. Note that this edition of volume 1 is the STORE EDITION (which debuted at SDCC 14). It has been upgraded since last year's campaign (Feb 14), to include MAKING-OF pages that people have been raving about, a fancy cover with flaps, a stunning vinyl finish, and more. Get these books before everybody else!\nSILVER Vol. 1 & 2\n We debuted our shirts at SDCC this years, so we know from experience that they are a hit (the tanks sold out on the first day). They are back by popular request. The Tees are available in S, M, L, XL, and XXL, and the tanks in XS, S, and M. These shirts are printed with love in a small boutique shop right here in California, and they are beautiful!\nSledge Shirts\nSledge tanktops\nOur digital rewards aren't mere PDF versions of the books! They ALSO include the integrality of the books' layouts! These pages are all about composition, clear acting and drawing shorthands, and are a great companion for anyone interested in the mechanics and craft of visual storytelling.\nSilver Vol. 2 layout\nCHECK OUT THESE PRINTS\nSince SILVER volume 1, readers and art fans have been enjoying our limited edition prints based on some of SILVER's most striking pages! Their vintage pop-artsy look makes these pieces of sequential-art a total conversation starter in your living room, and will make your office wall cool and inspiring.\nLimited edition page-prints from SILVER Vol. 1\n We are now continuing the tradition with new limited-edition prints from SILVER Vol. 2's splashiest pages!\nNeed a touch of color? Check these out, just as vintage and cool as the other ones, \nThese are only a few. The full gallery of print will be posted before reward time, and backers who picked a print package will have A TON TO CHOOSE FROM!\nPart of the selection will include images from other corners of the soon-to-be disclosed Dark Planet universe!  \nAll our prints are presented on the highest quality art paper, giving them warm, organic feel you want in an art piece!\nCHECK OUT THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY: CTN EXPO 3-DAY VIP PASSES!\nFor any animation fan,  student or a pro, CTN is the most important event of the year! This is the place to find incredible art, get inspired, get your portfolio reviewed by top pros, attend incredible seminars, meet studio recruiters... This event help every November in Burbank, CA is just absolutely UNIQUE and AWESOME, and these tickets are A HUGE DEAL! People fly in from as far as Japan and Australia to attend!\nSTORY TELLING MASTERCLASSES!\n We have been working closely with the amazing folks at the amazing CTN animation Expo, and the affiliated  Center Stage Gallery, to set up 2 masterclasses on storytelling that Stephan Franck will teach at the Center Stage Gallery in January 2016:\n-Class #1: \"Structure and esthetic of story\" (this one is about writing and 'story with a capital S').\n-Class #2: \"Visual storytelling\", (which is more about 'drawing', and equally applies to comics, storyboarding, and filmmaking in general).\nTickets for these events are included in our reward packages -- check in the reward section on the right for details!\nUPDATE: NEW REWARDS ADDED -- LARGE SIZE ORIGINAL ART\nHi all,\nOver the weekend, I had the good fortune to visit the JACK KIRBY exhibit at CSUN, and I was extremely inspired by seeing all those original pages from the King Of Comics. I had know most of those images for most of my life, but seeing the originals was a transformative experience, and really motivated me to do more ink and paper originals.\nSo since I'm very excited to see that most of the original commissions and cameo rewards are already gone I have decided to add two more LARGE SIZE ORIGINAL ART rewards:\n-The JUMBO SIZE FAN-ART SPECIAL: (original ink, 17X22). Not only will I draw your favorite characters, but two more characters from that universe, and their environment.\n-the JUMBO SIZE SILVER UNIVERSE SPECIAL: (original ink, 17X22), which will feature the SILVER full cast of main characters (the team, the main vampires, fan fave secondary characters like Myrick, Anna Olson, etc...)\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT!

Join today!\nFounded in 1903 *wink*, the Crow Scouts pledge to Believe, and Study, and Protect Our Monster Friends. We're a movement, a social club, and a place to imagine a world where monsters are among us.\nJoin the Steam Crow Monster Scouts!\nThey (the \"Crows\") also conveniently love, support, and help our little company, Steam Crow.\nWatch our Orientation Video from 1903:\nEssentially the Steam Crow Scouts is our unique Community - something more fun, more weird, and more engaging than a generic Facebook group. We want you to be a part of it.\nWe offer Spirit Badges for being an active Crow Scout, like being a great Patron, Activist, or Helper.\nThis Kickstarter is a way for us to grow our community, offer more Spirit Badges, and do more with the Crow Scouts.\nWHO WE ARE\nDawna and Daniel Davis are the folks behind \"Steam Crow\", an indie brand of illustrated weirdness begun in 1995 as a way to live a more creative life.\nPhoto by Michael Woodall\nOver the years we've exhibited at a bunch of shows like San Diego Comic-Con, Phoenix Comicon, WonderCon, Emerald City Comicon, Denver Comic-Con, Tucson Comicon, Alamo City Comicon, LA Times Festival of Books and, well, you get the picture; we do a lot of events.\nWe've had the honor of being featured Artisan Artists at Disney's WonderGround gallery since 2012, we've spoken at ASU's school of Design, the Phoenix Art Institute, and other fancy shindigs.\nThe Reason for this Kickstarter\nWe've been trying to create Spirit Patches on our own, and the response has been great! People seem to love them, and they're fun to collect and to register on our website.\nBut the trouble has been that our prototypes in leather just aren't sustainable. They're not cheap, they take a lot of time to \"pick\" the scorch coating off, and it's been difficult to find a reliable source. (A quality laser etcher costs tens of thousands of dollars.)\nBasically, we can't keep up with demand.\nWe need to convert 35+ designs to fabric woven patches, which will look great, not requiring hand-labor to prep them, and allow for color variations. The Cost: About $7000.\nSupport of this Kickstarter will allow us to convert our badges to cloth, create a bunch of new patches, create new products, and find a bunch of new Scouts!\nHeck, we believe in this, so we're willing to put in $1000 of our own money.\nWe Believe; We need YOU to Believe, too!\nCult of the Crow\nA few Crow Scouts from our first Rally\nOkay, so we're not a \"real\" cult at all, but some have said that Steam Crow has a cult following. We like that, since our Crows are really cool, creative, and ultimately generous folks.\nEXCLUSIVE PATCH\nThis Crow & Crown double patch is exclusive to the Kickstarter; Pledging at the Starter Scout on up, well get you this patch. A $14 retail value.\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nCUSTOM KAIJU HAIKU\nWe'll write you a unique Haiku about Kaiju (giant Japanese monsters like Godzilla), and email it to you as a graphic.

The hat comes with a virtual \"Hatter\" badge which you can register on our site.\nThis level INCLUDES all Stretch Goals.

You can expect:\n* Rare photos of such Golden/Silver Age creators as Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Vin Sullivan, Paul Norris, Martin Nodell, Chad Grothkopf, Al Williamson, Sheldon Moldoff, Bob Kane, Gene Colan, Marie Severin, Irwin Hasen, Harry Lampert, Ric Estrada, Bill Ward, Ramona Fradon, Bob Haney, Nick Cardy, Paul S. Newman, Dan Barry, Carmine Infantino, John Buscema, and Frank Frazetta.\nCarrie and Marty Nodell 1991\n* Pix of the big names in mainstream comics of the period, from Neil Gaiman, George Perez, Grant Morrison, Garth Ennis, Peter David, John Byrne, Chris Claremont, Kevin Eastman, Mark Waid, Alex Ross, Dave McKean, and Frank Miller to Todd McFarlane and Rob Liefeld.\nFrank Miller, Neil Gaiman, Bill Sienkiewicz, Bernie Wrightson, Dave Gibbons 1991\n* Lots of photos of writer/artists who were movers and shakers in the self-publishing/indie comics movement, including Dave Sim, Jeff Smith, Terry Moore, Linda Medley, Billy Tucci, Colleen Doran, David Lapham, Carla Speed McNeil, James Kochalka, Dan Clowes, Chris Ware, Dean Haspiel, Evan Dorkin, Sarah Dyer, Donna Barr, Shannon Wheeler, Scott McCloud, Paul Pope, Roberta Gregory, and lots more.\nJeff Smith at APE, 1998\n*Photos of key people in comics publishing and retailing, as well as shots from behind-the-scenes industry events, such as the very first organizing meeting for Friends of Lulu in San Diego in 1993.\nSome of the women in attendance at the first meeting to discuss the formation of Friends of Lulu: Cat Yronwode, Lee Marrs, (unidentified), Kim Yale, Martha Thomases, Maggie Thompson.\n*Photos of authors such as Clive Barker, Harlan Ellison, Ron Goulart, Raymond Feist, and Nancy Collins, as well as a smattering of celebrities such as Mr. T and Julie Newmar.\nAlong with all the usual favorites who were fixtures at Comic-Con year after year, including Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Stan Sakai, the Hernandez Brothers, Trina Robbins, Steve Leialoha, Bill Sienkiewicz, Bernie Wrightson, Steve Rude, Bob Burden, Bob Schreck, Diana Schutz, Mary Fleener, Michael Kaluta, Dave Stevens, Charles Vess, Jill Thompson, Denys Cowan, Eddie Campbell, Len Wein, Matt Wagner, Jimmy Palmiotti, Rick Geary, Art Adams, Karen Berger, Michael Davis, Neal Adams, Bil Stout, Howard Chaykin, Jim Valentino, Lea Hernandez, Larry Marder, Walt Simonson, Kyle Baker, Bill Mumy, Paul Levitz, Batton Lash, and lots more!\nStan Sakai in 1991\nAs in the first book, every photo will be accompanied by a caption with personal anecdotes about my experiences with these folks and events.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTo make this book a reality, I will need to raise funds to cover the design, production, printing, distribution, shipping, and storage of a high-quality hardcover publication, as well as the cost of producing the \"Extra\" booklet, the postcards, and other perks. If the goal is surpassed, money will go toward increasing the number of pages (and photos!), upping the print run, and possibly going back to press on the first book.\nBacker Rewards\nIn addition to the book, you have a choice of a number of backer rewards. They include:\n\u2022 A set of 10 postcards of images from the book\n\u2022 A pdf of the first book, Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n\u2022 A 2016 calendar with images from the book\n\u2022 An exclusive wraparound dustjacket\n\u2022 A signed copy of the first book, Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n\u2022 The exclusive Comic Book People 2 Extra, a 32-page 8 1/2\" x 11\" booklet filled with \"out-take\" photos from the 1990s\u2014shots from parties, panels, the exhibit hall, the art auction, and other aspects of comic conventions of the era\n\u2022 Postcards and the \"Extra\" booklet for the first book, Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n\u2022 A signed copy of Renegade Romance #2 (1983), which contains one of the only two stories I ever wrote for comics: \"Daydreams,\" with fabulous art by the late Barb Rausch. Also in the issue (with cover by Jaime Hernandez): stories by Colleen Doran, Trina Robbins, Steve Leialoha/Deni Loubert, and Bob Rozakis/Stephen DeStephano. A real collector's item!\nJust Added!\n\u2022 Custom 11 x 14 frameable prints of your favorite images from either of the two Comic Book People books, color or black and white. I have arranged with Chrome Digital, San Diego's premier photo lab, to make high-quality matte-finish prints from digital scans of the original negatives. If you pledge at the $250 level, you get five prints of your choice. You can also choose single prints as an Add-On to other levels\u2014see $30 in \"Add-Ons\" below.\n The plan is for backers who attend the San Diego Comic-Con in July to be able to pick up their book at the Exhibit A Press booth (#1909). That worked out well with the first book last year, as backers were able to take their book around and get it signed by folks whose photos appeared in the book.The official publication date for the book is September 10, so most backers will get their books well before it is available via bookstores and Amazon, for instance.\nAdd-Ons\nIf none of the levels quite fits your needs, you can also take advantage of add-ons. Just increase your backer amount to include any of the following items:\n$10\u2014Set of 10 postcards from CBP2\n$12\u2014Set of 10 postcards from CBP1 (limited to 35 sets: I will remove this item from the list if/when we reach that level)\n$15\u2014PDF of the first book: Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n$20\u2014Exclusive wraparound dustjacket\n$25\u20142016 CBP2 calendar\n$30\u2014The exclusive \"Comic Book People 2 Extra\"\n$30\u2014A custom 11 x 14 frameable matte print of your favorite image from either of the two Comic Book People books, color or black and white. Each additional print is $25, and you can add as many as you'd like.\n$40\u2014A signed copy of Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s (additional shipping costs will be required for international backers)\nYou can mix and match items; just keep track of which add-ons you are paying for.\nNote that just for fun, the backer levels are named after photographers from comic books and comic strips. Which one would you like to be?\nI am open to suggestions for additional levels or perks\u2014please let me know what would you like to see or get.\nHere are a few more samples of photos you can expect to see in the book:\nJill Thompson at the 1990 San Diego Comic-Con.\nChris Ware and Kim Thompson at the 1998 San Diego Comic-Con\nRory Root, Chuck Rozanski, and Jim Hanley, ProCon 1993\nThe burgeoning self-publishing movement: Jimmy Palmiotti, James Owen, Scott McCloud, Don Simpson, Larry Marder, Martin Wagner, and Dave Sim at the 1993 San Diego Comic-Con.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving done the first book, I'm in better shape to make sure that the production and fulfillment stages run smoothly. The biggest challenges are handling all the packaging and shipping (for which I will probably seek assistance), processing international packages, and producing the \"Extra\" booklet (which took more time than I thought it would for the first book).\n\nThe first big challenge will be getting the book done and off to the printers by early May in order to have books available for the San Diego Comic-Con in early July. I am already in the process of sorting through the hundreds of photo files to choose the images that will be included.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "The Calendars Are Here!", "update_content": "At last, the 2016 Comic Book People calendars have arrived.

See updates section for details.\n WELCOME TO THE BOOK 3 KICKSTARTER!\nMy name is Paul Roman Martinez, and I am the creator of The Adventures of the 19XX. In this case, that means I am the writer, artist, designer, and everything else! Some of you may know me well and have been waiting patiently for this book. Thank you for your kind words and your encouragement over the last few months! I couldn't have finished it without you. For those of you who are new to the series, hopefully I've provided all the information you need to get caught up. Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform to help creative projects get made. My goal is for the printing costs of the graphic novel and companion book. Any extra funds will go toward producing the other items on this page. \nABOUT THE SERIES\nThe Adventures of the 19XX series takes place in the 1930s and is about a group trying to prevent World War II. After seeing terrible glimpses of the future, they know the war is coming. Along the way, they gather machines, magical ancient relics, and powerful people to help them in their cause. Another group, the Order of the Black Faun, battles the 19XX at every turn to further their own goal of ushering in a dark new world order with the beginning of a second Great War. The series begins with a young boy, known only as the Kid, being taken in by the Captain of the 19XX. Along the way, the Kid learns more and more about his father, who was once a member of the organization. The agents of the 19XX each take part in training and teaching him the ways of the group so that one day he can become the kind of hero his father was. Each book in the series takes place in a different year, and we get to explore the effect this unique family has on the Kid. Join us here for the last book in the first 19XX trilogy, 1933-1936. With your help, the next trilogy will stretch from 1937-1939! Each book is a completely self-contained adventure, but they all build toward an epic conclusion that will leave an indelible mark on self-publishing. You can start with the third book and experience a great 19XX story, or pick up the whole series and see what it's all about!\nClick here to get a look at some of the characters from the series!\nClick here to look at some of the characters from the series!\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\nThe series has been available as a webcomic since 2009. As I finish each storyline, I get feedback from readers and use that information to finalize each book. Book Three is finally done and ready to go to print. Every illustration is complete; every page is written; all I need is your help to get it made! \nSECRET FILES\nEach book in the 19XX series also has a companion book called the Secret Files.\nArt Book 1.5 Revision and Reprint\nAll pledge levels will receive access to download a digital file of the revised Art Book!\nSCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE FOR MORE ITEM DETAILS AND ADD ON INFORMATION TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR PLEDGE LEVELS.\nTo the left of each pledge level is the cost.

One way to contribute is by pledging for a book. Another way you can help is by sharing the project with your friends.

What do I want to create?\nThe book will be a 176 page story, plus extras. I always like adding surprises at the end of each book. It will have a soft cover and have the same look and feel as the previous books in the series. \nEveryone that backs my book will automatically have their name placed in it's back section because I know we could not have done this without you.\nThe Bean is an epic story, when I am done with it, it will cover 9 volumes. That's a lot of story but I am determined guy with a strong desire to make my dream happen.\nSo please take a look and find the reward that fits for you. There are a lot of cool rewards this time, including some cameo rewards for book 5. It is a popular reward and those that are in book 4 will be pleased when they get their copy to find themselves within The Bean.\nThere are two $100 rewards. The first version is a very limited special reward for those that have never been introduced to the Bean. You will get all 4 books with this version of the reward. \nThe other $100 reward does not include all 4 books, as some fans have asked. It contains extra trading cards, a print, book marks and other goodies.\n This is a very special reward- it is a nice color penciled illustration of the character of your choice in the front cover. (It's not a quick sketch). I am also upgrading all the other rewards of $150 or more to have this same option.\nThe Cameo reward is for your own character to show up in the world of the Bean. It is a small role, yet there is interaction. We had a lot of fun with the cameo's that showed up in book 4 and each one will be getting their own book. Cameos will be for book 5 and it will take two years to finish off the book. When your cameos post online, you will be notified. Some of the cameos for book 4 are making it into book 5 as well. The goal is to let you become part of the world. The only requirement is the character must follow within the realm of the Broken Moon, and cannot be from any other series. Some requests are literally not possible.\nI am also giving away pages of the original books vol 1, 2 and 3 with this Kickstarter.\nWE HIT OUR GOAL IN 14 HOURS! WOW! WHAT'S NEXT? STRETCH GOALS!\nFirst off I am very very humbled by the out-pouring of support. I am floored and very excited about where the Bean is going and I know that I could not have done this without you. Thank you very much.\nThose that are familiar with kickstarter know that once a goal is met, many creators create Stretch Goals. These goals are basically very special rewards that everyone will get. If you have been a part of my past projects you will know that my stretch goal rewards are always unique and very special. I believe in that the way to add value to a project, is to make sure all the goodies are of equal caliber as well.\nWhat I am doing different this time, is I am only going to release one Stretch Goal at a time. Once we hit that goal, I will add the next one.\n  Shipping-\nDue to international shipping costs, which in my opinion are out of control, I am forced to have to add that to my reward levels. I am willing to cover a portion of it. I am so sorry that it has to be this way. That is why I am working really hard on adding some very awesome stretch goals. I want to make it worth it for my incredible friends across the sea.\nThank you again for your support and keep creating.\ntrav", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges from running Kickstarters. The nice thing is that I am experienced in making sure that my Kickstarters run smoothly. To me it is all about creating realistic deadlines, goals and expectations. I have run 5 successful Kickstarters in the last few years. We have always delivered on time. That is important to me. \n\nYet, it does not always mean that projects go smoothly. The most important thing to me in dealing with delays, issues and other problems is communication. That is very important and I hope you take the time to ask questions, voice your concerns, and let me find ways to help smooth the process out. \n\nSome risks and challenges that always seem to happen though, is the lack of communication when we send out forms seeking information on filling out your rewards. Especially with custom art. So one way to fix this is to make sure you check your email from kickstarter or backerkit. Read what is being asked and if you don't understand send me an email and we will get back to you. I want you to be happy and get your rewards. \n\nThe the other aspect is rising shipping costs. I love my international backers, but there is always a risk in shipping overseas and the costs can be pretty expensive, so we ask that be added in. I am grateful for your support and I want to make sure you get your rewards as well. We have done really well in passing on tracking numbers, but sometimes things happen like a Canadian package taking a detour to Brazil. This does not happen often but it still can happen. So we hope you take a moment if you find a problem or feel you have not gotten your reward to send us a note and we will look into that as well. \n\nThe main thing is though is communication. It is crucial to solving these issues. Like I have said, we have run 5 very successful projects and we have learned how to deal with issues and for the most part make it better for you and for us. \n\nThank you again for supporting our great adventure. \ntrav-\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "BackerKit is Set up", "update_content": "Hello everyone!

My daughter Marley's favorite color!\nPopcorn! It's the world's #1 snack food! Americans eat enough popcorn every year to fill the Empire State Building, TWICE. It is the go-to favorite for family movie nights or watching the latest blockbuster at the movies. The problem is how do you quickly and easily mix up popcorn, especially at the movie theater. Never easy and always a mess. The answer is the PopcornBall. It is the world's only portable, reusable, mixing container for popcorn and other foods too! I guarantee once you use the PopcornBall, you'll never go back to a bowl, bag, or bucket. Buy one now and be the first person in your family and at your local movie theater to have a PopcornBall!\nJoin the PopcornBall Club. See rewards and below.\nThe PopcornBall is a 7.5inch sphere container for mixing It can hold up to 120oz or 15 cups of popcorn, a little less if used for mixing purposes. A typical bag of microwave popcorn is 10 cups. Most small movie popcorns are between 6 to 11 cups.  \nThe digital 4x6 Christmas card that comes with every reward level can be used as a $5 off coupon on our website when that launches after the Kickstarter. Valid one coupon per Backer. It will never expire. So, if it's a dollar or $100 you get the Christmas card.\nPopcorn can be a very healthy snack full of fiber, whole grains, and antioxidants but recent studies have shown microwave popcorn is not what you think it is. Try air poppers or stove top popcorn.  Mix  in all natural toppings and use less because of better distrbution with the PopcornBall.\n5 PopcornBalls for $50.  The BEST DEAL.  Fun for the whole family. \nFree Seasonings with every reward level. First 1,000 Backers Only\nThis first 1,000 Backers will get FREE Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasonings with any reward level of $15 or more. I am doubling the offer from 3 half ounce packets to 6 half ounce packets.  That's two packets of Kettle Corn, Ranch, and White Cheddar. You will be ready to get the Ball rolling when your PopcornBall arrives!\n International Shipping\nI understand shipping cost can get expensive. Your best deal is to buy more. For instance, the 5 for $50 plus $30 shipping is a total of $80.  That's only $16 per PopcornBall.  Go in with a friend or a couple of friends and save money when you buy more.\nAS SEEN ON:\nFox17 Morning News Grand Rapids, MI.

Join us at writeremergency.com to learn more about what's happening with Writer Emergency Pack.\n---\nWriting is hard. You're constantly trying to figure out what word comes next. \nCreative writing is even harder. When you're working on a story, you're not just trying to decide what word comes next, but what idea comes next.\nIt's easy to get stuck.\nI know what that's like because I'm a screenwriter. I'm lucky to have had ten movies produced, from GO to BIG FISH to FRANKENWEENIE. I also host a popular podcast about film and television called Scriptnotes.\nOver the years, I've had conversations with hundreds of writers, both on the podcast and around the lunch table. No matter what genre or medium, all writers face story problems. Plots that plod. Characters that don't connect.\nEvery writer has her own techniques for pushing past these problems -- little nudges and prompts to help get the story clicking. \nWriter Emergency Pack is a curated collection of some of the most useful suggestions I've encountered. It's by writers, for writers.\nThe Cards\nWriter Emergency Pack contains 26 illustrated cards, each featuring a different idea for getting unstuck.\nThe notion of using cards to help you write isn't new. Writers have long used tarot cards, looking for meaning in the illustrations, or decks like Oblique Strategies, with its koan-like prompts (\"Repetition is a form of change\").\nThe ideas in Writer Emergency Pack are designed to be less abstract, and more immediately useful. They're specifically tailored to people writing fiction, from novels to scripts, poems to plays. \nThe cards focus on story, character, and conflict.\nFor each illustrated Idea card, there's a matching Detail card with more specific suggestions. And on the back, you'll find tips to try.\nDetail cards (front)\nDetail cards (back)\nGive One, Get One\nOur goal is to get these packs into the hands of as many writers as possible \u2014 both the backers of the project and young writers just learning their craft. That's why we are committing to donate one deck for each backer deck we send out.\nWe're based in Los Angeles, so our initial outreach will be with programs we can visit to see what works. Ultimately, we want to send these packs all over the world. We've identified several youth writing programs we'd like to work with -- but we want your suggestions as well.\nIf you know of a creative writing program you'd like to recommend, tell us about it in the Comments section. Links and instructor names are especially helpful. Most important is your personal experience about why this particular program is so good.\nAs we learn more about how the Writer Emergency Packs are working for students, we'll be updating the Education page on writeremergency.com with tips and suggestions for using these decks with classes and after school programs.\nWhy Kickstarter\nI mostly make digital things, like apps and podcasts and websites. In the digital world, it essentially costs the same to make ten or 10,000 copies of something. It's just bits. \nWith physical goods, each unit has a real cost. When we printed demo versions of Writer Emergency Pack, each deck cost a lot. Some of that was for the paper and ink and cutting, but a lot of it was setup fees.\nThose setup fees are largely fixed. If we printed 100 rather than 10, each deck would cost less. If we could print 500, they'd suddenly be affordable. \nYou'll find lots of excellent playing card projects on Kickstarter, and this chart explains why -- making cards scales really well. As long as you can print enough at once, it's viable.\nAbout the design\nRyan Nelson designed Writer Emergency Pack, drawing inspiration from publications of the 1950s -- handbooks, manuals and field guides with strong, bold typography. (In our case, Univers.)\nWe asked David Friesen to illustrate the cards. Each one is clever and packed with details. You'll be looking at these cards a lot, so we wanted them to be fun.\nWe also have some Kickstarter exclusives, including:\nYou can read about these two special perks in our update.\nHow This All Works\nFor many of you, this may be the first Kickstarter project you've backed. So here's a quick explanation of the process.\nKickstarter isn't a store, but you can think of it as a way to pre-order something that doesn't yet exist. \nWhen you pledge money, you pick which reward you want. For example, when you pledge $19, you get one Writer Emergency Pack.\nIf you pledge higher amounts, you can choose to get additional packs and other bonus stuff.\nOnce you've chosen, Kickstarter will send you to Amazon Payments, where they'll record your pledge. They don't bill you yet. They only charge you money at the end of the campaign, and only if we reach our funding goal ($9,000).\nYou can modify or cancel your pledge at any time until very close to the end of the campaign.\nOn the podcast, I've described Kickstarter as a way of bending the universe slightly. It's a way to make something happen that otherwise wouldn't. \nBy backing Writer Emergency Pack, you're causing these cards to exist. Thank you.\nKeep coming back for updates. You can also follow the project on Twitter @writeremergency and reach me @johnaugust", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPRODUCTION\n\nAll of the artwork and text is finished. We printed two runs of demo decks, which turned out great. We tested them with professional writers, students and teachers. The feedback has been terrific.\n\nDespite our best planning, problems may arise: printing delays, earthquakes, gamma ray bursts that knock civilization back to the Stone Age. But short of global catastrophe, we should be okay. We've built in contingencies for budget and schedule that should get us through.\n\nThere's a chance we won't reach our funding goal. That would be a bummer. We would reevaluate and figure out how to do this better.\n\nThere's the chance the response could be so large that we are overwhelmed with orders. If that happens, we'll figure out how to add staff or work with a fulfillment service to get these shipments out. (There's actually a card in WEP named \"Stack of Needles\" which is about exactly this curse of success.)\n\nBottom line: If stuff comes up, we'll fix it, and we will tell you. You're backing this project because you want to bend the universe in a slightly better way. You deserve to know the highlights and hiccups along the journey.\n\nSHIPPING\n\nOur company (Quote-Unquote Films) has shipped thousands of shirts and USB drives for the Scriptnotes podcast. We're good at it. \n\nWe've studied lots of other card-based Kickstarter projects to gather tips on fulfillment. Here are some things we've learned:\n\n-> We need good addresses.\n\nWhen funding concludes, we will be sending out a survey to get your mailing address. We plan to ship these in March, but it could be as early as mid-December. So PICK AN ADDRESS THAT WON'T CHANGE. If you're in college or moving a lot, that might mean sending it to your parents or a work address.\n\n-> International shipping is expensive.\n\nFor deck-based projects, current consensus seems to be that USPS is the best value, even overseas. But we wish it were cheaper. One suggestion: Buy in bulk. If you know several people who want decks, pool your money and buy at a higher tier (i.e. Elite Dolphin Squad or Ocean Rescue Task Force). That way, you'll only pay shipping once.\n\n-> Mistakes will happen.\n\nPackages will get lost or stolen or held in customs. One good thing about these decks is that we're making a lot of them.

The initial premise was What would Santa do for fun throughout the whole year with his legendary beard? I had plenty of sketches and situations, but in the end I chose to depict the more iconic celebrations throughout the year. In addition to Christmas Eve, I figured Santa would like to take part in those events as well.\nAfter a few people who saw the art commented: \"That would make a great poster. I want one!\" \nI thought Eureka! I could turn this into a poster! Unfortunately, the original art was only suitable for a 5\" x 7\" card, so I decided to recreate the whole design from scratch, this time in vector format and experimenting with some vintage-inspired techniques, like halftone patterns and old-school red/cyan anaglyph 3D.\nThis is the early version of \"Year of Beards\". While it was suitable for a postcard, it had to be recreated for a poster size print.\nThe NEW art has been completed for both the full color 18\" x 24\" (45cm x 61cm) version, as well as the 11\" x 17\"(28cm x 43cm)3D Kickstarter Backer Limited Edition. \nMy goal is to print both posters in a high quality thick, matte finish cover stock, but if we reach our backer stretch goal, I will be able to afford upgrading to an even better, more elegant paper.\nYear of Beards Poster, full size prototype details.\nThe same goes for the anaglyph 3D edition. Keep in mind, however, that I will only be able to afford printing and shipping the Anaglyph 3D Kickstarter Backer Limited Edition if we achieve the 200 Backers stretch goal. Every pledge over $25 ($40 for international backers) will receive both posters, with red/cyan anaglyph 3D glasses included!\nHere's where you all come in. I'm ready to send the files to the printer, and if you help me make this campaign a success, all I would have to do is upload the art and click the send button!\nOK, there's a little more than that. High quality printing \u2014and shipping, in particular\u2014 is not cheap. The process involves gathering shipping materials, packaging, organizing Kickstarter surveys, printing labels, adding extras, and above all, making sure each and every one of you correctly receives your rewards.\nFinally, there will be five special Patron of the Arts slots, who will receive a special 16\" x 20\" full color, wrapped canvas edition in addition to FIVE COPIES of all other rewards. \nStretch Goals\nWhile most campaigns have stretch goals based on reaching a specific monetary goal, I really want to get this poster to as many people as possible. On the other hand, I also don't want to send out a low quality product to a large amount of people, which would be the opposite of my intention.\nWith that said, here's the deal: I want to focus my stretch goals on the number of backers, rather than how much money has been raised. This will give me a clear idea of the demand and perhaps encourage you to share with friends and family.\nOnce we reach our initial goal, which will ensure basic high quality digital printing and shipping of the full color 18\" x 24\" Year of Beards poster, these will be my initial Stretch Goals:\n100 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Every backer will receive a Kickstarter Limited Edition Have Yourselfie a Merry Little Christmas bookmark (see image below).\n150 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Year of Beards will be printed on a thicker, nicer, more elegant paper using offset printing instead of digital.\n200 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Every backer will get Year of Beards 3D Kickstarter Backer Limited Edition with red/cyan 3D glasses included (see image below). \n250 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Every backer gets my Swedish-inspired KRYSTM\u00c4S \u00c5ssembly Instrukti\u00f6ns poster (see image below).\nIf we succeed in passing that number of backers, who knows? Maybe we'll get even more awesome stretch goals ;-)\nThe Goodies\nPrototype art for new and refined version of Year of Beards poster, 18\" x 24\"(45 cm x 61cm).\nPrototype art for Year of Beards 3D Kickstarter Backers Limited Edition poster, 11\" x 17\" (28 cm x 43 cm).\nSwedish-inspired KRYSTM\u00c4S \u00c5ssembly Instrukti\u00f6ns poster, 17\" x 11\" (43 cm x 28 cm).\nHave Yourselfie A Merry Little Christmas card\nHave Yourselfie A Merry Little Christmas bookmark.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have done my fair share of printing both for personal as well as professional projects, and for the last four years I have worked with the same high quality, fully reliable print shop to ensure a consistent level of quality. Their turnarounds are quite expeditious, and for a small fee, which I'm more than willing to pay, I'm confident I can get both posters done relatively quickly. HOWEVER, if the right amount of posters isn't reached, the cost of offset printing might be excessive, and I may have no choice but to do a digital print instead. Rest assured, I'll still relentlessly aim for the highest possible paper quality, color accuracy and delivery time.\n\nFor this project, shipping on time would be the heart of the matter. I would love to get everyone your posters by Christmas or before the end of the year. However, due to the high volume of shipping during the holiday season, some of you, in particular international backers, may get your prints in January.\n\nPackage handling is another issue I've encountered, so I've chosen to use a hard cardboard tube with plastic caps. Your posters will be carefully rolled, wrapped, and placed in the tubes along with your potential goodies, like the 3D paper glasses, bookmarks or additional posters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Last one this year...", "update_content": "Dear backers, I believe this is it, at least for now.

Have you tried changing behind a flimsy towel, in a dirty public restroom, the backseat of a car, or worse?  Perhaps before or after a workout? We have the perfect solution for you. \nWith The Undress, you no longer have to resort to these potentially embarrassing and inconvenient methods of changing your clothes in public.\nThe Undress is more than just a dress, it's a SYSTEM that has many proprietary features to help you change clothes without ever getting naked.\n                      The Undress has a variety of features & benefits such as:\nHelping you change from one outfit to another without getting naked!\nIs self-packable so you can bring it anywhere, easily!\nYou can shorten the length of The Undress for wading in the water or walking in the sand!\nUse it as a car seat cover in seconds!\nWear as a dress - It's cute!\nIt's reversible! One side looks like a one-piece and the reverse side looks like a two-piece!\n                      The Undress is versatile and can serve the needs of many women, but most especially active women that train week to week, and change clothes in odd places.\nWomen on-the-go- You're busy.  And like Superman (or Superwoman), sometimes you just need to do a quick costume change. (Where did all the telephone booths go?!) \nRunners-  You run.  You run a lot.  You sweat a lot AND you still have to get back in your car after the workout.  If you're like most runners, you might need to drop by the grocery store on the way back home, or grab a drink with friends after the run.  Change out of your workout clothes easily with The Undress.\nTriathletes- You train 4-5 times a week.  And chances are, you train outdoors and are a master at the Dreaded \"Towel Tango.\"  Put The Undress in your gear bag and keep it there at all times.  It's especially handy after a Triathlon!\nBeach / Surfers - Why hike a mile back to the car or to the crusty public restroom when you can easily change clothes ON THE BEACH?  With The Undress- you can swap in and out of your bikini in a quick minute without any embarrassing slips. \nYogis-  Yoga in the park = divine.  Getting out of your $150 yoga pants in a hot parking lot with only a towel to cover you?  NOT so divine.  The Undress helps your day flow, flow, flow smoothly even after your workout\u2026\nCross Trainers-  If you're going to do 5 things in a day, do 5 workouts- not the 5 \"Dreaded Public No No's.\"  And when you're done smashing your workouts and need to swap outfits, The Undress has got you covered!  (Get it?)\nSports Teams - Your team can do a uniform swap \"on the field\" in minutes.  As a bonus, you could totally confuse the other team if you decided to do a uniform swap in the middle of the game.  Worth it.\nUse in Locker Rooms to stay discreet-  Just because you're in a locker room doesn't mean you HAVE to show everyone your \"good side\", does it?\nModels, Performers, and Actors- You are sometimes forced to change clothes without adequate facilities.  So take matters into your own hands and protect your assets by bringing The Undress to every gig around town and around the country. \nPhotographers / Videographers - You can have The Undress on stand-by as a courtesy to your models and actors.  Oh, we bet that the models are going to love The Undress so much, they might steal it. Don't say we didn't warn you!\nTravelers - You're backpacking through the country or over-seas and staying in hostels. You live for adventure but that's doesn't mean you have to change in front of complete strangers or on a crowded tour bus. Use The Undress to easily change outfits in seconds! \n   \nA fitted, soft & comfortable cotton Kickstarter exclusve t-shirt available in Women's XS-XL. Be a part of The Undress Founders Family, and wear it loud and proud!\n                      The Super Shawl is a perfect compliment to The Undress.

She continues to build ridiculously huge models out of little bricks. \nHogwart's Castle\nAt BrickCon 2012, Alice\u2019s Hogwarts took home both \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice\u201d and \u201cBest in Show\u201d \u2013 a rare combination that demonstrates not only how massive Hogwarts is (\u201cPeople\u2019s Choice,\u201d voted on by visitors during the public exhibition, invariably goes to the single biggest LEGO model in the exhibition hall) but also just how well-built and detailed it is (\u201cBest in Show\u201d is voted by all convention attendees).\nRIVENDELL\nAlice teamed up with David Frank to recreate Rivendell, one of the iconic locations in Middle-earth,\u201cthe last homely house west of the mountains,\u201d where Elrond hosts both Bilbo and his dwarven companions in The Hobbit and Frodo and the Fellowship in The Lord of the Rings.\nThe World of Mouse Guard - Emerald City ComicCon - Seattle 2015\n  ArchLUG is a LEGO User Group based out of Western Washington, whose members share a love for LEGO, especially as it pertains to creating MOCs (\"My Own Creations\") focused on landscapes and world architecture, historic, modern, or futuristic. Their goal is to foster relationships with other AFOLs (\"Adult Fans of LEGO\") who share their same passion for building, and also to inspire those around them to appreciate the endless possibilities that LEGO provides as a medium to create and replicate both original and existing structures from around the world. After a successful group display of Laketown from the Hobbit, ArchLUG will be building a collaborative display for Emerald City Comic Con in March 2015 of the World of Mouse Guard. \nArchLUG is excited about the many interesting settings, stories and adventures that they will be able to create using the heads, accessories and capes developed for Bricks of the Mouse Guard!\nHOW DO YOU MAKE AWESOME STUFF LIKE THIS?\nThese high-quality injection-molded collectibles are fully licensed from the author-illustrator David Petersen and are ready to add fun to your favorite brick characters.   They fit your favorite miniature figures like LEGO\u00ae, Kre-O\u00ae, Kubrick\u00ae, Character Building\u00ae, Si-Dan\u00ae and Friends\u00ae.\nA long process of digital sculpture in various CAD and art programs is done to create the initial art. Many weeks of refining and direction are used to find the perfect balance of aesthetics and engineering. Real-world prototypes are created from these digital art files and these are then evaluated to make sure they are going to fit the proportions and style of the figure. It takes a long time but it is well worth the wait!\nWhat remains is to finance the expensive process of machining the steel injection-mold tooling followed by the tuning of the production process to create the actual parts via injection-molded plastic. This is the same high-quality ABS material and colors used by LEGO\u00ae and other popular brick products.\n THE CRATE OF THE MATRIARCH!\n BrickArms ( www.brickarms.com ) is the #1 provider of custom weapons and parts for your favorite brick figures.\nThey have created these amazing minifig-scaled crates and, as part of your pledge offering, you can get one of these special custom-printed Crates of the Matriarch only available through Kickstarter. The Munchkin Bricks, Pigs VS Cows and SKULLS Crates have already become sought-after collectibles. The final design for the Mouse Guard crate is still an ongoing work-in-progress with David Petersen.\n At CrazyBricks, we love Kickstarter!\nWhat better way to reach the fans of our favorite Graphic Novels and custom brick accessories and bring them all together!\nBricks of the Mouse Guard will be featured in the Emerald City ComicCon display in March but we want YOU to have a set too!

You can still make a pledge now, even if it's just a $1, to get all the updates. The re-launch is pending approval from the Kickstarter managers. With this new lower goal we should make our goal so jump on board now to take advantage of the new offers. There will be new rewards and the first 1000 backers get 6 packets of Free Seasonings.\nWelcome to the PopcornBall Kickstarter page. If you are not familiar with how Kickstarter works, it is an \"all or nothing\" fundraising campaign. If the pledges do NOT exceed the funding goal, you will NOT be charged. If the goal is reached you will be charged when the campaign ends.\nMy name is Mike Baxter and I am the inventor of the PopcornBall. The PopcornBall idea originated when I was rolling a ball with my daughter (see \"gift for kids\" photo below) when she was just 18 months old.  In order to make the PopcornBall a real product we need your donations and your help sharing our Kickstarter with your friends and family. I appreciate you looking at my Kickstarter and my family and I greatly thank YOU for your donations!\nJoin the PopcornBall Club. See details at bottom of page.\nThe PopcornBall is a 7.5inch sphere container for mixing\nIt can hold up to 120oz or 15 cups of popcorn, a little less if used for mixing purposes. A typical bag of microwave popcorn is 10 cups. Most small movie popcorns are between 6 to 11 cups.\nWhy do we need $50,000? The money will go towards the expensive plastic injection mold tooling for manufacturing.\nUPDATE: The digital 4x6 Christmas card that comes with every reward level can be used as a $5 off coupon on our website when that launches after the Kickstarter. Valid one coupon per Backer. It will never expire. So, if it's a dollar or $100 you get the Christmas card.\nFEATURED ON:\nFox17 Morning News Grand Rapids, MI.

Current ice cream scoops are designed in a way that forces you to use weak wrist joints to scoop ice cream. When you are scooping ice cream with standard ice cream scoops, you are doing a prying motion. This prying motion puts tremendous amounts of stress on your weak wrist joints. Your brain then tries to save your wrists by not letting you pry very hard--thus making scooping ice cream very difficult.\nThe Design\nThrough an engineer's understanding of ergonomic design and mechanical force, I came up with a design that protects the wrist when the Midnight Scoop is held. If you're using the Midnight Scoop properly, you're not using the small weak muscles located inside the wrist. Instead, you hold the curved end with the palm of your hand and \"push\" into the ice cream. This allows you to keep your wrists straight and protected while you use large muscles like your arms and chest \u2013 which are significantly stronger than your wrist. This \u2013 to me \u2013 is how to scoop ice cream properly.\nThe Midnight Scoop protecting your wrist from strain\nThe Facts\nHot-Forged From Solid 6061 Aluminum\nMultiple Industrial-Strength Coatings\nErgonomic Design\nLaser Engraved Logo\nPatent Pending!\nSolid Aluminum - This is Bomb-Proof!\nThe Handle\nThe magic is in the handle. The ergonomically shaped curved of the handle lets you push the Midnight Scoop with your palms. Your wrist are kept straight and protected. The handle is also long enough to help you reach all parts of a giant container of ice cream yet narrow enough to fit inside small pint size containers just as well. The Midnight Scoop works exceptionally well with hard-frozen ice cream. No more waiting to thaw \u2013 no more bending spoons \u2013 and no more hurting yourself. \nThe Scoop\nThe front scoop section is thin enough to cut through ice cream like butter, and thick enough to last. The base of the scoop design forces ice cream to curl into that appealing ice-cream-advertisement look, every time. \nThe Midnight Scoop's Advantage\nSure, there are heated ice cream scoops out there. However, who wants melted ice cream? The Midnight Scoop allows you to serve the coldest/hardness ice cream. Don't let your brain tell you not to scoop harder because it is afraid to hurt your wrists. Scoop through hard ice cream easily and correctly by using the beautiful, Midnight Scoop!\nAbout Midnight Scoop, Inc.\nOur company is built on the same principles as the Midnight Scoop \u2013 start with the right components, and build something to last. We are a close, tight-knit group that all share the same dream. We are based in South Lyon, MI \u2013 about an hour west of Detroit. At no point was this handed to a world-class design firm with thousands of products that look slightly different. It's a homegrown grass-roots dream.\nLook Who's Been Talking About Us.. \nCall to Action\nKickstarter, between our video and the description above, you should have a pretty good idea on what we have to offer, and where we are with our project. This Kickstarter campaign will allow us to move forward with production tooling and packaging, with expected delivery (barring significant hiccups) slated for the end of December 2014 (before Christmas!--great gift idea!)\nAll we need now is you. If you want to see this purpose-driven and quality-focused project and company get off the ground, become a backer of Midnight Scoop! \nProduction Colors - Natural, Ebony, Graphite, Moonstone\nColors Shown: Natural, Ebony (black), Graphite, Moonstone (white)\n  The Pledges\nOur pledges are fairly self-explanatory. The early adopter specials have the best prices \u2013 and limited quantities. We have complete packages (all four colors) available in both early adopter special and standard Kickstarter pricing. No-one will ever get a Midnight Scoop for the price we are offering right now! Once our backers have all had their Midnight Scoops delivered, we will open our e-commerce store, selling each scoop for $50. We have plans for expanding our product line, but right now the Midnight Scoop is the one and only thing on our radar!\nAnd that one and only thing is GORGEOUS!\nPushes through any container of ice cream easily\nWhen something is designed right, it just looks right\nLimited Edition - Gold\nLimited Edition - Pink\nLimited Edition color - This is the color of the exclusive Kickstarter-Green Edition\nPlease share this project with your friends and families \u2013 anyone who may be interested in a better way to scoop ice cream.

With the success on our first campaign of our first ever branded playing cards earlier on the year, we are now introducing a whole new concept to a deck of playing cards which you can touch, feel and admire as well as play.\nStealth Edition\nClose-up on high gloss - Stealth Edition\nTable spread\nAce of spades\nIn addition to the traits of a traditional deck of cards, Impressions playing cards gives you the added sense of touch on the artwork, brought to you using the latest in printing and secondary process technology which we have recently invested heavily in. We are using premium quality 310gsm German casino grade card stock with a black core centre layer.\nThe Impressions Playing Cards range\nCreating Impressions playing cards was by no means straight forward as the whole normal printing and production process of a traditional deck of cards had to be altered. Adding the special raised embossed gloss effect to the cards essentially increased the height of the deck so the cutting process had to be reconfigured. Also, the fact that we have applied this special layer on the surface top of each card meant that the finishing had to be completely changed so as to not lose the shine effect but keeping them true to their original purpose which is the playability aspect. We have had countless trials using different methods, materials and finishing which alone have lasted 3 months. We are now extremely happy to say that we have got it right.\n\nThe 3 decks (now 4 decks - 29 Sept.)\nThere are 2 main decks in this Kickstarter project. These are the Impressions Stealth Edition and the original Impressions deck. We also have an enlarge court cards special deck called the Impressions Court Edition.On 29th September, we released a new white deck called the Phantom Edition. This is the 4th deck to join the Impressions by MPC range.\nStealth Edition\nStandard Edition\nCourt Edition\n And the all new Phantom Ed. deck\nPhantom Ed. tuck box\nAside from our in-house traditional offset printers, latest large-scale digital industrial printers, this year we at QP have also invested significantly on state of the art secondary process machines, one of which we are using on our Impressions playing cards. This new digital technology is able to apply embossed UV to images with pinpoint accuracy. Some of you may say this is traditional spot UV but they are distinctively different. First of all, no expensive setup is required i.e. there is no MOQ. Second of all, spot UV is almost flat whereas this is able to achieve up to 250 microns (braille effect) in polymer height which is 100 times higher than selective varnish. It can be looked as a mix between enhanced UV and digitized embossing. We can apply different densities ranging from 1-100% through the same pass which normal spot UV cannot achieve. In terms of the glossiness, it achieves 99GU which is the highest gloss possible for printed material. What does this mean? Well, it means that your selected areas of colors will stand out even more through this raised gloss effect and what's more, you can experience the touching of it. The results are astounding which you can see in the photos here.\nWe have applied this glossy raised effect onto the cards here in this project as well as onto the tuck boxes. What\u2019s more, we have found a way to make the cards playable even after apply this secondary process which is a major breakthrough.\nWe took the traditional design for playing cards which is in the public domain, redrew the card faces completely making the design unique to the MPC brand. For the back, we also come up with a symmetrical design using a tree as the focal point since playing cards are essentially paper which originates from trees, hence the inspiration for the design.\ncard back design\nThe MPC Impressions range\nAs mentioned above, there are 3 decks in this project. The original Impressions deck is the main deck with the glossy embossed effect applied to it. The Stealth Edition is a really special design using the color black and virko to create the stand out design. The Court Edition enlarges the artwork on the court cards which aside from the unique design, players can properly experience the look and the touch and feel of the polymer applied to the card faces. We love all three decks as these should be the first on the market using this kind of new technology.\nStealth Edition\nStandard\nCourt Edition\nThe tuck boxes for this Kickstarter project is unique and limited to our Kickstarter backers in this project only. How? Well, we have especially printed \"Kickstarter Edition\" on the top flap of the boxes as shown below. We have applied varying levels of virko densities to different areas of the box. Basically the more polymer we apply to a specific area, the more raised and glossier it becomes. On top of this, if we reach funding of more than $10k, we will be adding our special gold foil seals to the boxes as an added mark of authenticity of a limited edition deck. These KS edition boxes will never be produced and released again so once they're gone, they're gone.\nTuck boxes - different density levels to different areas\nTuck box close-up\n\nHow do they handle? Can they bend?\nSome people are curious as to how these cards handle and whether they can bend. Using my limited handling skills, I created 2 videos for you to analyze and to help answer your many questions. Enjoy!\n$10,000: If we reach this funding goal, we will upgrade our tuck box seals to digital gold stamped foil. Beautiful!\nGold foil seals\nUnveiling the Phantom Ed. deck\nWe have also added the all new Phantom Ed. deck which we released on the 20th day of our project. It's available as a add-on for $13.\nImpressions Phantom Ed.\nThe 1st ever MPC chips give away to pledges of $35+\nWith the addition of another newly sought digital UV printing machine, we created the first ever MPC chips which we are going to give away in this project.

For example: \"I Feel Panicked At The Beach Because I Saw ______!\" You can shout anything, like, \"A shark!\", \"A smoke monster!\" or even \"My grandmother in a bikini!\".\nThe fastest player to shout a valid answer wins the point, but you have to outwit your friends - if two or more players answer, the host player picks his or her favorite. The games moves rapidly, switching from scene to scene in seconds - from Your First Date to A Haunted Mansion to Outer Space!\nThe first player to gain 3 points is the winner. Learning and playing the game are quick - just like your knee-jerk reaction!\nWant to try playing with the cards? Try out the Knee Jerk Randomizer!\nFast, Simple Gameplay: Because the fastest player to answer wins the point, the game zooms by. Each situation lasts ~10 seconds, and if you didn't win the last one, there's another one coming in just a moment's time. The game is also quick to set up and learn, with just a half-sheet of instructions.\nNo Downtime: In Knee Jerk, everyone plays at the same time. Only the host handles the cards, so there's no clean up between rounds.\nOver 150,000+ Combinations: With Knee Jerk's innovative \"arrow-locking\" card design, any three cards can be combined. This means you could play the game over 10,000 times and never see the same situation twice!\nOpen-Ended Answers: Any ending is possible in Knee Jerk - it's all up to your imagination. You could mention your badass grandma, that dinosaur you rode, or the fake superpower no one knows you have. The endings are limitless because you're not trapped within the confines of \"answer\" cards. Feel free to be as creative, dirty or family-friendly as you like.\nPortable: Knee Jerk is one deck of 55 cards, so you can easily slip it in your pocket or purse. And you don't have to sit around a table to play!

My first licensed board game, Merc Mayhem, is due out by publisher APE Games in 2015. My background is in video games, working at PopCap Games on Bejeweled Blitz, Zuma Blitz, and Solitaire Blitz. I was also the lead designer at SilverTree Media on the Disney TRON Legacy online games Disc Battle and Light Cycle. I gained my chops at Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center from leading game design professor Jesse Schell. You can read more here in my interview with Indie Cardboard.\nMark Major is the graphic designer and other developer of Knee Jerk. He was a finalist in the 2014 Tabletop Deathmatch series, and in March he won the The Game Crafter's Mystery Design Challenge. Mark has licensed two of his games to board game publishers, including Jupiter Rescue by Twilight Creations and Chimera Station by Tasty Minstrel Games. He has also designed video games, with experience on Cave Story and 1001 Spikes. Mark is also a contributor to the League of Gamemakers.\nWe conceived of Knee Jerk at a Game Design Summit in 2013.

Each piece is painstakingly sketched, cut, and layered (then often affixed  to wood).  No paint, no ink, just lush, textural paper; especially handmade Japanese washi and chiyogami.  It's still a wonder to see images and ideas plucked from my mind take papery form. \nThanks for checking out my project.  I hope you'll join us!\nVote for More Art!\nEver since the Calendar Campaign debuted here on Kickstarter, it has been my honor to express my gratitude to the backers by including their names on the calendar's \"Thank-you Page\". Long story short, we've had to end that tradition.\nOn the plus side, Two more pages have opened up for new, never before seen (in the calendar) artwork. I've narrowed the choice down to 5 great images. Now, it's up to you to tell us your 2 favorites.\nVote for the Art for the More Art! pages\nclick to vote\nThe Art\n(more images coming soon!)\nStretch Goals\nShould we be lucky enough to surpass our goal, it will allow us to refill our supplies of rewards, knock out a bigger print run of calendars, PLUS we've got some very cool ideas to make this project even more fun!\nReached!, reprinting Postcard Pack 4\nReached!!, Stickers Thank-you gift.

It's a great way to experience the wonder of paper artwork throughout the year.  Happily, the \u00a5en has held steady this year, so reward levels are still friendly!\nThe Ram T-shirt\nsample image: size and design may vary slightly from image\nThis t-shirt features the Year of the Sheep Ram half-face design from this year's LaserCut on both front and back, including all of the Kamon family emblems and traditional Japanese design elements you could desire.  Available in charcoal grey from United Athle Japan (english-ish), it is my first foray into clothing.  The plan is to produce 100, at least in our first shot.\nT-shirts are 100% cotton, and are available in unisex sizes XS, S, M, L, XL & XXL\nNote:  Japanese sizes differ slightly from US / European sizes. For example, Japanese style shirts aren't as long as current US styles.  Please check the size chart.\nLimited Edition Laser Cut Prints\nCut-by-Cut creation of the \"Year of the Sheep\" LaserCut Print\nThe \"Year of the Sheep\" limited edition LaserCut\nThanks to everyone for helping us reach our LaserCut stretch goal again this year!\nAs with all my lasercuts, there will never be more than 200; 100 have been set aside for Kickstarter backers. As a special thank-you, I'm thrilled to chop $20 off of the usual asking price until the end of the campaign.\nThe cut-by-cut creation of the Year of the Sheep LaserCut The cut-by-cut creation of the Year of the Sheep LaserCut\nclick to enlarge\nIntricately designed & gorgeous in their simplicity, both the Year of the Horse and the Year of the Snake lasercuts are signed and numbered by the artist. Frame not included.\nclick to enlarge\nThe Postcard Packs \nEach pack contains 5 full-color 10x15cm postcards (it's close to 4x6\") featuring papery goodness.  for details, check here.\nPostcard Pack 1\n Postcard Pack 2\n Postcard Pack 3\n Postcard Pack 4\n Open Edition Gicl\u00e9e Prints\nAll Open-Edition Gicle\u00e9s are printed with 6-color archival inks on high quality Deep PV 186 g/m2 Fine Art paper. Each is inspected and stamped with my personal hanko seal. Please check out the 17 prints currently available on my Website's Print Page. I plan to make perhaps 2 more prints available (tho I haven't selected which images yet).  Frame not included.\nAdd Ons\nBy popular demand!   Please check the chart below and add the price of the item(s) to your current pledge amount. In the post-campaign survey, you'll be able to specify your add-on items.\nWant a reward you don't see?  Have Questions? Contact me!\nWhere the Money Goes\nPrinting and shipping and boxes. The pledges you make cover the cost of printing the full-color A4 size wall calendar (around 8 1/4 x 12 inches, or 16 1/2 inches high when open). It also includes the cost of packaging for safe shipment all over the world from here in Fukuoka, Japan, and the shipping costs for all your rewards (unless otherwise noted).\nIf we go over the goal, the excess will go to re-printing postcards and purchasing more reward materials. The goal covers printing 100 calendars, so if we get more than 100 backers, we will need to up our order to 250 calendars, and so on. Last year, we bumped our order to 1000 calendars. Happily, printing is more-or-less a fixed cost. Shipping, however keeps reaching for the sky.\nWhat Happens Next?\nThe calendar portion is coming along nicely. The basic design will be the same as last year's, including the Tiger cover. Of course, the dates need changing. I've already picked out which images will be retired. I'm also prepping the art for the freebie stickers and the t-shirt.\nSpecial Thanks\nMy deepest appreciation to my good friend,Patrick Washburn.  Not only did he make it possible for me to become aWobblehead, but he also will be handling the conversion process that makes the Laser Cut Prints possible!\nI would be remiss to leave out all of the amazing washi paper makers scattered throughout Japan.  Although I cannot name them all here, without their work, this art wouldn't be half as colorful as it is.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges associated with any creative project. The last few years have been big learning experiences, and I've realized that obstacles can pop up in the most surprising places. Happily, with a little determination they can also be overcome.\n\nI already have a relationship with the calendar's (and postcards') publisher, and have much of the artwork optimized for their press. The calendar itself is laid-out, and only dates & some images need to be changed. Creating the second lasercut print was a much smoother endeavor than the first. Tokyo Shiki is a pleasure to work with.\n\nLast year, the \"Thank-you\" gift was a set of magnets. They were surprisingly expensive in bulk, and a not so much fun to ship. This year, we are avoiding rewards that might worry Post Office workers.\n\nThe only real complication comes from my plan to visit the US for 10 days or so this October. While I can't control what happens to the airplane, I do intend to get as much preparation as possible done before I begin traveling. I hope to place orders right after landing in Japan, if not sooner. I'm going to be doing my best to get all of the rewards shipped in time for the holidays. If any unforeseen delays pop up, I'll try to prioritize those of you who want to give the calendar or other goodies as gifts.\n\nThe only other variable I can think of would be a sudden and drastic swing in the \u00a5en/Dollar exchange rate, which wouldn't affect the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "The 2017 Cut Paper Art Calendar has launched!", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nThank you again for your support on the 2015 Cut Paper Art Calendar!\nI can't believe a year has gone by already.

In fact, from the time he sprang out of bed in the morning, until his mom pulled his boots off at night, Jon-Lorond knew that he was special. That he was destined for greatness. After all he was a super hero.\u201d\nWe follow Jon-Lorond through one of his extraordinary, yet ordinary, days that doesn\u2019t go quite as he had planned. Jon causes grief in the library, takes down the queue at the bank, and then wreaks havoc in the grocery store. To make matters worse, his mom thwarts all his attempts to protect her from the pirates that lurk around every corner of his imagination. Could any day feel less heroic? Just when all hope is lost, a damsel\u2019s cry for help springs him back into action. Will his training prepare him for what he is about to face? Will he finally be the hero he knows he can be?\nTHE WHY:\nI really love children\u2019s books and I love reading them to my children. When my girls were little we read Fancy Nancy, Ladybug Girl, and Pinkalicious. Eloise, Olivia, Madeline, and Molly Lou Mellon.\nThen I had boys. Two of them. While they are both huge Fancy Nancy fans I was discouraged when I tried to find a children\u2019s picture book where the boy was the imaginative, funny, and intelligent protagonist. You know, the hero of the story. A book where my little men could learn that boys knew big words and still had the ability to save the day. A book that celebrated the special qualities that makes a little boy unique.\nThat is where the idea of Jon-Lorond began. For the last two years I have been writing and re-writing, going to conferences, getting feedback, re-writing, and trying to find a home for my beloved book. After exhausting all my options. I tried again. And again.\nFinally, I decided to try this publishing thing one more time, only this time taking a different route to the finish line. Self-publishing. I am partnering with a very talented artist, Luke Flowers, to bring the world of Jon-Lorond to life. But I need your help. Without you this story will not get told.\nJon-Lorond is always ready for action.\nSO HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO COST?\nThat is a good question. I have done my research and have done my best to bring to you the best quality picture book for the most reasonable price. If you were like me before I started this process, I would have looked at that big goal number up there and said you have got to be kidding me! But the truth is that the best things in life are never free.\nCurrently, my goal number is set a little over half of what my total fees are going to be.\n\nCaptian Red Beard- Jon's arch nemesis.\nSO IS JON-LOROND A BOOK JUST FOR BOYS?\nI am so glad you asked that! The answer is a resounding no. Jon-Lorond\u2019s story is one that I believe will touch the hero in every child\u2019s heart no matter their gender.\n\nWHAT HAVE YOU DONE ALREADY?\nThat is a great question. The story has been written, professionally edited, commented on by industry professionals, re-written and edited again. And again. And again. This story is ready to go to press. \nLuke Flowers has done a ton of character concept work as well as completed the book's cover. He is ready to story board and finish illustrating this story.\nI have contacted several printing companies and chosen the one that I think will give us the best product for the most reasonable price. \n\nWHAT IS THE BOOK'S TIMELINE?\nWhen we meet our fundraising goal, Luke will go to work illustrating the story. We have left three full months for this part of timeline. Luke will story board and then complete the illustrations and design. This will give him more than enough time to get the illustrations just right.\nThen around the first part of January we will send the book to press. This takes anywhere from 6-8 weeks. (We get a better deal if we are not in a rush) I should have the books in hand no later than the first part of March. That will give me a month to put all the mailers together to have them in your hands no later than the first part of April.\nI plan to release the book to the general public on April 28th 2015, which just happens to be national super hero's day. So by supporting this KickStarter you are getting your books a full month ahead of everyone else.\nTHE REWARDS:\nThe Enemies of Imagination Poster\nThe Limited Edition Artist Sketch of Jon-Lorond.\nCaptian Red Beard Art Print\nBirdBrain Art Print\nChurocho Art Print\nChip Art Print\nGarsh Art Print\nMcGeehee Art Print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks and challenges with any start up project.

This project grew directly out of the Flight Playing card project. In doing research for great items related to playing cards, airships, and aviation, I came up with this idea for an airship or zeppelin USB drive. It was a little too large a project to add to the Flight Deck campaign, and it was too cool to be abandoned, so I thought I'd produce it on its own. It\u2019s not up to me though! That\u2019s the great thing about Kickstarter. If you want this drive to exist, then claim one for yourself, and be sure to share it around on Facebook, reddit, and twitter. If you're obsessed with airships like me, then you know we need more airship stuff out there!\nThe Airship USB drive is based on the USS Macon and USS Akron airships. With their rows of square vents engineered to control moisture used for ballast, these two airships have a very unique design. Their design makes them the perfect choice for the first Flight drive. \nRight now, the plan is for an 16gb (upgraded from 8gb!) flash drive which can be upgraded if we can get past the project goal. So, if you want a larger drive for the same cost, then definitely share this project with people who might be interested!\nThis project comes with Two Limited Edition Tins (a third tin now available-see below) that have been modeled after vintage tin and oil can designs. If you've seen my other projects, then you know I'm a fanatic for interesting packaging. I created these designs just for this flash drive campaign. Each tin comes with (1) Airship USB Flash Drive, (1) clear acrylic display stand for the USB drive, (1) 1\" pin, and each drive comes pre-loaded with airship wallpapers and airship related desktop icons that are also designed and illustrated by me.

Paul Jenkins here! If you\u2019re aware of my previous Kickstarter campaigns, then you know about the world of Fablewood, an amazing fictional forest where all of the stories that have ever been told are divided by genre borders into separate realms. But even if you\u2019re just discovering Fablewood, that\u2019s okay, too! As long as you don\u2019t mind a little bit of this and a little bit of that, you will love FICTION SQUAD!\nAs for us\u2026 we really need your help to bring Fablewood to life once again\u2014we cannot do books like this without you, and for your help we are eternally grateful!\nFICTION SQUAD tells the story of Frankie Mack, a failed gumshoe detective from the Realm of Crime Fiction, a lost character from an old 20-page novella that nobody remembers. After a lifetime of failure, Frankie crosses the genre border into the Realm of Children's Stories where he discovers that every nursery rhyme is a crime scene. But the Realm of Children's Stories is a dangerous place\u2014the Queens and the Witches are the Mob, the Mayor is a Crooked Man, and the Police Chief, Tom Thumb, is in everyone\u2019s pocket! And when someone drops a house on the Wicked Witch of the East it's up to Frankie and his idiotic partner, Simple Simon, to solve the crime before the Madonnas tear the place apart.  \nFablewood began life in the story of FAIRY QUEST (by myself and Humberto Ramos), which has been a successful and much-loved series printed in many countries across the world! You are our publishers and partners in this endeavor. Thanks to Kickstarter backers, we have had tremendous success. I always said that I would publish here as long as I could, and so for the duration, Fablewood belongs to you.\nWhich brings us here. I have stories I want to tell. People would like to read these stories. But it\u2019s not simple\u2014or cheap\u2014to produce them and distribute them to an audience. The Kickstarter community has been great to me\u2014I have successfully funded three campaigns now, and each time, I am eternally grateful to the lot of you. With you as my co-publishers, I've been able to carve out time from my \u201cday job\u201d as a work-for-hire comics writer (I know, woe is me, right?) to work on something I've created, something I love, and that\u2019s this, the world of Fablewood.\nFICTION SQUAD is, for lack of a better phrase, a sequel to FAIRY QUEST. But Fablewood is a giant place\u2014there are thousands of characters, and, much like everyday life, each one has their own story. FICTION SQUAD posits that every nursery rhyme you know is actually the result of a crime. Our main character, Frankie Mack, is a failed detective who, with his partner, Simple Simon, tries to prevent a full-scale war from breaking out after Humpty Dumpty and the Wicked Witch of the East both meet untimely demises under suspicious circumstances.\nJoining me to tell this story is Ramon Bachs, a fantastic artist and great friend who worked with me on the Front Line series for Marvel and has spent many years working for both DC and Marvel. Ramon is one of my favorite creative partners ever and just like Humberto, there was no one else in my mind to bring FICTION SQUAD to life. If you are a fan of FAIRY QUEST and Humberto\u2019s work, you will love what Ramon brings to FICTION SQUAD. He will do this series justice! And as with Leo Olea\u2019s beautiful coloring from FAIRY QUEST, we have another Leo (Paciarotti) doing amazing color work to keep our universe looking wonderful and vibrant (not to mention consistent).\nAnd that\u2019s right, I said series. Unlike the previous two FAIRY QUEST books, which were both 48-page hardcovers modeled on the European graphic album format I love, FICTION SQUAD is going to be a six-issue limited series. There will definitely be a collected hardcover at the end of it all for those of you that prefer to binge-read the entire thing at once, but if you prefer the one-chapter-a-month thing, you can pledge for that! When it's all done, this limited series will contain one, complete, self-contained story (as opposed to FAIRY QUEST, whose story is divided into three volumes of two chapters/issues each).\nI have once again enlisted the help of my mates at BOOM! Studios to help with logistics like printing, fulfillment, and shipping. (It keeps me sane so I can focus on writing!) As with FAIRY QUEST, I have granted them the license to reproduce FICTION SQUAD for the mass market, but you, my co-publishers, the Kickstarter community, are the only ones who will get the Kickstarter-exclusive covers, the collected hardcover, and the other cool rewards I\u2019ve lined up.\nWill you return with me to Fablewood once again?\nOUR BOOK\nThe land of Fablewood\u2014where all of the stories live side-by-side\u2014is a pretty dangerous place, and no area is more dangerous than the City of Rimes, deep in the heart of the Children\u2019s Realm. For it\u2019s a little understood fact that virtually all nursery rhymes (and most children\u2019s stories) are, in fact, crime scenes.\nTo make matters worse, the city exists under the shadows of two long-established Madonna crime families, led on one side by the Queens of the Card Crime Syndicate and on the other by the Wicked Witches of the East and West Side. Most of the seediest characters live in a run-down area known as the Bricks.\nThe Queens operate out of Kings, and the Witches run a numerology scam out of the Turnip District. There\u2019s even a subway system built out of the old mines, operated by dwarves and trolls. Fact is, you can\u2019t turn around these days without someone poisoning someone else with an apple, or some poor mook getting pushed off a wall or \u201cfalling\u201d down a hill when they\u2019re out fetching a pail of water. Half of Rimes\u2019 citizens are certifiably insane, and it\u2019s just a matter of time before the other half is eaten by wolves, abducted by trolls, or locked up in a castle tower. The Chief of Police\u2014a guy by the name of Tom Thumb\u2014is in everyone\u2019s pocket. Make a stink and you\u2019ll probably be getting a visit from some flying monkeys or a pack of bloodthirsty cards in a dark alley.\nThe City of Rimes needs a hero. It\u2019s about to find one. He just doesn\u2019t know it yet.\nI want to once again sincerely thank everyone who supported the first two FAIRY QUEST raises. In this new story, we\u2019re expanding the world beyond Red and Mr. Woof\u2019s story, to the gritty cities rife with corruption. It\u2019s a hard-boiled detective story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, but it can\u2019t happen without your help. Kickstarter is a wonderful tool that has helped our projects get off the ground, and it\u2019s all because of you, our co-publishers and partners in crime...err...prevention!\nOUR CAMPAIGN\nSo why are we asking for $60,000? I want to be as transparent as possible so here\u2019s a handy chart breaking down exactly where your pledge money would go:\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIf Ramon and I hit our initial goal of $60,000, we have some really cool stretch goals lined up! \n UPDATES\nKeep watching as the raise goes along because I intend to post as many updates as I can, including video messages!

It is the tale of a lovable alligator who secretly stows away with a family after a chance encounter during their Florida vacation.

It will be a high-quality, hardcover, numbered, limited edition.\nSneak peeks:\nWho is this \"Dozi\" and what's the big idea here?\nIn 2010 I was very fortunate and honored to have my comic strip, \"Hoxwinder Hall\", voted a Top-5 finalist in the Washington Post's \"America's Next Great Cartoonist\" contest. That bit of success gave me the confidence to launch the strip as a web-comic, which eventually lead to it being picked up for print syndication in parts of the United States and Canada.\nAt the heart of my comic is a little alligator named \"Dozi\". It didn't take long to realize that Dozi resonated with readers, and that got me thinking about how much a younger audience would REALLY love him! So I created a children's book that tells the story of how Dozi meets Byron Hoxwinder (the little boy and the other main character in the comic strip). And here we are!\n\"Dozi the Alligator\" is basically a Prologue to my comic strip. The text is easy to understand - actual sample verses from the book are seen above - and the look and feel of the characters have all been \"re-booted\" for younger kids who may not have ever heard of the comic strip.\n\n*For more info about the comic strip Hoxwinder Hall, scroll down near the bottom of this section to read a review by The Washington Post's Michael Cavna.\n---\nFor Parents and Teachers:\nThis book has been reviewed by the reading & literacy specialists at Read-Ability, Inc. and leveled for Grade 1 readers.\n*But will be enjoyed by readers of ALL ages!\nAbout Read-Ability, Inc.: http://readwithmenow.com/\n---\nWhat will this final printed book look like?\n- A high-quality, hardcover, complete with durable thick \"child-friendly\" inner page stock. Physical dimensions: Approximately 9\" x 9\". \nFinal thoughts\nThis thing is gonna be fantastic - - but it can't exist without YOU! Printing a book is no easy feat and I don't want to compromise on the details, so I'm coming to Kick Starter to get the funds to pay for this.

As many people know, I love to tell stories. I have found that the most wonderful gift we have been given is the power of our imagination. I am grateful for the opportunities I have to share mine with you through kickstarter. This is my next book. An adventure tale of Tanner Jones and the crew of the \"Scrawny Duck\", a bunch of misfit pirate teddy bears who are on a quest to find the fabled \"Monkey Stone\".\n The project is simple. It's to build another book, the way I envision it. One full of incredible art, a good story and strong design. I feel that books are a work of art and should be full of life and magic. I personally love books that take you places and that let your mind run wild with emotion and wonder.\n With your help, we can make this book a reality. I can only do it with you. That is what makes kickstarter so fantastic. It creates opportunities for creators to make their dreams a reality and let you be a part of the experience as well. \n This is my 5th experience on the kickstarter platform. I understand the importance of updates, reward fulfillment and making sure you are part of the experience. I will update regularly, and as I update we will be able to watch this adventure of a young man and his pirate bears unfold.\nShipping and Rewards\n Since we hit the Goal - Lets Bring out the Stretch Goals.... and as many of you know I like to make them fun and exciting. \n And that's not all - Just take a look at what else is coming! It's going to be fun!\n If we reach that point and move beyond the next level will be figurines... looking into those right now.  See all the stretch goals below.\n** important note on stretch rewards. Some rewards are for all tiers, while other rewards are for specific tiers and above. This is due to the added shipping costs. The coloring book for example is for tier $45 and above if we meet the goal.\nIf we hit the goal and go beyond, there will be stretch goals. The goals will be fun and the rewards worth it. I am once again considering a coloring book that deals with just the bears, as well as puzzles and book upgrades.\n**the survey we will send out right before the books arrive. **\nThank you once again for your support and your willingness to be part of my adventures.

The negatives for these photos have recently been digitized, creating a treasure trove of material to choose from for this book.\nPlease see my bio for my background in photography as well as in the comics industry; my photos of comics folks have been widely used in books, magazines, and documentaries over the years.\nThe Contents\nThese are rare shots from the days before comics and conventions were big pop culture events, when the founding fathers of the artform were still among us and today's top talents were just aspiring young pros trying to get noticed. If you were there, this is a great way to recall fond memories. If you weren't, these photos are a candid and unfiltered picture of a simpler time, familiar but far away.\nYou will find, for instance:\nJoe Shuster\n* Rare shots of Golden and Silver Age greats like Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Will Eisner, Carl Barks, Bob Kane, Harvey Kurtzman, C.

You may know my work from movies like THE IRON GIANT (supervising animator), or DESPICABLE ME (story), the TV show CORNEIL & BERNIE (Nicktoons) which I created, or SMURFS THE LEGEND OF SMURFY HOLLOW, which I just directed for Sony Pictures Animation.\nI have been writing, drawing, and telling stories all my life, most of them in animation. With my new project called  SILVER, I have the opportunity to explore another great love of mine: COMICS!!!\nDARK PLANET COMICS & SILVER\nMy passion for comics is the reason why in 2013, I started DARK PLANET COMICS, an imprint which gives me the ability to put my stories out into the world autonomously, without having to answer to any corporate overlord.\nThe first story on Dark Planet is SILVER, a 12 issue miniseries. Silver #1 & #2 came out in 2013, and the response from readers, reviewers, and even from comic book artists who I immensely respect, has been tremendous, and humbling.\n\"Franck knows his customers, what they want, and he gives it to them in spades.\"\u2014 Ain't It Cool News\n\u201cWith SILVER, Stephan Franck shows how much excitement can be packed into a fast-moving, thrill-filled story...dynamic, unfussy, black and white art, all in the service of speed and momentum...a really, really fun ride.\u201d \u2014 Tim Sale (Batman: The Long Halloween; Batman Dark Victory; Superman For All Seasons)\n\u201cA beautifully drawn and masterfully told noir/heist story with a teasing side of the supernatural that constantly kept me surprised with it\u2019s reveals. I was particularly taken aback by the creative camera angles and use of shadows. I was kinda blown away, really.\u201d\u2014 Takeshi Miyazawa (Code Monkey Saves The World)\nA lot of the inspiration for SILVER comes from all the late night movies I watched every friday night as a kid. From Fritz Lang to Murnau; Basil Rathbone to Todd Browning; from The Thin Man to King Kong, Sherlock Holmes to Nick Carter;  Bogart to Cagney\u2026 All black and white adventures, ripe with horror, action, romance, and most importantly, tales of when the world was BIG and filled with MYSTERY.\nPLAY\n\nThe other side of my inspiration for SILVER are my comic book gods--mostly KIRBY and his insane mythologies, WILL EISNER, master of noir, and last but not least STERANKO.\nBut while SILVER revisits many of the elements that captured my imagination as a child, it is not any kind of postmodern homage. SILVER IS IT'S OWN THING. \nThe imagination of it came together very organically, as the imagery relates to the deeper themes of the story. VAMPIRES, and CON MEN, for instance, are approached as very similar creatures. They are both soulless and predatory in nature, dwelling on the parasitic margins of society. As the story begins, that is the state in which we find JAMES FINNIGAN, our main character. A figuratively soulless, noir anti-hero. But as Finnigan's world shifts, taking him for a stroll through the garden of the truly undead, and literally soulless, finding his way out will mean having to confront the purpose and ways by which he has been living his life.\nFilled with action, adventure, mystery and yes--character comedy (watch for the classic screwball comedy streak between the main leads), SILVER is first and foremost about relationships. Timeless human drama of the personal kind-- father and sons, siblings, lovers, and how everyone struggles with issues of love, guilt, morals, and the elusiveness of feeling alive.\nAnd now, I am very excited to announce that SILVER #3 has been completed, and that issue #1, #2, and #3 have been compiled into SILVER volume 1: 87 pages of kick-ass comic content, PLUS extra material, and super cool PIN-UP art by fantastic GUEST ARTISTS.\nAnd let me be clear about one thing: ALL THE WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED.\nSo... what is this Kickstarter about exactly, you ask\u2026\nIt\u2019s about ONE WORD:  PRINTING!\nWith this kickstarter, we will be able to do all of the following:\n1-The original runs of SILVER #1 & #2 have SOLD OUT. We will be REPRINTING them, with a larger run. Btw, NOTE THAT ISSUE #1 REPRINT NOW HAS A VARIANT COVER (plus new making-of pages in the back, with even more conversation and insights on the storytelling process).\n2-We will be printing SILVER #3, which is brand new, and also contain exclusive making-of info in the back.\n3-We will be printing SILVER Volume 1: a trade-paperback compiling issues 1,2,& 3, with original cover, and extra exclusive content.\nWIth all this, we will be all set up for the convention circuit this year (about 10 of them), including COMIC CON in SAN DIEGO and starting MARCH 28th with EMERALD CITY COMIC CON. Conventions are super important to us, as they are where we meet new fans, and where, so far, we\u2019ve done most of our business!\nAPE 2013\nCTNX 2013\nCTNX 2013\nLONG BEACH Nov 2013\nPrinting the trade will also open the door to COMIC BOOK STORE DISTRIBUTION, which, along with the conventions, are the heart and soul of this business.\nREWARDS\nBackers will receive signed copies of the individual comics and/or the trade paperback edition IN PRINT, and/or as DIGITAL DOWNLOAD.\nTHE INDIVIDUAL COMICS have EXCLUSIVE MAKING-OF PAGES, while VOLUME 1 (the trade), has EXCLUSIVE PIN_UP GUEST ART.\nCertain pledge packages also include downloadable versions of the written script pages, as well as the layout versions of the books. Those are a lot of fun as they show the evolution of the storytelling from one form to the next.\nSilver #1 layouts\nBeyond the book, we also structured rewards around our SILVER ART PRINT SERIES, which have been super successful at conventions, and become fan favorites.\nPLAY\n\nWe have 11X17 limited edition, signed, black & white large prints of the pages from the book. Those are really striking pieces of sequential art to have on your wall. The stark black and white and the zip-a-tone effect creates a cool combination of vintage and modern. Those are conversation starters for sure.\nOur limited edition, signed, COLOR art prints, inspired by images from the books, are available in LARGE (11X17) or  EXTRA-LARGE (13X19). Not gonna lie, those are super nice!\nPLEASE NOTE: we have A LOT of different designs for the art prints (b&w AND color), so when rewards time comes, we will communicate a full list of available prints so that backers can make their pick.\nLastly, for our most serious backers, we\u2019re putting SOMETHING SPECIAL on the table\u2026 MASTERCLASSES\nHaving worked on about 25 movies, having storyboarded a lot, directed (I am nominated for Best Personal Achievement In Directing in a TV Production for the 2014 Annie Awards), created a TV show that you may know, (and one you will know about soon), done tons of writing for studios, credited or un-, and tons of script consulting, having trained story artists at Disney, and hundreds of artists and writers throughout my career, I have conceptualized and organized my thoughts on visual storytelling in two 3-hour masterclass sessions.\nThe first session is focused on VISUAL STORYTELLING, AKA the skills to, not only communicate visual ideas clearly, but also the ability to give them emotional impact for the audience.\nThe second session is called STORY WITH A CAPITAL \u201cS\u201d, and focuses on the mechanics and esthetic of story in general, including concept, structure, character arcs, esthetic distance in story, imagination vs immediacy, etc\u2026 not to mention what sells, and what doesn\u2019t, and why.\nPlease, note that all those concepts have been more than field-tested over the years, as I have trained artists at major studios, gave guest lectures at colleges, and presented at festivals and conferences in various countries.\nAnnecy Festival, june 2013\nThe View conference, Turin, Italy, nov 2013\nSo for Los Angeles area backers, (or backers willing to make the schlep on their own volition), I am making those sessions available here in town in may. We will keep the group small, and organize as many as needed. For Non-LA residents, I also make one-on-one skype conversations available, where we will cover some of that same material.\nJust remember that, for legal reason, I cannot look at, or give you direct feedback on any of your own specific projects.\nA COUPLE MORE THINGS YOU MAY WONDER ABOUT:\nPLAY\n\nQ: In the age of digital distribution, are PRINT EDITIONS a point of VANITY, especially for independents?\nA: Actually, print editions, are vital, and here\u2019s why. Although we greatly enjoy our digital distribution, it is very hard to compete for viewership against the giant marketing megaphone of the majors. Plus, let\u2019s face it, with net neutrality on the ropes, it will not get any easier. So the only place where we have a real chance to meet new fans, is the convention circuits. Convention is where we did 90% of our business last year, and for that to work, we need physical books on the table.\nWhat\u2019s more, we have met many comic book store owners on the con circuit, who fell in love with SILVER, and said they would be eagerly waiting for the trade to sell in their store. I don\u2019t need to tell you that those stores are the heart and soul of the comics community. WE NOW NEED TO PUT PHYSICAL COPIES OF SILVER vol1 INTO THOSE STORES.\nQ: Why print more floppies (Issue, 1,2,3), if you are going to have the trade?\nA: We will continue with the floppies because, a) we are committed to the art form, and b) because that way, people don\u2019t have to wait too long between the trades, but MOST IMPORTANTLY, because it\u2019s a point of entry for new readers!\nIt\u2019s been really awesome at conventions, to see people come in on the first day, and buy issue #1, read it that night, come back on the second day for #2, read it that night, and often come back if there\u2019s a third day, buying copies for their friends. These times are tough for everybody, and new readers are solicited in every direction. It\u2019s very important that they get a chance to try something new at almost no financial risk.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere's the good news! NO RISK AT ALL!!! Why?

I\u2019ve been making music full-time with my husband, Dave, for nearly 11 years. During that time we\u2019ve written several songs for our two little girls, Lucy and Nora, some long before they were born. We\u2019re often amazed when listeners tell us how songs we originally wrote to calm our daughters also play in the headphones of soldiers fighting for our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan, in delivery rooms of expectant mothers, and in the bedrooms of children as they drift off to sleep. Listeners frequently say my songs help them find peace in the midst of difficult circumstances, and many asked us to make a collection of lullabies (or love-a-bies as my daughter Lucy calls them). This past fall we began making that record. It\u2019s called \u201cI Dream of You.\u201d\nLast year as we sat on an airplane, Dave turned to me and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make a CD for people to listen to before they go to bed, we might as well write a bedtime story to go along with it.\u201d Honestly, I thought he was a little crazy, but during that flight I wrote a short poem on a page of the in-flight magazine. We continued to refine it, and eventually hired a very talented illustrator and friend, Luke Flowers, to help us realize our vision for this project.\nAs the parents of two girls under six, Dave and I have spent a lot of time reading children\u2019s stories. We wanted to create a book that both parents and children would love reading again and again. It\u2019s been a long road, but after five months of effort, the book is ready to print. The illustrations are beautiful and so much fun to pore over. The lovable main character is charming and you'll love following her on her fantastic adventure again and again. Our hope was to craft a heartwarming story about dreams, friendship and love, but we were so pleased when it grew into so much more! \nHidden bunnies in every illustration!\nDave and I loved scouring the pages of the \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo\u201d books as kids as we searched for the main character. Our illustrator, Luke, did an amazing job hiding adorable little bunnies in the trees, clouds, and environments of every scene! We really think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun for young and old readers to search for them every time they open the book.\nWhile it\u2019s easy to circulate a PDF of the illustrations for the tech savvy, there\u2019s something really special about having a physical copy of a children\u2019s book for bedtime. We plan to print a 8 x 9.5 inch hard cover first edition of \u201cThe Golden Feather,\u201d and we\u2019d love to get it into the hands of as many readers as possible. Compensating Luke for his time, printing costs and promotion of the book will cost around $28,000. We\u2019ve set a goal to raise half that amount with your support. \nRewards on the column to the right include PDF and MP3 downloads of \"The Golden Feather\" and \"I Dream of You,\" handwritten postcards, autographed books and CDs, a leather-bound journal with handwritten lyrics, a small (not pictured) and large (see photo below) chalk painted (by me) wood plaques, and even a private concert!\nThis large wood plaque is one of the rewards I'll create for backers\nIf we're able to raise more than our target goals, we've come up with some exciting stretch goals to dream even bigger!\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $30,000 - \"I Dream Of You\" Music Video: If we reach this goal, we plan to film a super fun music video for the title track of my new lullaby record! The lyric \"I Dream Of You\" actually ties in to the last line in the book, so the video certainly reference some themes from \"The Golden Feather.\" I can't say much more, but the video will certainly include our little girls dressed in some very cute costumes :) All Kickstarter backers will be the first to see this video!\nWe're still mixing the record, but here's what the song sounds like at the moment :) \nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $60,000 - Live Performance Music Video: If we reach this goal, we'll hire a professional film crew to shoot several acoustic performances with our producer, Ben Shive, as we play acoustic songs from the new lullaby record. All Kickstarter backers will be the first to see this video content!\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $80,000 - Private Kickstarter Backer Concert: If we reach this goal, we'll hire at least three other musicians (we never play with a band, so this will be fun!) to play a private concert in Nashville, TN for everyone who backed this project. (You'll handle your own travel arrangements).\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - $100,000 - Private Kickstarter Backer Concert: If we reach this goal, we'll audio record and film the Private Kickstarter Backer Concert. I'll give all backers a copy of the recording! Video footage will be uploaded to YouTube.com and all backers will be the first to see it.\nWe\u2019ve never self-published a book, but we\u2019re excited to branch out on this new chapter (pun intended) with you! There\u2019s a good chance that \u201cThe Golden Feather\u201d will even make its way into bookstores in the future. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be happy if it makes its way into your home. Please join us in making the first printing a huge success!\nI\u2019m so thankful for listeners who\u2019ve supported my music, and other endeavors.

If you look closely at the queen of spades you will see \"queen\" not only written in several languages, but you will find a queen chess piece and even a Queen Elizabeth signature.\nI have been developing this deck for nearly 8 years.  I worked with several artists until about a year ago when I found Nike, an artist from Florida, who could finally bring what I have seen in my mind all these years to life.  For the last ten months we have worked closely together deciding what would go into each and every card.\nEvery dot, every swirl, every language, and every hidden item was placed where it was placed with thought and purpose.\n\nThe more you look at a card and the more you look for hidden elements, the more you will find - things like ambigrams and words sharing letters, like the \"T\" in one word making an \"X\" in another.\nThere are over 100 different languages and numeric systems represented in this deck, plus there is symbolism and imagery in each card as well (an ant on a queen, or a toy jack on a jack, or an 8 ball on an 8, and so on).  There are some really fun things in subjects ranging from science and math, to history and mythology.\nA Bit About Me\nI am a magician and the founder of www.TeachByMagic.com where we show educators how to use simple magic in the classroom to engage students and make learning more fun and more memorable.\n\nI have worked as a creative consultant for several companies and I love the creative process.  I even do workshops on creativity.\n\nI have been married for almost 12 years to my best friend in the world and although we have been trying for almost nine years, we have not yet had kids. \n\nSo with that extra time and money we have traveled the world.\n\nWe have been to Egypt, Italy, France, Denmark, England, Turkey, China, Brazil, Greece, Honduras, Scotland, Alaska, and Ireland. We have touched the pyramids, kissed the Blarney Stone, stood on the Great Wall, seen Stonehenge, and climbed Mayan ruins.\n\nI am fascinated with the mystique behind these landmarks and I have have been working on this Different Deck during it all - learning about cards and numbers in these different cultures. For example, while in China I noticed the elevators did not have 4th floors.  Sure enough, the number 4 is unlucky in Chinese so we never put Chinese characters on any of the 4s.  \nEnough About Me, Let's Talk About the Cards!\n\nThis project will create three decks of cards.  Two are Kickstarter exclusive Bicycle branded versions of the Different Deck (white and black) and they are both Kickstarter limited editions, only available to backers of this project Never to be reprinted.  I will not sell this version ever again or anywhere else but here, during THIS project.\nThe faces of the white cards will be exactly like the unlimited edition decks except they will be on white cards rather than the antique parchment style.  The back of the Bicycle Limited Edition Deck is a custom design done by the same artist, again chock-full of symbolism and hidden imagery.  (If you look closely you can see that the word \"bicycle\" is hidden in the deck several times - how many can you find?)\nThe faces of the black cards again are exactly like the unlimited edition decks except they will be charcoal colored rather than the antique parchment style.  The back is the same as the white Deck only black instead of red. \nThe unlimited edition of the Different Deck will have the classic old paper style to it and this is the deck I hope to get into a corner store.  This has always been a bucket list item for my life.  I have developed several products (and even have a patent on one!) that have been in magic shops and that has been fun to walk into a shop and see my product.  But I want to walk into a normal store and see something I made.  \n\nSo with your help, hopefully 2014 will be the year that dream comes true.  And I will keep you posted in the backer updates about my progress as I pitch the deck to all the different stores.  You will know when I make the trek to Bentonville to talk to the Wal-Mart buyers.  And the more backers this project has, the more likely I will have success on that journey.\n\nAlso, because this is the Different Deck there will be a few surprises along the way.

The size will be approximately 3\" x 8\".\n\nUncut Sheets are available and they are set up... well Differently. \n\nThe cards all are mixed, but not in a random order. They are laid out like a crossword puzzle with words spelled out in number form like H.O.P.E. (4673) or L.O.V.E. (5683) but with lots of hidden inspirational words, like \"dream\", \"believe\", \"imagine\"...you get the idea.\n\nOriginal inkings\nThere are also 50 original artwork spots. These are the actual hand drawings that were scanned in to make these cards. They are approximately 7\" by 10\" and are on torn edged Stonehenge paper \u2013 and they will look AMAZING framed.\nThese come unframed so you can do whatever you like with them - but here is what it might look like if you framed it with 4 cards.\n\nOne Lucky Backer will get the 4 original H.O.P.E. inkings framed in a leather stitched frame with double matting, an inner fillet around each card, and museum  quality glass.\n It is 24\" high and 55\" wide and it looks AMAZING.\n\nHere are all the rewards:\nIf you would like to add even more to your reward level - GREAT - just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount after selecting your reward level. \n\nHere are the items you can add.

Makes mobility easy and storage efficient. Where will the Adventure take you?\nThe story of The Adventure Box began about six months ago on a California-bound Amtrak train. With Settlers in tow, we realized that there should exist a better way to consolidate the game and its many pieces for easier transport. After sketching out a variety of ideas, the first prototype was crafted from an old beer box. Not only did this makeshift container do a much better job than the stock 'Settlers' box of efficiently storing the game, it made traveling with Settlers easy. The level of excitement that our crude first prototype generated compelled us to pursue this project further, eventually to the point of sharing it with the world.\nWith our mission in mind, we began incorporating methods of digital fabrication into our design process. After discovering the ideal dimensions of a box to contain the game's pieces, we began laser-cutting acrylic parts that could interlock to form the enclosure. Be it to save some space on the shelf, encourage gameplay away from the home, or just look great resting on the table in-between games, we wanted to design a solution for the wide variety of people who enjoy Settlers.\nThrough many iterations, we have created a product that is functional, simple, resilient, and attractive; much like the game we all cherish.\nThe Adventure Box is laser-cut from 3/16\" extruded acrylic and furniture-grade AA plywood (Woody Box). All materials are sourced from businesses local to our production facility.\nEach laser-cut piece has been meticulously detailed to fit precisely with the next. The sides slot together and key directly into the top and bottom. Within the box are laser-inscribed shapes, which hint at the specific (and necessary) arrangement of the game's pieces.\nThe joined side, top, and bottom pieces are reinforced by two 5/8\" wide natural rubber bands. These rubber bands offer a low-tech method of connection that bypasses the need for adhesives and hardware. Apart from acting as the securing mechanism, they provide leverage to keep the box intact during gameplay (lid off).\nThese methods of construction and assembly allow us to quickly produce a perfectly consistent product for all of our backers that is inexpensive to ship and easy to assemble.\nThe Woody Box juxtaposes furniture grade AA birch plywood and clear extruded acrylic. This bold composition provides a 'natural feel' to complement the hand-painted quality of the game's pieces. The Woody Box is our most economically priced container, but don't let the cost fool you... The Woody Box gets the job done with dignity and style.\nThe Frosty Box capitalizes on the use of an acrylic material for the lid and base that is uniformly textured to create a 'frosted' effect. This effect adds a degree of abstraction to the box and plays nicely off of the clear sides. With refined precision and functional clarity, The Frosty Box reminds us why \"less is more\".\nThe Rainbow Box makes a statement with color. The four sides (one green, one yellow, one red, and one blue) unite to form a vibrant and dynamic vessel. This bold box is sure to turn heads at every stop.\n The Coasty is a set of four laser-cut coasters inscribed with our less-assuming Adventure Box graphic. This product finally allows you and your friends to maximize game play while minimizing unsightly drink-rings. The Coasty comes in four different styles:\nWooden Coasty\nClear Acrylic Coasty\nFrosted Acrylic Coasty\nRainbow Acrylic Coasty\nEach set is composed of 4 individual coasters each sporting the same graphic. The Rainbow Coasty set contains one red, one yellow, one green and one blue coaster. \nCustom Inscriptions are available to 30 backers in total. Backers may add an inscription to any of our three box styles, in either size. Just add the dollar amount of your box to this reward. Please keep in mind, we are not offering custom inscriptions for any early bird reward dollar amounts. \nInscriptions are laser-etched upon one of the short sides of your Adventure Box. We are limiting the number of characters to 50; this includes spaces, and we have no problem with any symbols on your keyboard.\nAll Adventure Boxes come in both 3-4 player, and 5-6 player sizes. \nThe 3-4 player Adventure Box stores all of the game pieces in a standard 3-4 player set which includes:\n[ 67 internal cubic inches vs. original game boxes 306 internal cubic inches ]\n19 Hexagon Game Tiles\n18 Number Discs\n9 Extra Port Tiles\n1 Thief Piece\n2 Dice\n4 Bags of Colored Player Pieces\n4 Building Cost Cards, 1 Longest Road Card, 1 Largest Army Card\n6 Ocean Frame Pieces \nand all the applicable resource and development cards associated with a 3-4 player set\n The 5-6 player Adventure Box stores all of the game pieces in a standard 3-4 player set, plus the 5-6 player expansion set. This includes:\n[ 80 internal cubic inches vs. original game boxes 306 + 101 internal cubic inches ] \n30 Total Hexagon Game Tiles\n18 Number Discs & 28 Numbered Discs\n11 Extra Port Pieces\n1 Thief Piece\n2 Dice\n6 Bags of Colored Player Pieces\n6 Building Cost Cards, 1 Longest Road Card, 1 Largest Army Card\n6 Ocean Frame Pieces\n4 Ocean Expansion Tiles\nand all the applicable resources and development cards associated with the 3-4 player + 5-6 player game sets\nWe are thrilled to announce we have unlocked our first stretch goal - Adventure Box Expansion Sets! Check out the side bar for our 4 new rewards:\n3-4 player Seafarers Expansion Set\n5-6 player Seafarers Expansion Set\n3-4 player Cities & Knights Expansion Set\n5-6 player Cities & Knights Expansion Set\nEach box will be constructed with birch plywood top and bottom plates (just like the woody box). The lids will be adorned with the shapes unique to the particular expansion (see illustrations below) rather than the Adventure Box logo. The sides will be of 3/16\" extruded acrylic, and just like all the current Adventure Box models, all pieces will ship flat, key together seamlessly, and remain secure using our 5/8\" natural rubber bands.

These dice are sturdy enough for everyday gaming and attractive enough to collect.\nRhythm Metal Dice, Bags and Cups Collection\n Our plan is to sell them at a reasonable price through gaming stores. In order to do that we need to mass produce them -- allowing high quality at a lower price than if we made them a few at a time. The finished product will be solid metal, matte antiqued with corrosion effects. We chose to go with metal casting for our designs because casting allows us to add details and textures which you can't get through either 3-D printing or precision machining. As a result our dice have a character and elegance you can't find anywhere else.\nThe Dice Line Up\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n SOLID METAL POLYHEDRAL DICE ADD-ON\nSolid Metal Polyhedral Dice Steel\nAdd $8 to any pledge to get a Metals 20-Sided Die in Steel\nAdd $26 to any pledge to get Metals 7-Die Set (D4, D6, D8, D10, D1%, D12 and D20)\nYou can add-on color from the second color list (copper, gold, nickel and bronze)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRhythm metal dice are custom designed dice made with bronze/brass material.

Molten material can flow into very small sections so that intricate shapes can be made by this process. As a result, many other operations, such as machining, forging, and welding, can be minimized or eliminated.\n2. It is possible to cast practically any material that is ferrous or non-ferrous.\n3. As the metal can be placed exactly where it is required, large saving in weight can be achieved.\n4. The necessary tools required for casting molds are very complex and expensive.\n5. There are certain parts made from metals and alloys that can only be processed this way.\n6. Size and weight of the product is not a limitation for the casting process.\nStorey Dice\nNote:This beautifully crafted Storey Dice as you can see it has a pearl colored loose ball inside to make the dice roll faster which will be a red ball in final production.\nLimitations\n1. Dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the castings made by sand casting processes are a limitation to this technique. Many new casting processes have been developed which can take into consideration the aspects of dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Some of these processes are die casting process, investment casting process, vacuum-sealed molding process, and shell molding process.\n2. The metal casting process is a labor intensive process\nDragondie in Progress\nDragondie in Progress\nNote: As you can see the numbers on the Dragondie Dice prototype are a little bit hard to see so in mass production they will be on top of the dragon and larger so it's easier to read.\nThere are plenty of custom dice out there. Dice also are simply just fun little tactile toys. Metal dice are somewhat less common as well, and these designs just seem to really work well in metal. I believe these designs to be unique and appealing, fitting with games that have a mechanical theme. I'd love to have some of these dice in my collection, and I'd love to get them to other people who might be interested as well. So, I'm bringing these designs to Kickstarter to see if we can put together a sufficiently sized order to make these Rhythm Metal Dice happen at a good price point.\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019m very confident and dedicated to this project we have tested and re-tested all of the products and determined most of the problems are overcome.

When we make our goal we plan to print the first two chapters, which combined are 90 pages long, and completely done. In addition to the first two chapters, the Kickstarter book will include two brand new exclusive stories that will only appear in this book. These special stories will not be featured on the Bully\u2019s Bully site or anywhere else. With the two stories pulled from www.bullysbully.com, the two new exclusive stories, a bunch of behind the scenes material, as well as some impressive guest art, our final page count will be over 150 pages!\nHow it came to be:\nI first experienced bullying in elementary school. Then again in junior high. Oh, and for good measure, once more in high school. It wasn\u2019t fun for me, and I suspect it wasn\u2019t that much fun for my bullies either. But none of those encounters infuriated me as much as when my daughter spent two years of elementary school with two different bullies. Though both situations were eventually resolved as civilly as possible, the seeds for the Bully\u2019s Bully were firmly planted. As a parent, my first instinct was to approach the bullies myself. Fortunately I knew better. Instead, I decided to use a tool I hoped I could be far more effective with, than direct intervention. My pencil. I immediately contacted my buddy James Taylor, who\u2019s also an artist, and told him about the project. Without hesitation, he too was on board. It turns out that he had encountered his fair share of bullies in school, too.\nThe Story\nThe Bully\u2019s Bully is an ongoing \u201cwordless\u201d webcomic about a young girl who, from birth, has felt absolute empathy with bullying victims. Through this ability to experience the pain, agony, and desperation of the people (and animals), \u201cThe Bully\u2019s Bully\u201d (or B.B. for short) can find those who\u2019ve been singled out for cruelty. Sure, she could buckle under the empathic pain that might reduce many grown superheroes to tears, but our girl transforms all those negative feelings into action. She selflessly aids anyone\u2014kids and adults alike\u2014who have been targeted by bullies.\nWhile the primary focus is to tell fun and engaging stories, the Bully\u2019s Bully aims to inspire anyone entangled in bullying, even bullies themselves. Having experienced bullying, as well as seeing those we love fall victim, our hope is that through the adventures of B.B., those living under a daily cloud of fear, can use our comic as a way to draw attention to a situation they might have previously felt impossible to get free of.\nThe Book: What\u2019s the Breakdown?\nThe goal of the kickstarter is to gather the funds to print the comic from the web into a physical paperback book, along with extra content. With bonus stories, original concept art, and some guest art, the entire book will be 6.625\u201d x10.25\u201d and at least 150 pages, possibly much more if we make stretch goals which will allow the creation of some exciting all new content.\nThe $5500 we're asking for would go towards paying for the initial print run of the book, as well as shipping costs for rewards. About 10% of that goes toward Kickstarter and Amazon fees, too. Anything leftover will go toward miscellaneous costs like replacing lost or damaged books, and packing supplies.\nRewards\nWhile the star of the show here is the 150 plus page book, we're also offering a number of other cool rewards including bookmarks, original sketches, opportunities to do your own story, original art pages, book bundles for our comic book retailer friends, and exclusive prints like the ones below:\n WHY ARE THERE NO WORDS?\nStories have been told without words since the first human picked up a spent coal from a fire and began marking the cave wall. Sure, we\u2019ve come a few thousand years since then, and we have some amazing technology, but the basics keep coming back time and again. Think \u201cTom and Jerry,\u201d Disney\u2019s \u201cFanatasia,\" \u201cMr. Bean,\u201d \u201cOwly,\u201d  \"The Artist,\" or the great Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. These examples illustrate rivalries, humor, romance and much more, while using few if any words in presenting their themes.\nSpecific to Bully\u2019s Bully, we wanted to make a comic that was truly open to all. Neither language nor literacy would impede any reader from enjoying the adventures of B.B., nor would it hinder learning lessons of acceptance, empathy and compassion. To that end, we created a comic which transcends educational and language barriers in a medium that\u2019s truly accessible to almost everyone.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks for this project are very low.

Everything the Orbitkey is not! We started trialling with different materials and designs. The initial design involved the use of Chicago screws, but we quickly found these to be unreliable (and unappealing) as they would come loose over time. We then set out to create something of our own \u2014 a tool that could withstand the test of time! Our newest model has a built in mechanism that prevents the device from coming undone accidentally. It can also be adjusted to fit a different number of keys. We tested many different materials for the band and finally settled on TPU rubber and leather. We wanted a material that is flexible yet strong enough to perform the movement of the Orbitkey, but, more importantly we needed something that would prevent keys from scratching our belongings.\n Why we need you\nFor the past 12 months we\u2019ve been testing and refining the Orbitkey. All the manufacturers are lined up and ready to begin production. Your support will help fund the first production run and get the Orbitkey from our warehouse into your pocket!

They appeared on another website. \nIronically, Bruce had to \"fire\" his son for not making his schedule. It was a classic parenting moment for both of them. Bruce's son was actually relieved though he missed the paycheck.\nBruce then hired his son's art teacher to do the next incarnation of the comic strip, however this artist had a very goth/dark side to his illustrations, giving the second version of Bruce's comic strip an edge that most certainly didn't fit his aspirations for the strip.\nLuck brought Michael Voogd to Bruce's attention when the Goth Artist had to leave town - perhaps he was being pursued by demons - and together Michael and Bruce created what is now the successful and spot-on target Because I Said So comic strip.\nMore of this history, with images of the original comic strips, will be included in our book.\nAll of this will be packaged in the highest quality hard-cover book materials and high gloss, high quality paper.

We are going to make a great film, and we're so glad you're a part of it. -- Chuck & Aaron\n\nPlease check out The Art Story website at:  www.artstoryfilm.com\n******************************************************\nWhat is Art Story?\n... the start of a very special, unique animated film.  Aaron and I saw all the exciting things happening online through crowd funding and thought, we've got a great film that SHOULD BE MADE and we could use some help -- so dang it, let's try Kickstarter\nSo, what's the story?  \nIt's a story about an 11-year-old, meticulous boy, WALT, and his crazy, loopy GRANDPA -- two complete opposites -- who get stuck in a vast, imaginative WORLD OF PAINTINGS.  Inside, they cross paths with a ruthless painted character determined to make it into our world.  In order to get home and stop the villain, Walt and Grandpa have to set aside their differences, work together and navigate worlds where the rules can change around every corner.  \nWalt being pulled into a painting! (concept painting)\nIt's structured like a hilarious, character-driven, buddy picture (\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles,\" \"I Love You, Man\" etc.), but takes place INSIDE THE WORLD OF SOME OF THE GREAT MASTER PAINTINGS OF ALL TIME ... where the characters change their appearance to match the style of each painting -- and meet lots of wildly entertaining characters.  It also explores and was inspired by that special relationship between a grandchild and their grandparent -- not something you see often in films nowadays.\nWalt and Grandpa photo bomb \"American Gothic.\" (Concept painting only)\nYeaahhh... paintings? Sounds sort of \"high brow\"\nOH CONTRAIRE mon frere!  Our number-one focus is to make an entertaining, compelling story with characters you love and who propel you through the film.  This one is for the whole family -- funny, emotional, and thrilling.  AND, believe me, we'll stay away from the low hanging fruit of crass gastronomical jokes and sexual innuendo (not our style).  \nAnd, BONUS, YES!! the film is set in some of the greatest master paintings of all time!  We believe this is an AMAZING WORLD to explore in a story, AND ALSO what a fantastic way to expose young kids (and some adults) to some of the most famous works of art of all time!!!  There's a reason these paintings and painters are so celebrated -- they're imaginative, engaging, spiritual, and, well, just astounding images and worlds.  \nLook, Aaron and I both have kids AND we love art of all sorts.  But how do we get our kids interested in this type of art?  \"It's boring dad.\"  We believe if you FIRST, TELL A GREAT, FUNNY, COMPELLING STORY; and second, set it in this world -- kids will be head over heels for it all.   We've all seen the success of fish, toys, bugs, dragons and monsters -- well, how about art?  The worlds of paintings are endless -- and the technology is available now to take us all into them and explore them in this unique way.  \nWalt chatting with Christina in Andrew Wyeth's \"Christina's World\" (concept painting only)\nWho are you guys? \nAaron and I are two passionate, experienced animation filmmakers who created this project and want to see it made.  We're both Disney feature animation film veterans, working at Disney for 21 years each on many of the recent classics -- Lion King, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas. We also produced and co-directed the Academy Award nominated Brother Bear.  (See more the in the biography section.)  \nGrandpa and Walt sneak by Degas's strict dance instructor (concept painting)\nAbove all, Aaron and I want to make films that stick with you.  Stories that are wildly entertaining, but also enrich the lives of their audiences -- films that have something to say.  We've helped create these kind of films in the past and are ready to do it again. \nWhat will you do with the money?\nWe'll use the money to create a script, a children's book ready for publication, killer artwork and a video presentation of the whole film.  It takes teams of people working 5 or 6 months to ready a film like this for production.  Along with a A LOT OF BACKERS  (really critical to show there's an audience for a film like this) and these items, we think we'll have a slam-dunk to get the film fully funded.  \nWill this film get made? \nNot without YOU.  Seriously, you, the person reading this right now.  This is a grassroots approach to making a film.  Help us send a message. YOU pledging now means there's another person who wants to see this film.  The money we raise here will get us started and is only a fraction of what the whole effort will take.  Any studio, any company or individual who wants to fund it will want to know there's an audience for this kind of film.  You backing us now, with whatever you can give, means there is someone else who wants to see it.  We need lots of backers.  It takes many raindrops to fill up a bucket.  \nWalt with Grandpa freaking out in a Picasso-esque cubist world.\nWhy not wait and just see the movie when it comes out?\nYes, we want you to see the movie when it comes out, take the whole famly.  But it may not come out at all without your help.  The studios are interested in BIG sequels, films from books or fairy tales that already have a following.   It's very hard to get an original film made unless you're already in a studio OR there's a proven, existing audience.  \nWe're 1000% confident this will be a sure-fire hit -- but we need YOU to support it and to show that it can have a big following!  With lots of backers and the entire package we'll create with the money, we're sure we'll have the momentum we'll need to get the film made.  \nOK, looks fun... how can I help?\nTo become one of our backers, just click on the big green button to the right of our video.  Kickstarter will ask you for your pledge, which reward you want, and how you want to sign up.  Signing up is easy -- you can even do it on Facebook.   And PLEASE pass on the info to your friends -- the more backers, the more we can show the studios films like this can have a following.\nBehind the scenes look at our process:\nArt Fans of the World Unite!\nIf you're an art teacher, work at a museum or are just a big fan of paintings or the arts -- this project is for you.  We'll treat this world right -- with respect -- honoring and celebrating these paintings.  An animated film is a great way to excite the next generation of artists, museum-goers and fans of the arts.  We hope you see the potential in the story and will become a backer.  \nWant More?\nConnect with us at:                              https://www.facebook.com/ArtStoryFilm & https://twitter.com/artstoryfilm\nCheck out Aaron's awesome range of paintings and work at: http://aaronblaiseart.blogspot.com & http://creatureartteacher.com\nMore Visual Development Artwork (Concept Art)\n\nWalt and Grandpa argue in Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" (concept art)\nWalt and Grandpa corned in an Escher!

The $350k will give us a great start, but animation is expensive -- in the 10s of millions, especially considering all the location and character design changes in this film. \n\nBut we know there's nothing out there quite like it and we think this can be a VERY SPECIAL FILM: a moving, entertaining story set in a world that will fascinate and one which you'll want to expose your kids to. \n\nTHE FINE PRINT (Stuff we gotta say)\n\u2022 Please understand, we are a creative team -- directors, writers, artists, producers -- we are not a production facility. At the appropriate time in the future we will look for 3rd party production partnership to complete the film. At this stage it's too early to pick a partner. However, this a technically challenging, reel-worthy project. We're 100% confident that when fully funded, we can find a great production facility to make this film -- there are a handful of really top-quality houses ready for animation.\n\n\u2022 If we can't get the funding for the film, we won't be able to fulfill some of the items. The pitch book, T-shirts, blog site, digital artwork and apprenticeship will all be funded by this campaign and we'll get them to you asap. We'll also create a CHILDREN'S BOOK ready for publication, but we can't guarantee you or your painting can be in the film or that we'll have a private screening if we can't get the film made. This is the same for the DVD. We're confident, but we've got a lot of big wig studio execs to convince -- THAT'S WHY YOUR BACKING IS SO IMPORTANT. \n\n\u2022 The APPRENTICESHIP is an unpaid position and is NOT a guarantee of employment on the film. We'll make it a worthwhile, rich experience -- you'll be right at the core of the film. Great for a resume and a unique peak into the pre-production process. \n\n\u2022 You must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to tour the studio or be a voice in the film. \n\n\u2022 The usage of a character likeness or a voice in the film will be ultimately determined by the filmmakers. You will be in the final cut, but we'll have to figure out where and how. We know we're asking for a lot of money for it, so we want you to have a good meaningful appearance, but we can't determine it until the storyboarding and editing begin in earnest. \n\n\u2022This fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable Kickstarter rules and regulations, movie guild rules and applicable laws. If any of this conflicts, we will work with you in good faith to give you a substitute reward.\n\nTo wrap it up -- filmmaking on this scale is a long and winding journey and we're not sure where all the bumps in the road may come. We know how important your contribution will be to this project and will do EVERYTHING POSSIBLE to: 1) make a great film you can enjoy for years, and 2) get you your rewards. Anything you can give, any recommendation you can pass on to your friends and family is very important to us.

I looked over at a bag of marshmallows on the kitchen table, my camera, and the dollhouse furniture my niece has in abundance... and the Marshmallow Microcosm was born.\nThe first was created when I saw the marshmallows and a small fake campfire my sister in law had made.

It was great that people were getting such a kick out of these little guys.\nKickin Confection \u00a92012-2013 Heather Applegate\nSo this year I find myself creating more and more scenes - I have over 40 now!

I'm Cynthia Petrovic, animation artist and illustrator and creator of RedTango. Started in 1999, the idea was to produce excellent quality, original products for everyone to enjoy. Fun, cute and affordable clothing, accessories, greeting cards and buttons with a distinctly retro feel. The flagship cat logo is an iconic symbol, representing the classy feminine retro look...and sometimes a favorite pet! With inspiration from mid 20th century color sensibility and animation art, the style is bold, fun and a real stand out. It caught on immediately, prompting licensing deals for watches, clocks, bath towels, purses, totes and accessory bags and pillboxes. The cat had arrived!\nThe Big Journey Started Small!\nOriginally I started selling at local Los Angeles swap meets and small shops..what I myself could afford to make....t shirts, greeting cards, buttons, etc. Then I met up with San Francisco based TokyoBay and with their help began to produce purses, totes, watches and other accessories to compliment the shirts. My fan base grew quickly as RedTango products were made available online, at the San Diego ComicCon and stores all over the world. It was TokyoBay's distribution power and additions to my product line that really got things out there.\nHuge crowds at the con!\nWhen the recession hit, we had to downsize and no longer could offer new purses and watches, and the licensing deal with TokyoBay concluded. This also meant the cash flow dropped. Existing product stock is selling out now and fans continue to ask for new merchandise. The big question for some time has been-do I continue on with the business and new shirt designs? Do I wait until someone steps in? What do I do about all the customers who want new stuff to wear? Can I afford to keep doing this?\n\nI get some very touching letters from people, one of which really inspired me forward:\n     \"In 2006 my Mom was dying of cancer. We were in a wig shop in Sacramento playing with the wigs. It was a really fun time, in spite of the circumstances. Your red baguette purse was in the shop. My Mom loved it and bought it for me. It was just worn out, but I couldn't bear to part with more more piece of my Mom, so I looked you up and found you! Yippee! I am thrilled the baguette purse is still available, even though only the black is. I will love it just as much and it will still be like having my Mom with me. Thank you, so, so much. you are part of a very sweet memory for me. xoxo, Heidi Hopkins\"\nCommunication with my customers is very important..and can be very touching.\nA New Era Begins\nI've decided the future of RedTango is now! I am reaching out to all the cool cats who have loved RedTango merch over the years, and who have followed along with RedTango and her pals as the website has grown. All my printing resources are in place to \"go back to my roots\" and start creating shirts again, with some of the top graphic artists in the Southern California area that have helped keep the cat looking sweet and hot all these years!\n\n\n\nI may just be handling shirts for now but who knows what buzz will happen! There's still so much to discover and do. So let's do it!\nThese guys have been silkscreening, printing and coloring every RedTango shirt since 1999! Aren't they adorable?!\nLend us a paw so we can get those shirts going again!\nProduction can start immediately..new ideas have been brewing for a while. A little goes a long way, and any size donation is greatly appreciated. I use only the finest cotton t's, sweatshop free, made in the USA, soft, stretchy and form flattering. I am also one of the few companies in the US to offer nicely cut plus sizes as well. As mentioned I personally oversee all the t shirt production/quality control and pick it up myself factory fresh! I also pack up every single order and toss in free goodies with each one. Woo!\nI think I need two of me. :D\nI Do Care....Always\nAbout company values: Customer service is absolutely priority number one. This includes timely delivery and communication. I am committed to producing fairly priced merchandise so everyone has the opportunity to look great. Recycled materials are used whenever possible to keep costs down. I also donate to local animal shelters and cancer charities thru out the year.\nA few years back RedTango was chosen as \"mascot\" for a cancer run in San Diego!\n\nCome Be a Part of the Kat!\n\nIf you love RedTango and would love to see a new line of shirts created this year you are welcome to help me out..I've got a fabulous array of goodies for everyone who donates. I am very encouraged by the positive feedback that keeps moving me forward and to keep creating, which I am very much ready and eager to do. The shirts, cards and buttons originally did come first, now it's time to get back to my roots again. Swap meets? Live events? Here I come!!\n\n\n\n\nShirt production can start immediately, since everything has been in place for over 10 years there is no risk except figuring out which new shirt you'll want to buy! They will be made available online, at tangoland.com/giftshop, reasonably priced anywhere from $19 to $24.\n\n Most important!

RedTango Kickstarter Project!"}}, {"backer": "Mike Kunkel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Flip-a-Quest Adventure Modules are the first interactive, fictional role-playing games that combine \"chooseable path\" adventures and the ability to battle minions and customize your own unique character. Take your character and all the rewards and items you've gained from one module, into the next adventure! There are several possible outcomes and story lines in each module, so you can play over and over again to gain different items and experience varied game play.\nOur $2000 goal will help us with printing and distribution costs, giving us the start we need to make this venture take off. With your help, word of mouth, and good ol' pounding the pavement, we will make \"playing a story\" a new socially rewarding experience. \nFlip-a-Quest is all about luck and fun. Use collectible Flip Disks to decide your journey or use whichever coin you like to decide your fate. Adventure time can range from ten to thirty minutes based on the luck of your flips. Just follow the easy instructions on each page, and you'll know what to do. Each encounter is numbered, so you can flip to wherever you need to go by glancing at the top of each page. Oh, and one more thing: You get to keep your character after the adventure's done! Build your character up over time and become stronger while collecting unique items that may be used for bonuses in later modules.\nTake a look at this excerpt from The Crimstone Creep Educational Edition:\nENCOUNTER 10: GREAT TONIC!\nThe man takes you to a shop across the way. Once inside, he goes to a cabinet and pulls out a vial of shiny green liquid. \"Here, drink this. It will make you feel...um...great!\" the strange man says as he points to the word Great in the sign above the cabinet. You notice the sign reads, Great Tonics for Troublemakers. The allusion that he might be referring to you as a troublemaker makes you very nervous. However, he may be giving you something that will help you defeat the troublesome, Crimstone Creep.\nFlip a Flip Disk or coin.\nIf it lands on \u201cheads,\u201d you drink the shiny green liquid.\nTurn to encounter 16.\nIf it lands on \u201ctails,\u201d you tell the guy, \"You're crazy! I'm not drinking nuthin!\"\nTurn to encounter 4.\nNotice that the word allusion is in bold print above. This means that this word is a frequently misused/misspelled word. Looking at the context clues of the sentence, a player can decide what the word means. Elsewhere in the book the word illusion is used, and the context clues help the reader make an educated guess at to its meaning. When an adventurer reaches the end of the story, a short quiz is presented with multiple-choice answers to test the players knowledge of the vocabulary words and their meanings. If a player achieves a good score on the quiz, he/she will receive a special item for their character!\nEducational Editions will be made available for all Flip-a-Quest modules, but if you prefer to just play the adventure without building a broader vocabulary, you can CHOOSE to play the regular adventures instead! Either way, the random adventures generated by flipping a Flip Disk or coin make for dozens of possible outcomes and several different options for specialized gear and battles.\nTake a look at this battle from The Sickly Cyclops:\nENCOUNTER 14: THE RING OF TRAPS!\nOooooooooh, it's a magic ring surrounded by scary looking traps! Treat this event like a battle. \nFlip Battle: You begin with 20 Life Points. The Ring of Traps has 25 Life Points. Each hit removes 5 Life Points. If you have any enhancements, adjust your stats accordingly.When either of the fighters reaches 0, the fight is over.\nFlip a Flip Disk or coin.\nIf it lands on \u201cheads,\u201d you disable the traps for 5 damage!\nIf it lands on \"tails,\" the traps grab you for 5 damage!\nIf you disarm the traps, you receive a magic ring which gives you +5 Life Points! Draw this item in your Bag O\u2019 Stuff at the back of the book. Turn to encounter 15.\nIf you fail, turn to encounter 10.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo, when you encounter a battle, whether it be against a monster or a trap, like this one, the player deals damage when the Flip Disk lands on heads, and takes damage when the Flip Disk lands on tails. The more customizations and magical enhancements you've gained in your adventuring, the better your chances are of defeating your opponent!\nEven after you've played an  Adventure Module multiple times to experience different paths and quests, the game keeps on giving with the collectible Flip Battle Disks! (Flip Disks are also Flip Battle Disks for out of game play.)\nThink of Flip Battles with your friends as the new \"marbles\" for players and collectors of all ages. Flip, deal damage, and swipe your friend's Flip Battle Disk!\nHere's how to play:\n1.Players face each other and flip their Battle Disks!\n2.If they both land on matching sides, players reflip!\n3.If they land on opposite sides, the player who lands on Damage Points deals damage to the opposing players Life Points! (Different Flip Battle Disks have differing amounts of Life Points and Damage Points!)\n4.A player wins by getting the opponent\u2019s Life Points down to zero and is awarded the opponent\u2019s Battle Disk as a prize!\nWith the ability to take game-play outside of the adventure and battle with your friends \"in-person,\" we hope to regain a sense of Real Life group play, something that has taken a back seat to the isolated atmosphere often found in hand-held digital gaming.  \nThe Lethcoe brothers, Jason and Jeff, grew up in the '70s and '80s reading the Choose Your Own Adventure book series. Jeff was a reluctant reader, so these books provided endless hours of fun while developing a love for reading. Today, Jeff is an English teacher, and Jason is a storyboard artist.\nAlso, the '70s and '80s brought the first role-playing adventure games, like Dungeons and Dragons. This ground-breaking type of gaming has ushered in modern-day MMORPGs like Everquest and World of Warcraft, which people of all ages play around the world. \nNow, well into the Digital Age, a growing sense to return to the simplicity of pencil and paper games, which can be enjoyed in about a 20 minute time span, has been nagging at the brothers. Preserving the best of both interactive, \"chooseable path\" fiction, and the basics of role-playing adventuring, Jason and Jeff have combined their talents and love of gaming to come up with Flip-a-Quest Adventure Modules!\nWe hope you will believe in our project and help us fund this exciting throw-back (but with a modern twist) \"chooseable path\" adventure game. We want to get these books out into the stores as well as in the classrooms, helping kids and fans of all ages to enjoy the benefits of game and story (and all without batteries.) \nTHANK YOU!\n-The Lethcoe Brothers\nReal Games for Real People.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter our project is fully funded, it's off to find a new printing company! The first three Adventure Modules have been written, save the additions to Grunmyr! that we will add from potential backer package selections. Currently, the prices we have been paying for the initial copies that we have made, have proven cost prohibitive. We like to do things with care and quality, so we never skimp on the color or adventure play. This adds up quickly at the printer, so we are looking to purchase copies in bulk, which will lower the cost overall, allowing us to offer a better price to those who choose to adventure through the series. \n\nIf all goes well, we plan to release four or more Adventure Modules per year. We are aggressive and passionate story-crafters, and as you can see by our fulfillment dates, we plan to fulfill all Kickstarter rewards in the next four months (hopefully just in time for holiday stocking stuffers!)

You might know me from my art on such comic book titles as Wonder Woman, The Sandman, The Invisibles, Finals or Beasts of Burden, to name a few.\nOr you might know me from my wrestling gear and t shirt designs for WWE Superstars and Champions Daniel Bryan and CM Punk. But hopefully you know me from my own creation, The Scary Godmother!!\nWHAT ARE WE HERE FOR?\nThis Kickstarter is to fund the production of a Scary Godmother Fashion Doll. Kind of like Barbie but much, much cooler. ;-) She's bigger, better, redder, curlier, pointier, magicky-er and more meow than your usual dolls.\nSO GIVE ME THE OVERVIEW OF THIS SCARY GODMOTHER, WHERE DID SHE COME FROM?\nI created Scary Godmother as a gift for my first niece when she was born. I wanted to make a book for the baby and I also wanted to be her godmother. But, I thought about me in my black motorcycle jacket, pointy toed shoes and wild, red curls standing in the back of a church and mused out loud \"HA! I'd be a pretty scary Godmother!\" And it was one of those 'light goes on' moments...I immediately had a picture in my head of a goth, witchy type of fairy, flitting about doing Halloween things for people...I had to draw her right away! Once I drew her, stories and a supporting cast of characters started popping into my head! It was a runaway train of images I had to put down on paper! I teamed up with Sirius Entertainment to produce series of graphic novels and comics that were first published in the late 1990's. All of the Scary Godmother Stories are currently being published for your enjoyment by Dark Horse Comics. If you're not familiar with all of her adventures, you might want to check them out by visiting your local comic book shop or the Dark Horse Comics website,  as well as other places online like Amazon.\nBACK TO YOUR SG HISTORY...\nSoon after being published, Scary Godmother was Optioned for Animation by Mainframe Entertainment. I also worked with Chicago children's theater company, Runamuck Productions to adapt Scary Godmother to the stage. We had a wildly successful run of 26 performances at the Athenaeum Theater. We adapted the play to television for Mainframe and you can see the result of that on TV each Halloween on Cartoon Network. I worked on every step of each production and they were each an incredibly rewarding creative experience!\nI've been fortunate to take my creation from books and comics all the way to the Stage and Screen! Now I want to be able to take her to that next step, the place people have been asking me about ever since I wrote the first Scary Godmother Story. I want to create Scary Godmother Stuff! I have a notebook filled with pages and pages of Scary Godmother product ideas and I finally have a way to bring them directly to you..... starting with The Scary Godmother Fashion Doll!\nSO, SHOW ME THE DOLL!\nI've been working for two years with sculptors and doll clothing designers who have been working from my sketches to create a Scary Godmother Prototype doll that I adore! \n I've gathered quotes from factories to find out the costs involved to get her into the real world where people can love her as much as I do!\nShe will be articulated at her head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, ribcage, waist, hips, knees and ankles. Final articulation will be the hidden, unobtrusive articulation found in finer fashion dolls. The joints in our prototype are necessary for the factory to determine where she will be jointed. \nShe stacks up much taller and curvier than your other fashion dolls that are out there. Have a sandwich, other dolls!\nHer hands are elegant, don't you think?\nShe will have removable wings so you can easily change her clothes.\nShe will come with her basic costume and we plan on producing several outfits for her in the future! Her tights are real tights and not just painted on her legs, because that would be cheating!\nShe has fun shoes!\nShe is accessorized with a pumpkin purse \nand her ghost cat, The Boozle!\nThe Boozle is made of smokey, translucent plastic and can stand on his curly ghost feet or be suspended by the hook in his back! So you can make him fly, just like in the books and stuff! \nHere's the prototype box after I painted it and was in the process of scoring it for folding. And here's Scary Godmother Prototype all finished. I left her hat off of her in the photo so you can see her hair and face in an unobstructed view.\nAll we need to do now is get her into production. That's where the crowd funding part comes in.\nBUT JILL, YOU SAID SHE WAS ON TV, DOESN'T THAT MEAN YOU ARE SUPER RICH?\nAh, Grasshopper, you have much to learn about Optioning. First of all--- Sometimes the deal you strike does make you rich, and sometimes the deal you make means you have awesome creative control and will get to work on all the parts of the show to make it exactly the way you want it to be. Sometimes, both of those things happen, which would have been amazing...but it didn't.  All of the time it means that your Ancillary Rights (that means merchandise, like dolls, for instance) are controlled by the company who Options your 'thing'. This is necessary because it helps them to sell it to networks and stuff. So, for a long time my rights were tied up with the animation company and for some reason no products were made. That's all right, that's what happened then. This is now! We made two awesome animated specials that I totally love! And I think you do too, if you are reading this! \nThe GREAT part of this whole story is that I have ALL my rights back for EVERYTHING Scary Godmother! Which means I can go full steam ahead and create any type of thing my Scary heart desires...dolls, books, plush toys, playhouses, Halloween costumes, dishes, comics, movies, TV and more!  We just need to Kickstart this whole deal to get the ball rolling! I believe there is a receptive audience for Scary Godmother Stuff! I think this can become a cool, big, wonderful thing!!! I think this is an incredible way to get the products you want right into your hands. It's you, me and the factory that will make them! No giant corporation telling me how my character is supposed to look, or how big she should be, or what outfit she should wear or any of that stuff. She will be exactly the way she's supposed to look! Now we have the ability to take control of things ourselves!\nAll we need to do is get enough people on board to make the minimum amount of dolls the factory requires to go into production on this project!\nWHAT DO I GET?\nThat depends on what Incentive you choose...if you are here for the doll and only the doll, Scary Godmother comes fully dressed in her signature hat, tutu,tights and shoes. She comes with a swell Jack O' Lantern purse and her ghost cat, The Boozle. There are many other incentives that get you other original goodies and treats AND the Doll as well! That's pretty excellent!\nEVERYONE who contributes gets a public THANK YOU, MY ART PATRONS, MY MONSTER MINIONS, MY FRIGHT SIDE FRIENDS...on my new website! I will owe you all a hug. The good kind, with both arms and giggling! You will be updated (or inundated, depending on your point of view) with progress reports, photos and video of our doll making journey. You are also first on the list to be informed of any Scary Godmother products that are coming out in the future, so you can get first dibs. ( I'll have all of your email addresses, you know!) You got shotgun on the Scary Godmother Road Trip!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nI know it seems like a lot of money to create this doll. It threw me for a loop, too! But, it breaks down pretty quickly and adds up just as fast. Here is an overview.\n-TOOLING THE STEEL MOLD (this costs nearly 40 thousand dollars alone, but it is a one time cost for this body) This is what is necessary to create the actual parts of the doll.\n-CASTING THE PARTS \n-ASSEMBLY and PAINTING\n-HAIR SOURCING, ROOTING AND CURLING\n-SOURCING OR CREATING CUSTOM TEXTILES TO MAKE HER HAT, TIGHTS, TUTU AND BODYSUIT.\n-SEWING THE CLOTHES\n-MAKING THE BOX\n- packaging each fancy box in an INDIVIDUAL SHIPPING BOXES  so each doll is ready to ship after it is a finished product.\n-SHIPPING FROM THE FACTORY TO THE UNITED STATES  \n-STORAGE\n-SHIPPING TO YOU FROM THE SHIPPING FACILITY\nWE HAVE TO COVER THE KICKSTARTER AND AMAZON FEES and the production of INCENTIVES... \nIt's exciting and daunting at the same time, I know!\nWILL THERE BE THOSE STRETCH GOALS?\nI love your positive attitude! Let's just get this goal achieved and start adding things once we know we can do it.\nIf we get the right amount of money, then I would love to add more clothing to this campaign, so you would get more outfits for her. But, I haven't gotten estimates for multiple fashions. I'll check into it once we are successful and add on accordingly if we can.,. But, I think it's better to take things one step at a time. Let's work to make as many Scary Godmothers as we can!\nWHAT ABOUT ADD ONS?\nYou bet! Contact me through messaging to make arrangements for adding on other items to your pledge amount.\nWhew! That's a lot of information! I'm so nervous! I'm afraid that I forgot  to mention something! It's going to be an exciting, crazy, wonderful journey and I'm really pleased that you want to come along with me! I really want to get this thing started, let's make Kickstarter History!\nPSST! PASS IT ON!\nIf you find that this doll is not your cup of tea...Please pass along this link to someone you know that might like it. Maybe it's your funky Auntie who loves witchy and goth stuff...\nOr a comic book fan...\nOr your friend who has some kids...\nOr your friendly neighborhood doll collector!\nOr those people down the block who decorate their house really well every Halloween! Or maybe you're just a generous person who wants to get a doll to give to a Toy Drive at some point. That would be super cool of you!\nBecause the most important fact about this campaign is that IF WE DO NOT MAKE OUR GOAL,YOU DO NOT GET A DOLL And we can't let THAT happen!!! So let's get started!\nThanks to Brandon Hauer and Daniel Kibblesmith for filming and editing the video.\nThanks for this usable on the internet Music \nThe Creepin' Crawl- Sir Richard Wentworth\nThe Snow Queen- Kevin Macleod\nHugs for the great\nIntro -Bob Buckley\nhire Bob to make music for your show at www.bobbuckley.com\nThanks to Colt Cabana for giving me positive energy,encouragement and help along the way!\nThanks to Alison Achauer, Mark and Andrea Davis for their amazing Scary Godmother and Bug-A-Boo Halloween costumes and photos.

I will be traveling to the factory to oversee the product to ensure it is the exact version I want. We have to work to schedule the tooling and doll production into the factory's existing schedule,and we can only schedule when we can pay them... so until we have funding, I cannot give an accurate time frame of when the doll will be finished and ready to ship.\nI will keep everyone informed along the way.\nHere are some facts I know from the quotes we have gathered...The Tooling lead time is 6-7 weeks.\nProduction lead time is 9 weeks after the samples are approved. Master doll, clothing and paint samples must be provided by me to the factory.Then they make samples based on that doll. I have to be happy with everything for the whole shebang to move ahead. Then we make thousands of her! Yay!\n\nI realize that if this project is funded, fulfilling the Incentives will become my full time job in 2014 and 2015.

I am a working comic book artist and I have to finish the jobs I have on my desk before I can devote my full time schedule to the Rewards. This is my highest priority and I will not let you down.\nI'm working with an experienced toy maker (he is the creator of Presidential Monsters) to guide me through all of the steps in this process. I'm learning as I go, but I'm determined to get this done the way I want it. Just like I've done with all the other Scary Godmother Stuff.\n All of my Incentives are a labor of love and unique creations. Most of them I am personally making for you. Each one is a work of Heart and I will not stop til I finish them all. But occasionally, I might need a day off to recharge the creative machine and rest my hand...\nAnything I will be able to get help doing I will, like shipping prints and books and dvds.\nI plan on working with a shipping service to get the Doll to you, because if all goes according to plan, it will be a ton of dolls!\nIf you'd like to volunteer to help with some of the other envelope stuffing, message me!

Pretty damn difficult it seems.", "update_content": "We've been having some issues with the die cut box. When I updated you all in March, The Factory was telling me they would be sending a sample of our box by mid April. Then we started getting emails from them asking for us to explain our art files, and that there was missing material on our files. Now, I am not versed in any computer programs, much less print ready,multi-layered files that are necessary to print and die cut a box. The designer I have been lucky enough to work with is a package designer for other toy companies and his work is always print ready. It was unclear what they needed from us and why and the designer had to have multiple,confusing exchanges with them to determine why they could not understand his industry ready files. He found it fairly exasperating. And, I found it terrifying and confounding. Then they wanted me to green light the actual creation of the box even though they were saying they needed us to change our art and the art files. Please see a small sample of our communication with them trying to understand and find a solution for problems we didn't understand. We asked for white die cut samples with the doll placed inside and discovered that the box design had been slightly altered. Again, we found out that these were quickly hand cut samples and not boxes following our design as sent. After much back and forth, we suggested that if they were having this many problems creating the box they had told us they could create, that perhaps they had better find a different source for the creation of the box. And soon after, we were given confirmation that they would create the box from our files as we request. They are also sending us a sample. It was shipped yesterday. I hesitate to update because everything that seems simple, becomes a hurdle. Fingers crossed that the sample box arrives in PPERFECT conditio so we can be done with all of this and get to the Importing of our Doll! Again, Thanks for your patience.

The body parts should be done at the end of March. (Says the factory) I do not have the actual timeline with the information about how long from doll assembly, to painting to dressing, to rooting the hair and styling it will take. Each component is subcontracted out by the main factory. The clothing is made at a separate factory from the one that tools the body, as is the hair, the painting of the doll, and the box. Here are the photos of the 'signed off parts\", (yes, the term signing off on a project actually comes from signing on the final version of a thing) the final wrist and arm, the most recent suggestions on how we fit everything in the box and attach it so it stays put but still looks pretty'. NEXT STEPS? We get the unprinted die cut box with sample doll body, accessories, clothes attached to the box insert for inspection--hopefully next week. Then the Drop test will happen.

It was tough not to spill the beans along the way, but I've always had a grand vision for Bastion's 7 and wanted it to grow and breathe and develop organically with the help of my teammates over the past few years. Now I'm proud to say, the day has come to finally reveal the world of Bastion's 7!\nB7 is a very special project for me because it's a reflection of some of my personal life experiences as well as a mash-up of cartoons and comics I devoured as a kid: Bionic Six, Gatchaman, and Star Wars, for example. It also incorporates my daydreams  about being a Kung Fu Master when I grew up. I'm thrilled to say B7 is finally here, and I am very excited to share it with you.\nWhat's the story?!\nBastion\u2019s 7 is a sci-fi/fantasy/superhero epic that takes place on Earth - however, not the Earth you know. It is a parallel Earth, one that has been ripped apart by a strange force and is crumbling away into space bit by bit. The laws of gravity are defied during this event and have caused large land masses to float into the sky. Destruction is everywhere and for many, hope seems lost...\nOne man, Dr. Thaddeus Bastion, has vowed to do everything in his scientific power to restore order to the chaos and pull the Earth back together again using Tong-e, his curious chemical concoction that he invented and could be the answer to the world\u2019s woes. Standing in his way are genetically enhanced monstrosities created by his evil nemesis Moquay, a mysterious and menacing villain who is capitalizing on the weakened state of humanity.\nWith so much worry and danger awaiting you at every turn in this world...  you can\u2019t even enjoy a plate of dumplings in peace! For Dr. Bastion, that was the last straw! \nTo maintain order, protect the weak, battle the bad guys and help rebuild society (not to mention defend the dumplings!), Bastion creates the organization known as Bastion's 7! They are the superheroes of this world, the marshals of this wild west, the army in this war against evil...\nIn the midst of the mayhem is Kai.\nA boy who wants to be a hero himself, in search of a family, in search of his destiny... in search of the right page to reference from his handy martial arts manual, \"How to Punch People in the Face Properly (and Beat Up Bad Guys).\"\n(There you have it!

If you missed the Kickstarter campaign you can still pre-order copies at  cedricstudio.com/sparkbook\nMore about the hardcover options here.\nWhat Is A 'Sparkbook'?\nMaster storytellers at studios like Disney/Pixar and comic book greats like Will Eisner have all understood a fundamental principle: \"Show, don't tell\". In other words, it's more entertaining for an audience to *see* what a character is thinking or feeling rather than to have the character express it with dialogue. It's a principle that's been true from the days of silent cinema right up to today. Remember the \"married life\" sequence in Up that made everyone in the audience cry? Not a single word was spoken for several minutes, and yet everyone who watched it was deeply moved.\nIf you can master the skill of using drawings to communicate thoughts and feelings, you'll go a long way towards becoming a successful storytelling artist. That kind of expressive drawing connects with an audience. It helps make your characters relatable and causes us to care. \nI plan to create a super-charged sketchbook designed to help you capture that \"spark of life\" as you draw. It's more than a sketchbook, it's a SparkBook! This is not your typical \"how to draw\" book. Instead, there will be snippets of acting instruction and inspiration with lots of space to practice, practice, practice! You can finally draw in a book without getting into trouble!\nThere are three things that make the Sparkbook more than a typical sketchbook:\n1. Acting Lessons For Your Drawings\nThe Sparkbook includes 32 pages of instructional text, with illustrations, sprinkled throughout the book and covering several topics. Things may change and evolve as I write but for now I'm planning to cover the following:\n\u2022 Acting For Artists: Making Drawings That Entertain\n\u2022 Understanding Facial Expressions\n\u2022 Acting With The Entire Body\n\u2022 Thumbnails: Small Drawings That Make A Big Difference\n\u2022 How Personality And Emotions Affect Behavior\n\u2022 Pantomime: Actions Speak Louder Than Words\n\u2022 Resources For Further Study\n2. Acting Exercises For You To Sketch\nThe bulk of the book consists of 100 drawing ideas, or \u201csparks\u201d, printed right on the sketchbook paper! Each one is a brief story situation or scene printed at the bottom of a blank two-page spread. Some will be dramatic, some humorous, but each one will be carefully crafted to give your character(s) broad possibilities to act, emote, and entertain.\nEach of the 100 \"sparks\" is designed to meet four goals:\nEmotional: Gives the character a clear thought or a feeling to express.\nPhysical: Can be shown with the entire body, not just the face & hands.\nEntertainment Value: Relatable situations with dramatic or humorous potential.\nNarrative: Each idea could be a springboard into an entire scene or mini-story.\nEXAMPLES:\n\"Trying to stop a baby from crying.\u201d\n\u201cIn pain but trying to hide it.\u201d\n\u201cJust lost everything in a card game.\u201d\n\u201cAfter nine cups of coffee.\u201d\n\u201cHolding a gun for the first time.\u201d\n\"Walking on thin ice.\"\n\"Trying not to laugh.\"\nSome of the \"sparks\" are heartfelt (\"Reunited with a lost pet\"), others are more humorous (\"Trying to close an overstuffed suitcase\"), but all are open-ended with lots of room to play around. Ask yourself \"Where is the entertainment value in this situation? What poses could best communicate this idea? How would my character feel in this situation, and how can I show that in a drawing?\" The more you practice, the better you'll become at showing your audience what your characters are thinking and feeling. That will make you a more engaging storyteller!\n3. Hundreds Of Bonus Drawing Ideas\nIn the back of the book will be several lists carefully selected to give you more expressive drawing ideas. Once you fill up your SparkBook you\u2019ll have plenty of \"sparks\" to carry forward into future sketchbooks, such as:\n\u2022 \"A Day in the Life\" - 100 situations that take your character through a typical day.\n\u2022 100 Phrases for your character to act out (Examples: \"I'll never forgive myself!\"; \"Put that down young man!\"; \"I challenge you to a duel!\"; \"Give me a big kiss\"; etc.)\n\u2022 100 Emotions & Moods for your characters to portray (Examples: Nervous; Defiant; Sarcastic; Curious; Hopeful; etc.)\n\u2022 100 Props for your characters to interact with. (Examples: Blanket, Gift, Mirror, Water Balloon, Back Scratcher, etc.)\nThat\u2019s a grand total of 500 character ideas for you to sketch! Just think how much your drawings will improve!\nBONUS! Free Download\nTo promote the project I'm giving away a list of bonus sketchbook ideas from the back of the book: 100 Props for your characters to interact with. Each prop is carefully chosen for it's versatile acting potential. Feel free to download and share the link with your friends. All I ask is that you also point them back to this project.\nE-Book Version Automatically Included!\nMany artists prefer to draw digitally, so every Sparkbook will come with a \"basic\" e-book version (or you can buy the e-book by itself). The e-book will include everything from the physical book, except all of the spark exercises will be printed in list form instead of one per page so that you don't have to scroll through tons of unusable white space.\nIf you back it at the $35 level or higher your e-book will be upgraded to an \"expanded\" edition. It's just like the basic version except each of the bonus lists in the back of the book will be bumped up to 150 items. That's a total of 700 drawing ideas! (NOTE: The bonus lists will only be expanded in the ebook; the physical copy of the book will not change.) \nIncludes Sparkbook Online Gallery!\nIf successfully funded, I'll create and manage a SparkBook page (perhaps using Flickr or Facebook) for at least one year as a place to showcase the drawings everyone creates from their SparkBooks. (Note: I want the gallery to be very family-friendly and G-rated so there will be a few guidelines for submissions.)\nPose Drawing Bookmark!\nEveryone who contributes at the $35 level or higher will receive a sturdy bookmark, printed on both sides with a few tips from the book. \nBook Specs:\nSize: 7in. x 10in.\n240 pages (120 sheets)\nMetal wire-o double loop binding\nPaperback cover (Hardcover upgrade if stretch goal is met.)\nEach challenge will be printed in light-gray type to minimize any distractions as you draw.\nThe book will be printed on real sketchbook paper, but because the paper has to run through a printing press it will be flattened out and the \"tooth\" of the paper will be lost. However, it should still be able to withstand more abuse (erasing, wet media, etc.) than typical book paper would. \nExtra's and Add-On's:\nEveryone who orders the physical book will automatically get the ebook version (either Basic or Expanded, depending on your contribution amount) and access to the SparkBook online gallery. Additional add-ons are also available, including:\nAdditional copies of the book in discounted two-packs, five-packs and ten-packs.\nBookmark printed on both sides with tips from the book (automatically included with any contribution of $35 or more). Available individually or in discounted packs of ten.\nWebinar: \"Bringing Your Drawings To Life\"\n6-Month Sketch Club Membership: Each month I'll send out a special character-related drawing assignment (Example: \"Draw five different poses to show a tired man sitting in a chair\"), followed by a brief personal critique of your work.\nOriginal Sketch by me from an example \"spark\" assignment from the book (in order to preserve my sanity I'll choose which spark to draw). Available in black-and-white or color, with optional mat and frame. Mat will be white, frame will be thin black metal.\nWorkshops and Lectures: I'll travel to you and give a 3-hour drawing workshop, and/or my 90-minute lecture Freelancing Tips and Tricks.\nHow Will The Money Be Spent?\nYour contribution will help cover the costs for my time and effort in researching and writing the book; marketing and advertising; creating the artwork and layouts; printing costs; shipping the books to me, and then again to you; design and production of reward items; admin fees to Kickstarter and Amazon.\nWho Is Cedric Hohnstadt?\nI'm a professional illustrator specializing in character design, toy design, and advertising concept art. I've designed toys for Disney and Hasbro; created advertising comps for Coca-Cola, Target, and Best Buy; illustrated packaging for Orville Redenbacher; Supervised the animation of Mr. Potato Head for the Hasbro website; and designed characters for VeggieTales and for the animated TV series 3-2-1 Penguins! I've also been a guest speaker at the CTN Animation Expo and the Motion Conference.

There will no doubt be a slight learning curve, but I've done my research and planned ahead. I've worked on hundreds of client projects in the past and have a lot of experience in solving problems and meeting deadlines. \n\nI'm working with a printer who specializes in sketchbooks. It's a little unusual for them to print on the sketchbook paper itself but the samples they've sent me lead me to believe they will do a good job. They will print the book on real sketchbook paper, but because everything will be run through a printing press the \"tooth\" of the pages will be smoothed out. As a result the pages will feel similar in texture to those of a normal book. However, they should be able to withstand abuse (erasing, wet media, etc.) better than normal book paper would.\n\nPortions of the book are already written. I will continue writing and drawing as the Kickstarter unfolds and will post snippets on my blog to keep interest going. If the project is successfully funded I will set aside chunks of time in between my normal client projects over a period of approximately 4-6 weeks to finish the book and create all rewards items. The book will be printed in the USA so turnaround-time should be relatively short (no \"slow boat from China\"). Once the Kickstarter campaign is finished, I expect to begin shipping the books to backers within 8-10 weeks if not sooner.\n\nI want to be as open and transparent as possible so if any problems do arise I'll be sure let everyone know what's going on and how I plan to handle it.\n\nFeel free to contact me with any questions you have and I'll try my best to respond within one business day.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "My new Kickstarter: A book of Sketchbook Silliness gag cartoons", "update_content": "I want to thank you all one more time for backing the Pose Drawing Sparkbook three years ago.

More than twenty years ago, I began writing and illustrating a massive graphic novel I called StarChild. Released first as a series of comic books, the stories were later collected into two volumes: AWAKENINGS, and CROSSROADS. A third volume, MYTHOPOLIS, was never completed.\nThe years when StarChild began were a thrilling time to be in comics,  and the book amassed a following that included some of the greatest luminaries in the field: Will Eisner and Neil Gaiman, and Rick Veitch and Paul Chadwick, and Whilce Portacio and Ray Bradbury, and many, many more. I self-published most of the comics and collected editions, but the latter issues were published by industry leader Image Comics, under Jim Valentino. Then, the business changed \u2014 and other than a few shorter stories, StarChild went on hiatus.\n\n(One of the trade show jam prints I did with my friends and colleagues Dave Sim, Jeff Smith, Martin Wagner, and Colleen Doran.)\nThe Decision\nI always wanted to go back to complete the stories I started, and many readers clamored for more \u2014 but I discovered that over the two decades since I began, my work had also changed, and I faced a dilemma. I had changed too much as a writer and illustrator and storyteller to finish the stories in the same way I began them. So, I decided that I would revisit and complete those stories in another way, as a series of illustrated novels called Fool\u2019s Hollow.\nBut\u2026 A lot of what was in the original comics only works as comics \u2014 and I mourned the idea that so much wonderful work that I loved creating might be lost. Over the years, there have been a number of reprint editions of the StarChild material, most recently as the six volume Essential StarChild collections. But multiple editions are hard to keep in print and make available. So, I decided that what was needed was what I had planned for almost from the very beginning: One extraordinary, deluxe volume containing every page of the entire StarChild story that I had ever created.\n                             (Above: one of the little-seen MYTHOPOLIS pages.)\nThe Book\nAll the stories, including the first two storylines, AWAKENINGS and CROSSROADS; the \"Little Neil\" short stories from the anthology NEGATIVE BURN; the long story \"Hobblesmith;\" the unfinished MYTHOPOLIS chapters that have never been reprinted; all the development sketches and notes; guest illustrations and art features from some of my pro friends; literally everything that had been associated with the title StarChild - as well as the Prologue of the forthcoming illustrated novel, Fool's Hollow.\nAlmost 700 pages of material.\nEverything has been rescanned from the original art and digitally cleaned for the highest quality reproduction, and I have also hand-retouched several of the pages to both assure the final quality of the work, as well as alter (slightly) a few of the more mature-reader-oriented pages to make this edition more family-friendly for my younger readers.\nMy good friend Steve Bissette, who not only inspired a lot of the art within but who also was a fellow traveler along the self-publishing highway with his book TYRANT is contributing an introduction.\nIn one book, I can share the work that established my career for readers old and new to enjoy \u2014 and YOU can help make it happen.\n                              (Above: the title page from the story \"Hobblesmith.\")\nAdd a Second Book for a Friend: there have been requests for a way to receive a second hardcover and this is the solution - add $45 to any current pledge level and you will be sent an additional signed hardcover and signed mini-print of the cover illustration. If you change your pledge level, you will need to add the $45 again to your new pledge to receive the second hardcover and mini-print. If the hardcover is shipping outside the US, please add an additional $30.\nThe Rewards\nDigital: A PDF of the entire book is available to supporters who pledge at the $20 and $30 levels and all levels at $60 and higher (exclusive of the $125 Bookseller's Pledge)\nHardcover: The entire 700+ page collection, finely printed on heavy unbleached recycled stock, bound as a high-quality hardcover, with a foil-stamped Kivar leatherette binding in a felt finish and a tipped-in full-color cover plate, available for a pledge of only $45, and available for all greater pledges. The hardcover will include a signature from the grateful author on the title page.\nPrints: A signed 5\" x 7\" mini-print of the color cover art included for pledges $30 and greater (exclusive of the $125 Bookseller's Pledge)\n\u2014 A special 13\" x 19\" B/W StarChild print, produced just for this project, limited to 245 copies maximum, and not to be offered for sale after this project's completion for pledges at $75, $125, and greater (exclusive of the $125 Bookseller's Pledge).\n                              (Above: the art for the backer-exclusive print.)\n\u2014 Artist proofs of the two massively detailed 28\" x 40\" Fool's Hollow art prints: \"The Gatherum\", and \"Old Tom's Study\" for the $250 pledge level. The prints will be shipped separately in a sturdy tube, and are the ideal wall decoration for the dedicated StarChild collector (exclusive of the $125 Bookseller's Pledge).\n                  (Above: details from \"The Gatherum\" and \"Old Tom's Study.\")\nSketches: Pledges at the $100 level and greater have an ORIGINAL head sketch of one of the characters (artist's choice) drawn in marker on the front endpapers of the hardcover collection.\n(Above: an example of a head sketch I did in a French edition of StarChild: Awakenings.)\nOriginal Art: A FULLY-RENDERED FINISHED ILLUSTRATION commission of the character(s) of your choice (within reason and subject to approval), to be rendered in pen and ink on a 10\" x 14\" illustration board for the greatest pledge level of $750. Please note the artist (me) may take several weeks, months, or possibly over a year to deliver - but with the understanding that as I almost NEVER sell original art, it will most assuredly be worth your sponsorship and your while, for which I will endeavor to make your wait as short a period as possible.\n(Above: an example of a commission piece I did of RUSH drummer Neil Peart as a Dragon. Obviously, I'm open to all sorts of possibilities for commissioned pieces.)\nBonus in Celebration of Early Funding for ALL pledge levels $1 and up: a signed mini-print (5\" x 7\") of the popular StarChild character Martin Humble as Cupid, from the cover of Joe Pruett's anthology NEGATIVE BURN.\n        (Above: the art for the Bonus Reward print.)\nSomething Extraordinary for a Backer at the $100 Pledge level and higher*: of the hardcovers that contain an original head sketch (Libri Fresco, all Hat Tricks, \u00dcberfan, and Michaelangelo Pledge levels), one special hardcover will have an original, remarqued, four-page (both sets of endpapers, front and back) handwritten STORY, which may contain elements of the ENTIRE epic that I'll be sharing in the Fool's Hollow novels that come out in 2014. Which hardcover I write the short story in will be chosen at random after the Kickstarter project ends. The head sketch for that hardcover will then be on the inside endpaper opposite the signature page. *Does not include hardcovers included in the Bookseller's Pledge.\nThe Pledge Levels\n\nUPDATED! And for worthy Booksellers of discretion and taste, the Bookseller's Pledge now has six books!\nStretch Goals\nThank you\nThese stories and art exist because of the support of my readers. Whether you are an old friend of StarChild (such as \u00dcberfan Alex De Luca, who provided the WONDERFUL soundtrack for the video) or a new reader excited to jump in, I have always been and remain truly grateful for your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause all of the work is complete, there are very few risks to be had in supporting this project.

In January of this year, I started folding 1000 origami Wish Cranes.\nIt takes me about six minutes to fold each Wish Crane because getting the Crane folded is not the goal, it is the end result. That time is spent thinking about my wish and how I can best do what I can to make it come true. That time is a break from what has to be done to contemplate what could be done. That time is well spent, every day.\nI currently have over four hundred Wish Cranes completed. In November, I will finish folding the final one. I do not know when my Wish will be granted, but I do know ...\nI will have *a lot* of origami Wish Cranes.\nThus this Kickstarter project.\nIf you pledge, you will receive one of the origami Wish Cranes I have folded this year. I will rejoice that it has a new home, and perhaps that Wish Crane can aid a wish of yours to come true, too. \nThe origami Wish Canes are created from 3 inch x 3 inch patterned paper, which comes in five designs.\nEach Wish Crane is folded by hand, therefore they lack a machine's precision but have a craftsman's uniqueness.\nAll Wish Cranes are numbered under one wing, ranging from 1 to 1000. \nThe number and pattern of the Wish Crane you receive will be randomly chosen when I reach into the flock and close my fingers gently upon a single wing and withdraw that crane - kind of like The Claw in the movie Toy Story, but with less vocalizations for my origami Wish Cranes are a silent species.\nThe Funding Goal is $25 because that is how much I need to pay for the additional paper necessary to fold the remaining Wish Cranes.\nThe Pledge Reward is set to $3, which covers supplies and shipment of one Wish Crane to wherever you are in the world.\nThe Pledge Limit is set to 999 because I want to keep one of the Wish Cranes for myself. \nI am folding 1000 origami Wish Cranes and hope to send 999 to new homes, where perhaps they can help fulfill a new Wish.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt is possible a Wish Crane may go missing after it leaves my house and before it reaches yours.

They crash land on a weird planet and end up locked in a mysterious fortress called Armikrog. Then...the adventure begins!\nThe Game\nArmikrog is a point and click adventure game that features all of the characteristics of TenNapel's unmistakable style:\nQuirky and lovable characters\nUnique worlds\nA compelling story\nMind-bending puzzles\nGreat animation\nTons of clay!\nThe Music\nTerry S. Taylor -- the award winning composer of The Neverhood soundtrack, will be composing and performing an entirely new original soundtrack for the game. Hooray!!!\nArmikrog will be available DRM-free for PC (WINDOWS), MAC OSX and LINUX, and distributed though GOG.com, The Humble Store and several other digital distribution platforms. For those of you who prefer Steam, we are now on Steam Greenlight. Click the link below where you can vote YES for Armikrog and boost our popularity!\nArmikrog on Steam Greenlight\nMaking this game will be a labor of love, and a \"thank you\" to all Neverhood fans and adventure gamers.\nArmikrog is being developed by Pencil Test Studios, an independent game development company located in Lake Forest, CA. Along with Doug TenNapel, the team includes core members from The Neverhood, as well as puppet fabricators, sculptors, and animators that will help to create the stop-motion that makes this project so unique.\nArmikrog will also feature the voice talents of:\nThe Neverhood was conceived and created from the ground up over a 12 month period. Armikrog will be developed using the Unity engine for PC, MAC and LINUX in order to secure the goal of completing the project within one year. We'll also be using many of the same animation, modelling, sculpting, set building and clay & puppet fabrication methods we've used before\u2014keeping the overall game design scalable so that we can create a fun and exciting experience within our targeted funding goal, but still have the flexibility to expand, should the opportunity present itself.\nOf course, none of this happens without your support, which is why we are reaching out to you through Kickstarter. Why Kickstarter? Funny you should ask...\nKickstarter is our most direct link to you, the fans. This is your opportunity to express whether or not you'd like to see another clay and puppet, stop-motion adventure game. Armikrog is a unique and creative project that we would love to make for those of you who have, over the years, dreamed of the chance to immerse yourself in another world made of clay. We're here to offer you the opportunity to make this project a reality.\nWhile our funding goal is considerably less than The Neverhood cost to produce in 1997, it is still our biggest hurdle. But in light of what it will cost to create, the real question is this: Would you support and play this game for $25?\nIf enough of you support it, you will get this game.\nThe Armikrog game will be comparable in size and scope to The Neverhood. It's been noted that our initial funding goal is significantly less than the cost of the original Neverhood game--this is possible since we are now utilizing technology that was not available to us 15 years ago (Unity engine, post-production and editing software, etc) which will allow us to create this game more efficiently with a overall higher level of quality.\nIn addition to our more conventional game production pipeline, we are also utilizing many of the same stop motion techniques used in such feature films as Paranorman and Nightmare Before Christmas. A significant portion of our budget is allocated toward puppet fabrication and sculpting, set building, lights, cameras, and lots and lots of clay!\nStop motion animation is an art all of its own. Each puppet, set and prop is individually hand-crafted by artists, while each and every frame is painstakingly animated. This specialized process is what makes this game unique--and we feel the time and talent that it takes to bring a project like this to this to life is worth every penny.\n100% of the funds that are raised will go directly into the production of the game. To date, we\u2019ve invested over $100,000 into the preproduction, design, and development, and we can see how fun and amazing this project will be. We want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and applying 100% of your contributions toward development is the only way this will happen.\nIllustration by Earthworm Jim poster artist, Mike Koelsch\nRewards fall into two basic categories: Digital Rewards that are distributed though Steam and/or comparable download venues, and Physical Rewards that will be distributed through the mail. Note that all physical rewards under $1000 have an additional shipping cost for supporters with addresses outside of the United States.\nRewards that are not dependent on the production of the actual game will be fulfilled before the date specified in the reward tiers. Since we can't predict the amount of rewards that will need to be fulfilled, all rewards have been given the same fulfillment date as the game's ship date (July 2014). Once the campaign has ended, we will notify you of the fulfillment dates for those rewards that will ship sooner.\nBoxed Edition in the big, old-school size (mockup - design not finalized)\nKickstarter Exclusive Armikrog T-Shirt ($200 tier and above)\nTommynaut stop-motion production puppet\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\nArmikrog is already getting a lot of great press.

Having many of the original members of The Neverhood team is a tremendous asset, as we already have the experience of creating this type of game. All games face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, but we have yet to face a challenge that we couldn't overcome. We have already begun to detail the entire scope of the game before production begins, which will help to define and minimize risks--which is key to the successful development of any game.\n\nWe've already invested a substantial amount of time and money into preproduction, laying the groundwork for an amazing game and we hope that you are as excited as we are about this project.

Now that we know what's possible, there's more work to do. $2,000,000 is just the beginning! We've got 30 days, and the more we raise, the bigger and better this movie will be.

It only took you 11 HOURS to cross 2 million dollars? You speedy little marshmallows :) Words can't even express how excited we are. You came through, and I'll keep my promise too. We're going to make the best Veronica Mars movie anyone ever made, and the movie YOU deserve. Because YOU made this happen. But there's still time, and the more we raise, the better we can make it. All of the money you pledge this month goes right back into making this movie the one you've been waiting for, and the movie we've been waiting to make. So call your friends. Rally the troops. Lets break another record.\nLoVe always, \nkristen bell\nDay 1: Messages from Rob & Kristen\nAlmost since Veronica Mars went off the air, there's been talk of making a movie. In that span, I've taken different tactics in dealing with the question of whether it might happen. To be clear, I've always wanted to make a Veronica Mars movie. I love writing these characters and working with these actors. Kristen Bell has always wanted to make the movie.\nThere was a moment, a few years ago, when we thought we had a real shot at making it happen. I developed a pitch that revolved around graduation day at Hearst college -- Wallace and Mac were graduating at least, Veronica had been sidetracked by freeing Keith from prison. Plus, there was a murder in Neptune that was affecting the beach city's spring break business in much the same way a great white shark affected the beach community of Amity. I probably stoked fan fervor in my optimistic comments about the prospects. Warner Bros. wasn\u2019t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.\nAfter that, I tried to tamp down expectations. I didn't want to be guilty \u2014 at least not twice \u2014 of building up hope when the odds seemed so long. Still, without fail, in every interview I do or every place I speak, I get the \"will there be a Veronica Mars movie?\" question. Even after a couple of years of downplaying the chances, I'd still run across blog postings headlined, \"will Rob Thomas shut up about the Veronica Mars movie, already!\" I was trying to. I promise. \nI first found out about Kickstarter a couple of years ago from an Austin musician friend of mine \u2014 Robert Harrison, lead singer of Cotton Mather, the band that gave us \"Lily Dreams On,\" our closing song of season 1. He financed a rerelease of the band's fantastic Kontiki album. Later, I was marveling about Kickstarter with another buddy of mine who said off-handedly, \"You should use Kickstarter to raise the money to make the Veronica Mars movie.\" I chuckled. That seemed like a silly idea in the moment. We'd need millions. But for the next few weeks, the notion was never far from my mind. I started doing the proverbial back-of-a-cocktail-napkin math. The average pledge on Kickstarter is $71. Hell, if we could get 30,000 people to give the average donation, we could finance the movie, particularly if the cast and I were willing to work cheap. The most common donation amount on Kickstarter is $25. Surely, 80,000 of our three million viewers would find that price-point viable! \nOf course, Warner Bros. still owns Veronica Mars and we would need their blessing and cooperation to pull this off. Kristen and I met with the Warner Bros. brass, and they agreed to allow us to take this shot. They were extremely cool about it, as a matter of fact. Their reaction was, if you can show there\u2019s enough fan interest to warrant a movie, we\u2019re on board. So this is it. This is our shot. I believe it's the only one we've got. It's nerve-wracking. I suppose we could fail in spectacular fashion, but there's also the chance that we completely revolutionize how projects like ours can get made. No Kickstarter project ever has set a goal this high. It's up to you, the fans, now. If the project is successful, our plan is to go into production this summer and the movie will be released in early 2014. \nLife has taken Veronica away from Neptune. In the years since spoiling Keith's chances to be reelected sheriff, Veronica hasn't taken a case. But something big is about to bring her back home and back to her calling. My goal is to include as many of your favorite characters as possible. It is, after all, time for Veronica\u2019s 10-year high school reunion. Keep in mind that the more money we raise, the cooler movie we can make. A two million dollar fundraising total probably means cross words are exchanged at the class reunion. Three million? We can afford a full-on brawl. Ten million? Who knows... For some reason the Neptune High class reunion takes place on a nuclear submarine! A Hobbit shows up! There\u2019s a Bollywood end-credit dance number! I\u2019ve always wanted to direct Bill Murray. We\u2019ll figure out something cool. Hey, if that total goes high enough, I\u2019ll bet the good folks at Warner Bros. will agree a sequel is a good idea.\nThanks to everyone who hasn't lost faith.\nRob\nDay 1: A Message from Kristen\ndearest marshmallows... \nI am currently the happiest blonde in a hamster ball the world has ever seen. We have been waiting so long to make this movie dream a movie reality, and it\u2019s because of YOUR commitment, YOUR persistence, that we finally have a chance. We just have one more step to go. \nYou have banded together like the sassy little honey badgers you are and made this possibility happen. i promise if we hit our goal, we will make the sleuthiest, snarkiest, it\u2019s-all-fun-and-games-\u2018til-one-of-you-gets-my-foot-up-your-ass movie we possibly can. \nI promise to give it my all. i promise to work my hardest to give everyone a little bit more Veronica, and i will be oh so honored to do so.  \nI only ask for one thing in return. \nIf I ever die, do me a favor. Go on Oprah and tell the world that I loved kittens. \nLoVe to you ALL, \nkristen bell \nMore Countries!

His people are all but gone, his kingdom destroyed apart from one surviving relic: a magical sword of light that was forged by gods, which will help this lone hero return his land to freedom.'\nThis is our story - one that we have been incredibly passionate about telling. Each panel has been lovingly hand-painted by Imaginism, and brought to life by Studio NX using cool 2D animation in a modern filmmaking style, complete with a score of contemporary classical music featuring DJ Yoda\nWe created an intense story experience that we would want to see, and which in turn we know our audience would love.\nThe rapid spread of iPads and other tablets across the globe has opened up exciting possibilities for storytelling that in the past, we could only dream of. We are merging these capabilities with our own skills and knowledge of the movie industry to bring you a comic book where every panel is transformed into a fully animated audio/visual experience.\nGREAT CHARACTERS NEED GREAT VOICES\nFor voices and narration we have the movie and video game voice actor Lewis Macleod, whose credits include \u2018Star Wars: Episode One\u2019 and the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 and the \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 series by EA Games.\nPLUS WE HAVE A GREAT SOUNDTRACK!\nWe knew we needed a memorable soundtrack so we have Gabriel Prokovief\u2019s \u2018Concerto for Turntables and Orchestra\u2019 featuring the famous DJ Yoda!

We have funded this entire project for the past 15 months with our own time and money but now we need YOU - the Kickstarter audience - to help us take this project into the final stages. \nWe are more than halfway through animating the app and need your help to complete it by the end of the summer, 2013. Our goal from the beginning was to ensure that we achieved the highest quality of 2D animation and not to cut any corners along the way. Every frame is painstakingly drawn by hand, which is extremely time consuming and costly to produce, but - as you will see - the results are well worth it. \nFunding received will go towards completing the production of the app as well as the coding to release it on the iPad appstore.\nSo fellow comic and animation lovers, this is where you come in!

In ADDITION, I am going to include a rare two page story drawn by me (in color for the first time), a separate development/sketcbook section for a TV VERSION pitch I've created (redesigning the characters, making them younger and in high school), as well as a mini flip book in the corner of never before seen animation I created of Marty and Alexis (in COLOR!).

It was a real labor of love for me.  My buddy and I started a comic company to self-publish our own creations called Funnypages Press.  This first story arc (issues 1-4, reproduced in this Kickstarter) was originally printed in BLACK AND WHITE with a press run of only a couple thousand.  They are very rare to find (though I have a few left that I am offering in one of the incentive tiers to the right).  Around 2005 or so, ALIAS Publishing (now long gone) offered to reprint issues 1-4 in COLOR for the first time.  I created all new covers for that run and we had a talented artist (Cedric Hohnstadt) INK issues 3 and 4  (which I had drawn much more roughly), along with the covers.  Joshua Ray did an excellent job coloring all four issues and the covers.  So, between the two print runs, there were two versions of the interior art (black and white/ color) and 8 different covers created for the combined runs.  AND, all \"celebrity\" pinups and covers that I had made for the black and white (Funnypages Press) version were NOT reproduced for the COLOR (Alias) version.  SO- this is why I wanted to finally compile the BEST of all the versions, have some of the pinups colored for the first time, AND add extra content like the sketchbook sections to create THIS AWESOME TRADE PAPERBACK!  It's the ULTIMATE OPPOSITE FORCES BOOK!  \nWhat will the money be used for?  Well, largely, the printing of the book, the art prints, paying some colorists, a graphic artist to put the book together and color the animation drawings, my 15 year old daughter wants something for helping to ship stuff and help shoot my video, Amazon and Kickstarter fees (that's up to 10% right there), and Shipping (this could be about 20-25% of the costs too).  IF we go over the goal, I do plan on ADDING A FEW \"REACH\" GOALS.  Maybe Hardcover?  Maybe adding more pages to the sketchbook sections?  Maybe both or more?  We'll see.  \nPS- Send me a note if you have any ideas of other incentives that you'd like to see.  I may add some as we go!\nNOTE: I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND and have added a PDF version of the book to the $35 and up levels.  Since this Kickstarter is IN PROGRESS, I don't feel it is right to add a lower level tier with JUST the PDF version of the book.  It would be unfair to those that have already purchased the book.  If you have backed at the $20 level and still ALSO want the PDF version, then I suggest you UPGRADE to that level.  I hope this helps those that enjoy both digital and book form versions of this book.  \nALSO, this new PDF version of the book will ALSO go to EVERYONE that is ABOVE the $35 tier.  I can not change the wording of the tiers once the Kickstarter has begun, so this is the best way I know how to get that word out.   \"Always be backing!\"\n_____________________________________________________________\nAnd here's some images of what you are getting in some of the INCENTIVES on the right:\nHERE'S THE BOOK COVER:\nA couple sample interior pages from the 80+ page story:\nIssue 1, page 13\nIssue 1, page 14\nThe book will include tons of alternate covers, pinups, and sketchbook pages too!\nThere's even a never before seen animation I created of Marty and Alexis running toward the camera.  It is being colored and put in the corner of the sketchbook section as a flip book!  Here is an example of one of the frames from the Alexis level!  (The Marty and Alexis original animation artwork from this animation is a part of some of the incentives on the right!)\nOne drawing from the Alexis level of the run cycle (NOTE: the original artwork is NOT in color)\n__________________________________________________________________\nAND for some of the incentive tiers there are EXTRAS like:\nPage samples of the Tom Bancroft SUPERHEROES PDF Sketchbook\nHere is the original artwork for the $250 tiers- The Marty Fan and The Alexis Fan:\nNOTE: These are two SEPARATE tiers.

They are high quality and have printed many Kickstarter projects along with great \"art of\" books for many well-known comic artists. Obviously, there can be challenges to working with any company abroad, so some shipping delays can always happen. My shipment deadline in each backing tier is just a guess of when I might get the comic back from the printer (usually 3 months) and get all of them together and shipped out to you. Assume 4 months, I guess. My 15 year old daughter will be working with me (so she can raise a little money for overly sexy swim suits for summer- dang it!) to help ship and fulfill all the incentives. That can always be problematic but I have 4 daughters so working with ONE sounds easy. Shouldn't be a problem we can't handle by bringing MOM in to get things done. I will do my best to get quality packing materials to ship all the incentives. I live in fear of the postal service, so that should help us all here. Also, my time is limited because of many work commitments, but I am planning on making this as much of a priority as possible to accomplish all the shipping, emails, and art commissions to everyone's full pleasure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "If you liked Opposite Forces- try my Art of Tom Bancroft book!", "update_content": "Help me Help my buddies bring COMIC STRIPS BACK FROM THE ABYSS!

Our adventures were nothing short of epic. As we grew older we forgot how powerful our imaginations once were and how it was our imaginations that helped us overcome fears, find creative answers to problems, and just see a little bit of magic in the world around us.\nAs an illustrator, I decided many years ago that I wanted my art to help people go back and remember those fantastic adventures. I wanted to recreate the sense that you have the power to do anything, go anywhere and most importantly just to dream.\nThese artistic adventures have grown over the years. There have been dragons, trolls, rock whales, and unicorns. Unfortunately they are not all in one place. So I figured, maybe it was time to share these adventures in a book. That was able to take you to places that were familiar, yet at the same time completely unique.  Places that might bring a tear the eye, a smile to the face, and a warmth to the heart. I wish I could do this on my own but I need the help of others. Welcome to my kickstarter project.\nMy Project: Adventures for a Lazy Afternoon. A FULL COLOR 68 page 9\"x12.25\", hard cover art book that deals with imagination, creativity, adventuring and dreams. This is all artwork, sketches, and concepts by illustrator/comic creator Travis Hanson.\nWho's it for? It's for anyone that enjoys dreaming, adventuring, creating and just in general playing in their imagination. We are all kids at heart and this book is for the sci-fi/fantasy fan, no matter what the age.\nWhat's in it? All original content. I have a very active imagination and when I am not drawing comics, I like to draw for me. All these creative adventures were originally prints by me. The ideas are purely mine.  I am also including sketches , new pencil art and some work that has never been seen before. \nWhy? I love to tell stories. I love to tell stories through my art. I believe that good stories don't have to be long and drawn out tales (though I like those as well), but can be single complex images with several layers of interpretation. Most of all as I watch my children play, I am reminded of how incredibly fun it was to adventure when I was their age. While I enjoy looking at art online, I love holding a book in my hand. There is just something about that.\nI can't do this without you: I need your help, that's why I am here. $11,000 is my goal. This covers printing and for the most part shipping. I am going to add another $1500 of my own money into this project. Why? Because I believe in the dream. With your help we can make this series of adventures a reality.\nWhat happens if we pass the goal? If we pass the goal, I will upgrade the book. I will add a cover jacket, more pages to the interior, and upgrade paper stock. The goal is to make something fantastic and wonderful that keeps getting better.\nthe cover\nHow can I get a 2nd Book? The last few weeks I have received a lot of requests about if it's possible to get a 2nd book with the rewards. I want to make this happen and yet I need to make sure that everything goes smooth for myself as well. So here is what we are going to do.\nYup just add $30 to your Current Pledge level and I will send you a 2nd book. If you decide to change your reward tier you will need to add $30 as well to get a 2nd book. This is the easiest way to do this.\nMy adventure book contains many new illustrations from this last year.\n...as well as a lot of old ones that are no longer in print.\nThis book is also loaded with tons of new artwork not found anywhere else in my creative collection. Some designed specifically just for this book.\nSTRETCH GOALS: Since we hit the original goal, I want to make the stretch goals fun and rewarding. Really rewarding.\nColoring Book Stretch Goal!\nLets see us really get this book upgraded and also lets add a brand new coloring BOOK! Right now though the book is still getting printed! Thanks for love and the support! Please help spread the word.\nFor my International friends - I am asking that you add $10 to your pledge to help cover the added expense of international shipping, I will make up the difference. ANY Pledge that is over 175 though I will cover ALL the shipping no matter where it goes.\nSPREAD THE WORD... Help share the adventure and always be creative.

One of them being that the books get lost or held up in transit. Or that it will take a long time to finish off the art. Or you might miss the email that sends the survey on how to get your reward when it is all done. These are all valid. \n\nYet after 3 successful campaigns, I have proven that my main goal is to make things work for you the backer. \n\nFirst off almost all the art is done. In 60 days I should have it all done and I will keep you updated at all times on what things are going on. I will never start a campaign without being close to completion. That is important to me. If there are hold ups or production issues- you will be the first to know. The goal is that this process is transparent and that you will always be advised on what is going on. \n\nAs for missing the important emails, I would encourage you to make sure that you check your spam folder and that you keep an eye out of all kickstarter emails. This is really important. I will do my best to make sure the reward process is smooth, I would also encourage you to make sure that the emails are checked so you don't miss important information. \n\nAlso several of the rewards are all custom pieces of art or sketches. This takes time, be aware of that. I do draw quick, but it still takes time. I work down the list as well. So those that get their information to me on-time, well that puts your art on top of the list. \n\nThis is a great process and I enjoy when the projects I back are filled with updates and information.

Throughout my career, I've worked for many studios including Don Bluth, Electronic Arts, Cartoon Network, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Disney, and many more. In 2001, I left my position as Head of Special Effetcs at Warner Brothers Feature Animation, so that I could pursue being a full time independent artist. I had always done personal work after hours and on weekends, but with my departure from Hollywood, I was hoping that from then on, I could make my art the primary focus of my career. In 2002, I moved to the Pacific Northwest, and began working seriously toward that dream.\nSince leaving the studios and becoming a full time independent artist, I have done books, graphic novels, short films, a video game, live performances, etc, while at the same time, continuing my affiliation with the movie, television and game industries as a freelancer.\nAnd now, I feel ready to tackle my dream of making an independent animated feature film.\nTHE SAGA OF REX: THE MOVIE IN MY HEAD\nTHE SAGA OF REX is labor of love that reflects my deep love for science fiction, strange creatures, otherwordly concepts, and classical animation. When I created THE SAGA OF REX graphic novel, I literally saw it as a movie in my head and treated the whole thing as a fully art directed storyboard. I saw the characters, the effects and the landscapes move in my mind's eye, and tried to convey as much of that feeling as I could on the pages.\nA COSMIC LOVE STORY\nTHE SAGA OF REX is the story of a little fox who gets abducted by a flying saucer and is transported to the planet Edernia, where he encounters the Blossoms, a race of shape shifters.\nOne of the Blossoms, chooses Rex as a potential mate and so the adventure begins. Rex must prove his worth and Aven, the shapeshifting Blossom, must conquer Rex\u2019s heart.\nIt\u2019s a love story. It\u2019s an adventure. It\u2019s an epic journey into an alien world. I am convinced that it will make a fascinating and beautiful film.\nA 1\u00bd TO 4 MINUTE SHORT FILM AT FIRST\nSo, how do I go about making a film of THE SAGA OF REX? Here's my concept: My first goal, before diving into a feature length film is to make a short film. The short will be a self-contained section of the feature film and will be used for the second round of financing (which may or may not necessarily be on Kickstarter). Preferably, the short film will be 4 minutes in length, but shorter will work too (you will help determine the length, but more on that later). So why 4 minutes you ask? Here are my reasons:\nI believe THE SAGA OF REX will be beautiful, visionary, surreal, and fascinating, but I also realize that it will be quite artsy in terms of storytelling. If it is too long, it could be taxing on the audience. This is why I want to make the movie as short as possible, yet I still want it to qualify as a feature film. According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences:\n\"An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of more than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters\u2019 performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique.\"\n40 minutes for a film like THE SAGA OF REX sounds just like what I have in mind\u2014so this is perfect! But in order to be eligible for Academy Award submission...\n\"No more then ten percent of the running time of a film, is allowed to be shown in a nontheatrical medium prior to the film\u2019s theatrical release.\"\nSince I want to have the option of submitting the film, and at the same time, I want to be able to share the footage created through Kickstarter with the world\u2014as soon as it is completed\u2014I need to make sure I play by the rules. Hence, the four minutes limit (40 minutes \u00f7 10 = 4 minutes).\nThe credits will be different in the short film and feature film so I'm not worried about going over 4 minutes with that part of it.\nYOU DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THE FILM\nI evaluated that by working full time, at my regular pace of 50 hours a week, I can produce around one minute of completed film every 8 to 10 weeks. I also need to budget for sound and music since this is not my area of expertise. I already produced approximately 30 seconds of animation so the new footage will be added to that.\nFIRST GOAL - $15,000: I will create ONE minute of new full color animation bringing the total length to 1\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nSECOND GOAL - $30,000: I will create TWO minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 2\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nTHIRD GOAL - $45,000: I will create THREE minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 3\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nFOURTH GOAL - $52,500:  I will create THREE AND A HALF minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 4 minutes. LOCKED!\nFIFTH GOAL - $60,000: In addition to the FOUR-MINUTE SHORT FILM, I will create a TWO-MINUTE THEATRICAL TRAILER featuring 30 seconds of new animation.\nIf we reach the $60,000 mark, I will create a 2-minute theatrical trailer featuring scenes from the short film as well as 30 seconds of new animation. For the new animation, I will cherry pick events from the graphic novel that will display the full breath of what the feature film will look like: spectacular, emotional, poetic, action-packed, mysterious and thrilling.\nAdding 30 more seconds of animation that will be publicly shown before the completed feature film's theatrical release means that I will have to increase the length of the feature film to 45 minutes, so that I still respect the Academy's 10% rule. This is okay\u2014a 45-minute film still falls within the range of what I envision.\nAnything raised above the fifth goal will go back into the production to pay for sound and music, more lavish animation and effects, etc. EVERYTHING WILL GO INTO THE FILM. The bigger the budget, the more impressive this film will be. If you make the calculation (subtract rewards and 10% Kickstarter and Amazon fee), you will see how low the budget actually is for what I'm trying to attempt. That's why any surplus in money would allow me to expand the project further (equipment, software, assistant animator, etc). I'm not here to get rich, I only want an opportunity to do a beautiful film.\nOnce the short film is completed, I will start designing the next phase of financing, as well as planning the potential addition of a small crew. But first, let's do this first part!\nEVOLVING TECHNOLOGY\nWhen I started in the animation industry back in the 80s, I dreamt of a day when the technology would evolve to a point where a small group of artists, or even a single one, would be able to create complex and fully animated films\u2014something that could only be achieved with huge crews and big budgets at the time. Throughout my career, I kept learning everything I could about animation filmmaking while exploring new technologies. I always kept my dream alive of one day making that \"classically animated\" movie that would look like a big budget feature film, only done with a fraction of the cost. The big appeal for me was simple\u2014if the cost was massively reduced, a truly singular artistic vision could be kept untampered.\nWhen digital ink & paint and compositing started making their way into the animation biz in the early 90s, I hooked up with Cambridge Animation from the UK, to help them develop Animo, a 2D software for traditional animators. From that relationship, I made a short film called, PRELUDE TO EDEN, and became one of the spokepersons for Animo (watch the film here).\nDuring that period, Animo became the prime tool for non-Disney animated feature films, being used on movies such as, THE IRON GIANT, OSMOSIS JONES, PRINCE OF EGYPT, THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT, ELDORADO, SPACE JAM and many more. However, 2D animation software from other sources continued to evolve while Animo stagnated. I had to come to the realization that Animo, a product of a now defunct company which hadn't been updated since 2006, was no longer cutting edge. After over 15 years of using Animo for my animation projects, it was time for me to move on. I did some research and found a series of software called Toon Boom. Quickly thereafter, I proceeded to use Toon Boom Harmony 10, their latest offering, to create an animation test based on my graphic novel, THE SAGA OF REX (you can read all about it here).\nToon Boom allowed me to remain 100% paperless and bypass time-consuming steps such as scanning and processing drawings. By working directly within the software with a Cintiq tablet, my process was massively sped up. To test this, I gave myelf a 3-week deadline in an effort to see how much I could accomplish within that time frame. Chosing a simple section of the graphic novel, I was able to singlehandedly create approximately 30 seconds of animation, fully colored and composited. This would have been unthinkable if I would have been hand drawing the animation on paper. Granted, I worked like a mad man for the duration of the test, and this was one of the simplest section of the graphic novel with only one character and very little special effects\u2014most of the book is a good deal more involved and would require more time\u2014but nevertheless, I saw what was possible.\nTHE ORIGIN OF REX\nIn 1997, I was working at Warner Brothers Feature Animation as Special Effects Supervisor. My production assistant at the time, Scott Grieder, really enjoyed my art and suggested that I do a children's book. The thought of illustrating a storybook sounded pretty cool, so I told Scott, \"I'll draw it and you write it.\" I quickly scribbled a drawing of a cute little fox facing a strange creature and gave it to Scott. \"This is your starting point, write something about that,\" I said to him.\nTwo weeks later, before Scott had a chance to begin writing, I had completed twenty more illustrations.\"Here's more inspiration for your story,\" I said while handing him a stack of photocopies.\nAnother fifteen to twenty days later, I called Scott to tell him that the book was finished and that I'd written the whole thing. I couldn't stop myself\u2014it just poured out of me. I was glad to hear that Scott was relieved to have the burden off his shoulders.\nA SEARCH FOR MEANING: THE STORY OF REX was finished in December 1997 and published in July 1998 as an oversized hardcover book, signed and numbered edition of 1000\nI sold the book at trade shows, conventions and to friends, and after a couple of years, sold out all the copies. I didn't want to let the story disappear into oblivion, so in 2002, I colored the illustrations, refined the layouts, and self-published the second hard cover edition. I actually managed to get a distribution deal for the new edition and was able to get the book in several comic shops and bookstores.\nThe color edition eventually sold out and in my desire to keep the story available for readers, I included the original black and white version of the book in PARABLES: AN ANTHOLOGY, a compilation of the first four storybooks I self-published in 2004.\nREX TAKES FLIGHT\nBack in 2004, I was doing a signing at the Golden Apple Comics Booth at the Long Beach Wizard Con. Kazu Kibuishi (Amulet, Daisy Kutter) came to my table and showed me a binder containing the artwork for a comic anthology he was putting together called, FLIGHT. I was very impressed with it. Kazu was familiar with my work and hoped I'd be a part of future volumes, so when I suggested using my REX character, he was very receptive. One of Kazu's goals with Flight was to help artists build their own graphic novels in manageable chunks. Not sure if anyone else took advantage of that, but I, for one, saw a golden opportunity.\nWhen I did the first 17 pages for FLIGHT vol. 2, I had no idea where the overall story would take me. By the time FLIGHT vol. 3 rolled in, I had figured out the overall outline with its main themes and concepts. Within that framework, I kept improvising and coming up with new ideas as I went along.  From 2005 to 2010, I did a new chapter every year and progressively built the story over six volumes of FLIGHT.\nTHE SAGA OF REX was very loosely thumbnailed, and in some cases I didn't even thumbnail at all. I'd go straight ahead with cleaned up and colored pages without knowing exactly what the next page would be like. This method of working would be impossible in mainstream comics, but for a project like REX, being serialized in FLIGHT, it worked well. I found that it kept me constantly on my toes creatively and allowed new ideas to sneak in and surprise me. It made the whole process fun, unexpected and never boring.\nOnce the story was completed, I repackaged the whole thing, added a few pages and sent a mock-up to Image Comics, to see if they would be interested in publishing the graphic novel. I was delighted to get a very enthusiastic response from Image Comics' publisher, Eric Stephenson, and the book was quickly added to their pipeline. The complete SAGA OF REX was published by Image Comics in the fall of 2010.\nREWARDS\nThe rewards will allow you to dig deeper into my universe of strange beings, otherwordly concepts and offbeat storytelling. All my personal art is linked in some manner, and THE SAGA OF REX is very much part of this universe I've been developing over the years.\nEven though, the approximate shipping date for the rewards is listed as October 2013, most items will actually start shipping early in 2013. October 2013 is when I anticipate delivering the downloadable file of the film. The production blog will also become accessible as soon I start working on the film.\nTHE SECRET PRODUCTION BLOG: To share the experience of making the film with the people who back this project, I will create a secret, password protected blog that will document the whole process\u2014elation and frustration, happiness and trauma\u2014I\u2019ll share everything, the art, the tests, the animation\u2014every step of the way.

Hi-jinkery and thrills ensue with a twist on the truth about spoons. CLARENCE AND THE SPOON is a kid's picture book about manners, mayhem and magic, written and illustrated by Jeff Nitzberg.\nClarence and The Spoon is already 100% written and illustrated, and my goal is to use Kickstarter to self-publish and produce a finished beautiful 37 page, color, hardcover book.\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY:\nLEFT: 2005. One year in. RIGHT: 2011. Six years later, the book is finished.\nEight years ago I began Clarence and The Spoon as a side project. It was a simple story about a rebellious but intelligent kid, Clarence, who refuses to use his spoon to eat his soup.\nClarence's mother politely tells him to pick up his spoon.\nAs the story grew, I wanted Clarence to be all of the things I loved as a kid: part Ren and Stimpy, part Calvin and Hobbes, part Mad Magazine. Most importantly, I wanted it to be a kid's book that wasn't watered down for kids. There was nothing I loved more as kid than when the strange fused with the sophisticated, and the artistic assimilated the absurd.\nClarence grew into a passion project, a sort of Frog Prince tale, but instead of a frog there was a spoon, and instead of a prince, there was a fantastic magician's assistant.\nThe moral became more about the underlying magic in things than it did about table manners. It became a story for kids who like the strange, the silly, the fantastic.\nAbove: Clarence calmly explains he prefers hands over spoons.\nAbove: The spoon springs to life to defend its own use. Clarence's mother, panicked by the sight of a talking spoon, leaps into the food pantry.\nAbove & Below: By the end, Clarence learns that there is magic to be found in things as simple as a spoon, and he sallies forth with a renewed sense of adventure.\nI worked for so long on this book, it became a journey into madness. In the end it topped 37 pages, and each page is a lush painting, packed with humor and vocabulary-expanding text, best read aloud and bombastically. The imagery will demand a deeper look, with kids discovering hidden details upon each new reading. And now with your help, we can publish Clarence!\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nThe nutshell of Kickstarter is all or nothing. If I reach my funding goal through your generous donations on or before the 24th of Nov, 2012, then Clarence becomes a real book. If the funding goal isn't reached, then your money never leaves the bank and Clarence will sadly sulk into his soup bowl, spoonless.\nIf by some strange miracle I can raise more than $6,000 then I can do even more with Clarence... print more books, or expand rewards for backers. Have an idea? Let me know!\nREWARDS:\nAs a basic reward for your donation, you are essentially pre-ordering Clarence in either e-book or hardcover formats.\nHigher reward levels include some or all of the following:\nNOTE: Please add $10 for international shipping for reward levels 1 through 8 below. Thanks!\n1) Signed Copy Of The Hardcover Book ($35)\n2A) Includes Two (2) Signed Copies of The Hardcover Book ($50) (THIS IS A NEW REWARD ADDED 10/28/2012!)\n2B) Special Thanks With Doodle ($50) (NOTE: This and all pledges of higher value unless otherwise noted include ONE Copy of the Hardcover Book). This Special Thanks section will be featured in the back of both the printed hardcover and e-book editions. \nThis Special Thanks Level will also include a Personalized Thanks With A Doodle drawn into right into the title page of your copy of the book.\n3) Clarence and The Sketches: The Making of Clarence and The Spoon E-Book ($65)\nThis is a 55 page look into the creation of Clarence and The Spoon! Clarence was painted digitally. Want to know the process? The trials and tribulations along the way? Learn from my mistakes! There were many. This book begins with all 37 pages of Clarence in sketch form, followed by alternate unused pages, drawings, and concept art.\nThere is also a \"making of\" section where I talk about the process from start to finish, including tips and tricks on digital painting I learned along the way.\nThis \"making of\" will expand on the Clarence Blog, and is great for artists, aspiring book creators, or anyone interested in more Clarence.\n4) A Limited Edition Print ($75) of the artwork from any single page or spread from the book (your choice), signed and numbered by myself. These will ONLY ever be available through this Kickstarter campaign and they will be limited to the number of rewards filled.\n5) Softcover Clarence and The Sketches: The Making of Clarence and The Spoon ($100) With enough money I can do a small run of 8x10\" printed softcover copies of this book. Own a physical copy for art-making inspiration!\n6) LIMITED EDITION HARDCOVER Clarence and The Sketches: The Making of Clarence and The Spoon ($150) With an even higher donation I will do a limited edition 8x10\" hardcover printing of this behind-the-scenes book. This edition will only be available through this Kickstarter and will be individually numbered as such. Once they are gone they are gone.\n7) AN 8x10\" PORTRAIT PAINTING ($250) will be made by me, of you, or a loved one of your choosing. You provide the photograph and specification of costume or scenario, and I will create a gorgeous full color portrait painting (using digital paint), signed and delivered, as a quality, one-of-a-kind 8x10\" print. Note: gold frame is not included as part of the drawing unless specified by the backer.\n8) I WILL PAINT YOUR PORTRAIT INTO CLARENCE AND THE SPOON ($1,000) If you are able to fund this much, your name, title, and custom portrait painting will be featured in the Special Thanks section of the Hardcover and E-book. There will also be room for a short blurb about yourself where you can promote yourself as a superhero, shoe salesman, good Samaritan or whatever you wish. This blurb must be kid friendly, concise, and is subject to my final editorial approval. Examples are illustrated below:\n9) BOOK DEDICATION ($6,000). If you are somehow fortunate enough to have both a large heart AND large pockets and believe in this project enough to want to make it into a reality, then I will dedicate this book to you. This dedication will be at the beginning of the Hardcover and E-book, immediately following the cover page like so:\n10) I REALLY LIKE YOUR BOOK... BUT I HAVE NO MONEY.\nThat's okay! I don't have a lot of money either! That's why I'm doing this Kickstarter. If you like Clarence but can't afford to donate, you can do something equally as great, spread the word! Tell family, friends, co-workers and send them a link. You can even tell your dog or cat. I won't judge you.\nMy goal has always been to get this book out there as much as possible, so spreading the word is huge!\nWHY KICKSTARTER? WHY DID THIS TAKE EIGHT YEARS TO MAKE? WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT!?? HOW CAN I FIND OUT MORE!!?!??\nThanks for your interest!

Ever since the traumatic experience, Peter hasn't uttered a single word, making it difficult for anyone to make a social connection with him. Add that to the fact that Rachel has been absent from his life since he was a baby, and it goes without saying that the two don't exactly bond well.\nIn order to avoid the school bullies, Peter decides to walk home from school each day, finding a shortcut by cutting through the forest. While there, Peter encounters a massive tree giant, and the two of them form a very special friendship.\nThis heartwarming tale is one that we would love to share with as many people as possible. It is a story that shows the priceless value of friendship, and also reminds us that no matter how busy our lives may get, we should always remember to make time for the ones we love. We know that it has the potential to touch many lives\nWhere We Are Now\nCurrently, the film is in pre-production. The script and storyboard are finished and the shooting schedule is being written up. Most of the locations for the film have been already found, and we hold auditions for casting on October 27th. \nfilming will take place in Hawai'i from mid-November through till the end of February, then post-production is anticipated to take place from March until May/June. We already have our composer, Daniel Bayot, working on some of the sounds and tone we want for the film.\nWhere Your Money Goes\nAll the money we raise through kickstarter will go towards allowing us to get the right locations for some scenes, as well as taking care of our actors. However, most of the money will be going towards the construction of the giant.\nWe have Vanesa Furnari on our team as the scenic artist and prosthetic designer. Previously she has worked on many projects such as set design for Nicki Minaj \"Starships\" music video, and constructing the dinosaur eggs for \"Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\". She has also worked on the Disney Aulani resort at Ko'olina on Oahu, Hawai'i, by creating very realistic tree trunks, logs, and stones for the hotel.\nThe giant will be a man in a suit filmed against a green screen, and then later composited into scenes in the film. We want the giant and film to have the same feeling as the beasts in Spike Jonze's \"Where the Wild Things Are\". In order to pull this off, we need to be able to get the right materials to make the giant look as realistic as possible.\nFor your very generous contributions, we will be giving away some very exciting perks such as copies of the DVD, exclusive T-shirts, as well as props from the film!\nPeter's polaroid camera which belonged to his father plays a major role in the film. Everywhere he goes, Peter takes pictures, and keeps some of his favorites stored safely in an album which also belonged to his father. He also keeps polaroids hanging around all over his room. Each backer who donates $50 or more to the project will get one of the polaroid pictures from the film! (as well as everything else mentioned)\nWe Really Need Your Help\nBy contributing to the making of our film, you will become a part of the \"Peter and the Colossus\" family. We will be sure to follow through with regular updates so you can be a part of this exciting new journey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe largest and main challenge for us with this film is creating the giant and making him as realistic as we can. We have been working on some test shots to see if we can pull off this effect, and so far have been pleased with the results. Also, with this being the first feature-length film fron iNtertainment studios, we will have to work as hard as we can in order to film everything and make every shot perfect. We plan to shoot the main bulk of the film from mid-November through to mid-January, and then spend the rest of January and all of February filming the scenes of the giant against the bluescreen. This way, we can view the footage already taken, and film the giant in the closest way possible (i.e. lighting, angle, etc.) so that we can really make it seem like he's in the scene with the characters. \n\nOther than that right now the other challenge we are facing is making sure we can find the right actor to play Peter, which is quite an emotionally demanding role even though he has nearly no speaking lines in the film at all.\n\nAs stated before, we have around 3-4 months to finish all the filming for this, so we are on a tight schedule, which will demand a lot of stamina from our film crew.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "51 backers pledged $8,076"}, {"Project launches": "OCTOBER 3, 2012"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1389646012/peter-and-the-colossus", "project_name": "Peter and the Colossus"}}, {"backer": "Mike Kunkel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A mock up of a number card.

During the game you will have a character, a deck, and a discard pile. \nWhy Throwdown?\nThere are a lot of games out there and they all tend to have a lot of rules. Gameplay is fast and easy. You don't have to be a lawyer to understand what to do on your or your opponents turn. You can spend more time just playing and having fun rather than having petty arguments--games people-- we are playing games, so lets have fun...\nHow Do You Play?\nFirst you need at least 2 or more people to play and each person will need to have their own character card and deck, (the deck contains only 50 cards and is full of attacks, equipment, and modifiers) . \nThe objective of the game is to attack your opponents deck. You do this with your character card and cards you draw from your deck. You win when their deck is completely depleted. No matter how many people play you will always attack the person to your left, so until you get down to two players you cannot attack the person that attacked you.\nSetting up to play is easy just place your character card next to your deck and your discard pile will go on the other side of your character. \nFlip a coin to see who goes first, then follow 3 easy steps.\nSTEP 1 DRAW - On your turn DRAW a card from your deck and place it in front of your character card. \nSTEP 2 ATTACK - Your character must ATTACK on your turn and will automatically defend your deck on your opponents turn. Total and resolve conflict damage. Follow any additional rules on the card. \nSTEP 3 DISCARD - Now discard the card in play and put it into your discard pile, it is now your opponents turn and they follow the 3 easy steps.\nWhat do you get in a deck?\nEach regular deck comes with the following:\n1 Character Card (That can equip up to 3 items)\n15 Character Modifier Cards (5 Armor Cards, 5 Weapon Cards, 5 Disarm Character Cards)\n10 Dec Modifier Cards (5 Regeneration Cards, 5 Devastation Cards)\n5 Traps and Mishaps Cards (Thwart opponents attacks)\n5 Signature Attack Cards\n15 Attack Cards\nSome Backers will receive BONUS CARDS that you cannot get in the regular decks for pledging at certain levels.\n!!!Special Character Kickstarter Exclusive Cards packed with certain decks will allow characters to equip up to 4 items!!!\nWhy do we need your help?\nWell I need your help in a few different ways. First I need your money. Without your help, I don't have the means to make the game affordable for most people. With your help I can order a sufficient amount of cards that would make it easier for everyone to purchase their own set if we destroy our goal and increase orders I can actually give more rewards out to our contributors. Second I need your friends--help us spread the word, let all of your friends know about out project, tell them to get their own decks, after all, this game is way more fun with lots of people playing--and to be honest we need their money to make the game also.\nWhere the money goes?\nAll the money initially goes directly to having these decks printed and delivered, as well as some of the art that still needs to be created for the cards.  We need your backing to get them produced and make THROWDOWN! a reality. As we pass our initial goal we will unlock more rewards.\nShipping Time \nAll our rewards are listed to be sent/received in November. This is just a fail safe. We actually intend to ship them out as early as possible.

We would put nouns, verbs, and adjectives in a hat and on one occasion we had the fortuitous combination of ROBOT COWBOY SAMURAI coming up.

We would absolutely love your support in helping bring our latest passion project to life: a captivating storybook app featuring charming artwork by some of the animation industry\u2019s top artists, and narration performed by none other than Jim Dale, of Harry Potter audio book fame!  \nHere's an early proof of concept of three \"Beastly\" scenes which give an idea of how the final piece will look.  The small arrow you'll see represents your finger on the touch-based screen:\nTHE STORY BEHIND \u201cMY BEASTLY ABC\u2019S\u201d:\nA boy\u2019s dreaded daily routine spins toward the unexpected when, one morning, he rises from the \"wrong\" side of his bed.  Over the course of the day, he finds himself confronted by fascinating mythical creatures from every corner of the world.  As his adventure progresses, he begins to feel more at ease and befriends the creatures he encounters.  By day\u2019s end, the boy returns to bed with a refreshing new attitude \u2013 and he now looks forward to experiencing whatever new adventures the next day may bring.\nHere is actor Jim Dale recording \"My Beastly ABC's\" at Little Airplane Productions in New York:\n\u201cMy Beastly ABC\u2019s\u201d will be comprised of 37 separate colorful \u201cscenes\u201d bursting with comedy and whimsy.  To further enhance the user experience, the visually stunning artwork will be created at the latest high resolution standard of 2048\u201d X 1536.\u201d  The story is reminiscent of classic rhyming storybooks, with an added element of surprise brought about by the interactivity, movement, and sounds not possible with the ordinary book experience. \nFEATURES:\nINTERACTIVITY:\nTouching the characters within the scenes will cause them to move, react, or make funny sounds in unexpected ways.  For example, one creature may be tickled, while another can be manipulated to dance on the page.  Some will be able to follow the viewer\u2019s finger across the scene, while others will have added gaming elements to them.\nSCENE NAVIGATION:\nGraphic arrows will allow a viewer to easily move among the scenes.  A Chapter Menu index will also pull up images to allow for a quick jump to favorite moments.\nSOUND: \nViewers will have the option to either have the story read to them automatically (did we mention Jim Dale is our narrator?), or for them to read the story themselves.  Music/Sound Effects can also easily be switched on and off (a very popular restaurant feature)!\nEDUCATIONAL ELEMENTS:\nThis app will be as educational as it is fun.  Besides encouraging reading and the interest in different cultures, the story and interactivity also offers children a way to learn how to confront everyday apprehension and fears.  What better, more entertaining way to do that than with a bunch of colorful creatures!\nEXTRAS:\nA creature description index will allow the viewer to read further details about each beast \u2013 including fun facts about their country/ies of origin and folkloric information.\nABOUT DUNCAN STUDIO:\nDuncan Studio (www.duncanstudio.com)  is a full-service, creative animation house built on the idea that animation, as a storytelling tool, is truly limitless. Founded by world-renowned animator Ken Duncan, we have partnered with many major studios to produce projects of the highest quality using traditional (2D hand-drawn), computer animation, and stereoscopic (3D) formats.  We are now venturing toward a new exciting direction by creating our own interactive storybook iPhone/iPad app.  Employing our highly experienced staff, adventurous spirit and uncontainable passion, we are working hard to create something magical on this innovative platform that is sure to delight adults and children alike.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?:\nThis project is a true work of passion for us and, because it is 100% self-financed, we need your help to make it a reality!  Kickstarter offers a unique, personal way for us to directly reach fans of art and animation \u2013 that\u2019s where you come in!  Your support will ensure this interactive story is brought to life at the highest quality.

He\u2019s recently created some great physics and rig tools that will really help push the animation and interactivity of the project.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know Dylan, he is a man of many talents.  He helped build graphics and pipeline tools for major studios such as DreamWorks, Warner Brothers, and Disney (for which he actually won an Academy Award for his work on CAPS, the first computer animation production system for features). He has also written, produced, and directed several of his own short films. The most recent, \u201cChilly\u201d was just screened at the Seattle International Film Festival (fun bit of trivia \u2013 our Duncan Studio artists did the animated portions of the movie)!
