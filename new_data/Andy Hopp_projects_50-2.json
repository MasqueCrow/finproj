The players will both play\"Equipment\" cards that generate them gems on a turn to turn basis. These gems are stored in the Treasury Area and can be spent to play different types of cards. Most of these \"Equipment\" cards will have an alternate option that you may use instead of generating resources, for example drawing a card, or gaining a combat die. Which ensures that the players will have many tough choices to make on their warpath.\nNext I wanted to talk a bit about my experience playing war-games competitively as well as casually. I used to play Warhammer 40k competitively, and because of the imbalance of the system it made it mandatory to try to take only the best units. Because the disparity between them was so large, even if I loved a model, I couldn't still take it and have a chance to win.\n-Jared Barry"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "5 Reasons Why CLASH! Is Awesome", "update_content": " Hey again everyone, in this update I just wanted to touch on some of the best features of the game. Just to get as much knowledge and information out there as possible.\n1. Quick Setup: The game literally takes less then a minute to set up and get playing, making it perfect to pull out as an in between game between longer board games (I'm looking at you Twilight Imperium and Zombicide).\n2. Asymmetrical Gameplay: By making the victory conditions of both players different it allows two completely different experiences within the game. The strategy used to wreak havoc on the beautiful war torn location by the Herald of Fear is going to be entirely different then the strategy that the Champion of Hope may use to protect the location.
