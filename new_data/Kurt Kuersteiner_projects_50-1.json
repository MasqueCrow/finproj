[{"backer": "Kurt Kuersteiner", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Terror in the Toybox features six toy lines of the past that never were, created by six ground-breaking comic book creators, and published as trading cards and through a novella that reveals the full back-story of these toy lines.*\nWe address the \"Satanic Panic\" of the 1980s that \"revealed\" the evil and Satanic influences and power of toy lines like Masters of the Universe. The novella is the \"last writing\" of one Christian Goodfellow, who found that six children corrupted by old toys grew up to become the worst of the worst: comic book artists!*\n*Total work of horror satire by the way. Just go with it.\nThe trading card set and book reveal the creator-owned \"toys\" that led each of our six artists to a life of drawing sub-literate comic books. \nWho are the worst people in the world?\nComic book artists, that's who! This trading card set gives you their most depraved original visions as they create the toy lines that \"created\" them.\nIt all started in their childhoods, through toys that encouraged false idols in plastic form. Terror in the Toybox takes aim at the root of these depraved comic book \u201cartists\u201d by revealing the toys that turned them to their life of sin in both a trading card set and a revealing book.\nThe Trading Cards\nI reached out to six of my favorite creators who, I'm lucky to say, I can also consider friends. The challenge was to design the most subversive toy from their childhood, the one that led them to a life of comic book-ing!\nTerry Huddleston preaches the evil of comic books on the \"convention circuit,\" where converts and sycophants flock to meet their artist \"heroes\". It's like Black Mass for the hordes of frothing fanatics. Instead of a soapbox, Huddleston's podium is his booth of drawings that he sells on the unsuspecting converts. Major Damage is a corruption of the military, fusing it with the power of arcane musclemen,  and promising to do damage to your soul!\nReilly Brown took a depraved existence full of He-Man cartoons and brought his squandered talents to draw the sinful Deadpool for Marvel Comics. He created his own obscene avatar of online hatred called Outrage (with writer Fabian Nicieza, who has been corrupting the minds of comic book readers since the 1990s), where he preaches his absurd art. God did not mean for man to be cross-hatched!\nTim Seeley presents the Socialist Satanist Sorceresses, which explain how and why he's now managing editor of Heavy Metal Magazine, and writer of that obscene book Money Shot.\nDani Strips was turned to a life of fantasy and comic books with the Forever Pony, Brimstone, who requires children to sign a \"Forever Pledge\" of loyalty in red ink. It's part of what led her to draw subversive and dark horror comic books Coffin Bound and The Low, Low Woods.\nJeffrey Brown's moral decay started with G.O.A.T.s, the Guardians of Alternate Terra! These cloven-hooved goat people led Brown to talk about his checkered past through autobiographical \"graphic novels\" like Clumsy, or his ode to broken toy lines with The Incredible Change-Bots.\nPeter Bagge reared his demented head in the late 1970s in the alternative comix scene, working with purveyor of obscenity Robert Crumb on Weirdo. Bagge revealed elements of his troubled life through his too-long running comic book Hate! He has done so many more corrupting comics, and it all starts with his disgust with patriotic rodent Ratatat-Rat!\nThe Book\nAfter writing the character descriptions for the card, I realized there still needed to be more storytelling. Glutton for punishment that I am, I got to work on the tell-all book that documents the downfall of an anti-toy crusader, Christian Goodfellow, as he investigated the toys from the trading card pack.\nWhat you are about to read will undoubtedly shock you.\nThese are the works of advocate and decency activist Christian Goodfellow in his study of the arcane, insidious, and corrupting influence of children\u2019s toys that are tools of Satan, created and perpetrated by Godless factories of Paganism disguised as corporate toy companies. His early studies in the so-called \u201cSatanic Panic\u201d of the 1980s led him to ask one fateful--and fatal--question:\n\u201cWhat ever happened to those youths caught in the evil grasp of these toys of the past?\u201d\nThe answer is disturbing, to say the least.\nEvil toys of the past created a network of people so corrupted by them that they became the prophets of such horror. It became their job to perpetuate the vile gospel of these \u201cinnocent\u201d childrens\u2019 toys.\nThey became comic book artists, and the work they create right now conveys nothing less than sacrilege to warp the minds of today\u2019s youth.\nThis book is the final legacy of Christian Goodfellow.\nThe Heavy Metal level features all six cards reproduced on durable white metal. You can also, if you really need, individually order them as add-ons.\nNow, spread the word, and help us let the world know that true delinquency starts--in the Toybox!!!

With the Macarie, Stoinich, Bloody Subset, etc. in Wrapped and Sealed Packs. In other words... EVERYTHING! Oh... but WAIT... there's MORE! You get the limited edition Macarie METAL card, too!\n\n$95 PLEDGE LEVEL (\"What do you mean a $95 pledge level? At $68 I already got EVERYTHING!!! What's with this $95 level???\") ... At this level you get the $68 'stuff' MASTER SET. But because perhaps you want to leave your Master Set intact and STILL enjoy the cards, this level includes the MASTER SET 'APE ATTACK RACK PACK' plus the $38 'Deluxe Base Set' stuff ... AND ONE EXTRA SKETCH CARD!\n\n$100 PLEDGE LEVEL ... 'Dealer's BUNCH'. At $100 you get SIX of the tuck box base sets, 6 promos, and 6 of the lenticular motion cards. So at this level you get SIX TIMES the goodies listed in the $24 base set level.\n\n$125 PLEDGE LEVEL ... simple. This is the DOUBLE MASTER level. You get the $68 pledge level stuff... DOUBLED. So you can open one 'Ape Attack Rack Pack' and leave the other intact (and with a production of only 95 total 'Ape Attack Rack Packs', sealed ones are gonna be excruciatingly RARE). \n\nADD ONS:\nIf you want to ADD ON other pledge levels to whatever you're pledging on, you can ADD ON by simply pledging on whatever single level you want... then go to your finished pledge and, well, simply 'ADD' the other pledge level(s) amounts you want. For example, let's say you want the $68 'Ape Attack Rack Pack' MASTER SET ... but you also want some regular BASE SETS. Easy. Pledge on the $68 Master Set level, click to 'manage' your pledge, and just add $24 to your pledge for each additional base set you want. Or maybe you want several 'Deluxe' base set levels. Just pledge on ONE, click to manage your pledge, and add on the amount of however many OTHER 'Deluxe' base set deals you want. Want a CUSTOMIZED pledge? Well, just message me (not 'comment', I don't see 'comments'... but a MESSAGE) and we'll work it out. if all this seems as clear as something an ape might fling at you then just message me and I'll get back to you. \n\nSPECIAL ADD ONS: \n$35 UNCUT PUZZLE BACK PANELS, all 5 different 9 card PUZZLE BACK base set panels. Each panel has the entire 9 card puzzle and there are 5 different of them (hence, 45-card base set). Am going to try and get a photo of this posted soon.  \n\nOriginal Stoinich and Macarie art ... this is something I'm going to try and work out during the campaign. Will also see what the printing plate count is like and MAY provide some 'rainbow suite' printing plate sets, too. \n\nQuestions  and Answers:\nQ:  I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do  I go about it?  A:  Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter. If you are unable  to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no  worries.\n---------------\nQ:  When will the Psycho Ape Trading Card Series ship? A:  The current schedule and plan is to ship the end of May (perhaps end of April... but almost certainly by May). This series, though, is pretty complicated. Although the base sets, tuck boxes, lenticulars, bananas and mini rubber masks are all produced AND here the OTHER cards are going to be gang printed with Ultraman and Zorro Series Two (yes, that's coming!) which I hope to begin printing in March and April. But most of you know me pretty well by now that if I'm late for some reason getting shipping done I keep everyone informed and do my best to be on time. I'm good about  posting updates and communications so will keep everyone in the loop.  I do,  though, ask for patience in advance ... we ARE still in a pandemic and some productions are tricky to get done through printing companies. \n---------------------\nQ:  I'm OCD and want a box to keep sealed and a box to open. How do I back on two  base sets? Or two 'Master Sets'?  A:  If you want more than one pledge level just back the pledge level you want ...  then once you've pledged you can review your pledge and ADD to your pledge  amount. Be SURE to message me if adding on 'master set' stuff as that is limited to no more than 95 'Ape Attack Rack Packs'.   I'll check  and make sure it's done right and you'll be fine. The way I believe it's done is  after you pledge you click to view/manage your pledge and then you change the  amount of your pledge to reflect everything you want in your package. So, for  example, if you want to pledge on two master sets you just pledge on ONE. After  your pledge is entered you can click on view/manage your pledge and change the  amount of your pledge to reflect adding on additional goodies. And then MESSAGE me what you added on so I can keep an accurate record of what eventually goes into your pledge parcel when I start shipping.\n-----------------\nQ:  Why are you running this as a Kickstarter instead of selling at a comic shop or through a catalog? A:  This is my 25th (??!) Kickstarter over the last 5+ years. I've found that pre-selling a  card series on Kickstarter allows me to determine a proper production run of  cards and boxes (especially special production cards that are pricey to do ... such as metal cards). It also allows me to offer 'master sets' to collectors on a  limited basis. A Kickstarter also lets me get card series to serious  collectors FIRST before ANYONE else. Plus a Kickstarter allows me to exercise  some flexibility on providing 'stuff' for backers.\n-----------------------\nIf  you have a question not answered here please just ask -- you can message me  directly through Kickstarter and I will respond as quickly as possible. It is  better to message me than to post a comment. Kickstarter shows me MESSAGES as  soon as they are posted but is not consistent with showing me 'comments' or where those comments are made. Needle in a haystack. But a 'message'? Well that goes straight to the Kickstarter 'inbox' and ALL messages get seen easily and quickly.  If you can't figure out how to message on Kickstarter then just contact me through my RRParksCARDS.com website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks? Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. Otherwise, this is my 25th (perhaps more?) Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 5 years ... including eight different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, three Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, 3 Mystery Science Theater 3000 series, 'Series Four', Sharknado, The 100th Anniversary of Zorro, Oggy and the Cockroaches, Manos: The Hands of Fate, Old Man Like Ron, DOZENS of annual Halloween card series and others). You'll NEVER be left wondering \"what's going on\" because I post regular updates and keep in contact with EVERYONE. Please note: AFTER this Kickstarter ends and right before I start shipping I'm going to send out what's called a 'mailing address survey' ... be sure to fill that out and message it back to me when the time comes so there's no delays in mailing your package. Okay? Okay!. While there are always risks and challenges with production, logistics or even crossing the street I have years of experience publishing trading cards and conducting Kickstarter campaigns. So the risks and challenges are minimized.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "PROMO CARD", "descp": "$2 PLEDGE LEVEL ... will get you ONE regular promo card.

Frankenstein's Monster and Dracula. There will be equal amount of both wrappers in boxes.\nWe are also going to offer 2 types of hobby boxes.  1 with guaranteed Distressed set lurking inside and 1 with a full bleed guaranteed inside it.  2 different graphics for both boxes.  We will ask you after the kickstarter is over which box you would like.  \n\nNOTE:  The trading cards will have a United States release and be for sale on Amazon Prime and if enough people are interested, we will look at Amazon Canada as well. Walmart will also be carrying the cards online with 2 day shipping in the US.  We are exploring other outlets and will keep you posted.\n\nStretch goal update:  We hit $3,100 so a Rare Refractor card has been added to the series and everyone who pledged/pledges at least $30 will get the Refractor Card in their rewards!  \nWe hit $4,100 so everyone who pledges/pledged $99 or more gets a Sketch Card!  If you get a monster set, that means you get an extra one!\nWe hit $5,100 so a rare GOLD CARD has been added to the series.  Everyone who pledges/pledged $99 or more gets a rare GOLD CARD in their rewards.  \nWe hit our goal of $7,000 and now I am adding 2 new base cards and 2 new stickers to the series!\nWe hit our $9,000 stretch goal and added 2 more base cards and 2 more stickers and a Rare Refractor to the series.  The refractor will be included as a bonus for everyone who has pledged $30!   \n\nWhat is this project about?\nRemember the great non-sport trading cards from the 80s and late 70s?  They always had 7 cards, 1 sticker and a piece of gum.  This series is inspired by those cards and will have the same type of card stock on the base cards.  The same taste and smell in the bubble gum and the great joy of opening a pack.  After the kickstarter is over, the cards will be for sale on Amazon and Walmart and possibly other retail outlets.\nI have designed everything about the set myself from the packs to the box packaging as well as draw every card.  This is a labor of love and I wanted to make this set for my fans, classic Monsters fans, comic fans, and trading card fans.\nWho Am I?\nMy name is Mark Spears.  I am an artist with a career spanning over 20 years in the comics industry. I am a 3 time Rondo Hatton Horror Award nominee.  My past credits include Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Upper Deck Sports Cards, Image Comics, Warner Bros, Paramount, Rittenhouse, Corgi as well as many magazine covers and movie posters.\n\nThe Characters\nAll of the classic monsters are here that you know.  Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, The Bride of Frankenstein, Werewolf, The Mummy, The Phantom, Mr Hyde, The Blob, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Brides of Dracula, as well as some original 'monsters'.  72 pieces of artwork were created.  As well as some special art for some of the chase cards.   I may post a list of some of the characters but I don't want to give too much away just yet.\nThe series features 72  pieces of brand new fabulous monster art created by yours truly.  Each Hobby display box of cards will contain 20 packs.  Each pack will have 7 randomly inserted cards and 1 sticker card as well as bubble gum in a clear wrapper. Yes there will also be some puzzle cards  making a bigger picture with 9 cards.  I did not go with wax packs because the wax packs can be sealed again after opening them.  The card pack does have that throwback feel. The size of all the cards are standard 2.5\" x 3.5\".\nBesides character cards, there are also versus cards and group cards.\nMy goal is that once you hold these packs and cards in your hands you will feel like you have been transported back in time to your childhood.\nValue\nThese cards are high quality cards.  My cards could be printed at 24x36 inches and still look amazing because I draw them that big.  So scaled down they look even better.  Produced and made by the same manufacturers responsible for the cards you find at Walmart, Target and other retailers across the country.  This is a project I am using kickstarter to help with funding, not a kickstarter card series that is made just for kickstarter sales.  These cards will be on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting next spring.  If people love them, then I may do a series 2.  My plans are to do a comic book with these characters after the card series in sent to the printers.\nMy good friend\nScarah, the Damsel of the Doomed has joined me in offering some exclusive Kickstarter cards.  All her cards will be signed by her as well.  We would love to offer a wardrobe fabric card of Scarah, maybe as a stretch goal, we will see.\n If you would like all of Scarah's cards and want a different reward tier than the ones she is offered in, you can add $60 to that tier and let me know you want her full set.  Any questions please let me know.\n The Monster Set does come with an 11x17 art print signed.  (Forgot to mention that in the reward tiers but it comes with one)\n\nAlso Check out our two extra rewards featuring a full set plus you pick the characters on a versus card!  \n\nWant More?\nIf you see that you want two rewards, just add the other reward amount to what you are getting and let me know, I will make sure you get everything you want.\nIf you would like to add-on any Scarah Card to a reward, the price is $20\nIf you would like to add-on the 3D set with glasses, the price is $30\nAny other items, just let me know!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing in the trading industry for 14 years as well as professional artist for 22 years, I know what I'm getting myself into. My company Spears Art has become a brand of quality in fine art prints on Amazon and Walmart. I am funding the majority of the project myself but with this campaign, I am trying to make the series a little bigger.\n\nThe trading card series can be packaged and ready to go in 60 days of production time. I need 30 days prep time of getting all the sketch cards and remaining character artwork for the set and we are ready to go to the printers. We will make our release date goal or beat it.\n\nThanks!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "1 Pack Of Cards", "descp": "You Get 1 Pack Of Cards.

Sorry I have not updated in a few weeks, was sick but getting better.  Everything has been turned into the printers and are awaiting them to print them, package and send them to me.  The problem we had ran into first of May was that the colors looked to dark to me and we had to stop printing everything.  Then, even though it cost a lot to do, I decided to have everything printed as a hard proof and sent so I can inspect in hand.  This took much longer than expected and set us back.  Everything has been approved now.   So we are just weeks away.  1 week? 2 weeks? 3 weeks? I don't know.  I wish I had a definite date but the printers told me they can't give me an exact date but said all the card printing is scheduled.  After that though they do have to do the sorting, wrapping, etc.  I will keep you posted as soon as I hear any information though.  As for the cards, they look exactly how I wanted and I am very happy with how it all turned out.  I added a lot of stuff to the card set since the kickstarter and can't wait till you can all see everything.  (Ghoulish Golds, Classic Chromes, Horror Foils. etc) One thing I will let you know is there are secret cards in the series.  If you have the monster complete set, you will get them, don't worry.

I will send you some photos when I get them in.  We will be have a full page ad in Scream magazine starting in June.   You should grab a copy and check it out!  Once I am done with the hard proofs I will go down my backer list and write everyone to verify if I have everything listed you wanted in your order.

I have a few more sketch cards to finish up but the printers will be starting to print the other cards this week.  Besides the sketch cards, what has taken a little longer in the process is that I increased the base sets to 86 cards now.   Also the Classic Chromes are now at 93 cards.  Each Classic Chrome has silver ink on them as well, so they are a more premium card.  I went back and recolored each image to look its best in the glorious black and white.  They look amazing.  The Ghoulish Gold cards (gold stamped), the MonsterSpectrums (refractors) are all set to go to the printers this week as well.   I have made the base stickers die-cut so they would seem more retro.  As I was setting up the 3D cards over a month ago, I started getting really good at the technology.  In fact, after making them and showing them to some people, I have decided to include 4 3D cards in ever hobby box.  As for glasses, there will be a pair of 3D glasses included inside every hobby box as well.  Can't wait for you to see them.  The fronts and backs are in 3D.  For those who ordered the blaster boxes, besides one autograph card in every box, a Ghoulish Gold card will also be inside one of the 8 packs as well.  I will give you guys another update in a week.

The stickers will all feature new art (24 stickers in all) and then the cards will all have 74 pieces of art as well).  Last few days I have been working on the card backs and fronts getting them just the way I want.  The 'distressed' look will not interfere with the artwork and will just go a long the border for anyone who is curious about that.  After the final art piece is done, the next step will be finalizing all wrapper, card template designs, boxes, etc.  I am still hoping for late March release but it might be April depending on how the sketch cards work.  They will need to print them first before anything else, ship them to me, then I draw them all and ship them back for pack inserts.  So that might have a few hiccups in process but we will see.

First off, let me say thank you for checking this project out! It's my first Kickstarter and I'm excited to get this very strange card series produced! \nThis strange whacked out card series includes: 11 cards, foil parallels, sketch cards, original art cards, wrappers, and original production art.\n\nA little bit about me.... I've been collecting cards since I was a kid, and have been making one-of-a-kind collage art cards for about 6 years now. This is my first mass produced card set based on my work (Mike, who you'll meet further down, as well as Richard Parks talked me into it!).  I've made collage cards for both Richard Parks (Psycho Ape and MST3K) as well as Richard Fowlks (Drive In Double Feature Series 1) card sets.\nI'm an administrator at the FB page the Card-Board, and have my own FB art page Strange Cobwebs the Art of Jeff Trax (if you'd like to check out all the other kinds of collage cards I've done over the years....there's a lot!)\n\nI'm working on this project with Mike Gallegos Jr, an artist I met through the Card-Board earlier this year. He is a freelance artist from San Antonio TX, who has experience creating his own card set (the self produced Trash Bin Weirdos). He creates different pieces using pencils, inks, and colored permanent markers. His works include everyday objects and film characters.\n Mike designed the KS exclusive card, the backs of all the cards, and the 2 wrappers, .... more on that below.\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump in!\nThis set was created while I was listening to the music of Skinny Puppy, and if you are a fan of them then you'll see the influence! And if you are a fan of early Ministry you'll know that Everyday is Halloween, so these cards will fit right in to any horror card collection anytime of the year!\n\nThis set is called Creeped Out Collages (series 1....We've had so much fun making this series....Series 2 is already in the works!!!!): The Family of Fear. \n Each collage is a member of a Family of Nightmare proportions!! Each card has the character's name and an odd bio on the back of the card. \nIn ADDITION to the base set we have a BRILLIANT, SHINY foil parallel set!\n\nMike is doing 30 sketch cards and I'm making 30 collage cards. Each Master Set will get one of each! And the Master Set is limited to a production run of 30.\n\n\nHere's some examples of Mike's sketch cards.\n\nThe 1/1 collage cards I'm making FOR MASTER SET BACKERS will fit in directly with the set(s) you're buying but will be new characters in the family (There will be space on the back of the card for you to name the character!!)\nHere's two examples of my 1/1 collage cards:\nIncluded with ALL ORDERS will be this Kickstarter Exclusive Backer card. After this campaign this card will NO LONGER be available.\nIncluded with ALL MASTER SETS is this KS Exclusive Master Set Backer card. After the KS campaign is over this card will no longer be available!\nMike designed two color variations of this wrapper: wrappers are part of the MASTER SET, and ONLY AVAILABLE at the MASTER SET LEVEL...here's one of them. \nSo, Lets look at what you get at each Pledge Level!\nWHEN YOU VERIFY YOUR PLEDGE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION....WE HAVE SOME EXCLUSIVE ART ADD-ONS!!!!!\n\nMeet The Family: The Basic Level  (limited to 20 sets) \n$15 gets you:\n1 Basic set of 11 cards \n1 KS exclusive backer card (designed by Mike)\n1 Series 2 Promo card (designed by me)\n\nThe Engagement Party: Level 2 (limited to 20 sets) \n$25 gets you:\n1 Basic set of 11 cards\n1 Foil Parallel set of 11 cards\n1 KS exclusive backer card (designed by Mike)\n1 Series 2 Promo card (designed by Me)\n\nMarried to the Family: Master Set  (limited to 30 sets)\n$48 gets you:\n1 Basic set of 11 cards in the Kickstarter exclusive green wrapper\n1 Foil Parallel set of 11 cards in the Kickstarter exclusive blue wrapper\n1 sketch card by Mike\n1 1/1 collage card by Me\n1 KS exclusive backer card (designed by Mike)\n1 KS exclusive Master backer card (designed by me)\n1 Series 2 Promo Card (designed by me)\n1 \"eye-popping\" surprise card\n(The sketch card and 1/1 collage card pictured in the lower right corner below are samples of what are included in the Master Set Level)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is our first Kickstarter, Mike and I have both produced and sold our own 1/1 cards, sketch cards, and cards sets. \n\nOnce the Kickstarter is over and we have the funds, we will send everything to the printing company.

This KS will be ending during the holiday rush, so I will be mailing packages after Christmas to ensure speedy delivery. \nEvery sketch card and 1/1 collage card will be done before the KS is over! All we'll need to do is print off the amount of cards/wrappers that were pledged for in the campaign!

In an industry dominated by a handful of large publishers, many of the independent trading card companies have come together in a collaborative fashion.  Instead of fighting over customers or hoarding secrets, these firms have been working together for years.  Now, we are taking the next logical step...a joint publication based on one of the most revered horror films in history.\nRRParks, RJF Image/Design, and Attic Cards Present....Nosferatu!\nNearly 100 years ago, F.W. Murnau released his epic masterpiece, Nosfertu.  Initially ordered to be destroyed, a few copies were salvaged and the film was released seven years later in the United States to great acclaim.  Based on Bram Stoker's Dracula, the film follows the exploits of Thomas Hutter who is assigned to assist Count Orlok in the purchase a new home.  This simple task is far more than it seems when Hutter discovers that the Count is no mere mortal.\nEven those who haven't seen the film are familiar with this iconic scene.\nThe film contains numerous iconic scenes, but none match the sheer terror conveyed in Count Orlok's ascent up the stairs.\nBase Set of 27 Cards including Anaglyph 3D!\nThe base set for Nosferatu is made up of 27 cards among 3 subsets.  The first 9 cards feature amazing 3D conversions by the one and only Christian LeBlanc.  Christian has lent his talents to numerous sets released by this trio of publishers including Mystery Science Theater 3000, Manos, Florida Man, Little Shop of Horrors, and countless others.  Collectors are in for a treat with this release as Christian has gone all-out with some of the most incredible 3D images we've seen. \nThe 3D subset will have 9 different cards ... two of which are shown here. Designs by Christian LeBlanc\nOf course, a pair of 3D glasses is included with each set.\nFollowing the 3D subset comes the Story Cards, featuring images from the film in chronological order following the narrative of Nosferatu.  The obverse of each card contains a retelling of the story formatted to follow the classic Text Frames from the silent film era. \nNine different story base cards will tell the nightmarish story of Nosferatu\nThe final subset contains promo cards that will be given away in other products produced by RJF, RRParks, and Attic Cards, as well as by the artists who created the amazing art.  These promo cards will contain exclusive art created for the Nosferatu set.  But collectors, fear not!  Those backing at the Master Set level will be provided a complete 9 card set in their package with no additional purchase required!\nSketch Cards\nBackers from previous sets know that sketch cards are something that RJF, Attic and RRParks take very seriously.  Quality sketch cards may come from the talented artists on board this project, but they start with quality materials.  You won't find low-end stock here.  As with our prior products we have enlisted Karen \"Wonder Woman\" Cowan from ICONIX to manufacture the triple-layer, black-core, 35pt sketch card blanks that collectors have come to love, and artists have come to depend on.\n\nChase Cards o' Plenty ...\nBecause this card series represents the 100th Anniversary of this classic horror movie we've got a LOT of REALLY fun specialty cards ... starting with:\nFull Motion Lenticular Cards\nCount Orlock rises from his coffin ... Count Orlock creeps up the stairs! These two iconic scenes are brought to life in these two FULL MOTION lenticular trading cards! \nThese are the two FULL MOTION Lenticular cards for this series ... already designed, produced, and here -- ready to include in card sets!\nFine Art Limited Edition Genuine Etching Cards\nWhat a fitting tribute to this classic anniversary card series -- FOUR different genuine, limited edition signed and numbered FINE ART etching cards, produced in much the same way as Rembrandt Van Rijn produced etchings in the 16th Century. Each one hand inked and crafted. \nFour different fine art, limited edition and numbered Nosferatu Etching cards with art by Michael Mastermaker and plating by RRParks\nGenuine Film Cell Relic Cards\nWe can all watch Nosferatu on DVD ... but how about OWNING actual frames of the vintage film itself? FOUR different cell cards to collect -- each containing a genuine 16mm film strip from the movie PLUS a special tri-publisher cell. TWO cells inserts in EACH card.  \nImage shows ONE of the Four Different cell cards to collect.\n Special Packaging: BOX and 4-BOX CASE\nA complete set of all 9 story base cards, 9 art cards, 9 3D cards ... 1 lenticular card, 1 cell card, 1 etching card and 1 SKETCH CARD comes in a specially designed tuck-style box. Plus a pair of 3D glasses. All this for $34. Also available is a 4-box CASE which will include 4 of these tuck-style boxes and a case is guaranteed to contain BOTH of the lenticular motion cards, ALL 4 etching cards, ALL 4 cell cards and 4 sketch cards (by 4 different artists). And a full 4-box case also includes a special printing plate box topper PLUS 4 3D glasses and MORE surprises! A case of 4 boxes with all the special box toppers is $120. ALL orders will also receive the Nosferatu NSU 30th Anniversary Promo Card! \nThe four boxes and the CASE are currently being designed.

Or several of the same pledge level? Just let us know and we'll walk through how to pledge for exactly what you want. NOTE: 'Message' means message ... posting a 'comment' instead of a 'message' may go unseen. So be sure to use the message feature. All 3 of us publishers are also on Facebook so you can message us there, too, if you aren't able to do a message through Kickstarter. \nThe plan is to ship this card series by Christmas 2020. \nFAQ\n\"If I want to pledge on TWO base sets how can I do that?\"\nSimple. Pledge on ONE base set. Once you've pledged, just go to view/manage your pledge and change your pledge amount to reflect TWO base sets. Meaning you'll find your pledge for $34 for one base set ... simply change that amount to $68 (2 x $34) and then message us that your $68 pledge is for TWO base sets.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe three publishers have combined for over 100 trading card set releases and more than 35 Kickstarters, all successfully fulfilled.

And WELCOME BACK! To THIS ... our SEVENTH annual HALLOWEEN TRADING CARD EVENT! \nHAPPY HALLOWEEN from RRParks CARDS! We're wrapping up our seventh year as a trading card company as well as our seventh Halloween as a publisher. Every October we publish some fun spoooooky and creepy horror and monster card sets ... and THIS is our BIGGEST HALLOWEEN EVENT EVER!  Your pledge on this project helps with production costs and will make sure you get ALL the CARD SERIES as well as exclusives.\nWe are DETERMINED to get this years' RRParksCARDS Halloween Trading Cards to you BY HALLOWEEN! We might not be able to go out trick or treating ... might not be able to have a Halloween party ... but by golly I want everyone to be able to enjoy the holiday and so the scar-r-r-r-ry LOGISTICS for getting these cards to everyone by Halloween were started MONTHS ago in preparation.  Some of the cards of this Halloween have already been printed and here already... others have just been sent to printing ... and some I have to have produced when the Kickstarter ends (such as the limited edition METAL cards which have production numbers determined by the number of backers ... making such cards VERY rare and NEVER to be reprinted).\nSeptember 13th ADDED BONUS! See bottom of this description ...\nNote: The $92 master set level is SOLD OUT ... Some $85 master set levels are still available. If you want the binder insert kit added you can pledge on the $85 level and then click to view/manage your pledge and add on the $7 needed to include the binder insert kit (why $7? That's the cost of postage and packaging materials to send the binder insert kit in it's own package). If you have any questions just message me. \nSo, what card series are happening this year?\nHalloween Trick or Treat Series EIGHT!\nHalloween Trick or Treat Series EIGHT features 9 different cards of SPOOOOOKY vintage Halloween masterpieces (18 wonderful images) on glossy cards RETRO-STALGIC stock with black borders. All housed in a wrapper.\nMonster Choke 'n Gag Series SEVEN!\nContinuing the Monster Choke 'n Gag Series Seven -- which was the first card series I published under my then-new company RRParks CARDS -- comes series SEVEN. 24 different 1960s style midgee and triplix panel cards. This time the focus is on MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE (featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000) with dozens of 'riffed scenes' including a checklist back card. All in their own wrapper.\nQuatermass and the Pit SERIES THREE!\nThis annual card series chronicles the classic BBC TV series Quatermass and the Pit. And this is the THIRD installment (What? You missed the first two installments? Well worry not -- at the end of this description you'll see ADD ON options to catch up!) Perhaps you've never heard of Quatermas and the Pit... but you HAVE heard of the movie FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH. Well, almost 10 years before that classic Hammer film was released, the BBC did a 6-hour, 6-part miniseries called Quatermass and the Pit. It is one of my all time favorite science fiction / horror movies and I'm continuing the series started last year ... this is series two and features the 2nd episode of the BBC production. When construction workers begin work on a new housing development they discover strange fossil skulls ... a paleontologist gets wind of the find and with the assistance of Professor Quatermass and the professor's nemesis, Colonel Breen, the 3 set out to investigate the strange fossils in the pit. And it is quickly determined that they, and the strange cylinder found with them, are not what they seem. Stay tuned -- Halloween 2021 will have Quatermass and the Pit series four!\nHorror Monsters Series THREE!\nHere's something I've ALWAYS wanted to see since I started collecting monster and horror trading cards ... the THIRD series of the 1960s classic card series from Nu Cards: HORROR MONSTERS! This series of cards features the CONTINUATION of the GREEN and ORANGE border series of the 1960s... Goofy gags and jokes with a duo-tint front and classic retro-stalgic style stock. And when you get the cards look closely at the back graphics! The complete set of 21 cards come in a pack wrappered complete set. OH but WAIT! There's MORE! Some years ago I discovered that Horror Monsters Series One, in the 1960s, had also been issued as two-card panels, perforated in the middle and available in a cello pack. So to celebrate the return of this classic series ... after almost 60 years... This series is ALSO being released in a two-card panel version (10 panels = 20 cards PLUS a special 'slick' insert... and a 'cello' type package). And you get BOTH versions with a master set pledge.\nComic Book Advertising Card Series One!\nComic Book Advertising Card Series One. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, but when I was a kid in the late 1960s I marveled at the fantastical ADS in comic books ... Giant Monsters, Epic Plastic Army Men armies, Spaceships you could actually RIDE IN, Fish that could tell your FORTUNE, and perhaps the most MAGICAL of ALL: The X-Ray Spex. Relive those wonder years of being a kid where for $1 you could unlock all the mysteries and magic that hucksters were pedaling -- This trading card series of 18 retro-style cards features 36 of those classic ads! And what ABOUT those actual plastic soldiers, fortune telling fish, monsters that obey your commands, and X-Ray Spex that we marveled at but never sent in our $1 to get? Well ... keep reading ... your dreams will come true TODAY!\nScary Clowns Series 2 and 2 1/2\nA couple years ago I did a small little card series called Scary Clowns. Mini cards with nightmarish and disturbing clowns. Well, here's SERIES TWO! And because I'll be publishing a certain Mysterious, Scientific, Theatrical SERIES FOUR of something in a couple months we have a special Scary Clowns Series 2 1/2 ... with clowns familiar to MSTies! \nAttack of the GIANT LEECHES Trading Card Set!\nOne of my all time favorite 1950s B-Horror Monster movies is Attack of the Giant Leeches (sometimes called The Giant Leeches). It's cheesy, it's lurid, it's awful... and I LOVE it! MSTies are familiar with it ... and virtually ALL horror movie buffs have seen it. And now it's a full color retro style trading card series -- featuring the wonderful movie poster and one-sheet/lobby card art of that classic 1959 (almost 1960) movie. NINE cards ... and for master set backers a special promo card. \nThe OUIJA BOARD Card! ... that REALLY WORKS!\nThat's right gang! HOO HAH!  You will NOW own your very own Ouija Board ... that ACTUALLY WORKS! You can NOW communicate with the SPIRIT WORLD! Turn the card over, put your finger on the magic skull... ask your question ... and turn the card over to reveal an answer provided by a GHOST! Don't like the answer you get? Try it again and get a DIFFERENT ANSWER! OOOooOOooo SCARY! It's MAGIC! \nLimited Edition JACKALOPE ETCHING! \nDrawn and etched by RRParks (Hey! That's ME!) this miniature fine art etching is a limited production signed and numbered etching art print! The final edition number will be based on the number of backers. This genuine etching was drawn, plated, inked, and impressed by me using archival French Arches BUFF acid free stock and a Sturges \"O\" roller intaglio press and comes mounted to a signed COA (Certificate of Authenticity) and will be numbered once this Kickstarter is over. The final etching art card will be JUST like etchings created in the 16th century (and to the best of my knowledge I'm the ONLY trading card publisher that actually produces REAL etchings!).\nFINALLY! An OFFICIAL RRParksCARDS Halloween Binder Kit!\nAfter 7 Halloweens RRParksCARDS has published a LOT of Halloween Themed trading card series. Halloween Trick or Treat Series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and now 8 ... Monster Choke 'n Gag Series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and now 7 ... Scary Clowns Series 1 and now 2 and 2 1/2 ... The Dungeon of Doctor Dreck Series 1 and 2 ... Attack of the Giant Leeches mini set and House on Haunted Hill mini set ... Yoshitoshi Japanese Horror in 3D ... Chronicles of the Grim Reaper Series 1, 2 and 3 ... Gary Saves the Graveyard ... The Monster Times ... Duke's Comic Characters ... Lotte Monster Etchings ... Stooge Laffs and Stooges Halloween Spook-Tacular ... and more. Also RRParksCARDS' last series BEFORE we officially became RRParksCARDS: Hans Holbeins Dance of Death Etching Series. Well NOW you can put together a binder with OFFICIAL BINDER INSERTS and house your ENTIRE RRParksCARDS Halloween Sets in SCARY STYLE!  Includes a large insert panel for the cover PLUS a panel for the spine. \nThe Monster Times RACK PACK!\nThat's right! In celebration of our SEVENTH year we have a trip down memory lane with The Monster Times trading card packs in a 1960s style RACK PACK containing 3 10-card packs. These wrappers were actually produced about 7 years ago when I wasn't sure if The Monster Times was going to be released as a factory set box or as a retail pack. I had the official wrappers printed up -- two versions (green and yellow) -- and never used them. Until NOW! In this first ever The Monster Times Rack Pack.\nThe MST3K Rack Pack!\nWhen I was a kid I LOVED rack packs... those plastic or cellophane treasure troves that contained LOADS of cards or packs. So what better way to celebrate the upcoming SERIES FOUR ... what better way to celebrate the 1960s ... than with a SIX PACK Rack Pack of series 1, 2 and 3 MST3K cards. I field tested the 'rack pack' about a year ago with loose MST3K cards ... and NOW have the Rack Pack system figured out. RRParksCARDS Rack Packs come with an official header card. And this MST3K Rack Pack will come with a bonus SPECIAL card (like a lenticular or DIY blank or something else that's a 'chase' type card). \nExclusive Limited Edition METAL CARD!\nAt this time, the design of the Metal Card is still being worked out. Maybe it will be related to the upcoming Attic Cards - RJF Cards - RRParksCARDS production (yes, 3 different publishers all teaming up to publish a single card series) of NOSFERATU for Nosferatu's 100th Anniversary! This metal card will be available ONLY for backers of this Kickstarter and will be limited in number to fill orders. NO extras, no late-arrivals... available ONLY NOW!\nSpecial 1960s Style TOY SURPRISES!\nAs promised above ... we've got some REALLY cool vintage style toy surprises this year! A creepy 1960s 'style' jiggly finger puppet of a hideous beast! A spooooky realistic spider that obeys your commands (providing your command is to 'sit Spot, sit')... but then we've got for you an ACTUAL 1960s plastic soldier (two of them actually!) that are THE figures that were advertised in 1960s comics -- these were not easy or cheap to find and if you never coughed up a buck in the 1960s to order these guys, NOW you will KNOW what you missed out on (for either good or bad). But WAIT! How would you feel about getting a genuine FORTUNE TELLING FISH! Oh yes, that classic 'gimmick' novelty of decades gone by, this fish can tell your fortune (or at least how you feel). It's weird, it's odd, and it was NEVER worth what 1,000s of people paid in the 1960s! And now it is YOURS to CONTROL! And the holy grail of mail-away-weirdness ... you can NOW own a pair of GENUINE X-RAY SPEX! See through flesh, see through clothes, scare your friends, trample your enemies underfoot and usher in the end of days ... or at least see through flesh and clothes. Never sent away for a pair of X-Ray Spex when you were a kid? Well NOW you don't have to as this comes FREE with your master set!\nGenuine Printing Plates!\nEvery master set comes complete with a genuine printing plate used in the production of these trading cards. Each will have a certificate of authenticity on the back. EACH plate is UNIQUE and guaranteed genuine production-used for printing one of these cards in this, our SEVENTH annual Halloween Trading Cards project.  \nRARE and EXCLUSIVE PROMO CARDS available nowhere else!\nI don't have a photo to show you yet, but as Kickstarter backers on my Halloween campaigns already know, I produce exclusive promo cards for the annual event. Some are destined to be sent to The Wrapper and given our sparingly to resubscribers of that magazine ... while other promos will be available ONLY HERE and ONLY NOW! Planned are at LEAST 8 SUPER RARE promo cards ... a full set available ONLY here and now for master set backers. \nCREEPY CELL CARDS!\nFor Master Pledge levels backers ... CELL cards continued from last year -- you will get this year's INSTALLMENT of Cell Cards! \nPledge Levels:\n$3. For $3 you get TWO (random) of the rare Wrapper promo cards and my thanks for supporting this Halloween Kickstarter.\nBASIC SETS PLEDGE: At $35 you get ONE of each of the 2019's sets including Halloween Trick or Treat Series 8, Monster Choke 'n Gag Series 7, Quatermass and the Pit Series 3, Horror Monsters Series 3 pack set, Scary Clowns Series 2, Comic Book Advertising Series 1, and Attack of the Giant Leeches trading card set.

PLUS The weird creature finger puppet AND the realistic fake authentic imitation spider ... PLUS the Fortune Telling Fish ... PLUS 2 genuine 1960s plastic toy solider comic book ad toys ... PLUS the X-Ray Spex ... PLUS all of the special PROMO CARDS and some bonus promo cards, too. The MASTER SET has EVERYTHING!\nMASTER LEVEL plus BINDER INSERT KIT: $92. EVERYTHING in the above MASTER LEVEL but because the binder insert kit would have to mail separately (and it costs a bit to mail) if you want the binder insert kit, THIS level includes it and covers the US postage to mail it in a separate package.\n... and the next is THE ULTIMATE 'catch up' level:\nThe $280 ULTIMATE PLEDGE LEVEL:  This last one is to get you caught up on all the RRParksCARDS annual series. This one includes everything for the previous 6 years so you can CATCH UP: Monster Choke 'n Gag series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ... Halloween Trick or Treat series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 ... Scary Clowns series 1, 2, and 3 Quatermass and the Pit series 1 and 2, The Dungeon of Doctor Dreck series 1 and 2 (plus the mini sets of House on Haunted Hill and Attack of the Giant Leeches) ... plus The Most Irritating Man in the World pack set with bonus 'toilet targets' PLUS Gary Saves the Graveyard deluxe set with zombie head and all 8 autograph cards (the director plus 7 main actors), PLUS a loose set of all 50 The Monster Times cards, PLUS all 3 GitD cards (Gary Saves the Graveyard, Yoshitoshi, and Monster Choke n Gag Golem), PLUS Chronicles of the Grim Reaper Series 1, 2 and 3, Duke Comic Characters complete set, 'secret monster set' from a couple few years ago, Hans Holbein's The Grim Reaper complete set (the last card series I did before I became officially RRParksCARDS), PLUS the Three Stooges Halloween sets: Stooge Laffs (midgee panel set in wrappers) and the 1950s style Stooges Halloween 'continuation' series (in packs) PLUS the 6-card Three Stooges Monsters Glow in the Dark set. PLUS: Some cool extra goodies. IF you want this 'Ultimate Bundle' as WELL as this years' 2020 RRParksCARDS Master set pledge on the $75 master set and then ADD ON $280 for this Ultimate Bundle (Why? Because I have to keep careful tabs on the $75 Master Set level so I don't exceed 95 master sets). Expect a wonderous package of goofy, ghoulish trading cards. This is the 'BIG ONE'. And expect some really cool bonus collectibles in this one (they're a surprise! All treats -- No tricks!). PLUS THE BINDER INSERT KIT!\nIf you don't see the exact pledge level you'd like to back just message me and we'll piece one together for you.\n ADD ONS from 2013-2019 RRParksCARDS: \nThe printing plates, etching card, cell cards, metal card, and the 'toy goodies' in this years' MASTER SET level are available ONLY for Master Set backers. But if there are some card sets you'd like to ADD ON, just let me know. Card sets you can ADD ON include: Halloween Trick or Treat series 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 ... Monster Choke 'n Gag series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, and 7 ... The Grim Reaper series 1, 2 and 3 ... Yoshitoshi Japanese Horror in 3D ... Dungeon of Doctor Dreck series 1 and 2 ...

You can also add on for Basil Wolverton Barflize or Basil Wolverton 2: Wolverton's Women ...  I do my best to work things out with everyone and the only time I can't is when something is completely sold out OR when something was an exclusive for master set backers.  Message me about something you're seeking and if I still have it, you can 'add on' to your pledge at the original release price. If you're pledging on the MASTER SET and want to add on another MST3K Rack Pack, another Horror Monsters Series 3 panel set, another The Monster Times Rack Pack just let me know.  \nIF you want to ADD ON something and NOT pledge on this year's Halloween ... maybe you only need Halloween Trick or Treat Series 5... or some Grim Reaper sets ... something like that ... then simply pledge at the $3 level and MESSAGE me what you want to 'add on' and I can send you the amount to ADD to your $3 pledge to get the ADD ONs you want.\nNOTE: Very Important. As you can imagine, with Nosferatu coming up... and the Series Four (for MST3K fans) in November... AND ULTRAMAN towards the end of the year and some other early 2021 card series my time is gonna be strained. So as mentioned a couple years ago, 'Halloween' type sets (like those listed above) are ONLY available during September and October. If the various Halloween sets are NOT requested during September or October of this year then you'll have to wait until September/October of 2021 to get them. \n FREE BONUS CARD SET JUST ADDED (SEPTEMBER 13TH): \nAlthough I don't do 'stretch goals', this campaign has been doing so well with backers supportive of our seventh annual RRParksCARDS Halloween Kickstarter I've put together a BONUS set not originally planned. Celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the classic monster movie, THE GOLEM, here is a brand new 9 card set plus a special 10th Kickstarter backer card! Those who pledge at the Basic Set level or higher will get the bonus set and 10th card for FREE! Those who pledge at the Master Set level or higher will get the 9 card set, the special 10th Kickstarter backer card PLUS all 5 Der Golem promo cards! Those who pledge at the Master Set and Binder Insert Kit (or Master Set and add on the binder insert kit) will get the 9 card set, the special 10th Kickstarter backer card PLUS all 5 Der Golem promo cards PLUS a limited edition numbered uncut panel of the 10 Der Golem cards! If you've already pledged at the Basic Set or Master Set levels or higher you will get these free items AUTOMATICALLY -- no need to do anything, they are free and will be included with your other goodies. I'm creating this Der Golem set as a THANK YOU for your support.\nTwo of the 10 different DER GOLEM cards (fronts and backs of 2 of the cards shown... there are 10 total cards, all designed and going to the printing company TODAY)\n Frequently Asked Questions: \n\"What if I can't pledge directly on Kickstarter?\"\nIf you can't pledge on Kickstarter, just message me through Facebook or email me through my website at RRParksCARDS.com ... but any message or email MUST be received before the end of this Kickstarter (which is October 8th). RIGHT after this Kickstarter ends I'll be submitting the orders for Metal cards, Etching card COAs and assembling master sets. If you can't send a message or email before October 8th then there may be items you'll be unable to get.\n\"Why is postage outside the US so expensive?\"\nActually, quoted costs for international shipping are LESS than actual costs ... the reason the cost for mailing outside the US is so expensive is because you live FAR AWAY and the USPS are MEANIES! \n\"What if I would like to pledge on two Master Sets ... or some past year sets ... or want a customized pledge level?\"\nEasy -- just MESSAGE me through Kickstarter (that's \"MESSAGE\"... not \"COMMENT\". A comment is virtually invisible to Kickstarter hosts/creators ... but a MESSAGE is something I'll see) and we can figure out between us what you WANT and HOW to pledge it. \n\"What if I'm wanting to pledge on the Basic set ... or all of the Master Sets are gone ... but I still want the binder insert kit? How do I get that, too?\"\nBecause for binder insert kit is large it generally has to be mailed separately from the cards (a second parcel). So if you want to add on a binder insert kit you can simply click on your pledge to view/manage and ADD $7 to your pledge. This covers the postage and packaging materials for mailing the binder insert kit. The insert kit is basically FREE ... but I do need some money for US postage and the solid packaging materials. If you are outside the US message me first (as postage is higher going outside the US.\n\"What if I missed a couple years of RRParksCARDS Halloween Trick or Treat, Monster Choke 'n Gag, Grim Reaper, Quatermass and the Pit, etc.  -- how do I CATCH UP and add those sets to my pledge amount?\"\nEasy ... look above for the Jack O Lantern in the chef's hat and menu board. Next to him you'll see a list, with prices, for ALL past Halloween related sets. Figure out what sets you want, add up their costs, and just add that amount to your existing pledge. If you have ANY trouble doing this, just message me (MESSAGE ... not COMMENT... messages are something I can easily see and respond to but comments are largely invisible). If you can't figure out how to message me through Kickstarter you can also email me at RRParksCARDS@yahoo.com or message me through Facebook (I'm RRParks CARDS on Facebook). \n\"What if I don't know how to read?\"\nThen you won't be able to read my answer to that question.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 28th Kickstarter ... Everything always gets produced -- between my experience, trusted artists, an outstanding printing production broker I've always come through on everything (and mostly ON TIME, TOO!). And in the case of the Halloween sets above, virtually EVERYTHING is already printed/produced or already at the printers. By the time this Kickstarter ends only things that will remain to be produced are the Metal Cards and I will get right on those when I know how many backers there are at the Master and Deluxe Master levels (since they will be produced only to the quantities needed to fulfill such pledges).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Two Promo Cards", "descp": "For $3 you get TWO (random) of the rare Wrapper promo cards and my thanks for supporting this Halloween Kickstarter.

Oggy and the Cockroaches (known as Oggy et les Cafards in French, often referred to as simply Oggy) is a French cartoon series currently produced by Xilam Animation and created by Jean-Yves Raimbaud.  The show gives us the adventures, mis-adventures and various exploits of two cats (Oggy and Jack) and their regular adversaries Joey, Marky and Dee Dee ... three mischievous cockroaches. The cartoon series  started airing in 1998, it was successful in France and was eventually broadcast worldwide. Notable for truly beautiful scene work, unusual 'camera angles' and stories EASY to comprehend (even if inexplicable) because there is no dialogue!\nRRParksCARDS has teamed up with American Mythology and Xilam Animation to bring the world the FIRST US trading card series of this internationally beloved cartoon series ... and we're testing the US market with this very first, limited edition PREVIEW SERIES of limited edition trading cards. \nWhat does this PREVIEW EDITION include? \n1. Trading Card Base Set. This base set features NINE different PREVIEW cards ... PLUS a 10th Kickstarter Exclusive Card! Fronts feature a classic scene from the cartoon series and the backs feature title art, synopsis and extra image from the cartoon.\n2. Five Different Stickers. These full color stickers feature the lead characters: Oggy, Jack, Dee Dee, Joey and Marky.\n3. Genuine 3D Lenticular Card. This lovely lenticular card features Oggy and Dee Dee peering down a manhole with a gorgeous crescent moon background/sky graphic. VERY cool!\n4. Metal Card. Kickstarter Exclusive Full Metal, limited edition and numbered card available ONLY through this Kickstarter campaign and produced by that wonderful team Jacob and Julie Stem at Faerie Metal!\nThe nine card base with 1 sticker set will be wrapped in a special PREVIEW SET wrapper: \nFront of the wrapper for the special PREVIEW SET CARDS.\nThis PREVIEW SERIES is to help gauge how many Oggy and the Cockroaches fans there are so we can plan a FULL CARD SERIES release. As such, although the production of this preview series is VERY limited, we are keeping the pledge tiers VERY low priced to encourage Oggy fans to come on board, show their support and fandom, and we think that once you see the production quality of RRParksCARDS you'll be excited to collect the actual FIRST SERIES that is currently in the planning stages.\nHere are the pledge levels:\n$1 'sampler'. For a $1 pledge you will get TWO of these special edition PREVIEW cards mailed anywhere in the world.\n$7 'Preview Pack'. For a $7 pledge you will get a PREVIEW PACK. The pack includes the wrapper, 9 cards PLUS a sticker. Postpaid in the US\n$20 'MASTER SET!' PREVIEW EDITION. For a $20 pledge you will get the PREVIEW PACK of 9 different cards PLUS the sticker. PLUS the other 4 different stickers (so you'll have a complete set of all 5 stickers) ... PLUS the special 10th Preview card ... PLUS the 3D lenticular card ... PLUS the limited edition  METAL CARD! Postpaid in the US. \n$35 DOUBLE MASTER! One set for you and one set you can give away or trade or whatever. At this level you get TWO of everything listed in the 'Master Set' level. I will ALSO include TWO unused/UNFOLDED wrappers (since they make for a lovely addition to a special card series in your binder/album). Postpaid in the US.\n$50 HOARDERS SPECIAL. At the $50 level you get 10 PREVIEW PACKS  (guaranteed to include 2 of each of the 5 stickers... so if you were to open the packs you'd have two sticker sets and 10 of the 9 card sets) PLUS I'll include ONE lenticular card and ONE metal card and 10 of the card #10. Postpaid in the US. [LIMIT of ONE of these 'hoarder specials' per backer]\n SPECIAL ADD ON! \n$15 UNCUT, limited edition NUMBERED and PUBLISHER-SIGNED sheet of all 10 different preview cards. Limited to only 50 numbered sheets. Before adding this on be sure to message me FIRST to make sure They are still available. I'm limiting these to only TWO per backer.\nJUST ADDED on July 26th ... FOUR PROMO CARDS! \nThese are limited to only 100 or LESS each ... These will be included as a BONUS for those pledging at the master set or higher level and a complete set of all 4 will come FREE with EACH master set ordered.\n SPECIAL INTERNATIONAL Backer OPTION.  \nYes, shipping to any country outside the US is very pricey these days. BUT, if you pledged on my Manos: The Hands of Fate and/or Wolverton Series Three ... and if you want to include your choice of Oggy goodies above I can mail it with your Manos or Wolverton package for ZERO additional postage. So in order to do this just figure out what Oggy tier you want ... pledge $1 ... and then click to manage your pledge and change the pledge amount to the tier / level you want to get. This should result in ZERO postage costs added to your pledge amount.

This is my 27th Kickstarter (all 26 previous were all successful and while I'm still producing the previous two Kickstarter card series -- Manos: The Hands of Fate and Wolverton Series Three -- all responding backers have all received their rewards from all previous Kickstarters). I have an excellent record of delivering all products from all Kickstarters. Basically, the only risk of you NOT getting all these neat collectibles is if you don't even pledge! At the conclusion of a Kickstarter, once all payments are cleared and RIGHT before I publish cards I send out what is called a 'Mailing Address Survey'. This survey is where you tell me where to send your pledge rewards ... I can only mail a package if I know where it is being mailed. Kickstarter automatically emails the survey to everyone at the same time ... and I post an update when the surveys are going out. So when you get the mailing address survey be SURE to complete it and email it back to me. Will only take you about 2 minutes and it makes sure you get your stuff as quickly as possible.

I've also created Illustrations for instructional, equestrian-related books and articles.\nThis project is a way for me to explore sketch cards and the people involved. I'm really hoping that it could be a way for me to give back to a genre, a community, that let me draw, sketch, paint, and explore what else I could possibly do. Sketch cards are, in the grand scale of things, largely unknown, and I'm hoping that this book can show new people the possibilities of collecting sketch cards. It's also a way for me - and therefore the reader - to get to know who the people involved in this world are by chatting with them just a little.\nThe financial amount on this Kickstarter is based on a cost to print approximately 60 PAPERBACK books. People who support the $200 levels and up will receive 1 (2 copies EACH at the $500 and $700 levels) HARDCOVER. They are very expensive to produce for a small-run (low number) project such as this, but you are guaranteed that you'll own a very limited edition of a high quality book. The softcover will be very limited edition as well, it is NOT sold in print ANYWHERE else!\nMock-up of what the PAPERBACK book will look like published. There might be a few minor changes in the fonts, but nothing else. A view of what the HARDCOVER will look like is forthcoming and will be shown in the project updates.\nAbove is a list of the collectors, art directors, and artists interviewed for this book.\nA spread from the eBook.\nContaining 42 interviews and lots and lots of artwork, I'm hoping this project creates a time capsule/print collection of art and thoughts.\nThe front of the promo card.\nIt was absolutely impossible to include enough art from a vast variety of artists and sketch card/trading card sets, so this book barely touches the surface.\nTherefore, a stretch goal of this book is this: if it goes over the goal, I guarantee a second volume in 2021. The extra funds would help cover the costs of creating a similar book but containing all new artwork, a new perspective with different people, and give the ability to pay a few artists for original artwork. The incentives here feature my own work because I was so cheap (tee hee).\nThe back of the blank sketch card.\nThese are slightly thicker cards, excellent quality.\nHard cover books are available only at the $200 level and up because they are very expensive to produce in small numbers for a niche project such as this, as opposed to a large publisher producing books. However, you will be the owner/collector of a book that is guaranteed limited edition!\nStretch Goal: My first priority in attempting to have this volume published at least as a paperback, and limited hardcovers. Sketch/art cards are an awesome addition to a collection of nearly anything, and having a print compilation of various artists' artwork is something I really hope will happen. Ultimately, creating several volumes would make for a really nice archive of a multitude of artists in this niche world, and give printed voice to collectors and art directors as well.\nTherefore, should this project \"over fund\", next year would see the release of at least one more volume featuring different artists and people. I'm already attempting to coordinate interviews in the hopes that a volume 2 will happen. \nI will have learned a lot from this project, and would be able to bring that with me to the next one, and I'd like to include original art from other artists, and not just myself.\nWay down below are images of the prints, promo cards, and EXTREMELY limited Philly Alien cards. Two new prints will be forthcoming - I will post those images in the project updates.\n4 x 6 inch print of Salacious Crumb, from an original painting by me, Ingrid Hardy.\n4 x 6 inch card print from an original painting of a Walker on Jakku, painted by me, Ingrid Hardy.\n4 x 6 inch print of the base card art for the Galaxy trading card set from Topps, by me, Ingrid Hardy.\nLimited promo cards that were orginially destined to be available at the Philly Non Sport Show in early May 2020, cancelled because of Covid 19.\nThese are EXTREMELY limited! ONLY 5 exist. These are metal version of the previous promo cards (yes you can see my reflection in the cards) On the bottom left corner you'll see \"AP 1/5\" \"AP 2/5\" \"AP 3/5\" \"AP 4/5\" \"AP5/5\"\nALL books will have a hand stamped bookplate inside. This measures approximately 3 inches, and has room for your name or whatever you wish to write.\nUpdate June 18, 2020: These just arrived! 100 6 x 9 inch presentation folders in which the various cards and prints will be inserted for shipping.

Well, since a while ago, to be fair, but I thought it should be stated. Because of the support and interest shown in this project,there will be a volume 2! \nPlanning and work on that won't begin until this fall (my focus right now is this dream project), but a list of people has slowly begun populating already, including 3 special guests, one of which has already been hinted at.\nUpdate July 1, 2020: SECOND STRETCH GOAL REACHED! There will also be a 9 card sheet included with all levels from $70 and up! $70 and $100 levels will get the sheet cut into cards, and ALL levels $200 and up will get the sheets UNCUT and NUMBERED.\nThere will be a glossy, high quality \"sheet\" that will be printed, with 9  promo cards on it. For the $70 and $100 levels, you'll get them - cut -  within the presentation folder with the sketch cards and other promo  cards. For the $200 levels and up, you'll receive UNCUT sheets, hand  numbered, slipped inside of the books. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis book is already written and is currently published as an eBook, so there will be no delay in creating the book. There will be some small changes in the book to make print-ready, of course, and there will be pages within the book for collecting signatures from the artists, should you with to do so, and a page with an Ex Libris bookplate.

Then I package and mail (the book plates will take a short bit of time, depending on how many there are to print) everything to you. \n\nThe costs involved with this project are reflected in the goal and are also meant to cover the fees from Kickstarter.

Allen Williams (Darkstar, Everything) managed to purchase a copy of this story at the age of 12, successfully hiding the explicit underground copy from his mother, and tended a growing seed of an idea for a movie for nearly half a century.\nIn the early 90\u2019s, Williams met Corben and they collaborated on projects over several decades and became friends. In 2016 J. Allen produced a one-minute pitch video for \u201cFaces\u201d and sent it to Rich, who immediately flipped out and introduced the producer to Jan Strnad \u2014 and they began to plan. J. Allen wrote a first draft screenplay based on the 16-page comic, and began to work with Jan to refine it into a shooting script, co-writing the final version together. Fast forward to 2020 and the entire movie has been produced! Extensive CGI animated work is now waiting for live-action actors to be added, similar to TRON or The Last Starfighter, but in 4K with modern animation techniques.\n\nPatton Oswalt\u2019s performance voicing the lead animated character of MEAD has already been recorded. Now it's time to cast name actors to play the lead live action on-screen characters. \nPLAY\n\nA PRE-PRODUCTION trailer with no actors (actors are the reason for this KS campaign)\nSynopsis\nThe military thought they had created the ultimate weapon\uff0da soldier (Friz) linked symbiotically with an artificially intelligent spaceship (MEAD: Mobile Extrasensory Autonomous Deceptor) with the ability to project illusions so real that they cannot be distinguished from reality. Together, Friz and MEAD became the most deadly fighting force the world had seen.\n\nThere was one problem: An errant bit of programming instilled MEAD with a conscience and pacifist tendencies that made him and his human symbiote useless for military purposes. Scheduled for \"decommission,\" Friz and MEAD go on the run, pursued by bounty hunters and an admiral with a personal axe to grind.\n The Goals\nWe are setting our minimum goal at $25,000, but hope to raise up to $60,000+ to hire as many A-List Hollywood Actors as possible. As you know, much of that amount will go to Kickstarter\u2019s cut and the printing of backer prizes \u2014 so that is baked in. We are looking at this as a four-phase campaign that will allow us to minimally cast the role of \u201cFriz\u201d, but the top three tiers will allow us to add more.\n $25,000:  We will be able to cast our lead male character \u201cFriz\u201d to play opposite Patton Oswalt (already hired, paid and has performed), pay Kickstarter their fee, have prizes printed and signed, and ship them to our backers.\n $40,000:  We will be able to cast our antagonist \u201cAdmiral Gillette\u201d with a great name-actor as well as our initial goal.\n $60,000:  We will be able to add one or two more name actors to play one or both of our female leads, \u201cTam\u201d and \u201cPhoebe\u201d.\n Over $60K:  Any money we raise will be used to employ A-list actors. Negotiations on price are always very fluid, and certainly are at this juncture prior to funding this endeavor. Funds beyond our main goals here could also be used to pay character actors to play the 25-ish supporting roles. Of course we hope to reach our stretch goals, but hitting our 1st tier funding goal would be absolutely wonderful and vital to the success of our film.\n The Actors\nThough we have only finalized Patton Oswalt, other actors will be cast and contracted to play various roles once we have funding.\n FRIZ:  As our male lead, this actor must carry the entire film and interact with the animated \u201cMEAD\u201d character voiced by Oswalt. Friz is the imaginative half of the duo, imagining and creating the illusions that MEAD projects. Initially regarding MEAD as just another robot, Friz comes to realize that MEAD is much more.\n GILLETTE:  Admiral Gillette views our two symbiotes as the greatest threat facing the military establishment, treasonous pacifists who must be eliminated for the security of the planet Earth. Plus, Friz carries Gillette's severed hand aboard the MEAD ship, so the grudge is personal.\n TAM:  Tam is the technician responsible for MEAD'S programming \u2014 pacifist tendencies and all. During the process of creating MEAD and Friz's symbiotic relationship, a love developed between Tam and Friz. But a daring escape ended all of that, and Friz is left with nothing but a holographic \"Tam\" who can do anything he programs her to do,  but she can never surprise him.\n PHOEBE:  Phoebe is a tough cookie, an escaped convict who finds her fate intertwined with that of Friz and MEAD. As a flesh-and-blood woman, she is the best bet\uff0dalbeit a risky one\uff0dto take Tam's place in Friz's heart.\n 25+ SECONDARY CHARACTERS:  Fighter pilots, bounty hunters, technicians and extras are needed to flesh out the world of Friz and MEAD \u2014 about 25 actors.\n Diversity in Casting Process \nWe plan to cast actors from a wide range of cultures and backgrounds, with an intentional focus on showing what the world might look like in the future. This film will feature strong, commanding female characters, reflecting the importance of representing them in leadership roles. \n Our Schedule\nCOVID-19 has placed you, us, and the entire world on hold, but all projections assure us that this too shall soon end, hopefully by mid-summer. Once our campaign has funded, we plan to cast and schedule shooting immediately if possible, flying actors to our studio in Missouri for an aggressive production schedule.\nWe have already cast character actors to play some of the smaller roles. Nearly all have played parts in films before, but are not as recognizable as the people we are compensating with funds from this campaign will be.\nAs pointed out earlier, the HUGE-budget part of this film is complete \u2014 every scene is finished and edited (even the sound effects & music). All that is left on the docket is casting, filming, and compositing the actors (shot in our green-screen studio) into the final film.\n Worldwide Distribution \nWe\u2019ve already been approached by Heavy Metal magazine (they produced a 1980 animated film featuring our partner Rich Corben\u2019s art and story) for an interview. We have received tentative interest from a distributor in LA, and also one out of Singapore \u2013 and we\u2019ve barely even talked about this project publicly prior to this Kickstarter Campaign! WITH HELP FROM YOU and the casting of some great screen actors, we will have no problem finding an audience for \u201cTo Meet the Faces You Meet.\u201d\nPrize Fulfillment\nOnce we are funded, the comic book and posters go to print. That process will take a few weeks, and then the copies to be autographed by RICH CORBEN, JAN STRNAD and myself will be shipped around the country (Jan in LA, Rich in KC, and myself in southern MO) to be signed. Those will be shipped immediately to backers all over the world.\nThe BluRay of the film will go out to all that wanted one once the film has been edited and special \u201cpromo\u201d BluRays specifically for YOU backers will be duplicated, packaged and shipped. We project production to be complete by late spring of 2021 \u2013 virus situation allowing. But rest assured, nothing will stop the completion of this film, (even Covid-19) and as soon as possible. 80% of the project is complete already (you can view many scenes with Patton Oswalt in our pre-pro trailer and other videos we're sharing with you).\n Our Budget\nEven after including our stretch goal of $60K +, this film falls under Hollywood\u2019s \u201cMicro-Budget\u201d number at under $250,000. Low budget films out of Hollywood can be $10M.\nBut there is a huge asterisk here\u2026*\nThe company producing the film (Parallax Studio LLC) has completed everything to date in-house since 2016 \u2014 animation work that would cost tens of millions in Hollywood produced by any company there \u2014 like over $100M (check out what the average Pixar movie costs to make). But Parallax has not charged themselves for their own work, so this part of the budget has been absorbed by the studio as production proceeded. There is a small amount of out-of-pocket that the studio has also absorbed and paid to date.\nThe studio has spent roughly $30K for Mr. Oswalt, prop construction, costumes and other ancillary needs to date. It is projected another $30K will be spent outside of this Kickstarter casting budget effort to complete the film.\nThis makes our budget (if fully funded) a bit under $250K \u2013 *not including the studio\u2019s in-house investment in writing, design, animation hours, and business coordination. \nPLAY\n\nWhy produce this movie?\nJeff explains and describes the prizes backers will receive in the above video.\nThe story has bounced around in the Director/Producer\u2019s mind for nearly fifty years since purchasing the comic story in a small Springfield, MO head shop in 1972.\nJ. Allen (Jeff) Williams considered producing it in 1999, but decided to put Darkstar: The Interactive Movie on the front burner. In 2013 the idea to produce \"Faces\" was again considered, but the film Everything was greenlit and completed. Those projects had $500K and $150K budgets respectively. Darkstar was released in November of 2010, but the distribution of Everything has been held back until Faces is complete. The planets lined up in 2016 and Jeff was looking for a new title to produce.\nSo three guys from the Midwestern United States (Jan from Kansas/Jeff & Rich from Missouri \u2013 both Kansas City Art Institute Alumni) decided to combine their skills, story & art, and embark on an animated journey that has led us here. They are passionate about their story and the amazing characters that Jan created so long ago.\nJan and Rich originally wrote and illustrated this fantastic story long ago as young and starving artists, making virtually no money from it. Their passion was storytelling \u2014 they were not the most aggressive capitalists. This describes most artists, writers, actors, and musicians at their core. At 50\u00a2 a copy, the lion\u2019s share of the proceeds went to underground publisher/distributor Kitchen Sink Comics.\nThis time around, only the creators of this IP (Jeff, Jan and Rich) are in control over the finished product, and we are poised to do what it takes to take \"Faces\" into the public sphere as a feature film. Its success or failure is in our hands, not Hollywood\u2019s, and that\u2019s the way they want it.\nJust look at the work we have done thus far \u2014 and we are close to the finish line.\nTHE PRIZES\nThere are several combinations of prize options available to Faces backers. Here are descriptions of each component.\nYOUR NAME IN THE CREDITS: \nRegardless of pledge amount, every Kickstarter backer will have their name listed in the credits.\nMost KS projects offering \u201cyour name in the credits\u201d put your name in a credits sequence attached to their movie. We put your name in TWO places \u2014  one is in the film itself as a SPECIAL feature on the BluRay disk, PLUS your name will be listed in the Special Edition comic book prize.  And this is EACH AND EVERY of you. Even the smallest amount of contribution to our casting budget will get the backer listed in these two locations.\nGRAND PRIZE ASSOCIATE PRODUCER PRIZE:\nThere will be a grand prize available listing you as Associate Producer in the crew credits! (See photo above) This prize also includes a Limited Edition Signed Comic (#2/200), an unsigned extra comic copy, BOTH large SIGNED posters, both art prints, a Blu-ray copy of the film, and your name in the credits. THERE IS ONLY ONE of these offered, so get it early.\nADMIRAL GILLETTE'S SEVERED HAND PROP: \nAdmiral Gillette\u2019s severed hand.\nAnother Special Grand Prize is a screen-used prop \u2014 Gillette\u2019s severed hand! Turns out the Admiral loses it while trying to kill MEAD, but his loss is your gain. This prize will ship immediately after the campaign is funded and comes with a Limited Edition Signed Comic (#1/200), an unsigned extra comic copy, BOTH large SIGNED posters, both art prints, a Blu-ray copy of the film, and your name in the credits.\nOPTION: We have TWO of these props, the screen-used version and a backup created by our prop department for safety.  We intend on sending out the screen-used version to the backer of this reward, but it will be shipped once the scene it is required for has been shot, sometime in late 2020 or early 2021.  If the lucky backer of this prize prefers, we can immediately ship the backup version OR they can wait for the screen-used hand.  We'll reach out after the campaign to find out what your preference is. There is only ONE of these available, so get it before it's gone.\nSPECIAL EDITION AUTOGRAPHED \u201cTO MEET THE FACES YOU MEET\u201d reprint: \n\"Fever Dreams\" Special Edition reprint (left).\nThis special item could be a Kickstarter campaign of its own! The comic art has been re-mastered and the magazine enlarged substantially from 7\u201dw x 10\u201dh up to a huge 8.5\u201dw x 12.5\u201dh. (See it in Jeff's video) It features the movie poster as one cover; flip it over, and you will see Rich Corben\u2019s original art for the Fever Dreams comic. Four pages will contain EVERY Faces Kickstarter backer in print, and a thank you message to all of you. And of course, the entirety of the uncensored 16-page story by Jan Strnad and Richard Corben is reproduced in all of its visceral, underground comic glory.\nThere will be both autographed and unsigned versions available. \nRichard will sign his cover art and Jeff & Jan will sign the movie version. This is a gorgeous collectible, and ONLY available here \u2014 this special edition will not appear anywhere else. There will be a limit of only 200 comics signed and numbered, so if you want a signed version, get in on it early in the campaign. The total print run including the unsigned editions will depend on the number of pledges we receive.\nAUTOGRAPHED POSTERS:\n24x30\" film poster designed by J. Allen Williams.\nThere will be two designs offered at a limited signed/numbered run of 100 for each design. One features the \u201cmovie version\u201d (shown above) with MEAD featured (approximately 24x30). The other is the comic version (shown below) with Richard Corben's famous Fever Dreams cover (approximately 21x30). These will be shipped separately in tubes worldwide.\nThese are big and glossy, rare collectibles on heavy stock, and will not be sold elsewhere \u2014 only backers of our movie can get their hands on one of these babies!\nART PRINTS (not signed): \n12.5x18 art print of the original comic cover by Richard Corben.\nThere will be two designs of these art prints, the same art as used for our autographed posters, just smaller.  The \u201cmovie version\u201d print is 14.5\u201dw x 18\u201dh and the Richard Corben-illustrated version will be 12.5\u201dw x 18\u201dh. They are great collectibles in their own right, and again, not offered anywhere but here. On request, the Director (J. Allen) will sign your print for no extra cost (message us after the campaign). Autographs for Jan and Rich on this item are not available.\nBLURAY of the FINISHED FILM: \n\"To Meet the Faces You Meet\" blu-ray.\nThis is the prize above all, the subject of all of this much-appreciated fuss and attention. A copy of the finished film for YOU before ANYONE else sees it. Our backers will be the first audience that Faces will premier before. It will run at about 94 minutes (including credits) chock full of slam-pow-kablooey action, comedy, drama, breathtaking special animated effects, and a starship-load of zany robot fun injected with a T-Rex, pteranadons, a giant toy robot, a rubber duck bigger than a trash truck, the Titanic, an ugly squid-faced monster, and a vague Kubrick easter egg reference to boot.\nOf course this prize will take a little more time to get to you, (we have to finish it) but we will be sharing the progress of this film production to keep you informed on many social media pages and through media interviews during production. The earliest we can ship promotional pre-sales Blu-rays to backers will most likely be late spring of 2021. The COVID-19 crisis may protract that a bit, especially if it resurges in the fall as predicted, but rest assured that this film is nearly finished right now \u2014 nothing will keep us from crossing the finish line for our backers.\nWe apologize for the patience required for this prize, but believe me when I say \u2014 it will be well worth the wait. Plus, we have plenty of other prizes listed above that will go out toot-sweet (that means really fast).\nFOLLOW US AT \u201cTo Meet the Faces You Meet\u201d on FACEBOOK.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/209691127118509/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to raise funds to pay name actors to play one, two, or more characters.

The SEQUEL SERIES to the SEQUEL SERIES!\nFirst there was BASIL WOLVERTON: BARFLYZE ... Then came BASIL WOLVERTON II: WOLVERTON'S WOMEN. And NOW, here comes WOLVERTON SERIES THREE: MONTE WOLVERTON. Monte Wolverton is an incredibly talented artist who is not only carrying on the loopy, ugly, spaghetti monster style of his Dad, Basil, but is an artist in his own right who does fine art AND political cartooning. And Monte has been generous and encouraging and helpful every step of the way in this BRAND NEW card series celebrating the Wolverton Art Dynasty! And presented here is the visual 'photo tour' of this upcoming card series:\nThis series features a 54-card base set -- the entire Lena's Bambinas (daughters of the infamous LENA the HYENA ... go on, google that ... I'll wait. You'll recognize 'her' the moment you see her), the entire series of all 12 strange and twisted 'Twelve' fine art paintings, the entire suite of 'Eight Portraits of Things' PLUS more of Monte's fine art works. \nBut WAIT, there's MORE! We're going to be doing a FULL MOTION lenticular card. Ever wonder what a Wolverton creation would look like if it actually ... MOVED? Scary thought, huh! Makes you fear for your safety, don't it! Well keep that fear alive -- because here comes that SCARY THOUGHT right to your eyeballs! In full motion lenticular good-ness!\nNot enough for you? Well that's great because there's MORE! Through the generosity of Monte Wolverton and Grant Geissman we're creating a limited edition Kickstarter Exclusive fine art etching of a work created by both Basil Wolverton and Monte Wolverton. And it will be limited to backers of this Kickstarter. \"Awww... only ONE etching? But I LIKE etching cards!\" Well that's GREAT because there are FOUR limited edition etching cards planned for this card series! Am showing you ONE of the etchings but the other 3 are in the works so there will be a total of FOUR etching cards and master set backers will get all 4 of them ... limited edition and with matching edition numbers. \nThe four different Monte Wolverton Etchings (artwork by Monte and Basil Wolverton, platework by RRParks)\nSTILL not enough for you? Fine then, BE greedy (card collectors SHOULD be greedy!) -- there is being created a very special METAL CARD. Limited edition and a Kickstarter Exclusive. let's just say in future generations when your kids or grandkids ask \"anything happen in the year 2020?\" this card will be horrifically relevant!\nOh come on now, STILL fiending for MORE WOLVERTON in this card series? Well that's super swell and peachy keen because we'll have genuine production PRINTING PLATES! These are UNIQUE -- there can only ever be ONE printing plate for each of the four colors that go into a trading card's production. And at the master set level you will GET one!\nJUST ADDED! June 3rd! \nALL Master Set Level backers will get a BONUS ITEM on top of everything else. No add-ons, no stretch goals, no extra cost. Those who have pledged, will pledge or who change their pledge from a lower level to the MASTER set level will get a FREE full metal Monte Wolverton Autograph card! Here's what it will look like (image below) and the number of autograph cards will be determined by the Master Backer number (so these are limited edition Kickstarter Exclusives). EACH Master Set will get one ... so those who pledge on one master set will get one... those who pledge on more than one will get an autograph card for EACH master set they pledge on.\n\n\nBecause I'm a fan of 1950s and 1960s trading cards and packaging, we're going to do something different with this Wolverton card series. There will be a 'header card' and it tops the 'Rack Pack' style packaging of this card series. I've designed it to have that 1950s through 1960s RETRO-STALGIC look of packaging. The Rack Pack will contain the complete base set and other non-exclusives ... while the exclusive cards will be outside the packaging. I want to capture and share the look and feel of going back in time and finding this card series at a 5 and 10 store's candy counter display ... and then the FUN of being 8 years old and tearing into this package of weird delights. \n\nHere are the pledge levels:\n$1. For a BUCK you'll get ONE Wolverton Series Three promo card. \n$8. For $8 you will get ONE Wolverton Series Three promo card ... 3 base set cards ... and the LENTICULAR MOTION card.\n$28. For $28 you will get the COMPLETE BASE SET of WOLVERTON SERIES THREE with the header card in the Rack Pack style packaging PLUS the promo card PLUS the lenticular card. \n$50. For $50 you will get the COMPLETE BASE SET of WOLVERTON SERIES THREE with the header card in the Rack Pack style packaging. PLUS the promo card. PLUS the lenticular motion card. PLUS all four limited edition Monte Wolverton Etching cards.\n$68. THE MASTER SET. Here it is for you OCD maniacs (like me) who have to have it ALL! For $68 you will get the COMPLETE BASE SET of WOLVERTON SERIES THREE with the header card in the Rack Pack style packaging. PLUS the promo card. PLUS the lenticular motion card. PLUS all four limited edition Monte Wolverton Etching cards. PLUS the limited edition metal card. PLUS a genuine Wolverton printing plate used in the production of the base card set. PLUS ... some surprises! I like surprises ... and also like to give surprises.\n$120 THE DOUBLE MASTER SET. At this level you get DOUBLE the Master Set stuff and DOUBLE the surprises.\nADD ONS:\nSeries One and Two:\nSo, you're all bummed out that you missed Wolverton Series 1 and 2, huh? You lay awake at night ... kicking yourself, pulling at your nose hairs ... \"Why oh WHY didn't I get the first two series of Wolverton cards from RRParksCARDS?\" Well if that's the WORST regret you have you certainly haven't done much with your life! But let's get rid of at least that ONE regret. You can ADD ON to your pledge and get BASIL WOLVERTON: BARFLIZE Trading Card Series (series 1) and/or BASIL WOLVERTON II: WOLVERTON'S WOMEN (series 2) ... EITHER of these two sets for $28 or BOTH for $50. Add that $50 on for BOTH and get BONUS promo cards for these two series AND ... yep, you guessed it, some SURPRISES, TOO!\nThe BARFLIZE FINE ART ETCHING SET!\nDid you know, that right before I started RRParksCARDS Monte Wolverton and I did our very first project together? It was a limited edition suite of limited edition large-size (about 8x10\" with 5x7\" art area... each signed and numbered) hand crafted/pulled FINE ART ETCHINGS of Basil Wolverton's BARFLIZE (yes... we called the etching set 'Barflize' and the card set 'Barflyze' ... must have been a reason for that, but danged if I can recall what it was). All 36 of them WITH a special 'frontis plate' signed by Monte Wolverton (and me, as I did the etchings). This was limited to on 75 signed and numbered folio sets. I do not promote these much at all because I want the supply to last and go ONLY to true Wolverton fans. When i do list them for sale I list them at $360 ($10 each etching). But since if you've read this far along you are a Wolverton fan so ONLY during this Kickstarter, you can get one of the complete 36 (plus signed frontis plate) etching sets for a $250 add on. \nAnd THAT is our GRAND VISUAL TOUR of WOLVERTON SERIES THREE Trading Cards! \nIMPORTANT: Master Sets will be available ONLY during this limited time Kickstarter. Once the Kickstarter ends, the opportunity to get a MASTER SET ends at the same time. The limited edition etchings and metal cards will be based on the number of backers getting a Master Set (plus a set for me and a small number of contributors to the project). A base set MAY be available at a much later date on my website (but will cost more at that time ... Kickstarter prices are ALWAYS the lowest prices for sets). \nIMPORTANT: Customized Pledge Levels. Above are the pledge levels ... however, if there's a different combination of stuff that you want, just ask. Obviously ... material that is exclusive to this Kickstarter and to Master Sets can't be 'bought alone'. But if you wanted a Master Set plus an extra base set ... or if you wanted a base set of all 3 series PLUS a series 3 Master Set then sure -- we'll work that out. \nQuestions? Just MESSAGE me. And by 'message' I don't mean 'comment'. A 'comment' is a public, well, COMMENT ... and as odd as this sounds, it is virtually impossible for me to see comments. But a message is a message ... it shows up as an email and is quite visible for me. I typically answer messages and respond to emails either same day or next day. You can send me an email through my RRParksCARDS.com website ... I'm also on Facebook as RICHARD PARKS or RRPARKS CARDS ... or in the Facebook group called 'Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards'. BEST way is to message through Kickstarter ... but any of these other ways will also be seen by me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks? Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. Or a pandemic could sweep through the entire world and cause a slight delay in production (oh... wait a minute!) Otherwise, this is my 26th Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 7 years (including eight different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, two Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, The 100th Anniversary of Zorro and others, MST3K Series one, two and three, Grim Reaper Series one, two and three, and others). I know my way around card publishing and financing production. Wolverton Series Three is nearly entirely designed and since Monte and I are the ONLY approval process 'chiefs', there will be zero delays for licensing approval 'big shots'. SOME graphics shown above may change but I don't anticipate much, if any, changes. So risks and challenges have all been minimized. At this moment, the printing company i want to use for production is very slow in turnaround and so I've set the anticipated release date of Wolverton Series Three as 'August'... this could change, of course, as we live in uncertain times with regards to business services. But anyone who has pledged on one of my Kickstarters knows the routine -- I keep everyone informed and do my best to release products on time (or nearly on time).

And it only took 55 YEARS to happen! MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card Series! MSTies had a sneak peek at some MANOS: The Hands of Fate  trading cards in MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 Series Three  trading cards (a Riff It! subset) ... but now, here, finally -- a full card series with all the bells and whistles of the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! Produced by Jackey Raye Neyman Jones (who played Debbie, the little girl in MANOS: The Hands of Fate  ) and RRParksCARDS Cards (who published MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 Trading Cards Series One, Two and Three). And this is the Kickstarter campaign where you have your chance to FINALLY add the card series demanded by MILLIONS of fans across the world ... or perhaps just some really good fans here and there.\nThe current plan is to have the series released in June. Now, as we ALL know ... the entire earth is sort of in quarantine as a pandemic is sweeping across this section of the universe ... so the PLAN is a June release. The card series will actually be completed in just a few weeks and I'll keep everyone up to date on actual production. This Kickstarter, with all the exclusives, will run from March 24th through April 24th. During that time you can pledge and LOCK IN your card series and all exclusives.  \nHere's  a visual 'grand tour' of the card series:     MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card Series:\nA 36-card BASE SET which tells the SHOCKING story of MANOS: The Hands of Fate ... where we meet Torgo, The Master, Debbie and her parents and all the other miserable souls. Cards are planned as old timey 18pt RETRO type cards similar to 1960s tracking cards. However! Jackey obtained permission for us to utilize the HIGH DEF imagery from the remastered version of the movie ... so no grainy, blurry 'vhs' sourcing -- these cards will have GLORIOUS images!\nAll 36 cards will be housed in 4 retro style card packs, each pack containing 12 different cards PLUS 1 sticker AND RRParksCARDS' first ever ANIMATED stick of FAKE GUM! OooOOoooo... it's HAUNTED, it's POSSESSED, YOU command the POWER to bring it to CREEPY LIFE -- it MOOOOVES! Si-i-i-ICK!\nEACH 12-card pack will include ONE STICKER! There are currently 9 stickers planned for this card series. If you pledge on a single pack or 3 packs you will get 1 different sticker in each pack. If you pledge at the MASTER set level you will get ALL 9 STICKERS! [Note: Final sticker design may vary from what is shown... I'm still working on the sticker designs].\nA VERY neat treat -- Specially produced ART CARDS of Manos-inspired paintings created by Jackey Raye Neyman Jones! Not sure how many different cards there may be in this set -- Jackey has 3 produced right now and because of this pandemic 'lock down' she's BOUND to have time to produce even MORE! IF she paints it, I will produce it and backers will GET SOME (Master set backers will get ALL of them!).\nTWO DIFFERENT \"TORGO MOTION\" Lenticular cards ... he ambles, he gropes, he creeps you out and NOW he's doing all those things while you HOLD HIM in your HANDS! EwwwwwWWW!!! Two different cards are planned (already designed and ready for printing production). You get ONE Torgo Motion Lenticular card with a 3-pack pledge ... you get BOTH of them with a Master Set pledge!\n\nI've been bringing aboard sketch card artists from Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards Series One, Two and Three -- Artists are currently still being invited (in fact, just now brought on MST3K Trading Card Artist Leon Braojos!) and others are still working on their masterpieces. Floydman, Philip Trujillo, Lindsey Armitage, and Jason Miller were able to make some scans of the cards they are working on... feast yer peepers on these shocking mini masterpieces above! Master Set backers will get one original MANOS: The Hands of Fate sketch card in their pledge!\nOFFICIAL Sketch Card Blank! Those who pledge at the 3-pack level get ONE... those who pledge at the Master Set level get THREE (so hopefully Master Set backers will feel comfortable keeping one 'unsullied' in their collection and ALSO actually dust off their crayons or thick, stubby pencils and DRAW their OWN Manos Masterpiece for their collection!). \nTwo BEAUTIFUL Metal Cards to collect! These will be limited edition, signed and numbered and available ONLY on Kickstarter! ONE random metal card for backers at the 3-pack level and BOTH metal cards for Master Set backers! Produced by those fine folks at Faerie Metal -- if you've enjoyed the MST3K metal trading cards you'll love these, too!\nOkay, the PLAN is to have printing plates for Master Set backers ... the 'trick', though, is that the printing company has said they only MIGHT be able to provide printing plates (this is a company I've used before and they do a great job... but I've never ordered the printing plates from them before). So while I've been told 'probably yet' I can't guarantee it. But you know me by now if you've pledged on my Kickstarters for The Three Stooges, Zorro, Sharknado, Old Man Like Ron, Gary Saves the Graveyard, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Basil Wolverton, etc. that if something is even REMOTELY possible I do my best to move mountains to MAKE IT SO!\n\"What ELSE is included?\"\nWell I'll TELL YOU! A special KICKSTARTER BACKER ONLY promo card for SURE ... and I'm working on designing a special BLACK BUCKRAM bag for Master Set backers (3-pack or lower will have the cards in packs... master backers will have their cards in packs AND in the special Manos custom made 'red hand' buckram black drawstring bag). to house your card collection with a RED FELT 'Hand of MANOS' on the bag (see that photo above of all the cards laid out next to a black fabric drawstring bag? That's a mock up of what's being designed... so end product might not look EXACTLY like that, but gives you an idea). \n\"Yea, okay... what ELSE you gonna do for us, huh?\"\nNot enough for you? Well okay ... at this time I'm working out logistics for creating MANOS ETCHING CARDS! If you've ever collected my Wolverton card series, Grim Reaper, Three Stooges or the Dance of Death series I did about 7 years ago (the first card series I did as RRParks CARDS) then you already KNOW what etching cards are. I believe I'm the ONLY publisher who creates genuine intaglio ETCHING cards! At least... for the MOMENT I am. And for this MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card Series I'll be working out some challenges for the next couple weeks and will post an update or addition to this description once I work them out. \n\"Yea, okay, that's all fine ... but what ELSE YOU GONNA DO FOR US???\"\nOhhhhh you greedy little monkey! Good for you! Well I DO have one more item up my sleeve. STEVE VANCE! Yep -- Steve Vance who did ALL those Shout! Factory DVD mini posters, the DVD Mini Poster Art Subsets for Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards Series One, Two and Three PLUS the exclusive mini poster for Series Three? Well, he is RIGHT NOW working on an all original MANOS: The Hands of Fate mini movie poster! He's going to try and get me the pencil rough draft to me before I launch this Kickstarter but in ANY event ... SOON. The mini poster will be in the same style as the Shout! Factory DVD mini posters and the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards Series Three box topper mini poster.\nNOTE: Steve Vance JUST now (March 29 8:34pm) sent me his rough draft pencils for the Manos: The Hands of Fate mini movie poster art. Isn't this LOVELY -- and it includes 'Debbie' and her family, Torgo ... and, of course, The Master ... and... and what's that? Is that a 'cat fight', too??? Steve wanted to get this rough draft to me ASAP so all you Manos fans could see it in the early stages. \nPLUS I'm working on the idea given to me by TWO MSTies: special Faux Scratch 'n Sniff MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card Series. I'm working on that right now so may adjust pledge level descriptions (but pledge level prices will NOT change even if I add in more cards, so no worries) once these very various variables are worked out. What I CAN say right now is that Master Set levels will be guaranteed whatever items I'm currently working out actually happen (Etching Cards, Mini Poster, Faux Scratch 'n Sniff, and any additional promo cards). It is my intention to create, with the generous help of Jackey Raye Neyman Jones, not just the first actual trading card series of Manos: The Hands of Fate but also the BEST POSSIBLE CARD SERIES for this movie that anyone could hope for. As most of you know, I wasn't given leave to produce Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series Four.  Bummer, I know, a lot of ideas 'left on the table' ... so MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card Series is sort of an unofficial 'Series Four'... an epilogue card series to Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards. And since Manos: The Hands of Fate is so beloved by MSTies I think it is a fitting tribute to the show to include this movie as a stand-alone card series. I hope you agree!\nPLEDGE LEVELS:\n$1  Pledge = 1 promo card\n$7  Pledge = 1 promo card PLUS 1 pack of 12 different cards. Not a complete set of course but fun for someone on a budget who simply wants to enjoy opening a pack of MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card Series  and be part of the FUN! PLUS, of course, the weird and strange 'Manos Motion stick of fake gum'!\n$30  Pledge = THREE PACKS of MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card Series. Comes with 3 packs containing all 36 different cards, 3 different stickers, 1 METAL card, 1 Torgo Motion lenticular motion card,  1 Sketch card blank and some promo cards and, of course, the 'Manos Motion gum sticks', ONE special Jackey Art Card ... PLUS the Steve Vance Mini Movie poster for Manos: The Hands of Fate!\n$66  Pledge = THE MASTER SET! Alrighty, here's what you get in the MASTER SET ... you get the 3 packs which will contain all 36 different base cards AND 3 different stickers. But you ALSO get BOTH Metal Cards, ONE original art sketch card, THREE official Sketch Card blanks, the Steve Vance Mini Movie poster for Manos: The Hands of Fate, all promo cards PLUS the exclusive Kickstarter campaign promo card, one genuine 1/1 unique printing plate, BOTH of the Torgo Motion Lenticular cards, 'Manos Motion animated fake gum sticks', COMPLETE set of all stickers, COMPLETE set of the special Jackey Art Cards. PLUS anything else that might be created for this series (such as the possible etching cards, Faux Scratch 'n Sniffs, etc.). Pledge at this level and you get everything! [66 limit]\n$67 Pledge = THE MASTER SET ... on April 20th I did the math and am having to create an updated Master Set. The ONLY difference between this master set and the $66 one (despite the $1 difference just so I can tell them apart at the end of the campaign when doing paperwork) is that this master set doesn't have a printing plate. It has everything else, just not a printing plate (there's only so many printing plates possible). Everyone who came aboard the other master set level with the printing plate will get theirs... backers arriving NOW, though, I just won't have enough printing plates. BUT, you get everything else:  the 3 packs which will contain all 36 different base cards AND 3 different stickers. But you ALSO get BOTH Metal Cards, ONE original art sketch card, THREE official Sketch Card blanks, the Steve Vance Mini Movie poster for Manos: The Hands of Fate, all promo cards PLUS the exclusive Kickstarter campaign promo card, BOTH of the Torgo Motion Lenticular cards, 'Manos Motion animated fake gum sticks', COMPLETE set of all stickers, COMPLETE set of the special Jackey Art Cards. PLUS anything else that might be created for this series (such as the possible etching cards, Faux Scratch 'n Sniffs, etc.). \n$99 Pledge = THE MASTER SET + 1 Extra Sketch Card PLUS a surprise. So at this level you get EVERYTHING in the $66 pledge level (which includes a sketch card of course)... PLUS an additional sketch card ... PLUS a little surprise I'm cooking up (which MSTies will DEFINITELY approve of!). \n$100 Pledge = DOUBLE MASTER! Yep... as you rightly conclude, at this level you get the MASTER SET and everything that goes with it... only DOUBLE! So you can keep one and give the other as a gift... or hoard like a greedy, graspy ghoul until such time that it is worth a bazillion bucks and then ebay it. \n$180 Pledge = TWO full MASTER SETS (which includes 2 sketch cards) ... PLUS: TWO additional bonus sketch cards (for a total of FOUR sketch cards) ... PLUS: The sneaky secret surprise mentioned in the $99 level. \n\nSO  HOW DO I GET ALL THIS AMAZING STUFF AND SATIATE MY DIRE NEED FOR MANOS: The Hands of Fate Trading Card COLLECTIBLES???\nIt's  easy. You'll notice there are many different pledge levels listed above -- levels to fit all  collector budgets -- just pick which pledge level you like and on the right hand side of this screen you'll see the pledge levels to click on.\n\nQuestions  and Answers:\nQ:  I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do  I go about it?  A:  Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter (or CAN'T sign up on Kickstarter). If you are unable  to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no  worries.\n---------------\nQ:  When will the MANOS Trading Card Series ship? A:  The current schedule and plan is to ship during June or early July. However, keep in mind... this series has a lot of moving parts and this pesky global pandemic quarantine has rather thrown delays into almost every aspect of human life. So you'll have to bear with me, please. I can certainly have everything designed (most likely designed even before this Kickstarter is over)... but whether or not ALL the printing companies involved in production are in motion again soon there COULD  be delays. I think June/July is a safe guesstimate. And, of course, will post updates to keep everyone informed about production 'stuff'.\n---------------------\nQ:  I'm OCD and want a set to keep sealed and a set to open. How do I back on two  base sets? Or two 'Master Sets'?  A: I've set up various pledge levels to satisfy most permutations of what most people might want. But you probably know me well enough by now that if you want some customized pledge level you message me (not 'comment', I don't get to see comments... but MESSAGE me). HOW does one message? Easy -- click to send me a note or message. If you pledge and have a question, click on your pledge and you'll see the clickable to contact me... or you cam message me through Facebook (my FB name is Richard Parks or RRParks CARDS or join the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Card group and message me from there... or email me at RRParksCARDS@yahoo.com).  \n-----------------\nQ:  Why are you running this as a Kickstarter instead of selling at a comic shop or  through a catalog? A:  This is my 25th Kickstarter over the last 5 years. I've found that pre-selling a  card series on Kickstarter allows me to determine a proper production run of  cards and boxes (especially special production cards that are pricey to do ... such as metal cards). It also allows me to offer 'master sets' to collectors on a  limited basis. Once the Kickstarter is done I will have a good idea of what the  total 'sealed pack' needs will be for a production run to provide Kickstarter  backers. A Kickstarter also lets me get card series to serious  collectors FIRST before ANYONE else. AND to provide limited edition exclusives available NOWHERE else.  Plus a Kickstarter allows me to exercise  some flexibility on providing 'stuff' for backers.\nQ: I've got a wart with a hair growing out of it. A: That's not a question. Might not even be a wart.\nADD ON GOODIES:\nIf you want something not listed just let me know and if it's possible we'll do it. Add On prices are postpaid in the US. If you're outside the US let me know before doing the add on so I can research postage costs to your country. And of course if you have any questions just ask! My goal is to make sure you have fun with your collection and it's everything you want it to be.  \nMST3K ADD ONs!\n I've finally squared away all the 'MST3K Special Venue' items from last months' limited-time Special Venue ... I have some full boxes left (not many), some autograph cards left, and the original art of BYRON WINTON (first time available as individual pieces) and the Elisabetta Stoinich original art complete set. If you missed a MST3K series or just want to get another box or boxes, here they are:\nAnd here are the LAST of the autograph cards:\nHere are the Byron Winton ORIGINAL ARTWORK items:\nHere is the complete original art set of Elisabetta Stoinich (not available individualy, ONLY available as a complete set... because if no one wants the complete set I'll keep them for my personal collection): \nI still also have a FEW odds and ends from the special venue (printing plate, Macarie and Character card error sets, 9up Puzzle Back printing plates, ULTIMATE progressive proof bundle, etc.) but MOST are all gone. If you want any of these MST3K shown here (or in the special venue -- see the MST3K Series 3 update for the special venue listings, listed February 29th as an UPDATE) just message me BEFORE changing your pledge on this Kickstarter. If what you want is still available you can then change your pledge amount and add on and I'll update the paperwork). If you have any questions, just let me know!\n-----------------------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks? Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. or a pandemic could sweep through the entire world and cause a slight delay in production (oh... wait a minute!) Otherwise, this is my 25th Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 7 years (including eight different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, two Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, The 100th Anniversary of Zorro and others, MST3K Series one, two and three, Grim Reaper Series one, two and three, and others). I know my way around card publishing and financing production. Manos: The Hands of Fate is nearly entirely designed and since Jackey and I are the ONLY approval process 'chiefs', there will be zero delays for licensing approval 'big shots'. SOME graphics shown above may change but I don't anticipate much, if any, changes.

So you might get a stack of card #1, then a stack of card #16, then #26, etc. There are three steps to putting together sets for packaging:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #62", "update_userinfo": "Progress Report: PRINT DAY.", "update_content": "Watch as Mars Attacks: Uprising comes to life before your eyes!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Progress Report: Proof Printing 2/8/21 + Tattoo Update", "update_content": "All proofing is complete!

Every backer will receive in addition to the KILLER DUDES 2 set and Kickstarter Title Card; the Title Card Magnet, 4 Card Sticker Set to be voted on after the campaign ends, 5 parallel Alternate Look Cards, and 3 Final Girl Cards with their pledge at no extra cost! If you would like additional of any of these items, they're available as Add-ons. Message me for details.\n===============\nIt's been a year since I released the 6th set. It's time to slay a 7th set of FACE CARDS.\nIf you're familiar with all of my previous FACE CARDS Kickstarter campaigns then you should know the quality and passion that I put into each trading card set. For those who are coming into this new, let me tell you what you'll expect...\nMy main objective with each Kickstarter campaign is to raise funds for the printing costs and cover shipping and Kickstarter fees. The majority of the cards have been created and are ready for press. I just need a little financial help to get the ball rolling.\nBy supporting, you'll get the basic KILLER DUDES 2 set PLUS EXCLUSIVE material (rewards) only offered here as a Kickstarter backer!\nAs before, I've opted for a 21 day fundraising period. Please share this with a horror fiend, a friend, and a fan who might also be interested in this collectible item.\nClick to view ALL of the KILLER DUDES No. 2 cards\nTHE CARDS\nEach basic 25 card set has 1 title card and 24 b&w KILLER DUDES 2 portrait cards.\nEvery backer will also receive 1 exclusive 'Kickstarter Funded' title card.\nEvery card has a detailed monstrous portrait on the front and revealing info about the character on the back. The info includes; character's name, actor, movie they were in, director, synopsis, trivia, and poster.\nThe sets do not contain any nudity and are considered \"safe for work.\"\nOnly 500 sets will be produced, the title card will be signed and numbered, and each set will be in its own crystal clear 2 piece slider box.\nThere will be one character per film or tv program in the regular set and possible others in stretch-goal cards. I chose these characters to balance out future KILLER DUDES editions. There are many killer dudes, I will be doing more editions eventually. Something to look forward to!\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nEvery pledge level will have 1 regular KILLER DUDES 2 card set and 1 Kickstarter title card. Pledge levels other than the 'Single Set' will have extra items (see image below). For example, the 'Take 2 Sets' will consist of; 1 KILLER DUDES 2 card set, 1 KS title card, and a set of your choosing. It can be another KILLER DUDES 2 set or one of the other sets. The 'choosing' will happen after the Kickstarter ends, funds are collected, and the survey is emailed out. In the survey, I will ask for your mailing address, your choices, and other FACE CARDS related questions.\nADD-ONS\nThe items below can be added on to your initial pledge. Increase your pledge by adding the item amount to your pledge level. If you have already pledged, there should be a button in the side bar that says \"manage my pledge.\" For example, if you're in the U.S. and you pledge at the ALL 7 SETS ($60 + $14 shipping) level and you want to add-on an Additional Card Set ($10) for a friend, your total pledge will be $84. If that doesn't make sense, please message me for any specific combination questions.\nThe amounts below include shipping for that add-on item.\nAdd-on an extra KILLER DUDES 2 set or add-on sets that you missed. Be sure to mention A) Killer Dudes 2, B) Zombies, C) Vampires, D) Anti-Heroes, E) Creatures, F) Killer Dudes 1, or G) Killer Babes when the 'Survey' is emailed to you at the end of the Kickstarter.\nAs a special Kickstarter ONLY reward, the KILLER DUDES 2 set will be available as Metal Cards! Get them as a Pledge Level or as an Add-on. No where else will you be able to get this limited edition metal set.\nThere are only a few original 4\"x6\" drawings left from all 7 sets. Claim what remain before they're all gone. PLEASE MESSAGE ME DIRECTLY IF YOUR ADD-ON IS FOR ORIGINAL CARD ART. We don't want any one else trying to claim that item. Although most of the original art for this set has been claimed, there are a few from previous sets also available.\nAvailable original art from KILLER DUDES 2\nA - Dr. Phibes (unmasked)\nF - Dr. Hannibal Lecter\nG - Dr. Channard Cenobite\nI - Max Jenke\nQ - Captain Howdy\nT - Leatherface\nY - Dr. Phibes (masked)\nAA - Imotep (Egyptian)\nSTRETCH GOALS\nHere are the Kickstarter EXCLUSIVES that I have planned to give to you at no additional cost. The more the campaign generates, the more free Stretch Goal items I can offer to every backer. Check out the updates for details. Let's see if we reach all of these stretch goals!\nMANY THANKS!\nPlease tell a friend and share on social media to help us reach more stretch goals!\nMore editions of FACE CARDS are planned for the future. But, as I've done in the past, I've left the theme up to the backers in a form of a poll. Expect a new set every 9 months or so!\nCheck out the Facebook page The Art of Byron Winton to see more of my 4x6 drawings, many of which these cards are based on. Follow me on Instagram and Twitter. Lastly, join me on Patreon to support in the creative process and to sign-up for the popular Card-of-the-Month program.\nThank you for your interest and support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the time of the launch, I have a few images left to complete for the set. I plan to have them done before the campaign ends. In doing so, the Available Original Art will reflect their completion.\n\nI given myself enough printer time for an end of March delivery for all the regular set backers. However, in the event that I am unable to ship by March, I will update you with a revised shipping date.\n\nFor those of you getting the 4\"x6\" drawing rewards with your sets, please be patient during the creation of those. I will produce them as quickly as I can without disrupting my current work-load. Depending on the quantity will determine the complete turn around time. I will mail in weekly batches.\n\nI will be adjusting quantities available if necessary.

It featured a loud-mouthed, swearing, old man 'puppet' named Ron yelling and swearing about putting bubbles in his bathwater. It had me laughing so hard I instantly thought it would make a HILARIOUS trading card series. But to my knowledge, no one had ever published a trading card series based on short 2-3 minute videos posted on Facebook ... and certainly no card series with so much foul language. So that right there was reason enough to take this project on. Nick, the creator of Old Man Like Ron, was easy to chat with and we hammered out a deal to get these videos brought to the world of trading cards. And here the project is! Right now!\nIf you've never heard of Old Man Like Ron ... you are MISSING OUT! Head on over to Facebook or Youtube, type in 'OLD MAN LIKE RON' and watch the videos. There are DOZENS of 1-4 minute videos of the absurd, offensive and ludicrous adventures of 'Ron'... everything from taking a bubble bath to having explosive POO after eating curry to being gobsmacked over large boobies on the television. \n https://www.facebook.com/OldManLikeRon/ \nThis trading card series features 24 of the first videos of the Old Man Like Ron series. Each trading card shows a scene from the video on the front ... and on the back the totally uncensored exact dialogue from that video (censored here on the Kickstarter ... but this card series is rated 'MA' because of language and 'adult' ... even if totally immature ... subject matter). To make these sets postpaid for everyone in the world I'm publishing TWO versions: a 'UK' version of 24 cards in 6 4-card panels (so the set can be mailed cheaper than a parcel, meaning I can mail it postpaid and low priced instead of charging $13 postage) ... and a 'US' version of 24 standard size cards. BOTH versions are otherwise identical with all 24 cards represented in each set.  \n Each set comes in it's own specific full color wrapper with checklist printed on the inside.   \nMOTION LENTICULAR CARD:\nEach set comes with a motion lenticular trading card showing an animated sequence of when Ron drops a can of pasta that's tied to his twig and berries.   \nSKETCH CARDS by some of the Trading Card Hobby's Biggest Names!\nCheck out these artist names! There's Adam Everett Beck, Amanda Pattison, Bekki Sharp (the artist who showed me the first 'Ron' video I'd ever seen), Cyrus Sherkat, Dan Tearle, Dave Gaskin, David Day, Floydman, Ingrid Hardy, J. Hammond, Jaime Hitchcock, James Dickson, Jamie Cosley, Junior Bruce, Kevin P. West, Lee Dumarquez, Junior Bruce, Leon Braojos, Lindsey Greyling, Mai Irving, Marsha Parkins, Matthew Hirons, Matthew Stewart, Michael Mastermaker, Quinton Baker, Rees Finlay, Rich Molinelli, Scott Harrell ... and there are also some other artists working on 'Ron' art cards who haven't yet gotten in their work (but are working on it). Because of the wonderful flexibility of the project artists were allowed to GO CRAZY with their art cards and provide some of the most hilarious sketch cards you'll ever see. I'll post examples below.   \n Limited Edition, Numbered Metal Card ... KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE! Will be available only here and now during the Kickstarter.\nThere will be a limited edition numbered metal card created for master set level backers, limited to the number of backers/pre-orders during this 30-day campaign. The metal card will be published by those great people Jacob and Julie at FAERIE METAL! A limited edition metal card will be given to EVERY backer who pledges at the master set level or above. IMAGE ... well, THAT'S a SURPRISE! :-) \n\"SO! Just HOW do I add this FUCKING BRILLIANT card series to MY collection?\" Well, here are the pledge levels and the fun stuff you get with that pledge:\n$2: At the $2 level you get ONE of the promo cards banned by Non Sport Update Magazine (meaning this promo card is RARE!). And it is postpaid anywhere in the world.\n$12: Complete UK Version Set. For $12 you get the complete set of all 24 trading cards in 6 perforated panels all housed in the UK version wrapper. PLUS you get the LENTICULAR MOTION card PLUS the promo card! ALL postpaid anywhere in the world!\n$12: Complete US Version Set. For $12 you get the complete set of all 24 trading cards all housed in the US version wrapper. PLUS you get the LENTICULAR MOTION card PLUS the Promo card! All postpaid anywhere in the world. \n$20: At this level you get ONE of the complete UK version card sets PLUS ONE of the complete US version card sets (each with a lenticular motion card of course). PLUS a promo card. Postpaid in the US.\n$36: THE MASTER SET LEVEL!  At this level you get the UK complete set, the US complete set (all in their own wrappers) PLUS a lenticular motion card, ALL promo cards to be published for this card series PLUS a genuine original art sketch card, PLUS both the US and the UK version wrappers in unused/unfolded condition. Postpaid in the US.\n$62: DOUBLE the FUN! At the $62 level you get DOUBLE everything in the master set level. TWO of the UK sets, TWO of the US sets, TWO lenticular motion cards, TWO of all promo cards to be published for this card series AND two unused wrappers for EACH of the two series (US and UK) ...  PLUS  TWO original art sketch cards (each sketch card will be a different artist). Postpaid in the US.\n$95: TRIPLE PLUS!  At the $85 level you get THREE master sets of everything (THREE times the $36 master set level) but instead of THREE sketch cards you get FOUR original art sketch cards (each one by a different artist). The ideal level for those who want to have a master set PLUS 4 original art sketch cards ... and also extra sets to give as gifts to your friends and family who aren't easily offended by foul-mouthed humor. \nThis Kickstarter will run until December 25th ... and it ends at 8pm PST on CHRISTMAS NIGHT! \n\nQuestions  and Answers:\nQ:  I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do  I go about it?\nA:  Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter. If you are unable  to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no  worries.\n---------------\nQ:  When will the \"Old Man Like Ron\" Trading Card Series ship?\nA:  The 24-card UK and US version sets, wrappers, lenticulars AND sketch cards are ALL DONE, HERE, RIGHT NOW! I have just a couple special promo cards to have produced yet and plan on doing that next week. So what does this mean? What it means is that on December 25th this Kickstarter ends ... about 10 days later Kickstarter funds everyone's pledges ... and once everything is funded I will ship. So basically, 10 days after this Kickstarter ends I'll be shipping out packages. Just be sure to provide your mailing address after the Kickstarter is over (no worries, I send out mailing address surveys after a Kickstarter finishes). \n---------------------\nQ:  I'm OCD and want a pack to keep sealed and a pack to open. How do I back on two packs? Or two 'Master Sets'?\nA:  There's already a level for pledging on multiple master sets. Now, if you wanted a master set and 2 regular sets ... or a master set and an extra UK pack set, that's easy -- just pledge on the pledge level that is CLOSE to what you want and then message me and i'll walk you through how to adjust your pledge so you get everything you want.  \n----------------- ADD ON GOODIES:\nIf you want something not listed ... or a different combination ... or just whatever customized pledge level you had in mind ... just let me know and if it's possible we'll do it.  And of course if you have any questions just ask! My goal is to make sure you have fun with your collection and it's everything you want it to be.\n-----------------------\nIf  you have a question not answered here please just ask -- you can message me  directly through Kickstarter and I will respond as quickly as possible. It is  better to message me than to post a comment. Kickstarter shows me MESSAGES as  soon as they are posted but is not consistent with showing me 'comments' (plus Kickstarter will show me someone has commented ... but they don't show me where the comment is -- if it is a comment on an update please note there are 100s of updates spread over 20 different Kickstarters ... meaning a 'comment' is a needle in the haystack. If you want me to see your comment, question, etc. send it as a MESSAGE).  If you can't figure out how to  message on Kickstarter then just contact me through my RRParksCARDS.com website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges Risks? Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. Otherwise, this is my 24th Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 6 years (including eight different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, two Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, am currently finishing up Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series Three and others). I know my way around card publishing and financing production. And for this project, the cards and wrappers and lenticular motion card AND the sketch cards are actually IN HAND right now! The only thing left to do is to produce the couple few promo cards I have in mind. Otherwise, everything is produced and waiting here! Please note: AFTER this Kickstarter ends and right before I start shipping I'm going to send out what's called a 'mailing address survey' email through Kickstarter (everyone will automatically get a survey and Kickstarter will alert you when it is available PLUS I will post updates letting everyone know ... be sure to fill that out and message it back to me when the time comes so there's no delays in mailing your package.

And WELCOME to our SIXTH annual HALLOWEEN TRADING CARD EVENT!\nHAPPY HALLOWEEN from RRParks CARDS! We're wrapping up our sixth year as a trading card company as well as our sixth Halloween as a publisher. Every October we publish some fun spoooooky and creepy horror and monster card sets.  This Halloween is no different except that we have added a selection of truly bizarre 'baseball' and 'sports' cards to the lineup ... but not your typical sports cards (because that wouldn't be weird enough!).  Your pledge on this project helps with production costs and will make sure you get ALL the CARD SERIES as well as exclusives.\nUnlike last year I'm going into this Kickstarter with the plan of mailing all Halloween packages in time for Halloween (last year just got too hectic). Some of the cards of this Halloween have already been printed and here already... others have just been sent to printing ... and some I have to have produced when the Kickstarter ends (such as the limited edition ETCHING and METAL cards which have production numbers determined by the number of backers ... making such cards VERY rare and NEVER to be reprinted). AND, of course, I've already started assembling the traditional RRParksCARDS Halloween 'trick or treat' goodie bags for backers that will accompany most pledge levels.\nSo, what card series are happening this year?\nHalloween Trick or Treat Series SEVEN!\nHalloween Trick or Treat Series Seven features 12 different SPOOOOOKY vintage Halloween masterpieces (24 wonderful images) on glossy cards with black borders. All housed in a wrapper.\n Monster Choke 'n Gag Series Five \nContinuing the Monster Choke 'n Gag series -- which was the first card series I published under my then-new company RRParks CARDS -- comes series five. 29 different 1960s style midgee and triplix panel cards. This time the focus is on Attack of the Giant Leeches (featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000) with 57 'riffed scenes' including a checklist back card. All in their own wrapper with bonus cards.\nQuatermass and the Pit\nPerhaps you've never heard of Quatermas and the Pit... but you HAVE heard of the movie FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH. Well, almost 10 years before that classic Hammer film was released, the BBC did a 6-hour, 6-part miniseries called Quatermass and the Pit. It is one of my all time favorite science fiction / horror movies and I'm continuing the series started last year ... this is series two and features the 2nd episode of the BBC production. When construction workers begin work on a new housing development they discover strange fossil skulls ... a paleontologist gets wind of the find and with the assistance of Professor Quatermass and the professor's nemesis, Colonel Breen, the 3 set out to investigate the strange fossils in the pit. And it is quickly determined that they, and the strange cylinder found with them, are not what they seem. Stay tuned -- Halloween 2020 will have Quatermass and the Pit series three!\n1960s style NASA 3D Tribute Card ... PLUS pair of 3D glasses!\nPaying tribute to NASA seemed fitting this year which marked the anniversary of the Apollo moon landing. So I commissioned Christian LeBlanc (anaglyph 3D maestro of MST3K Series 1, 2, and 3 as well as Sharknado Series 1 and 'The 100th Anniversary of Zorro') to do a special 3D back of one of my favorite astronauts (or 'astrochimp'). It is being created 'retro-stalgic style' to capture some of the feel of a 1960s card.\nPrehistoric Perils of Golf -- the classic 1920s cards NO ONE can ever find or afford!\nAn exceedingly rare sport/non-sport set of the 1920s is 'Perils of Golf'. Unless you have MANY $$$'s, this card series is just out of reach of most collectors. As the original series was produced blank on the back I've taken that space and designed in the equally classic, rare and pricey 'Tobin Lithograph Baseball' set from 1887 showing comical baseball players of the late 19th century. These are being published 'retro-stalgic' style, too!\n1882 H804-11 Cosack and Company 'Circled Position' complete set of NINE!\nNot quite as 'weird' as some 19th century sports sets, this one is more ... PRE-MAINSTREAM 'classic' and a truly beautiful early baseball set that ... like other 19th century baseball sets ... is ludicrously expensive when it can be found. But here's an affordable, retro-style complete set of all 9 (with vintage advertising on the backs). Even if one isn't a sports card collector the eye appeal of this set of cards is still likely to be of interest. \nThe 1880s H804-15A 'Red Line' Baseball set (with 1880 'Baby Talk' baseball on reverse).\nIf I were ever to collect 19th century sports cards, THESE would be the two sets I started out with. But because I'm not filthy, stinky rich (as Zoidberg would say \"Two out of three just doesn't cut it!\") I haven't, can't and most likely won't. But since I want them in my collection I'm making it possible for EVERYONE to afford this set. And here they are ... all 10 of them! The red border series on the front and 'Baby Talk' on the back. Retro-style printed? But of COURSE they are!\nThe 1878 and 1880 FORBES 'Comic Baseball' and 'Baseball Injuries' 6-card set!\nAnother classic series of the golden (or platinum?) age of baseball cards ... 'comic' and 'injuries'. Produced retro-stalgic style this complete 6 card set features 'comics' on the front and 'injuries' on the back.\nKickstarter Exclusive 'Master Set' Level Metal Cards\nFor Master Set backers we've got not ONE but TWO Kickstarter Exclusive DEMONIC metal cards. One features a devilish creature surrounded by witches  ...and the other my own interpretation of 'GOLEM' etching I created in the 1990s during my brief career as a comic book artist for a comic book called 'Demon Child' ... the etching was done as a promotional piece for the comic book and I sold the etchings at comic book conventions. And here's the artwork for it produced on quality metal by those fine folks at Faerie Metal -- Jacob and Julie Stem. These metal cards will be limited to ONLY the number of Master Set backers (plus a set for myself of course) and will never be reprinted. \nTHREE Genuine HAND PULLED Horror Etching cards by RRParks\nBack in the 1990s I used to do copper plate etching ... a fun art method involving nitric acid, ammonia, spirits and thinners, resin, carnuba wax lit tapers, soot and other fun and lethal chemicals. Here are 3 different works I'm replating as trading card size: 'Bog Head', 'Final Sniff' and 'Frankenstein's Monster'. These, like the metal cards, will be limited to ONLY the number of Master Backers who pledge on that level and backs will have signed and numbered certificates of authenticity. Backers are NOT limited to only one master set ... but when this Kickstarter ends, ONLY those who pledged on the Master Set will ever get a set of these. My 'plan' this year is to actually take photos of the etching process ... and post the photos as an update when I start creating the cards. \nGENUINE PRINTING PLATES\nAs has become tradition over here, my annual Halloween card series Kickstarters include at least ONE genuine printing plate for Master Set backers. MOST of the cards this year will be produced and ordered to include printing plates for each card. And you GET ONE with your pledge! Each will have a certificate of authenticity on the back.\nRARE and EXCLUSIVE PROMO CARDS available nowhere else!\nI don't have a photo to show you yet, but as Kickstarter backers on my Halloween campaigns already know, I produce exclusive promo cards for the annual event. Some are destined to be sent to The Wrapper and given our sparingly to resubscribers of that magazine ... while other promos will be available ONLY HERE and ONLY NOW! Planned are 4 'Wrapper' promos and about 5 other promo cards destined ONLY for Kickstarter backers. So if you like promo cards ... and LOVE really rare promo cards, then you'll want them all and you'll get them all at the Master Set level.\nBONUS STUFF!\nThose pledging on the MASTER SET will get BONUS GOODIES including a printing plate, progressive proof, error card and bonus cards. PLUS, of course, the usual little 'goodie bag' with some Halloween tricks and treats inside (See? You CAN be over 30 and still get a little treat bag for Halloween!).\nCREEPY CELL CARDS!\nFor Master Pledge levels backers will get a Grim Reaper cell card and a Halloween Trick or Treat cell card.  I started the annual RRParksCARDS Halloween cell cards last year ... and this year I continue with them.\nPledge Levels:\n$3. For $3 you get ONE of the rare Wrapper promo cards and my thanks for supporting this Halloween Kickstarter.\nBASIC SETS PLEDGE: At $30 you get ONE of each of the 2019's sets including Halloween Trick or Treat Series 7, Monster Choke 'n Gag Series 6, Quatermass and the Pit Series 2 -- all of which come in their own wrapper 'pack set'.

All treats -- No tricks!).\nIf you don't see the exact pledge level you'd like to back just message me and we'll piece one together for you.\nADD ONS:\nAs I've posted before, because my production year is really 'jammed' and hectic, the ONLY TIME to get past Halloween sets is during the Halloween Kickstarter. If there are sets you missed and wanted, NOW is the time. Such sets include Halloween Trick or Treat series 1,2 , 3, 4, 5, and 6 ... Monster Choke 'n Gag series 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ...

Three Stooges (there were 8 series, most probably still available ... but some are REALLY close to sold out) ... MST3K Series 1 and 2 ... MIGHT be able to conjure up a Sharknado series 1 ... If you missed out on 'The 100th Anniversary of Zorro' regular box, just let me know. I do my best to work things out with everyone and the only time I can't is when something is completely sold out.  Message me about something you're seeking and if I still have it, you can 'add on' to your pledge at the original release price. \nRisks and challenges", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 23rd Kickstarter ...

At this 10-box level you are guaranteed TEN sketch cards!\n\nQuestions  and Answers:\nQ:  I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do  I go about it?  \nA:  Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter. If you are unable  to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no  worries. \n--------------- \nQ:  When will the \"100th Anniversary of Zorro\" Trading Card Series ship? \nA:  The current schedule and plan is to ship the end of September or early October. This series, though, is a complicated one so if things get hectic with coordinating many different printing companies and licensing approvals and other moving part then delays MIGHT happen. But most of you know me pretty well by now that if I'm late for some reason getting shipping done I keep everyone informed and do my best to be on time. I'm good about  posting updates and communications so will keep everyone in the loop.  I do,  though, ask for patience in advance. This is my 22nd Kickstarter and I've published over 30 different trading card series in the last 5 years ... so I've got decent experience and am generally accurate when it comes to shipping and production deadlines and timeframes. \n --------------------- \nQ:  I'm OCD and want a box to keep sealed and a box to open. How do I back on two  boxes? Or two 'Master Sets'?  \nA:  If you want more than one pledge level just back the pledge level you want ...  then once you've pledged you can review your pledge and ADD to your pledge  amount. Be SURE to message me if you do this explaining what you did. I'll check  and make sure it's done right and you'll be fine. The way I believe it's done is  after you pledge you click to view/manage your pledge and then you change the  amount of your pledge to reflect everything you want in your package. So, for  example, if you want to pledge on two master sets you just pledge on ONE ... After  your pledge is entered you can click on view/manage your pledge and change the  amount of your pledge to reflect adding on additional goodies.\n----------------- \nQ:  Why are you running this as a Kickstarter instead of selling at a comic shop or  through a catalog? \nA:  This is my 22nd Kickstarter over the last 5 years. I've found that pre-selling a  card series on Kickstarter allows me to determine a proper production run of  cards and boxes (especially special production cards that are pricey to do ... such as metal cards). It also allows me to offer 'master sets' to collectors on a  limited basis. Once the Kickstarter is done I will have a good idea of what the  total 'sealed box' needs will be for a production run to provide Kickstarter  backers AND other customers and resellers (when the series is offered through distributors and  retail outlets). A Kickstarter also lets me get card series to serious  collectors FIRST before ANYONE else. Plus a Kickstarter allows me to exercise  some flexibility on providing 'bonus stuff' for backers ... once the Kickstarter is  over the only planned retail/wholesale activity for series three is simply the basic sealed box with 180 cards and some chase cards ... and as mentioned, MASTER SETS will be for sale ONLY during the Kickstarter. \nADD ON GOODIES:\n If you want something not listed just let me know and if it's possible we'll do it. Add On prices are postpaid in the US. If you're outside the US let me know before doing the add on so I can research postage costs to your country. And of course if you have any questions just ask! My goal is to make sure you have fun with your collection and it's everything you want it to be. \n----------------------- \nIf  you have a question not answered here please just ask -- you can message me  directly through Kickstarter and I will respond as quickly as possible. It is  better to message me than to post a comment. Kickstarter shows me MESSAGES as  soon as they are posted but is not consistent with showing me 'comments' (plus Kickstarter will show me someone has commented ... but they don't show me where the comment is -- if it is a comment on an update please note there are 100s of updates spread over 20 different Kickstarters ... meaning a 'comment' is a needle in the haystack. If you want me to see your comment, question, etc. send it as a MESSAGE).  If you can't figure out how to  message on Kickstarter then just contact me through my RRParksCARDS.com website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nRisks? Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. Otherwise, this is my 22nd Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 5 years (including eight different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, two Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, am currently finishing up Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series Three and others). I know my way around card publishing and financing production. The \"100th Anniversary of Zorro\" is almost entirely designed and at licensing for final approvals and revisions (plus I need to format the Lenticular Motion cards which won't take much time and I'll be doing that during the Kickstarter campaign) . Depending on licensing's 'revisions' SOME graphics shown above may change.

See Kickstarter description). BUT... ALL boxes should have a complete card set #'d 1-180. So I'm going to ask all backers here that IF something is missing from that #1-180 card set they should message me here through Kickstarter messages.

The BIG ONE! Mystery  Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards Series THREE is COMING! And SOON, TOO! And this is the Kickstarter campaign where you have your chance to add not just a BOX but also a MASTER SET and EXCLUSIVES available ONLY HERE and NOW to your collection. Current plan  is to have the series released late September or early October (there are a LOT of moving parts and this is our most COMPLEX card series ever -- but this is when I hope to release the cards to everyone who pledges on during this limited timeframe). And Series Three picks up right  where Series Two left off. While the First and Second series of MST3K Trading Cards' base  sets covered the Invention Exchanges and Experiments of the first SEVEN seasons (plus the KTMA series),  this THIRD series covers original seasons eight, nine and ten ... PLUS the REVIVAL seasons eleven and twelve (The Gauntlet).  So every character is here: Joel, Mike, Jonah, Dr. Forrester, Dr. Erhardt, TV's Frank, Pearl, Bobo, Observer, Kinga, Max, Tom, Cro-o-o-ow, Gypsy, Cambot ... and everyone else including guest appearances. \nThe  entire third series is designed and already through the first stages of the approval process (at this very minute Joel himself is reviewing the 500+ cards!). I will be starting production of some of the more challenging cards while this Kickstarter is running ... and afterwards, when funding takes place, I'll be sending the rest to press.  And as we did in the first and second MST3K Trading Card Kickstarters,  there will be cards ONLY available for those who pledge during this campaign. This pre-order opportunity is planned to run through July 31st. \nMST3K Trading Cards Series Three isn't just  larger than Series One or Two but it might also be one of the largest non-sport trading  card series ever published with over 500 different cards to collect.  A 'box' pledge has most of these cards (including complete base and subsets) and a 'master set' pledge has all the base and subsets and more (see below for details) \nHere's  a visual 'grand tour' of the series:     MYSTERY  SCIENCE THEATER 3000 Series Three Trading cards features: \nExample of 'Experiment' card\n A  68-card \"Experiment\" base set -- every experiment of the 8th, 9th, 10th ... and 11th and 12th seasons of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The card fronts feature a classic scene from the show and the backs  of the cards cover the movie title, release date, air date, host, director,  stars, synopsis, classic riff and trivia.  \nExamples of 'Invention Exchange Cards'\nA  42-card \"Invention Exchange\" base set -- every invention of seasons 11 and 12 (as there were no Invention Exchanges in seasons 8, 9 and 10)  ... With  each card featuring the invention on the front and on the back of the card is  the dialogue of the Invention Exchange. \nExample of the front and back of Riff It! cards.\nA  27-card 'Riff It' cards subset featuring a scene from a movie featured on the show  along with a hilarious riff ... and on the back? Another scene with space for  you to write your OWN riff. These are done in old timey stock. \nSpecial 9-card set of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: THE MOVIE\nThere will be 9 different MST3K: The Movie cards to collect with fun scenes from the film featuring Mike, Tom, Crow, Gypsy and, of course, Dr. Clayton Forrester. Glossy 16pt production with backs having the cast and crew given their proper due respect.\nExamples of the 'Planet of a Million Monkeys' subset featuring Pearl, Bobo and Observer ... and a few others.\nMST3K seasons 8, 9 and 10 featuring the misadventures in space and time of Pearl, Bobo and Observer and so this special subset features the various locations Pearl and her 'pals' journeyed -- the planet where apes evolved from men, the brain guys' 'world', strange planets, Roman world, courtroom, Castle Forrester, etc. On the backs is dialogue related to the image on the front of the card. 65 cards chronicling their adventures.\nExamples of Steve Vance's beautiful and beloved artwork on 'mini poster' cards with DVD Menu Art on the backs.\nA  37-card special subset featuring MST3K iconic mini movie posters from the Shout!  Factory DVD releases ... and terrific DVD menu art on the card backs. Steve  Vance (artist) has personally helped in obtaining high res images of his poster  art so the cards can look as lovely as you hope they'll look.  AND (let's just see who is reading all this, shall we?) Steve Vance has generously provided his time and talents to create a special EXCLUSIVE COOL ITEM for this series (he is working on it right now -- he showed me the rough draft and it is beyond nerd-cool ... it is GEEK-COOL!). \nExamples of the Spot UV Glossed GIZMONICS, GADGETS, and GUESTS subset cards\nThese terrific cards -- 64 of them -- feature the 'spot UV' technique of card production where part of the image is high gloss (giving the cards a FUN extra 'dimension'). For those who collected my Sharknado series, you know what these will look like. These cards feature iconic guests, strange gadgets, space ships, and more with fun 9-card puzzle backs (so they'll display nicely in your 9-pocket binder pages). \nExample of Macarie Claudiu's brilliant Limited Edition Portrait Art Cards\nMacarie has returned once again to RRParks CARDS to create 17 NEW portraits for the Limited Edition Portrait Art Cards. For those on Facebook who participated in the poll to decide on which actors should be in this series I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. And yes, as you can see, Dr. Erhardt finally gets a portrait card!  \nExample of one of the 36 different 3D cards (yes -- get your 3D glasses out and take a look!)\nThe incredible Christian LeBlanc has returned to MST3K Trading Cards and provides us with 36 brand new 3D cards for this series. And they are MAGICAL! And of course if you lost your 3D glasses from series 2 don't worry -- a pair of 3D glasses comes in the 'box' or 'master set'.\nExamples of Elizabetta Stoinich art for the BOX TOPPERS\nWhen I published Chronicles of the Three Stooges I commissioned the mega-talented Elizabetta Stoinich (our 'artist in Rome') to do portraits of the Three Stooges. So impressed was I with her skills I brought her back for MST3K Series Three. Aren't those lovely!!! Watercolor and coffee is her choice of paint. Nine different standard box topper cards (and for 'master set' backers -- oh, just a little something extra!).\nExample of RETRO designed Spot UV Character Cards by Jason Crosby\nNine different Character Cards to collect with artwork by one of the hobby's most popular artists -- Jason Crosby. Brilliant artwork AND with an added Spot UV production feature. \nDiecut PUNCH OUT Nanite Cards!\nI'd been talking with friends and fellow publishers about doing these (am sure they are sick of me talking about it). These are being done regular card size (extra thick cards) with TWO different Nanites per card that you can punch out and the put back when done doing whatever it is you'd DO with a Nanite. I've never tried this type of production before so this is a 'first' for RRParks CARDS. \nExample of Lenticular Motion card (impossible to show the effect on a computer screen)\nOooohhhh do I have high hopes for these! MOTION LENTICULAR cards -- not just one but NINE DIFFERENT featuring motion effects of scenes and bits from POOPIE! This is another 'first' for RRParks CARDS. \nExamples of the Sketch Art Gallery PROMO CARDS!\nFor MST3K Series Two we produced the LARGEST promo card series ever ... at 63 cards. So why stop at already producing the largest promo series when Series Three can have even MORE! 90 of these beautiful cards by DOZENS of artists. \nExamples of the MST3K Sticker Chase Cards!\nThe very first 'cards' I collected as a kid were the Wacky Package stickers in 1973/1974 ... and the first trading card series I actually collected in packs had a sticker subset (I won't mention here what series THAT was ... let's just say a wookie featured prominently). So for MST3K Series Three I really wanted to have a set of stickers. Ten different of them, too! Chances are NO ONE is actually going to peel them off and stick them on their notebooks or bikes, but they ARE stickers. Every box will have at least one ... and of course 'master sets' will have all TEN!\nExamples of just THREE of the different Artists' Sketch Cards\nSome of the most popular cards in the MST3K Trading Card projects have been original art sketch cards ~ so of COURSE Series Three will have sketch cards (one in every 'box' and of course one in every 'master set'). Over FIFTY different artists have sketch cards destined for MSt3K Series Three. On the inside of one of the wrappers you'll get you'll find a complete list of ALL the artists that are involved in the MST3K trading card production (many of these artists have become great friends and are coming back for my Old Man Like Ron series coming up... and The 100th Anniversary of Zorro (that I'm doing right after MST3K Series Three). As most of you have seen, MST3K sketch cards are popular ... SO popular in fact that they sell on eBay and online for $80-$120 on average (with some fetching upwards of $200 on ebay)... so do the math: a 'box' pledge is $85 and is guaranteed a sketch card. \nExamples of progressive proofs (actual colors may differ when printed)\nProgressive Proofs are on the task list for this production -- just like Series Two. And all 'box' and 'master set' backers will get at LEAST one progressive proof. For Series Two the colors were Magenta, Cyan and Yellow. What will Series Three colors be? We'll just have to wait and see won't we!\nExample of printing plates (actual colors and intensities will vary)\nAs with Series One and Series Two, Series Three will once again include printing plates! Each plate is UNIQUE ... for any given card there's only ONE cyan, ONE magenta, ONE yellow and ONE black. So each printing plate is UNIQUE -- there's only ONE of them! Some boxes will include one ... all master set backers will get one.\nJoel, Trace, Frank, Bill, Kevin, Jim, J. Elvis, Mary Jo ... with some scarce dual autos of Trace & Frank, Bill and Kevin, Kevin and Bill\n\nThe most complicated and time consuming part of MST3K Series Three was obtaining the original actors AUTOGRAPHS on special production METAL CARDS. None of that 'on sticker' type of stuff -- these cards were actually held and signed by Joel, Trace, Frank, J. Elvis, Kevin, Bill, Mary Jo and Jim Mallon. And through some clever coordination and a rare moment of genius the BACKS of the autograph cards will have a certificate of authenticity attached with a photo of the actor actually signing the autograph cards! I asked my best friend and fellow publisher what do master sets usually include -- and he informed me a master set typically requires ONE autograph card. Which is a good thing because some actors would only sign a certain number of cards. I had a choice -- I could provide a very small number of collectors a complete set of autographs OR I could afford to provide EACH collector ('box' or 'master set') with ONE autograph card so that EVERYONE can have at least ONE autograph card for their collection (am sure on the Facebook Group page collectors can trade with someone else to make sure everyone gets the actor they want). But for this campaign and pre-sell if you pledge on a BOX or a MASTER SET you will get ONE random autograph card. Some collectors will randomly receive a DUAL autograph card (Trace and Frank ... or Trace and J. Elvis ... or Bill and Kevin 'Crow and Tom' or 'Bobo and Observer'). All the combinations and varieties will be listed on the inside of one of the wrappers. OH! And there's even a 'special guest' autograph card possible (I won't say WHO ... let's just say 'The Master would approve!' and leave it at that). This is only the second time an RRParks CARDS series features autographs (because I'm not filthy rich to afford this sort of thing very often)... the first series I published with autograph cards was Gary Saves the Graveyard (which featured the 7 main actors and the director of the webisodes). Very excited about this part of MST3K Series Three.\nBox Topper Mini Clipouts\nAnyone who collected MST3K Series One or Series Two already knows I'm a big fan of packaging clipout cards. Probably from me youth when cereal or pizza boxes would have cards on the packaging to clipout. And so MST3K Series One and Two ... and now Three ... will have boxes with mini clipout cards showing the MST3K entrance/title sequences. And because a box only has so much surface area (and there were several difference title sequences) I had to EXPAND the surface area of the box by including EIGHT (only four shown above) panels EACH with 5 mini clipout cards ... covering ALL title/intro sequences. So if you're getting a 'box' or a 'master set' you'll have the mini cards to clip out on the box PLUS an additional EIGHT panels as a BONUS. \n And there you have it! The GRAND VISUAL TOUR of what's coming ... and what you'll get ... for your MST3K Trading Card Collection! Over 500 different cards including some pretty darn nifty SPECIAL PRODUCTION diecut Nanites, Lenticular Motions, Spot UVs, Limited Editions, Stickers and Autographs and more. My LARGEST and more COMPLEX card series to date.  Here (below) is a chart showing contents for 'box' collectors and 'master set' collectors:\n\nIn the chart above you'll see the guaranteed contents of a MST3K Series Three Box and a MST3K Series Three MASTER SET. Boxes are guaranteed all the fun stuff shown plus some rare and chase cards ... and Master Sets are guaranteed ALL the sets and subsets. See chart below:\nEach  and every full, sealed box of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards  carries 36 packs (that's right... not 18 or 24 packs holding 4 or 5 cards each like other industry averages) and each pack as 10 different cards. Boxes will have NO DUPLICATES! Every pack has 10 different cards from any other pack. So a box of 36 10 card packs holds at least 360 cards plus the box toppers, a metal and an autograph card. Master sets will have all 500 different cards plus at least one autograph card and additional exclusives and bonuses. master backers will receive unused wrappers inside their box. \nAs a BONUS, the MST3K  retail box  features something NO other publisher provides: Printed  right on the box are 36 different mini double-sided clip-out cards in FULL color  front and back on super glossy stock. It's almost like getting a FREE 36  card special subset. Oh wait, it IS like that EXACTLY! Each  pack wrapper features a complete checklist printed on the inside showing you all  the cards to look for to complete your set. \nSO  HOW DO I GET ALL THIS AMAZING STUFF AND SATIATE MY DIRE NEED FOR MST3K  COLLECTIBLES??? \nIt's  easy. You'll notice there are many different pledge levels -- levels to fit all  collector budgets.  \nLevel  1: $2 You get ONE promo card for the MST3K Series Three Trading Card collection.  \nLevel  2: $5 You  get FIVE different promo cards for the MST3K Series Three Trading Card  collection. \nLevel  3: $12 You  get THREE sealed packs of cards. Each pack contains 10 different cards. Consider  this a 'sampler' level. And you'll also get a promo card, too.  \nLevel  4: $85 You  get a FULL SEALED BOX of 36 10-card packs. Guaranteed to contain everything listed in the chart above. 360 different cards plus the box topper goodies (mini clipout cards, 1 metal box topper card and 1 autograph card. Plus a pair of 3D glasses.\nLevel  5: $175  At  this level you get a MASTER SET. What's in a MASTER SET? Take a look at the chart above showing everything! And I'm sure that during production there may end up being some additional goodies.  500 cards will barely fit inside the box  unwrapped so it's going to be one REALLY thick, heavy box of cards -- all ready  for you to load into your card collection (you'll want a lot of 9-pocket pages  for THIS rascal!). And I might even have some more surprises for you depending  on pledge levels.  This is the level you want if you're a super fan and gotta  have EVERYTHING. IMPORTANT: A 'master set' will ONLY be available during this  Kickstarter pre-sell ... and during the Kickstarter I MAY have to limit the  number of these available (so you may want to jump on this one fast before the  option is gone).   \nLevel  6: $220. This level is a combination of Level 4 and Level 5 -- at this  level you get a 36-pack box AND a master set. This way your master set gives you  ALL the cards... and you still have a 36-pack sealed box to either open packs,  save for a rainy day, give as a gift, use as a boat anchor or whatever else your  imagination can come up with. At this level you are guaranteed at least TWO original art sketch cards and TWO genuine autograph cards plus bonus goodies.\nLevel  7: $320 Four  Box Case Level. At this level you get FOUR sealed 36-pack boxes. And yes, that means FOUR original art sketch cards and FOUR genuine MST3K actor autograph cards (all different actors guaranteed!).  A great level for  those who want to build sets and have duplicate sets to sell on ebay or give to  a friend or simply keep because you're greedy and fiending for cards... a great  level for those who love the thrill of seeking rare chase and hit cards. As a BONUS, those who get the Four Box Case  Level will get some guaranteed bonus stuff like uncut panels, additional  printing plates, error and freak cards (I won't know what errors or oddballs  I'll have until AFTER printing production... but virtually every printing  production does end up with some oddball cards and with a production job this  big am sure we'll have errors, freaks and oddballs), and more. Hurry on over to  the local store and grab a barrel full of bubble gum as this level will keep you  busy for HOURS!   \nLevel  8: $600 DOUBLE  the 'Four Box Case Level'. You get every everything in Level 6...DOUBLED. So  that's EIGHT boxes and all those goodies. And you are guaranteed to get not only 8 original art sketch cards (that sell on ebay for an average of $80-$100 each ... yea, do the math on that!) BUT I will guarantee that all 8 of the autgraph cards you get will be one from each actor: Joel, Trace, Frank, J. Elvis, Bill, Kevin, Mary Jo and Jim Mallon. This level is a pricey one ... but just the sketch cards alone are worth the whole amount!\nQuestions  and Answers:\nQ:  I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do  I go about it?  A:  Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter. If you are unable  to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no  worries. \n--------------- \nQ:  When will the MST3K Trading Card Series ship? A:  The current schedule and plan is to ship the end of September. This series, though, is the most complicated one I've published so far so if things get hectic with coordinating almost a dozen different publishers delays MIGHT happen. But most of you know me pretty well by now that if I'm late for some reason getting shipping done I keep everyone informed and do my best to be on time. I'm good about  posting updates and communications so will keep everyone in the loop.  I do,  though, ask for patience in advance ... this is the first time I've published a  trading card series this large involving so MANY moving parts.   \n --------------------- \nQ:  I'm OCD and want a box to keep sealed and a box to open. How do I back on two  boxes? Or two 'Master Sets'?  A:  If you want more than one pledge level just back the pledge level you want ...  then once you've pledged you can review your pledge and ADD to your pledge  amount. Be SURE to message me if you do this explaining what you did. I'll check  and make sure it's done right and you'll be fine. The way I believe it's done is  after you pledge you click to view/manage your pledge and then you change the  amount of your pledge to reflect everything you want in your package. So, for  example, if you want to pledge on two master sets you just pledge on ONE. After  your pledge is entered you can click on view/manage your pledge and change the  amount of your pledge to reflect adding on additional goodies.\n----------------- \nQ:  Why are you running this as a Kickstarter instead of selling at a comic shop or  through a catalog? A:  This is my 20th Kickstarter over the last 4 years. I've found that pre-selling a  card series on Kickstarter allows me to determine a proper production run of  cards and boxes (especially special production cards that are pricey to do ... such as metal cards). It also allows me to offer 'master sets' to collectors on a  limited basis. Once the Kickstarter is done I will have a good idea of what the  total 'sealed box' needs will be for a production run to provide Kickstarter  backers AND other customers (when the series is offered through distributors and  retail outlets). A Kickstarter also lets me get card series to serious  collectors FIRST before ANYONE else. Plus a Kickstarter allows me to exercise  some flexibility on providing 'stuff' for backers ... once the Kickstarter is  over the only planned retail/wholesale activity for series three is simply retail  boxes of 36 packs (and ONLY boxes pledged on during a Kickstarter are guaranteed an autograph and sketch card both in the same box).  \nADD ON GOODIES:\n If you want something not listed just let me know and if it's possible we'll do it. Add On prices are postpaid in the US. If you're outside the US let me know before doing the add on so I can research postage costs to your country. And of course if you have any questions just ask! My goal is to make sure you have fun with your collection and it's everything you want it to be. \nIt is my intention during the Kickstarter to create some special Kickstarter-exclusive 'add on' options (original production art, progressive proofs, uncut sheets, etc.). So watch for updates throughout this Kickstarter. I\n----------------------- \nIf  you have a question not answered here please just ask -- you can message me  directly through Kickstarter and I will respond as quickly as possible. It is  better to message me than to post a comment.

Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. Otherwise, this is my 20th Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 5 years (including eight different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, two Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, am currently finishing up The 100th Anniversary of Zorro and others). I know my way around card publishing and financing production. MST3K Series Three is entirely designed and at licensing for final approvals and revisions. Depending on licensing's 'revisions' (which are usually modest) SOME graphics shown above may change but I don't anticipate much if any changes. The lenticulars and the nanite diecuts are brand new to me but the details have been worked out. And ALL 100% of the autograph cards are here. So risks and challenges have all been minimized. \n\n\n\n You'll NEVER be left wondering \"what's going on\" because I post regular updates and keep in contact with EVERYONE. Please note: AFTER this Kickstarter ends and right before I start shipping I'm going to send out what's called a 'mailing address survey' ... be sure to fill that out and message it back to me when the time comes so there's no delays in mailing your package. Okay? Okay!). While there are always risks and challenges with production, logistics or even crossing the street I have years of experience publishing trading cards and conducting Kickstarter campaigns.

It means that it is simply not cost effective for us to produce the post cards on a small scale.  And since they are part of the master set, it would mean a HUGE delay in sending out cards versus getting the post cards in the hands of master set backers.  \nThe only logical step forward is to withdraw the Kickstarter now, about two weeks before it ends.  It makes sense to do this now, before we potentially disappoint more people.  The trading cards will be available for direct purchase after printing.  No money collected in advance.  We will be offering the post cards at a MUCH later date.  We'll send out updates as each is available so please continue to follow this Kickstarter even after it ends.\nThanks for your interested in Florida Man.  He will be back and better than ever.\nThe Adventures of Florida Man\nThe Nation's favorite ne'er-do-well comes to life, bringing his crazy antics to life in this exciting collection of art.  Featuring \"ripped from the headlines\" stories (with a fair amount of artistic freedom given to protect the innocent), the adventures of Florida Man know no limit.  This series, however, does:  it will contain 9 fantastic events brought to life in glorious illustrations.  Stories ranging from Florida Man Denies Syringes Found in Rectum are His to Florida Man Brings Alligator through Drive-Thru, these images are sure to delight.\nThe first three illustrations, the remaining will be announced throughout the campaign!\nTrading Cards\nEach of the nine images will be featured on the front of high quality 16pt glossy trading cards.  The reverse of each card will feature a summary of the events that resulted in Florida Man's adventure.  Like previous releases from Attic Cards, these trading cards will be packaged in a customized wrapper.  These cards are sure to make you chuckle and are fun to share with friends.\nMetal Cards\nBackers of past Attic Cards sets are likely already familiar with metal cards.  Unlike many other trading card publishers who use the term \"metal\" to simply mean shiny, these cards are printed on actual SOLID METAL.  They feature an incredible shiny finish and are simply brilliant.  Metal cards will only be available through the Kickstarter and will be numbered.  They will not be available for retail sale after this campaign begins.\nAlso available is a special Master Set PLUS 1/1 Proof pledge level that includes a 1/1 metal printing proof from one of the metal cards.  There are four colors in the CMYK printing process - Black, Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.  With 9 different cards, there will be 36 available.\n1 Random Printing Proof will be included with each of the 36 Backers at the Master Set Plus 1/1 Proof level.\nPost Cards\nWant something a little larger than a 2.5\" x 3.5\" trading card?  Want to send something funny to your cousin in Jacksonville?  Or perhaps you are looking for a beautiful piece of artwork to have framed and hung in your Florida room?  Look no further!  The same nine incredible pieces of art are available as 4\" x 6\" post cards!  The reverse will feature regulation compliant specifications for stamp location and addresses.  These are ready to mail!\nThe Artist\nAll of the art for this release is being created by the incredibly talented Lindsey Armitage.  We couldn't be more proud to have her bring Florida Man and Nom-Nom to life!\nAttic Originals Master Set\nHave you missed out on prior sets from Attic Cards?  You're in luck!  For only $99 you can catch up and receive Reptiles, Sharks, and Krampus in addition to Florida Man.  Sharks includes 9 cards featuring original illustrations by Kokkinakis Achilleas.  Reptiles features 19 cards with 18 original illustrations also by Kokkinakis.  A bonus numbered parallel card is included in each back as well.  Krampus features 9 spot UV Krampuskarten cards, 3 solid metal cards featuring original art and 1 sketch card from our talented artists.\nKrampus Master Set - 9 Spot UV Cards, 3 Metal Cards, plus 1 sketch card will also be included.\nPack of Sharks cards featuring 9 original illustrations\nPack of Reptiles with 18 original illustrations and 1 bonus numbered parallel card\nShipping\nAll pledge levels include shipping for backers in the United States.  International backers will have a nominal shipping charge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 9th Kickstarter from Attic Cards.

Although RRParks CARDS was still almost 20 years away at the time this book ... A Gadzillion Other Uses for Condoms ... marked my initial journey into the world of publishing. And to mark the start of that journey I've remastered a 25-card set based on the lunacy within the covers of this utterly worthless tome. Each card is full color on a retro style stock with artwork by RRParks (currently the publisher of Sharknado, Mystery Science Theater 3000, The Three Stooges, and other trading card series). I'm also launching this campaign at this time to support Kickstarter's 'MAKE 100' Month -- where Kickstarter promotes the concept of projects that are limited to 100 of a project. So in this case, there is a limit of only 100 \"Gadzillion\" Master Sets. \nSo just what's IN this project you ask? Well... assuming you asked... or wondered... or didn't leave this campaign the second you read the word 'condoms'... the answer is this: A Book and Cards Package Deal. The book is a 64-page landscape style squarebound paperback, published in 1997 (First... and ONLY edition!). I had squirreled away back in 1997 a couple boxes of the books for some future project (that future project is now). The book has full color front and back covers painted my RRParks. \nFront Cover of the book\nBack cover of the book\nThe book leads off with a four-page history of condoms from 1350 BCE through Roman times all the way up to the present. The what follows in the book are COUNTLESS... or rather \"a Gadzillion\" (which in this case is around 54) 'other' uses for condoms besides the obvious uses for condoms. Here's some of them ... \nPLUS ... In addition to the book this Kickstarter includes a complete 25-card set of A Gadzillion Other Uses for Condoms -- artwork fully remastered and produced in FULL COLOR fronts (and duo-color ... black and one primary color...  retro style backs planned). \nPLUS ... in addition to the book and the 25-card series there are TWO metal cards planned (produced by Faerie Metal) in full color. These are limited edition cards.\nPLUS ... in addition to the book, the 25-card series, two different metal cards there will be included in the LIMITED EDITION Master Level a genuine printing plate. The printing plate will be the UNIQUE (1 of 1) actual printing plate used in the production of the card series.\nPLUS ... in addition to the book, the 25-card series, two different metal cards, and the printing plate I'm ALSO going to include at the LIMITED EDITION Master Level a unique hand drawn SKETCH CARD (by RRParks of course)... your preference of subject matter is a possibility (within reason) OR let me conjure up something unique. ALSO (and this is of special interest to promo card collectors) I'm planning a rather UNIQUE and STRANGE series of promo cards for this project ... the complete set of which will be available ONLY through this Kickstarter's MASTER PLEDGE LEVEL. I do not have the promo cards designed yet but I've figured them out, the logistics, and it's going to be rather... WEIRD and EXPERIMENTAL!\nThis is all to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of my first publishing project (and the 5th anniversary of RRParks CARDS as a company). \nOPTIONAL: If you want the author (me) to scrawl some personal dedication and doodle inside the front cover just let me know in a message after you've pledged and I'll be happy to vandalize your book!

For those who are coming into this new, let me tell what you'll expect...\nMy main objective with each Kickstarter campaign is to raise funds for the printing costs and cover shipping and Kickstarter fees. The majority of the cards have been created and are ready for press. I just need a little financial help to get the ball rolling.\nBy supporting you'll get the basic ZOMBIES set PLUS EXCLUSIVE material (rewards) only offered here as a Kickstarter backer!\nAs before, I've opted for a 21 day fundraising period. Please share this with a ghoul, a friend, and a fan who might also be interested in this novelty item.\nUPDATE: Final Stretch Goal unlocked! All backers will receive a 4 sticker set to be voted on after the campaign ends, 5 Zombie Fighter cards, and 5 Bonus Zombie cards.\nClick to view ALL of the ZOMBIE cards\nTHE CARDS\nEach basic 25 card set has 1 title card and 24 b&w Zombie portrait cards.\nEvery backer will also receive 1 limited 'Kickstarter Funded' title card.\nEvery card has a detailed monstrous portrait on the front and revealing info about the character on the back. The info includes; character's name, actor, movie they were in, director, synopsis, trivia, and poster.\nThe sets does not contain any nudity and is considered \"safe for work.\"\nOnly 500 sets will be produced, the title card will be signed and numbered, and each set will be in its own crystal clear 2 piece slider box.\nThere will be one character per film or tv program in the regular set and possible others in stretch-goal cards. I chose these characters to balance out future ZOMBIES editions. There are so many zombies, I could do a few editions. Something to look forward to... to spread the zombie infection!\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nEvery pledge level will have 1 regular ZOMBIES card set and 1 Kickstarter title card. Pledge levels other than the 'Single Set' will have extra items (see image below). For example, the 'Take 2 Sets' will consist of; 1 ZOMBIES card set, 1 KS title card, and a set of your choosing. It can be another ZOMBIES set or one of the other sets. Any additional sets will be an Add-On. The 'choosing' will happen after the Kickstarter ends, funds are collected, and the survey is emailed out. In the survey, I will ask for your mailing address, your choices, and other FACE CARDS related questions.\nADD-ONS\nThe items below can be added on to your initial pledge. Increase your pledge by adding the item amount to your pledge level. If you have already pledged, there should be a button in the side bar that says \"manage my pledge.\" For example, if you're in the U.S. and you pledge at the ALL 6 SETS ($55 + $9 shipping) level and you want to add-on another set ($11) for a friend, you pledge a total amount of $75.\nThe amounts below include shipping for that add-on item.\nAdd-On an extra ZOMBIES set or add-on sets that you missed. Be sure to mention A) Zombies B) Vampires, C) Anti-Heroes, D) Creatures, E) Killer Dudes, or F) Killer Babes when the 'Survey' is emailed to you at the end of the Kickstarter.\nAs a special Kickstarter ONLY reward, the ZOMBIES set will be available as Metal Cards! Get them as a Pledge Level or as an Add-On. No where else will you be able to get this limited feature.\nThere's only a few original drawings left from all 6 sets. Claim what remain before they're all gone. PLEASE MESSAGE ME DIRECTLY IF YOUR ADD-ON IS FOR ORIGINAL CARD ART. We don't want any one else trying to claim that item. Most of the original art for this set has been claimed. However, there will be a few stretch-goal card art that will be available when announced.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nHere are a couple Kickstarter EXCLUSIVES that I have planned to give to you at no additional cost. The more the campaign generates, the more free Stretch Goal items I can offer to every backer. First up, is a 5 card ZOMBIE FIGHTER sub-set! Then, if all goes well, there will be a potential additional set of 5 ADDITIONAL ZOMBIES. Check out the updates for details. Let's see if we reach all of these stretch goals!\n MANY THANKS!\nPlease tell a friend and share on social media!\nMore editions of FACE CARDS are planned for the future. But, as I've done in the past, I've left that decision up to the backers. Expect a new set every 5-6 months (roughly)! Stay alert!\nCheck out the Facebook page The Art of Byron Winton to see more of my 4x6 drawings, many of which these cards are based on. Follow me on Instagram and Twitter. Lastly, join me on Patreon to support in the creative process and to sign-up for the popular Card-of-the-Month program.\nThank you for your interest and support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the time of the launch, I have a few images left to complete for the set. I plan to have them done before the campaign ends. In doing so, the Available Original Art will reflect their completion.\n\nI given myself enough printer time for an end of March delivery for all the regular set backers. However, in the event that I am unable to ship by March, I will inform with a shipping update.\n\nFor those of you getting the 4\"x6\" drawing rewards with your sets, please be patient during the creation of those. I will produce them as quickly as I can without disrupting my current work-load. Depending on the quantity will determine the complete turn around time. I will mail in weekly batches.\n\nI will be adjusting quantities available if necessary. There are ONLY 500 sets being produced... and even less are available for the previous sets.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "SINGLE SET", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1 reg ZOMBIES card set\n1 KS exclusive title card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["56 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "TAKE 2 SETS", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1 reg ZOMBIES card set\n1 Card set of your choice\n1 KS exclusive title card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "ALL 6 SETS", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1 reg ZOMBIES card set\nThe 5 other card sets\n1 KS exclusive title card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "SINGLE SET & ORIGINAL ART", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1 reg ZOMBIES card set\n1 CUSTOM 4x6 B&W character drawing of your choice\n1 KS exclusive title card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["8 backers", "Limited (12 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "METAL SET", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1 metal ZOMBIES card set\n1 reg ZOMBIES card set\n1 KS exclusive title card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 140 or more", "title": "METAL SET & ORIGINAL ART", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1 metal ZOMBIES card set\n1 reg ZOMBIES card set\n1 CUSTOM 4x6 B&W character drawing of your choice\n1 KS exclusive title card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["3 backers", "Limited (17 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 180 or more", "title": "TOTAL PACKAGE", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1 metal ZOMBIES card set\n1 reg ZOMBIES card set\nThe 5 other card sets\n1 CUSTOM 4x6 B&W character drawing of your choice\n1 KS exclusive title card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "New Set Launched!", "update_content": "Hey collector card fiends!

MST3K Series One boxes and UNCUT card sheets. Scroll to the bottom for more information]\nMystery  Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards Series Two is COMING! And SOON! Current plan  is to have the series released late in October. And Series Two picks up right  where Series One left off. While the first series of MST3K Trading Cards' base  sets covered the Invention Exchanges and Experiments of the first three seasons,  this second series covers original seasons four, five, six and seven... PLUS a  special subset covering the KTMA episodes. Series Two sees the end of the Joel  era and the start of the Mike Nelson era ... the end of the TV's Frank era and  the start of the Pearl era. As with MST3K Trading Cards Series One, all episodes  (invention Exchanges and Experiments) are covered.    \nThe  entire second series is designed and already through the approval process and  heading right into printing production. And as we did in the first Kickstarter,  this Kickstarter includes exclusives available ONLY for backers. This pre-order  campaign runs from September 1st through September 30th. \nMST3K Trading Cards Series Two isn't just  larger than Series One but it might also be one of the largest non-sport trading  card series ever published with over 500 different cards to collect. But don't  let that 'worry' you because a master set pledge gets you ALL of the cards (and  here's a shocker -- although LARGER than Series One the master set is priced  LESS. How often does a business offer MORE ... for LESS!).     \nHere's  a visual 'grand tour' of the series:     MYSTERY  SCIENCE THEATER 3000 Series Two Trading cards features: A  118-card \"Invention Exchange\" base set -- every invention of seasons 4, 5, 6 and  7 episodes of the show (well, except for episodes that had no inventions). With  each card featuring the invention on the front and on the back of the card is  the dialogue of the Invention Exchange. \nSample INVENTION EXCHANGE cards\nA  78-card \"Experiment\" base set -- every experiment of the 4th, 5th, 6th and  7th seasons. The card fronts feature a classic scene from the show and the backs  of the cards cover the movie title, release date, air date, host, director,  stars, synopsis, classic riff and trivia. And there are some scarce variation  cards to look for! Don't worry -- if you're pledging on the Master Set you get  ALL the variations.  \nExamples of EXPERIMENT cards ... look for scarce VARIATIONS CARDS!\nA  47-card special subset featuring MST3K iconic mini movie posters from the Shout!  Factory DVD releases ... and terrific DVD menu art on the card backs. Steve  Vance (artist) has personally helped in obtaining high res images of his poster  art so the cards can look as lovely as you hope they'll look.  \nExamples of the Steve Vance Mini Poster Art Cards (with Shout! Factory DVD menu graphics on the backs)\n A  99-card 'Riff It' subset featuring a scene from a movie featured on the show  along with a hilarious riff ... and on the back? Another scene with space for  you to write your OWN riff. Eleven different movies and 9 cards per each movie.   \nExamples of RIFF IT Cards ... 11 different 9 card sets covering 11 different MST3K-featured movies\nAnd  why is there a FREE pair of 3D glasses in the top of the card box? How about 36  different Anaglyph 3D cards! Put on your 3D glasses and each of these specially  designed cards POPS into THREE DIMENSIONS! Designed by the incredibly talented  anaglyphist Christian LeBlanc and features scenes from riffed movies, host  segments and DVD poster art. Christian did such a wonderful job on his 18 Series  One 3Ds that I asked him to come back for Series Two and do TWICE as many! And  he's done a truly breathtaking job of them (in fact, he did such a great job on  MST3K 3D cards I commissioned him to do Sharknado's 3D cards as well). \nExamples of just ONE of the 36 different Christian LeBlanc designed MST3K Anaglyph 3D cards in MST3K Series Two\nBefore Season One of Mystery Science Theater 3000 there was a season of MST3K ... the KTMA episodes. Can't very well have a card series of MST3K and NOT have a subset of the KTMA episodes. So all 22 KTMA episodes are represented in this 22-card subset with Joel, Crow, Tom Servo, Gypsy, Dr. Forrester and Larry (back when they were trying to decide if they were mad scientists or just scientists who were mad).\nAn example of the 22 different KTMA era MST3K cards\nNOT very many of us have one (let alone all 9 different) Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie 'promo cards'.  So, apart from slight design modifications of the legal notice, year, card number here is the complete set of all 9 different promo cards from the 1990s!\nExample of one of the 1990s MST3K: The Movie promo cards ... reprinted here for the first time. Collect all 9!\nMystery Science Theater 3000 Series One featured some of the most beautiful sketch cards ever brought to the hobby of trading card collecting. Since sketch cards are unique and only ONE person can ever own an original sketch card I decided -- and the artists each permitted  me -- to create Sketch Card Artist Gallery Promo Cards. There are 63 different in this series and they feature all different actual sketch card art from MST3K Series One. \nExamples of the MST3K Sketch Card Artist GALLERY promo cards... promoting the sketch cards to be found in random packs of MST3K Trading Cards.\nAs we all know, during MST3K original series season 7 TV's Frank left and Pearl became the other 'mad' along with Dr. Forrester. Since the MST3K Trading Card box only had enough room for the opening scenes of seasons 4, 5 and 6 I've created this BONUS mini-clipout card panel BOX TOPPER so the alternative intro scenes can have their own mini cards to collect. This will be in every box of MST3K (and, of course, in all Master Sets).\nSpecial Production 'mini clip-out cards' box topper panels. Complete set in EVERY box of MST3K!\nA  full, sealed box of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series Two Trading Cards is  guaranteed to contain at least ONE complete set and subset of Invention Exchange Base Set, Experiment Base Set, Vance / DVD Menu Art Cards, 3D cards and more mentioned above.    \"But  WAIT! There's MORE!\" In each box you'll find randomly inserted limited edition and rare chase cards to collect:   A  24-card limited edition Macarie Claudiu MST3K art card series featuring Joel,  Mike, Gypsy, Tom, Crow, Dr. Forrester, TV's Frank, Pearl and Bobo and NEW SEASON  characters Jonah, Kinga, Max ... and then on to some actors from the movies and  serials. A total of 24 commissioned portraits by 'Chronicles of the Three  Stooges' official artist Macarie. \n1 of 24 different Macarie Limited Edition Portrait Cards\nBecause  I'm a big fan of GLOW IN THE DARK trading cards there will be NINE different  GLOW IN THE DARK Mystery Science Theater 3000 trading cards. My print production  broker Karen 'Wonder Woman' Cowan has connections with a production company that  does thermographic phosphorescent work (like the Glow in the Dark cards I  published for Chronicles of the Three Stooges Series Four). These are gonna be  SOOO COOOOOL! \n1 of 9 different GLOW IN THE DARK Mystery Science Theater 3000 rare cards\nThere  will also be genuine, unique printing plates to be found. Each printing plate is  UNIQUE as there can only be ONE printing plate for each of the four colors used  to create a full color card. These will be randomly inserted into box packs and  your box may be lucky enough to have one. Master Set backers, of course, will  get one.      \nExamples of genuine printing plates to seek and find in packs of MST3K Trading Cards Series Two\nIn  some boxes you'll find a pack that contains a UNIQUE original art 'sketch card'.  These sketch cards are 1 of 1 and RARE -- I commissioned some of the very best  sketch card artists in the hobby. Here's a current list of artists planned (and  some of these artist have already gotten their work in -- take a look at this  list: Aaron Laurich,  Achilleas Kokkinakis, Adam Beck, Andy  Moore, Ariel Mamani, Brent Scotchmer, Brian Abston, Caleb  King, Carlos Cabaleiro, Christian Baster, Daniel Gorman, Danny  Hayman,  Darrin Pepe, Dave Gaskin, David Day, Eric Lehtonen, Gary  Kezel, Ingrid Hardy, James Dickson, Jamie Hitchcock, Jason  Crosby, Jeff Abar, Jenette Brown, Jerry Bennet,  Jerry Garcia Jr., Jim O'Riley, Jonarton, Jon Mangini, Juan Rosales, Kevin P.  West,  Kris Penix, Kristin Allen, Kyle Burles, Laura  Atikinson, Laura Martin, Lee Brown,  Louise Draper, Marsha  Parkins, Matt Appelgate,  Norvietro Basio,  Rebecca  Sharp, Rees Finaly, Rich Molinelli, Robert Floydman, Sammy  Gomez,  Scott Rorie, Tim Proctor, Tim Shay, Todd Smith, Tony  Keaton, Trent Westbrook,\n    and introducing Bujtor Klara. If you're a serious card collector then chances are you recognize MOST of these  artists as being sketch artist SUPERSTARS in the hobby. When these artists found  out I was publishing MST3K Trading Cards they wanted in!  At this date I do not yet have ALL sketch cards turned in and so the list above may change slightly (if an artist or two is late then they will be moved to MST3K Series Three) and there are actually some additional artists that have just recently been brought aboard. This list above is to give you a SENSE of what artists are involved. Quite a list, isn't it! \nExamples of genuine, original art sketch cards randomly inserted in packs of MST3K Trading Cards (naturally every master set has ONE sketch card)\nRandomly  inserted into packs you may find rare 'Faux Film Cell' cards -- 4 different  styles to collect but EACH and EVERY ONE of them is UNIQUE. No two alike! These  four cards include Pearl, Doctor Forrester, Mike Nelson ... and Mike Nelson in  various guises and disguises. The numbering for these cell cards picks up right after Series One's cell cards (series one were numbered 1 through 8 ... series two are numbered 9 through 12).  \nExamples of 2 (of 4 different) MST3K Faux Cell Cards ... EVERY cell in EVERY card is unique. No two cell cards are alike\nInside  the top of each box, alongside the free pair of 3D glasses, you'll find a 1 of 9  different Full Metal box topper card, produced by those geniuses at Faerie Metal  (the best producer of limited edition metal cards in the biz!).  \n5 of 9 different Metal Box Topper cards to collect\nEach  and every full, sealed box of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards  carries 40 packs (that's right... not 18 or 24 or other industry averages ...  and not 36 packs like MST3K Series One ... but FORTY packs! and each pack has 10  cards (a typical modern day card series usually features 5 or 6 cards per pack  and only 18 or 24 packs to a box ... but I'm a serious fan of MST3K and card  collecting so my card series always include more ... and my saying over here is  \"Too much is never enough\"). With this many packs and that many cards in each  pack your odds are good for pulling rare cards... and the chances of putting  together complete sets of Experiments, Invention Exchanges, MST3K mini poster  and DVD menu art cards subset and Anaglyph 3D cards is excellent (in fact, those  complete sets and subsets are guaranteed in each box).  \nAs a BONUS, the MST3K  retail box of 40 packs features something NO other publisher provides: Printed  right on the box are 36 different mini double-sided clip-out cards in FULL color  front and back on 24pt super glossy stock. It's almost like getting a FREE 36  card special subset. Oh wait, it IS like that EXACTLY! Each  pack wrapper features a complete checklist printed on the inside showing you all  the cards to look for to complete your set. \nSO  HOW DO I GET ALL THIS AMAZING STUFF AND SATIATE MY DIRE NEED FOR MST3K  COLLECTIBLES??? \nIt's  easy. You'll notice there are many different pledge levels -- levels to fit all  collector budgets.  \nLevel  1: $2 You  get ONE promo card for the MST3K Series Two Trading Card collection.  \nLevel  2: $5 You  get FIVE different promo cards for the MST3K Series Two Trading Card  collection. \nLevel  3: $10 You  get THREE sealed packs of cards. Each pack contains 10 different cards. Consider  this a 'sampler' level. And you'll also get a promo card, too.  \nLevel  4: $75 You  get a FULL SEALED BOX of 40 10-card packs. Guaranteed to contain complete sets  of Experiment cards (78 cards), Invention Exchange cards (118 cards), MST3K mini  poster and DVD menu art cards (47 cards), Anaglyph 3D cards (36 cards), and Riff  It Retro-stalgic style cards (99) ... you'll also get randomly inserted rare and  hit cards which could include a printing plate, original art sketch card, 'Faux  Film Cell' card, limited edition Macarie Claudiu art card, Glow in the Dark  card, Sketch Card Artist Gallery promo cards, KTMA subset cards and more. Each  box comes with a free pair of 3D glasses PLUS 1 of 9 different Full Metal Box  Topper cards. You ALSO get some MST3K promo cards. \nLevel  5: $160 At  this level you get a MASTER SET. What's in a MASTER SET? Well I'll tell you!  It's everything. See all those cool cards in the 'grand tour'? Your collection  will include all of them. All the cards will be inside a retail box ... you'll  also receive 3 UNUSED wrappers. 500 cards will barely fit inside the box  unwrapped so it's going to be one REALLY thick, heavy box of cards -- all ready  for you to load into your card collection (you'll want a lot of 9-pocket pages  for THIS rascal!). And I might even have some more surprises for you depending  on pledge levels.  This is the level you want if you're a super fan and gotta  have EVERYTHING. IMPORTANT: A 'master set' will ONLY be available during this  Kickstarter pre-sell ... and during the Kickstarter I MAY have to limit the  number of these available (so you may want to jump on this one fast before the  option is gone).   \nLevel  6: $220. This level is a combination of Level 4 and Level 5 -- at this  level you get a 40-pack box AND a master set. This way your master set gives you  ALL the cards... and you still have a 40-pack sealed box to either open packs,  save for a rainy day, give as a gift, use as a boat anchor or whatever else your  imagination can come up with. I will guarantee that those pledging at this level  WILL have a sketch card in their 40-pack box (so at this level you're getting a  master set with a sketch card... AND a box with a sketch card lurking somewhere  inside all those packs).      \nLevel  7: $280 Four  Box Case Level. At this level you get FOUR sealed 40-pack boxes (for the  contents description of a box just look at Level Four above). A great level for  those who want to build sets and have duplicate sets to sell on ebay or give to  a friend or simply keep because you're greedy and fiending for cards... a great  level for those who love the thrill of seeking rare chase and hit cards... a  great level for those wanting to have the odds in their favor of finding more  than one sketch card, printing plate, or other limited edition material. This  level also includes the promo cards. As a BONUS, those who get the Four Box Case  Level will get some guaranteed bonus stuff like uncut panels, additional  printing plates, error and freak cards (I won't know what errors or oddballs  I'll have until AFTER printing production... but virtually every printing  production does end up with some oddball cards and with a production job this  big am sure we'll have errors, freaks and oddballs), and more. Hurry on over to  the local store and grab a barrel full of bubble gum as this level will keep you  busy for HOURS!   \nLevel  8: $500 DOUBLE  the 'Four Box Case Level'. You get every everything in Level 6...DOUBLED. So  that's EIGHT boxes and all those goodies. And at this level I'll make it even  MORE worth your while by loading up on the freebies and bonus stuff.    \nQuestions  and Answers:\nQ:  I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do  I go about it?  A:  Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter. If you are unable  to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no  worries. \n--------------- \nQ:  When will the MST3K Trading Card Series ship? A:  The current schedule and plan is to ship the end of October. I'm good about  posting updates and communications so will keep everyone in the loop. Virtually  every trading card series I've published has been issued ON schedule.  I do,  though, ask for patience in advance ... this is the first time I've published a  trading card series this large. My other 'largest' card series was Chronicles of  the Three Stooges Series Four with just over 300 cards ... and this series of  MST3K is almost TWICE as large. I've gotten pretty good about working through  logistics, numbers, time and such but just want everyone to know I'll be making  a real effort to release the end of October and IF I'm a little late it will  only be a LITTLE late. Not months and months late. Still, am aiming for end of  October. \n --------------------- \nQ:  I'm OCD and want a box to keep sealed and a box to open. How do I back on two  boxes? Or two 'Master Sets'?  A:  If you want more than one pledge level just back the pledge level you want ...  then once you've pledged you can review your pledge and ADD to your pledge  amount. Be SURE to message me if you do this explaining what you did. I'll check  and make sure it's done right and you'll be fine. The way I believe it's done is  after you pledge you click to view/manage your pledge and then you change the  amount of your pledge to reflect everything you want in your package. So, for  example, if you want to pledge on two master sets you just pledge on ONE. After  your pledge is entered you can click on view/manage your pledge and change the  $160 to $320 to reflect TWO master sets (backers outside the US MUST message me  to find out postage requirements... US packages are postpaid).  \n----------------- \nQ:  Why are you running this as a Kickstarter instead of selling at a comic shop or  through a catalog? A:  This is my 17th Kickstarter over the last 4 years. I've found that pre-selling a  card series on Kickstarter allows me to determine a proper production run of  cards and boxes. It also allows me to offer 'master sets' to collectors on a  limited basis. Once the Kickstarter is done I will have a good idea of what the  total 'sealed box' needs will be for a production run to provide Kickstarter  backers AND other customers (when the series is offered through distributors and  retail outlets). A Kickstarter also lets me get card series to serious  collectors FIRST before ANYONE else. Plus a Kickstarter allows me to exercise  some flexibility on providing 'stuff' for backers ... once the Kickstarter is  over the only planned retail/wholesale activity for series one is simply retail  boxes of 40 packs. No master sets, no case deals with bonus 'swag', no  individual packs or promo card sets or anything else. Once this Kickstarter is  ended the ONLY available material will be sealed 36-pack boxes (may be 40 packs, but for sure Kickstarter backers will have 40-pack boxes ... retail boxes after the Kickstarter may have only 36)... months from  now. \nADD ON GOODIES:\nSince I've had requests for certain extra items I'm making these available to Kickstarter backers as 'add ons'. So if you want a box of MST3K Series One or MST3K Series One uncut card sheets (180 cards in uncut sheets!) you can add them onto your pledge easily. Here's how: If you've already got a pledge on this project and want a box of MST3K Series One cards just click to view/manage your pledge and add $75 for each series one box you want. If you want a set of uncut sheets (2 different sheets each having 90 different cards) just add on $68 for each set of 2 sheets you want (1 set of 2 sheets is $68, not $68 per sheet... just $68 for a set of BOTH uncut sheets). If you want something not listed just let me know and if it's possible we'll do it. Add On prices are postpaid in the US. If you're outside the US let me know before doing the add on so I can research postage costs to your country. And of course if you have any questions just ask! My goal is to make sure you have fun with your collection and it's everything you want it to be. \n----------------------- \nIf  you have a question not answered here please just ask -- you can message me  directly through Kickstarter and I will respond as quickly as possible. it is  better to message me than to post a comment. Kickstarter shows me MESSAGES as  soon as they are posted but is not consistent with showing me 'comments'. So  asking me questions through messages is better. If you can't figure out how to  message on Kickstarter then just contact me through my RRParksCARDS.com website  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks? Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. Otherwise, this is my 17th Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 4 years (including seven different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, two Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, am currently finishing up Sharknado Series One and others). I know my way around card publishing and financing production. For MST3K Series Two I have the BEST sketch card artists on board, the BEST printing production broker on the planet (Karen 'Wonder Woman' Cowan at ICONIX who has overseen ALL the card series I've published since I started my business), and ALL cards are written and designed and ready for production and officially approved through Shout! Factory. I also consider myself an excellent communicator -- you can view my other Kickstarters and see the level at which I keep backers informed during a campaign, after a campaign, during card production/collation/assembly, and through actual shipping of cards to backers AND afterwards. You'll NEVER be left wondering \"what's going on\" because I post regular updates and keep in contact with EVERYONE. I've never had a publishing challenge I couldn't overcome with the help of my printing production broker ... and except once (when I was 2 weeks late shipping on one campaign) I've shipped everyone their goodies ON TIME (with the ONLY exceptions being backers who didn't let me know WHERE to send their stuff... those were delayed of course. So please note: AFTER this Kickstarter ends and right before I start shipping I'm going to send out what's called a 'mailing address survey' ... be sure to fill that out and message it back to me when the time comes so there's no delays in mailing your package. Okay? Okay!). While there are always risks and challenges with production, logistics or even crossing the street I have years of experience publishing trading cards and conducting Kickstarter campaigns.

In cooperation with The SYFY Channel and The Asylum I've been working with David Latt (Producer), David Garber (Executive Producer) and Anthony Ferrante (Director) and we've put together a PHENOMENOL Sharknado collectible trading card series. And it's happening right now. This minute. And YOU can be part of the whole process AND add these cards to your Sharknado collection. \nMy name is Richard Parks, publisher (CEO, designer ... and janitor) at RRParksCARDS. Perhaps you've collected some of my previous card series which include The Three Stooges, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Gary Saves the Graveyard, and other card series. If so, you already know what to expect. If not, then just know that I don't do 'small' card series ... 'Too much is never enough!'. And I produce the types card series I myself want to collect. And Sharknado is exactly that -- this is the card series I want to exist. And it has extensive base sets covering Sharknado and Sharknado 2, genuine movie-used relic cards, Anaglyph 3D cards, beautiful original art sketch cards, subsets, Faux Film Cell cards, metal cards and more. This is the first series and it features Sharknado and Sharknado 2 (series two will feature Sharknado 3 and Sharknado 4 and series three will feature Sharknado 5 and Sharknado 6) \nHere's a visual tour of Sharknado Trading Cards Series One: \nSharknado Base Set, 90 Different Cards\nSharknado 2, 90-card Base Set\nBase Cards and subsets. There are TWO base sets in this series ... the first base set is a 90-card set of Sharknado. The series is sequentially numbered lovely photos as seen in Sharknado (and in the order seen in the movie). The back text is the shoot script for that scene so you can relive the movie in this 90-card set just as it happened. And that's the same for the 90-card set of Sharknado 2! BOTH movies. Two complete 90-card base sets for a total of 180 different cards. And the special subset is the \"Bloody Subset\" featuring gooey, nasty scenes of sharkish mayhem. My plan is to produce this subset with a special coating so the blood shimmers when cards are held at a light source. That's in the works as of this Kickstarter launch. In any event, though, the 'Bloody Subset' is another 18 cards (or more). \n18 Diffrent 3D Anaglyph cards and FREE pair of 3D glasses in each box\n3D anaglyph 18 card subset. Oh this is cool -- RRParksCARDS has spared no expense in making this series all it can be and we've brought on the 3D anaglyph genius Christian LeBlanc (known for LOADS of 3D projects, perhaps best known for his 3D work on Star Wars projects). Each card features on the front a traditional red/blue anaglyph TRUE 3D photo. Using the free pair of 3D glasses you'll find in the box you can view the image in stunning THREEEEEE DIMENSIONSSSSS! On the back is a detail 3D image showing you a highlight of the next 3D card in this subset. Christian has shown me some of the cards he's done and they are lovely. If you collected Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series One you'll have seen his amazing anaglyph 3D work in those 18 MST3K cards. \n4 Different Scarce Faux Film Cell Cards -- Each is UNIQUE\nFaux Film Cells. We all like adding truly unique cards to our collections and that's why Sharknado series one has Faux Film Cell cards. As well all know, Sharknado 1 and 2 were not released in the theater and so there are no 35mm cells existing. However, like I did for MST3K series one I've created Sharknado Faux Film Cell cards. These diecut cards each have a UNIQUE (no two cells alike) cell embedded in the card. Hold to a light source and you can see a brilliant full color UNIQUE film cell. There are four different in this special chase subset -- cells of 'Fin', 'April', 'Nova' and The Sharknado!\n4 Different Genuine Movie-Used Costume Prop Relic Cards\nRelic Cards. These are pure magic! David Latt generously helped secure genuine movie-used costumes and props for the creation of these relic cards. Sharknado series one features FOUR different relic cards. One of Tara Reid's (April's) white jacket from the opening shots in Sharknado 2, Ian Ziering's (Fin's) jacket from Sharknado 4, the bloody sleeve of Tara's jacket in Sharknado 2 when the shark bit off her arm (how about THAT for an iconic genuine costume card!) and Cassandra Scerbo's (Nova's) military style combat jacket from Sharknado 5. These aren't replica props, these are the actual costumes SEEN in the movies. You'll be able to own an actual PIECE of Sharknado movie history. \nBeautiful FULL METAL BOX TOPPER CARDS produced by Faerie Metal\nMetal card box toppers. There are 12 planned. These are full metal, full color cards -- same size as standard trading cards but about twice as thick and produced in full metal from those terrific folks at Faerie Metal (the leaders in the metal card industry... besides being really nice guys). Each card has a full color Sharknado poster graphic on the front and a certificate of authenticity on the back. Boxes will have ONE of the TWELVE different cards inside the box top area (along with the free pair of 3D glasses). Collect all 12 ... or GET all 12 with a master level pledge. \n9 Different Limited Edition Special Commission Portrait Cards with Puzzle Backs\nLimited Edition portrait puzzle cards by Macarie Claudiu. Mr. Claudiu is a top shelf graphite realist artist who has worked on countless productions in his native Romania -- and he's also worked on portrait cards for my other trading card projects including Chronicles of the Three Stooges series 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series Two. He's done 9 different original portraits for this special limited edition subset. The fronts feature his artwork ... and the backs of the cards feature a 9-card puzzle scene of behind-the-scenes 'making of' Sharknado 2 with 'Fin' suspended by ropes, holding a chainsaw, with a greenscreen behind him. \nJust three examples of the Sketch Cards to be found randomly inserted in packs\nSketch Cards. These are special -- I've brought on the BEST artists in the hobby to work on these. What IS a 'sketch card'? A sketch card is a specially produced card that's had an original artwork painted, drawn, inked, graphited, etc. right on the card. NO two are alike because each is an actual original artwork. My first project to include sketch cards was MST3K Series One and the collector response was enormous and extremely enthusiastic. And that's because I bring on the best artists. As of this Kickstarter I'm still bringing on more artists but here's a list of those already hard at work on Sharknado sketch cards: Aaron Laurich, Achilleas Kokkinakis, Adam Beck, Andy Moore, Ariel Mamani, Brent Scotchmer, Brian Abston, Caleb King, Carlos Cabaleiro, Christian Baxter, Daniel Gorman, Danny Hayman, Darrin Pepe, Dave Gaskin, David Day, Eric Lehtonen, Gary Kezel, Ingrid Hardy, James Dickson, Jamie Cosley, Jamie Hitchcock, Jason Crosby, Jeff Abar, Jenette Brown, Jerry Bennet, Jerry Garcia Jr, Jim O'Riley, Jon Arton, Jon Mangini, Juan Rosales, Kevin P. West, Kris Penix, Kristin Allen, Kyle Burles, Laura Atikinson, Laura Martin, Lee Brown, Louise Draper, Marsha Parkins, Matt Appelgate, Matt Stewart, Norvietro Basio, Ray Racho, Rebecca Sharp, Rees Finaly, Rich Molinelli, Robert Floydman, Sammy Gomez, Scott Rorie, Tim Proctor, Tim Shay, Todd Smith, Tony Keaton, Trent Westbrook, Wayne Tully, and introducing Bujtor Klara. MORE being added, too!\nExamples of printing plate cards (every card is only ONE color used to create the trading card)\nPrinting Plates. Every series I publish I obtain the actual printing plates from the printing company. I clean them up a little bit and attach a certificate of authenticity to the backs. Result? A unique, one-of-a-kind printing plate that was used to actually create the trading card series. They are the size of a standard trading card (but of course... they were used to print the card!). There's only ONE magenta card #13 printing plate, only ONE cyan card #44 back printing plate ... no matter what printing plate or plates you HAVE you are the ONLY one to every have that plate. \nExample of rare Progressive Proof cards\nProgressive proofs are done during the printing production process. Sometimes the printer is testing the cyan plate or the cyan and black ink registrations. Sometimes progressive proofs have only one color, sometimes two colors... sometimes the back is blank and sometimes it has printing. These are neat 'oddities' and fun to collect because very few of each progressive proof are ever created -- and you'll have one of the few progressive proofs (too bad for other card collectors who don't jump on board this Kickstarter). I make these available on Kickstarters to make sure those who are supportive of a card series on Kickstarter will have something rare and fun for their collection. \nEach retail box has 36 10-card packs plus box topper AND a pair of FREE 3D glasses!\nBox and Packs. One thing I really like to see in trading card series is a LOT of cards per pack, a LOT of packs in a box, and a pricetag that's collector friendly. PLUS something creative with the box. So what I'm doing is publishing this series with 10 cards per pack (rather than the usual 5 or 6 cards like some publishers)... and 36 packs per box (instead of the usual 20 or 24 packs). And the box itself has 36 mini clipout cards on 24pt glossy stock and each card has front and back graphics in full color. Each pack has a full series checklist printed right on the inside of the wrapper (so you'll have enough wrappers it will be okay to actually write on one, marking off the checklist the way a checklist should be used). And if you're a card collector then you already know that 36 10-card packs for only $85 is TWICE as many cards for HALF as much money as other card series. I want this and ALL my card series to be affordable by as many collectors as possible. \nSO HOW DO I GET ALL THIS AMAZING STUFF AND SATIATE MY DIRE NEED FOR SHARKNADO COLLECTIBLES??? \nIt's easy. You'll notice there are many different pledge levels -- levels to fit all collector budgets. \nLevel 1: $4 You get THREE promo cards and the knowledge you helped my new company. \nLevel 2: $10 You get TWO sealed packs of cards. Each pack contains 10 different cards. Consider this a 'sampler' level. And you'll also get a promo card, too. \nLevel 3: $35 You get TEN sealed packs of cards plus 2 promo cards PLUS, available on through this Kickstarter, a rare progressive proof Sharknado card. \nLevel 4: $75 You get a FULL SEALED BOX of 36 10-card packs. Guaranteed to contain complete sets of Sharknado base set (90 cards), Sharknado 2 base set (90 cards), 'Bloody Subset' (18 cards currently planned but I might expand this), and all 18 Sharknado 3D cards (plus a free pair of 3D glasses to view them in all their dimensional glory). If your 36-pack box you'll find a few rare and scarce hit and chase cards which might include Faux Film Cell cards, limited edition Macarie Claudiu portrait art / puzzle back cards, genuine unique printing plate, genuine movie-used costume relic card, original art sketch card by some of the best sketch card artists in the hobby, and more. And each box has ONE full metal box topper card. PLUS, available on through this Kickstarter, a rare progressive proof Sharknado card and a Sharknado promo card.  \nLevel 5: $160 Okay, this is the BIG level. This is for serious collectors who want complete collections of everything -- At this level you get a MASTER SET. What's in a MASTER SET? Well I'll tell you! It's everything ... You'll get the retail box. Inside, instead of finding random packs, you'll find a complete Sharknado base set (90 cards), Sharknado 2 base set (90 cards), 'Bloody Subset' (18 cards currently planned but I might expand this), and all 18 Sharknado 3D cards (plus a free pair of 3D glasses to view them in all their dimensional glory). You'll also get a complete set of all four Faux Film Cell cards, a complete set of the Macarie Claudiu portrait puzzle back cards, ONE genuine unique printing plate, ONE original art sketch card, a complete set of all 9 Metal Box Topper cards, a rare progressive proof Sharknado card, ALL Sharknado promo cards PLUS all FOUR genuine costume prop relic card. Everything including the 36 mini clipout cards right on the box. All sets and subsets completely collated and ready to load into your binders or boxes. I'll also include a stack of UNUSED Sharknado trading card wrappers plus other goodies. You'll have all the cards, promos, hit and chase cards. You won't have to constantly check on ebay to try and find a missing card. You'll have it ALL. Please note, since some of the special cards have a very low production number I may have to cut short this pledge level ... so if you want a master set, best to pledge early before it gets ended.  \nLevel 6: $200 This includes the $75 pledge level 4 bundle (a full box of 36 packs) AND the $150 pledge level collection. So you'll have a master set PLUS a box full of packs you can have the fun of opening and building more sets... or squirrel away for some later date.  \nLevel 6: $300 Four Box Level. At this level you get FOUR sealed 36-pack boxes (for the contents description of a box just look at Level Four above). A fun level for those who want to build sets and have duplicate sets to sell on ebay or give to a friend or simply keep because you're greedy and fiending for cards... the right level for those who love the thrill of seeking rare chase and hit cards... a perfect level for those wanting to have the odds in their favor of finding more than one sketch card, printing plate, prop card, or other limited edition material. This level also includes the promo cards. As a BONUS, those who get the Four Box Level will get some guaranteed bonus stuff like uncut panels, additional printing plates, error and freak cards, progressive proofs and more. Hurry on over to the local store and grab a barrel full of bubble gum as this level will keep you busy for HOURS!  \nLevel 7: $500 DOUBLE the 'Four Box Case Level'. You get every everything in Level 6...DOUBLED. So that's EIGHT boxes and DOUBLE all those bonus goodies.  \nQuestions and Answers:  \nQ: I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do I go about it?  \nA: Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter. If you are unable to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no worries.  \nQ: When will the Sharknado Trading Card Series ship?   \nA: The current schedule and plan is to ship the end of September. With any trading card production there are a lot of variables such as the licensing approval process (but I've noticed so far that The Asylum is faster than ANY other licensing approval group I've ever dealt with -- they are helpful, enthusiastic and encouraging ... and FAST!), printing production (a card series with this many different types of cards is quite complex and requires working out logistics) and of course paperwork and funding and a host of other variables ... but I think 'end of September' is a good, rough guesstimate at this stage of things. If you've backed any of my other Kickstarters you already know that my estimates for shipping, even when I make the estimates MONTHS in advance, usually turn out accurate within a few days or a couple weeks. I've had some that actually BEAT my estimate, others are real close. POINT is that WHILE this Kickstarter is running and WHILE you're pledging I'm not just sitting around on my hands -- production is already underway.  This will be my 16th Kickstarter project, so I've gotten pretty good at estimating completion and shipping dates. So it's just a few short months from now ... considering we've all waited about 5 years for someone to publish a Sharknado trading card series, a few more months will seem like a walk in the shark ... er... PARK.  \nQ: I'm OCD and want a box to keep sealed and a box to open. How do I back on two boxes? Or two 'Master Sets'? Or other combinations of pledge 'swag'? \nA: If you want more than one pledge level just back the pledge level you want ... then once you've pledged you can review your pledge and ADD to your pledge amount. If you want a customized pledge level just message me -- we'll work it all out. Be SURE to message me if you do this explaining what you did. I'll check and make sure it's done right and you'll be fine.  \nQ: Why are you running this as a Kickstarter instead of selling at a comic shop or through a catalog?  \nA: This is my 16th Kickstarter over the last 4 1/2 years. I've found that pre-selling a card series on Kickstarter allows me to determine a proper production run of cards and boxes. It also allows me to offer 'master sets' to collectors on a limited basis. Once the Kickstarter is done I will have a good idea of what the total 'sealed box' needs will be for a production run to provide Kickstarter backers AND other customers (when the series is offered through distributors and retail outlets). A Kickstarter also lets me get card series to serious collectors FIRST before ANYone else. Plus a Kickstarter allows me to exercise some flexibility on providing 'stuff' for backers ... once the Kickstarter is over the only planned retail/wholesale activity for series one is simply retail boxes of 36 packs. No master sets, no case deals with bonus 'swag', no individual packs or promo card sets or anything else. Once this Kickstarter is ended the ONLY available material will be sealed 36-pack boxes... months from now. In other words, for those who collect Master Sets this is your first, best and ONLY chance to get in on a Master Set of these cards (unless later on someone lists their master set on ebay... but don't count on it being LESS than what you can get it for here and now).\nNOTE: As of this posting, the cards are currently being reviewed by licensing for approvals/revisions. This means that some images and/or text MAY end up slightly different than as shown above. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges. Apart from a sharknado coming through my living room ceiling there are no logical risks. I'm working with wonderful people at The Asylum, I'm working with the same print broker at ICONIX who saw through my other 26 trading card series, the guy producing the retail box has done 5 other card series boxes for me and helped invent the type of box I use (which is unique to the hobby), the anaglyph designer (Christian LeBlanc) is the best and very professional and dependable, my sketch card artists are all reporting progress and everything's moving forward right on schedule. I'm an experienced card publisher with dozens of card series produced and this is my 16th Kickstarter campaign. EVERY Kickstarter campaign has been successful and all awards were mailed out for them (well, everyone who pledged and provided a mailing address of course). So I've become an old hand at this. Plus I am REAL good at communicating. I post updates before, during and after Kickstarter campaigns to let everyone know how everything is going every step of the way. YOU are a valuable part of my productions and I return the support you show me with your pledge by making sure you not only receive everything you should get but I keep you in the behind-the-scenes loop about what's happening. And if you have questions, just message me (try to use Kickstarter 'message' instead of Kickstarter 'comment'... I see messages, I don't always see comments).

Right this minute, American Mythology is conducting a Kickstarter for their current Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f comic book project. \nThe Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Comic Book Trading Card Series is a much smaller card series than previous Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f series. This series is not being issued as a 'wax pack' style product but rather a 'factory set' -- meaning the entire series is in a slip-sleeve style package. This series includes:\nBase Set Sneak Peak\n- A 45-card base set featuring ALL of the wonderful American Mythology comic book covers and cover variations of their numerous comic book series/titles:  The Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f .\n'Retro Stalgic' 1950s Continuation Card Sneak Peak\n- A 9-card 'Retro Staglic' continuation subset... continuing not just the 1959 Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f trading cards but the RRParksCARDS 'continuation' series.\nExamples of the 9 Metal Cards (final actual designs will differ only slightly)\n- 1 of 9 different METAL CARDS (or, if you pledge on the MASTER SET pledge level you get all 9) produced by those fine folks at Faerie Metal.\nExample Printing Plates\n- 1 Genuine RRParksCARDS 'The Three Stooges'\u00ae\ufe0f trading card printing plate with COA.\n- 1 Ultra Rare Production/Progressive Proof card\nSpecial Reproduction Cards\n- Plus recreations of the classic 'ABC Film Stars' card (made possible with the generous assistance of R. Gallo) and the majestic  'Movie Machine' card (since most of us don't have $100s or even $1000 just sitting around to spend on mint originals, I've recreated both of the iconic Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f cards). \nThe base cards are being printed on high gloss quality 16pt UV stock with offset printing (by the same production company that did Chronicles of the Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f series 1, 2, 3 and 4) with the cards featuring all aspects of the American Mythology comic book series: covers, progressive covers and artworks, panels and progressives, trivia cards, model sketches and more. The 'Retro Stalgic' continuation cards feature the wonderful artwork and overview words of Norman Maurer and Joe Kubert from the original 1950s Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Comic Books -- printed in the exact same style as the RRParksCARD continuation cards (these being numbered 239 through 247). The printing plate and metal card and rare progressive proof card AND other goodies, along with the base and continuation cards, will all be housed in a slip-sleeve style package (yes... WITH header card!).  \nMaster Set pledge level backers will be treated to a COMPLETE set of everything including all 9 different metal cards -- All 3 'election' American Mythology Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f covers (white metal), all 3 'Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Christmas' metal puzzle cards (gold metal) and 'Movie Machine' iconic card (front and back) plus the 'Movie Machine' ad metal card (silver metal). Each with COA on the back. \n    PLEDGE LEVELS I'm setting up this campaign with levels to satisfy (hopefully satisfy) all collector levels and budgets and I want long-time backers to see this as not just a fun series but also as a way to have a trading card 'sneak peak' at the historic American Mythology Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Comic Book series.\n$4 PLEDGE. This gets you two basic Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Promo Cards.\n $28 PLEDGE. This gets you the 'factory set' which includes all 45 base cards, all 9 'Retro Stalgic' continuation cards, 1 of 9 different Metal Cards, 1 printing plate, 1 progressive production proof, and the two special reproduction cards... PLUS two basic Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Promo Cards.\n$60 PLEDGE. This is the 'Master Set' level pledge.  You get the factory set box, all 45 base cards, all 9 'Retro Stalgic' continuation cards, ALL 9 different Metal Cards (3 white, 3 silver, and 3 gold -- the complete set of all 9 metal cards), 1 printing plate, 1 progressive production proof, the two special reproduction cards and ALL Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f promo cards associated with the RRParksCARDS and American Mythology production. Odds are EXCELLENT (mainly because I'm already planning it) that Master Pledge backers will get some bonus goodies). \n.....\nI'm also including some additional pledge levels for those who may have missed out on the PREVIOUS RRParksCARDS Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Trading Card Series. \n$380 'Ultimate' Package Deal Bundle. This includes Chronicles of the Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Series 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ... The 1959 Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Reprint retail box (6th series)... The Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Theater retail box (7th series) ... PLUS this current 8th series: The Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Comic Book Trading Card Series Factory Set. Individual prices for these 8 items is much more than the $380 bundle deal price. Ultimate package deal pledges will also get bonus printing plates and other goodies. A great way to 'catch up' and add a MASSIVE MOUNTAIN of The Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Trading Cards to your collection. I will NOT be able to put together too many of these 'Ultimate' Package Deal Bundles since Three Stooges\u00ae\ufe0f Theater (7th series) is nearly sold out.  ...\nCUSTOMIZED PLEDGE LEVELS. If you don't see a pledge level that suits your needs just let me know. I've done customized pledge levels before -- it's no bother. Be advised, requesting a customized pledge level is NOT for 'haggling' over pledge level prices -- the prices listed above are what they are (and if you've ever published trading cards you can already see they are very low). A customized pledge level can be created for those seeking a bulk deal... or if someone has Chronicles series 1 and 3 and the 1959 and wants a level that includes 2 and 4 and the 'Theater' set. Or for collectors seeking certain printing plate package deals, uncut sheets and so on. I'll do what I can (within reason) to accommodate special requests. You get the idea... this is to fine tune a package that covers everything you want, need or gotta have or you'll die. I'll post updates during and after the Kickstarter campaign letting everyone know progress and production 'milestones' and finally 'shipping date' once production is done and 'backer swag' is packaged up and ready for mailing. ...\nPrinting production of this series is actually ALREADY HAPPENING! All cards except the metal cards are at the printing company right now! So when this Kickstarter is over I'll simply do the order with Faerie Metal for the metal cards ... and submit the production files for the packaging. Otherwise, well before this Kickstarter is over the base cards, Retros, special reproduction cards, printing plates, progressive proofs, etc. will already be here. So it will simply be a matter of processing everyone's packages. So why am i saying a release date of March? Because I'll be frantically processing orders for 100s of boxes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 during January and February. Will have my hands full.\nUPDATED January 30: ORIGINAL ART. Want to own a piece of actual Three Stooges Trading Card History? How about a piece of original art used in the production of Chronicles of the Three Stooges! The portrait cards for the Three Stooges card series were all done by Macarie -- the series' official portrait artist (he's also already completed the portraits for Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series Two ... and I'm helping him break into the world of doing sketch cards. Short version? A name to WATCH! And you can get original trading card art right here right now. How to buy is simple ... let me know which one(s) you want to confirm their availability. This is on a first-come, first-serve basis so once I confirm it is still available you can 'add' to your pledge for the piece(s) and I'll mark them SOLD on the image below. I'll then include them in your Stooge package. Although most are already sold, there are some left. Take a look.\nQuestions?

Only 500 sets will be produced.\nEach set will be in its own crystal clear 2 piece slider box.\nI chose these characters to balance out future VAMPIRE editions. There are so many vampires, I could do at least 3 editions. Something to look forward to.\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nEvery pledge level will have 1 VAMPIRES card set and 1 Kickstarter title card. Pledge levels other than the 'Single Set' will have extra items (see image below). For example, the 'Take 3 Sets' will consist of; 1 VAMPIRES card set, 1 KS title card, and 2 sets of your choosing.

In the survey, I will ask for your mailing address, your choices, and other FACE CARDS related questions.\nADD-ONS\nThe items below can be added on to your initial pledge. Increase your pledge by adding the item amount to your pledge level. If you have already pledged, there should be a button in the side bar that says \"manage my pledge.\" For example, if you're in the U.S. and you pledge at the ALL 5 SETS ($45 + $8 shipping) level and you want to add-on another set ($11) for a friend, you pledge a total amount of $64.\nThe amounts below include shipping for that add-on item.\nAdd-On an extra VAMPIRES set or add-on sets that you missed. Be sure to mention A) Vampires, B) Anti-Heroes, C) Creatures, D) Killer Dudes, or E) Killer Babes when the 'Survey' is emailed to you at the end of the Kickstarter.\nAs a special Kickstarter ONLY reward, the VAMPIRES set will be available as Metal Cards!

Claim what remains before they're all taken. PLEASE MESSAGE ME DIRECTLY IF YOUR ADD-ON IS FOR ORIGINAL CARD ART. We don't want any other fang-bangers claiming that item.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nHere are a couple Kickstarter EXCLUSIVES that I have planned to give to you at no additional cost.

However, in the event that I am unable to ship in or by March, I will inform with a shipping update.\n\nFor those of you getting the 4\"x6\" drawing rewards with your sets, please be patient during the creation of those.

Worshipers of the Hindu snake goddess Manasa are growing in strength and numbers, rebuilding their Order. Episode One introduced us to hard-drinking line cook Luke Bishop and his friends Jill, Darcy, and Steve. They're going to have to fight hard against this cult, and their troubles are just beginning!\nOUR CAMPAIGN\nOur crowdfunding campaign for Episode One was a wonderful success, and we're building on that momentum to create the next chapter in the story. The pilot episode, clocking in at a little under six minutes, is available to watch right here, right now, for free.\nhttps://vimeo.com/217678470\npassword: doomtown\nPlease check it out, and if you want to see what happens next, pledge to support the production of Episode Two! Our new episode will continue Jill and Luke's romance, introduce new characters, and be between 5 - 10 minutes long.\nDoom Town is a completely independent microbudget project. Our cast and crew are all being paid for their time, energy, and commitment. Pledging to Doom Town is a way to directly support your creative community, your friends and neighbors. \nTo thank you for supporting us, we have t-shirts, stickers, and buttons designed by Justin Kaye of www.kingwolfdesign.com.

Originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, Alex grew up doing musical theatre from a very young age. Alex moved to Portland in 2011 to attend Reed College, and has been involved in several local film and stage projects since graduating last Spring, including several web series and most recently a musical adaptation of He-Man. In addition to Doom Town, Alex is also filming a feature film musical, and rehearsing for Faultline Ensemble's \"Holding onto the Sky,\" a show about life and loss in post-earthquake Portland.\nAlex McCracken\n Chelsea Weder as Jill  \nChelsea Weder moved to Portland, Oregon in 2008 from Los Angeles, California. She studied acting, filmmaking and German at Portland State University, graduating as a triple major. While her background is mainly in screen acting, she has participated in multiple stage productions. Her most memorable stage acting experience was \"The Other Side of The Gestapo\" in the International Theater Festival in Hamburg, Germany. She stunt doubled and coordinated for PSU's very first feature film, and is also a camera/drone operator.\nChelsea Weder\n MEET THE CREW\nAnna Bremner Smith: Director / Producer\nAnna is a local producer who also specializes in Props and Set Decoration. After an unsuccessful attempt at starting an ADD support group, she landed happily in the Portland film community. She enjoys good friends, good food, and cat memes that contain off-color language. Doom Town is one of her favorite projects, and she is thrilled to be back for Episode Two!\nAnna Bremner Smith\n Guthrie Taylor: Writer / Producer  \nMy love of horror began at a young age when I cut my teeth on Stephen King novels and snuck out of bed to watch Elvira, Mistress of the Dark on late night TV. I've also been a huge fan of heavy metal since I heard Black Sabbath in the 6th grade. Doom Town is a chance for me to explore the subjects that interest me while playing around with the conventions of serial narrative.\nGuthrie Taylor\n Daniel Smith: Location Sound\nDaniel Smith\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery creative project has its challenges, and Doom Town is no different. However, we feel we're in a really great place. The experience of producing the pilot was wonderful, and we're proud of what we were able to accomplish on a microbudget and with limited resources.\n\nOur simple merchandise (stickers, buttons, and t-shirts) is all being produced in Portland. This will be our second run of t-shirts, the first run of 40 sold out by word of mouth! It's always possible that something could go wrong in production, but we doubt it.

What better way to celebrate Joel, Crow and Tom Servo's return than an epic trading card series covering all 197 episodes -- the perfect collectible for true MST3K fans everywhere. And here it IS! The FIRST SERIES of MST3K officially licensed trading cards! And this Kickstarter offers exclusive package deals ONLY available between 'now' and December 27th when this Kickstarter ends. So, 30 years of waiting for a MST3K trading card series... over a year in production... and it's all finally happening NOW and for the next month! Woo hoo!\nMYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 Series One Trading cards features:\nA 104-card \"Invention Exchange\" base set -- every invention of the first 3 seasons of the show. With each card featuring the invention on the front and on the back of the card is the dialogue of the Invention Exchange.\nInvention Exchange cards (examples)\nA 50-card \"Experiment\" base set -- every experiment of the first 3 seasons. The card fronts feature a classic scene from the show and the backs of the cards cover the movie title, release date, air date, host, director, stars, synopsis, classic riff and trivia.\nExperiment Cards (examples)\nA 29-card special subset featuring MST3K iconic mini movie posters from the Shout! Factory DVD releases ... and terrific DVD menu art on the card backs.\nMST3K mini poster and DVD menu art cards (examples)\n A 36-card 'Riff It' subset featuring a scene from a movie featured on the show along with a hilarious riff ... and on the back? Another scene with space for you to write your OWN riff.\nRiff It Cards (examples)\n And why is there a FREE pair of 3D glasses in the top of the card box? How about 18 different Anaglyph 3D cards! Put on your 3D glasses and each of these specially designed cards POPS into THREE DIMENSIONS! Designed by the incredibly talented anaglyphist Christian LeBlanc and features scenes from riffed movies, host segments and DVD poster art.\nAnaglyph 3D Cards (examples)\nA full, sealed box of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Series One Trading Cards is guaranteed to contain at least ONE complete set and subset of everything just mentioned above. \n\"But WAIT! There's MORE!\" In each box you'll find randomly inserted limited edition and rare chase cards to collect:\nA 9-card limited edition Byron Winton MST3K art card series featuring Joel, Mike, Gypsy, Tom, Crow, Dr. Forrester, TV's Frank, Pearl and Bobo.\nByron Winton Limited Edition Art Cards (examples)\n2 different authentic show-used Costume Prop cards with actual costume material as seen on MST3K -- one card includes Joel's Jumpsuit and another Dr. Forrester's lab coat. Guaranteed genuine! Own an actual piece of MST3K history!\nGenuine Costume Prop Cards (actually used in the production of MST3K)\nLook for a GENUINE MST3K Series One printing plate inside a pack -- the actual printing plate used to produce this landmark trading card series. \nGenuine Printing Plates, each one UNIQUE (examples)\nIn some boxes you'll find a pack that contains a UNIQUE original art 'sketch card'. These sketch cards are 1 of 1 and RARE -- I commissioned some of the very best sketch card artists in the hobby including Bryan Abston, Jerry Bennet, Kyle Burles, Caleb King, Garrett Dix, Rees Finlay, Tiffany Groves, Ingrid Hardy, Daniel Hayman, Michael James, JonOnArt, Achilleas Kokkinakis, Eric Lehtonen, Rich Molinelli, Andy Moore, Marshs Parkins, Kris Penix, Darrin Pepe, Tim Proctor, Scott Rorie, Kevin P. West, and MORE! If you're a serious card collector then chances are you recognize MOST of these artists as being sketch artist SUPERSTARS in the hobby. When these artists found out I was publishing MST3K Trading Cards they wanted in! \nOriginal Art Sketch Cards (examples)\nRandomly inserted into packs you may find rare 'Faux Film Cell' cards -- 8 different styles to collect but EACH and EVERY ONE of them is UNIQUE. No two alike!\n'Faux Cell Film Relic' cards (examples)\nInside the top of each box, alongside the free pair of 3D glasses, you'll find a 1 of 9 different Full Metal box topper card, produced by those geniuses at Faerie Metal (the best producer of limited edition metal cards in the biz!). \n9 Different Full Metal Box Topper cards to collect (examples)\nEach and every full, sealed box of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Trading Cards carries 36 packs and each pack has 10 cards (a typical modern day card series usually features 5 or 6 cards per pack and only 18 or 24 packs to a box ... but I'm a serious fan of MST3K and card collecting so my card series always include more ... and my saying over here is \"Too much is never enough\"). With this many packs and that many cards in each pack your odds are good for pulling rare cards... and the chances of putting together complete sets of Experiments, Invention Exchanges, MST3K mini poster and DVD menu art cards subset and Anaglyph 3D cards is excellent (in fact, those complete sets and subsets are guaranteed in each box).  As a BONUS, the MST3K retail box of 36 packs features something NO other publisher provides: Printed right on the box are 33 different mini double-sided clip-out cards in FULL color front and back on 24pt super glossy stock. It's almost like getting a FREE 33 card special subset. Oh wait, it IS like that EXACTLY!\nEach pack wrapper features a complete checklist printed on the inside showing you all the cards to look for to complete your set.\nSO HOW DO I GET ALL THIS AMAZING STUFF AND SATIATE MY DIRE NEED FOR MST3K COLLECTIBLES???\nIt's easy. You'll notice there are many different pledge levels -- levels to fit all collector budgets. \nLevel 1: $2\nYou get ONE promo card for the MST3K Series One Trading Card collection. \nLevel 2: $5\nYou get FIVE different promo cards for the MST3K Series One Trading Card collection.\nLevel 3: $10\nYou get THREE sealed packs of cards. Each pack contains 10 different cards. Consider this a 'sampler' level. And you'll also get a promo card, too. \nLevel 4: $75\nYou get a FULL SEALED BOX of 36 10-card packs. Guaranteed to contain complete sets of Experiment cards (50 cards), Invention Exchange cards (104 cards), MST3K mini poster and DVD menu art cards (29 cards), Anaglyph 3D cards (18 cards), and Riff It Retro-stalgic style cards (36) ... you'll also get randomly inserted rare and hit cards which could include a printing plate, original art sketch card, 'Faux Film Cell' card, limited edition Byron Winton art card, super rare 'Prop Card', unique printing plate and more. Each box comes with a free pair of 3D glasses PLUS 1 of 9 different Full Metal Box Topper cards. You ALSO get MST3K promo cards.\nLevel 5: $175\nAt this level you get a MASTER SET. What's in a MASTER SET? Well I'll tell you!

This is the level you want if you're a super fan and gotta have EVERYTHING. I'll even include an extra EMPTY box so you can keep one box intact and have that extra box to clipout all 33 mini cards to complete your master set (now, if you aren't allowed to play with scissors just let me know... and I'll cut that extra box FOR you so you'll have the 33 mini card set without having blisters or losing an eye messing around with scissors... just let me know after this Kickstarter is over. No worries!). A 'master set' will ONLY be available during this Kickstarter pre-sell ... and during the Kickstarter I MAY have to limit the number of these available (so you may want to jump on this one fast before the option is gone).\nLevel 6: $300\nFour Box Case Level. At this level you get FOUR sealed 36-pack boxes (for the contents description of a box just look at Level Four above). A great level for those who want to build sets and have duplicate sets to sell on ebay or give to a friend or simply keep because you're greedy and fiending for cards... a great level for those who love the thrill of seeking rare chase and hit cards... a great level for those wanting to have the odds in their favor of finding more than one sketch card, printing plate, prop card, or other limited edition material. This level also includes the promo cards. As a BONUS, those who get the Four Box Case Level will get some guaranteed bonus stuff like uncut panels, additional printing plates, error and freak cards, and more. Hurry on over to the local store and grab a barrel full of bubble gum as this level will keep you busy for HOURS!\nLevel 7: $500\nDOUBLE the 'Four Box Case Level'. You get every everything in Level 6...DOUBLED. So that's EIGHT boxes and all those goodies. And at this level I'll make it even MORE worth your while by loading up on the freebies and bonus stuff. \n     Questions and Answers:\nQ: I want to get stuff, but I don't want to sign up to back on Kickstarter. How do I go about it? \nA: Some collectors and fans don't want to sign up on Kickstarter. If you are unable to back through this Kickstarter just message me. We'll work it out, no worries.\n---------------\nQ: When will the MST3K Trading Card Series ship?\nA: The current schedule and plan is to ship the end of January. I'm good about posting updates and communications so will keep everyone in the loop. Virtually every trading card series I've published has been issued ON schedule. I realize MST3K Trading Cards has been 'coming soon' for ages... but 'soon' starts NOW! And I'm organizing everything so that product will ship towards the end of January. We've waited 30 years... just a couple more months now :-)\nQ: I'm OCD and want a box to keep sealed and a box to open. How do I back on two boxes? Or two 'Master Sets'? \nA: If you want more than one pledge level just back the pledge level you want ... then once you've pledged you can review your pledge and ADD to your pledge amount. Be SURE to message me if you do this explaining what you did. I'll check and make sure it's done right and you'll be fine.\n-----------------\nQ: Why are you running this as a Kickstarter instead of selling at a comic shop or through a catalog?\nA: This is my 14th Kickstarter over the last 4 years. I've found that pre-selling a card series on Kickstarter allows me to determine a proper production run of cards and boxes. It also allows me to offer 'master sets' to collectors on a limited basis. Once the Kickstarter is done I will have a good idea of what the total 'sealed box' needs will be for a production run to provide Kickstarter backers AND other customers (when the series is offered through distributors and retail outlets). A Kickstarter also lets me get card series to serious collectors FIRST before ANYone else. Plus a Kickstarter allows me to exercise some flexibility on providing 'stuff' for backers ... once the Kickstarter is over the only planned retail/wholesale activity for series one is simply retail boxes of 36 packs. No master sets, no case deals with bonus 'swag', no individual packs or promo card sets or anything else. Once this Kickstarter is ended the ONLY available material will be sealed 36-pack boxes... months from now.\n12/1/2017 FAQ.\nQ: Is there are will there be a binder for these cards?\nA: I've been asked this question A LOT! So figured I'd update this FAQ. When I was publishing Chronicles of the Three Stooges I created a binder 'insert kit'. I'm not a fan of commercially produced binders by 'the big boys' because they are invariably the wrong size, they invariably cost a fortune to produce and then are sold for a fortune. So for Three Stooges I created a binder insert kit -- VERY nice official cover and spine inserts so that a collector could be GIVEN the binder insert kit for free and then just go to an office supply store and pick out whatever color binder they like (black, white, red, mauve, lime green or whatever) and whatever size binder the like (1/2\", 1 1/2\", 3\" or whatever) and then simply tuck in the official cover and spine kit and presto -- official binder but entirely customized by size and color. And I didn't have to charge for the kit! So for MST3K a binder insert kit is already in the planning for around the time series two comes out. In the meantime, when you get your series one cards and load them into 9 pocket pages I suggest getting a nice binder of your favorite size and color and just make sure it has clear pocket cover and spine... and then sit back, have patience... and just relax :-)  I'll soon take care of your official binder art needs (or have fun and design your own binder cover insert!).\n-------------------\nIf you have a question not answered here please just ask -- you can message me directly through Kickstarter and I will respond as quickly as possible. \n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks? Well I suppose an asteroid could come hurtling through space and land on my head. Otherwise, this is my 14th Kickstarter Campaign... and I've published dozens of other card series over the last 4 years (including seven different Three Stooges series, Gary Saves the Graveyard, two Basil Wolverton series, Japanese Horror in 3D, and others). I know my way around card publishing and financing production. For MST3K Series One I have the BEST sketch card artists on board, the BEST printing production broker on the planet (Karen 'Wonder Woman' Cowan at ICONIX who has overseen ALL the card series I've published since I started my business), and ALL cards are written and designed and ready for production and officially approved through Shout! Factory. I also consider myself an excellent communicator -- you can view my other Kickstarters and see the level at which I keep backers informed during a campaign, after a campaign, during card production/collation/assembly, and through actual shipping of cards to backers AND afterwards. You'll NEVER be left wondering \"what's going on\" because I post regular updates and keep in contact with EVERYONE. I've never had a publishing challenge I couldn't overcome with the help of my printing production broker ... and except once (when I was 2 weeks late shipping on one campaign) I've shipped everyone their goodies ON TIME. Very few other Kickstarter hosts can make that claim! While there are always risks and challenges with production, logistics or even crossing the street I have years of experience publishing trading cards and conducting Kickstarter campaigns. So the risks and challenges are minimized.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "One Promo Card", "descp": "You get ONE promo card for the MST3K Series One Trading Card collection.

And who is J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs? And why is his name always in quotes? And for nonbelievers, why has this strangely compelling parody religion, this long-running postmodern joke, caught the attention of such pop culture icons as Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), David Byrne, Robert Crumb, Richard Linklater, Alex Cox, Ken Kesey, Frank Zappa, Jonathan Demme, and Devo\u2019s Mark Mothersbaugh? And is it true that Tori Amos is also one of \"Bob\"\u2019s chosen?  \n\"Bob\" and the Church have caught the attention of many\u2013 include David Byrne, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), Tori Amos, Stephen Colbert, Robert Crumb, Mark Mothersbaugh and DEVO, Matt Groening, Margaret Moser, Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, and more.\nARE WE CONTROLLED BY SECRET FORCES? ARE ALIEN MONSTERS BRINGING A STARTLING NEW WORLD? DO PEOPLE THINK YOU\u2019RE STRANGE? DO YOU? \nThe Church of the SubGenius: The Early Years\n\u201cWe tied together every occult, superstitious fringe belief you could think of\u2026it was so much fun!\u201d\n\u2013 Ivan Stang, co-founder\nBorn into the suburban world of the 1950s, future founders of the Church of the SubGenius Reverend Ivan Stang (Douglass St. Clair Smith) and Dr. Philo Drummond (Steve Wilcox) come of age during the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a time of unprecedented social and political tumult. They experience the rise of a deafening consumer culture, the tarnishing of the \"American Dream,\" the violence of the Vietnam War abroad, and the Kennedy assassinations and conspiracies that follow. \nAs youths they revel in the delights of stable families, monster movies, Science Fiction, super-8 moviemaking, dinosaur figures, comic books, and Rock 'n' Roll. As they grow older they witness the emergence of televangelism, the Jonestown Massacre, punk culture, and Reaganomics.\nDespite both growing up in Texas, it was not until the mid 70s that Stang and Drummond meet and quickly forge a friendship over a shared love of comic books, Captain Beefheart, and UFO paperbacks. One not so particular eve in 1977, while bemoaning their lack of conventional \u201csuccess\u201d for two such intelligent, well read chaps, Stang remarks, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly geniuses.\u201d To which Drummond replies, \u201cyeah, we\u2019re sub-geniuses.\u201d \nAnd in that moment the Church of the SubGenius is born. It is not long after that J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs reveals himself as the Church's iconic prophet and foremost patron of ineffable Slack. In fact, Stang and Drummond will later come to the realization that \"Bob\" has been planting evidence of his presence for them for the past twenty years!!!\nTHE SUBGENIUS DIASPORA\n\u201cThere was that moment of realizing that this thing goes further than I ever imagined.\u201d\n\u2013 Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman)\nIn late 1979 Stang and Drummond, with the help of their wives, brainstorm what would become perhaps the single most significant marketing effort made at the inception of the Church of the SubGenius \u2013 the writing, design, printing, and distribution of Pamphlet #1. The doctrine of the Church quickly spreads, and the word of \u201cBob\u201d and the teachings of JHVH-1 teach \u201ctime control\u201d as a way to wrest \u201cSlack\u201d from the \u2018Pinks\u2019 and \u2018Normals.\u2019 The Church, it seems, has struck a nerve amidst the deadening consumer culture, the evisceration of basic social services, and the worship of wealth that occurred during the Reagan/Thatcher years.\nL: An early years Devival | R: The Three Wise Guys \u2013 Ivan Stang, Dr.X and Philo Drummond \u2013 pose with a Model X Humanoid (1979)\nAs \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s pamphlet continues to travel the world, the emergent punk publishing scene and new wave comic writers seize on the humor and cultural critique of the Church's doctrine. In San Francisco it is fished out of a trashcan by cartoonist and artist Paul Mavrides, igniting a SubGenius cell that gives the movement some of its most enduring art and performances through LIES (Paul Mavrides), Dr. Howland Owl (Hal Robins), Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman), Janor Hypercleats and Pope Sternodox. \n\"Bob\" captures the zetigeist of the day. Cartoonist Robert Crumb reprints Pamphlet #1 in the first issue of his comic Weirdo. A few years later Simon and Schuster publishes The Book of the SubGenius.  Acclaimed film director and SubGenius Alex Cox channels Church mythology in Repo Man as the glowing, alien-owned Chevy Malibu soars high above Los Angeles with Otto (Emilio Estevez) and Miller (Tracy Walke) inside, their faces shining with Slack as Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) watches from below. \nDr. Howl and Puzzling Evidence conduct legendary \u201cDevivals,\u201d radio shows (More than an Hour, Less than a Show), and introduce the word of \"Bob\" to Burning Man. The Stark Fist of Removal newsletter, The Hour of Slack podcast, an MTV special, and countless cassette tapes, posters, comics, videos, websites, and Facebook groups perpetuate the word of \"Bob.\" \nBy the turn of the century, publications as powerful as TIME Magazine begin to get the SubGenius joke when \u201cBob\u201d is voted \u2018Fraud of the Century\u201d by readers of its online poll. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, the \u201cFree Party\u201d constituents of Brighton in Great Britain voted \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs as an M.P. to the House of Commons three times.\nToday, \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s hucksterism and the wisdom of JHVH-1 is apparent in all fifty states and a multitude of countries across the globe!\nPLAY\n\nAnother early SubGenius of Texas, David Boone (late husband of Slacking Towards Bethlehem director Sandy K. Boone), documents the rise of the SubGenius in his 1980 film, Invasion of the Aluminum People, which is lauded by Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme. This is one of the first known recorded instances of the transmission of SLACK.\nGIVE TO THIS KICKSTARTER NOW AND ACHIEVE SALVATION \u2013 OR TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!\nOnly with your support can our intrepid group of award-winning filmmakers dare to make this film.

We\u2019ve only just begun to uncover many of the SubGenius\u2019 most guarded secrets.

One of the nation\u2019s top music journalists and music scene nurturers, Reverend Reverend Doctor Doctor Archdoctor Saint Margaret Moser even had a photo of J.R. \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs on her Austin Chronicle business card. She said it helped her connect with her interview subjects, many of whom were already members of the Church themselves.\nPLAY\n\nIn her interview with us, she spoke about the pleasure, \u201cthe great release, to have all this nutty stuff in your head and find like minded people to express it with.\u201d But most notably she sang a song written by her own hand, \"Oh, Life's a Bowl of Cherries with \"Bob\" Dobbs.\" Saint Moser's life epitomized the way that membership in the Church accelerated the discovery of true friendships, experimentations, creative collisions, and rebellion through art, music, and comedy against dehumanization in any form.\nWHY THIS FILM? \nWhy not this film? Pull the wool over your own eyes and help us make a movie! The Church of the SubGenius is the underground movement that has galvanized the imaginative, the artistic, the nerdy, even the deranged \u2013 to examine the simmering dystopia in their culture, and do absolutely nothing about it... except, maybe, poke fun at it all. The Church of the SubGenius is taking over the universe. The sooner you learn about it, the better off you\u2019ll be. \nPLAY\n\nNow more than ever we feel that the story of the Church of the SubGenius needs to be told.

BONUS for anyone who has already pledged or WILL pledge before October 2nd -- because this kickstarter has done so well I'm INCREASING what everyone gets. I've expanded the Monster Choke n Gag series from 37 cards to 64 CARDS! ... PLUS you'll get a secret surprise 15 CARD MONSTER set (it'll be a surprise... but you'll be 'blowed away' by golly at it's monstrous goodness... trust me, you'll LOVE IT!)... plus I've added some additional exclusive promo cards so the total number of promo cards has gone from about 15 ... to 26 different!). As mentioned, if you've already pledged at the $50, $90, $100 or more levels you get this bonus stuff AUTOMATICALLY! A FREE BONUS TREAT from RRParksCARDS! If you want to take a look at the FULL SET of EXCLUSIVE promo cards just scroll on down to the very end of this description... it's the last photo.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHAPPY HALLOWEEN from RRParks CARDS! We're wrapping up our fourth year as a trading card publisher as well as our fourth Halloween as a publisher. Every October we publish some fun spoooooky horror/monster sets and this Halloween is no different except that we have FOUR NEW CARD SERIES all releasing before October 31st 2017! Your pledge on this project helps with production costs and will make sure you get ALL FOUR CARD SERIES as well as exclusives.\nChronicles of the Grim Reaper Series 3\nFirst up,  Chronicles of the Grim Reaper Series 3. Our series 1 featured the whimsical and macabre artwork of Tom Rowlandson ... series 2 featured the gothic horror artwork of Hieronymus Hess. This series 3 features 25 standard size 'retro stalgic' cards of the classic 1741 Gedenkt Sterven and Pater Abraham St. Clara suite,  produced in Amersterdam nearly 300 years ago! These have been colored in muted grays and oranges (the originals were back and white) for a spooky 'feel' to them. Set comes in it's own wrapper. \nMonster Choke 'n Gag Series 4\nSecond up is Monster Choke 'n Gag Series 4 -- with classic stills from 'bad' monster and horror movies and goofy jokes (some realllly pushing the lines of good taste, but hey -- we're all adults here). This is a largest Monster Choke 'n Gag series to date with 37 different mini cards in panels and singles along with a separate checklist. the wrapper inside is designed with 'do it yourself' riff options. Set comes in it's own 'wide' wrapper.\nHalloween Trick or Treat Series Five\nThird up is Halloween Trick or Treat Series 5 -- continuing our journey back in time to the classic age of Halloween this, too, is our largest Halloween Trick and Treat series to date with 20 different cards featuring full color reproductions of vintage Halloween art -- and on the backs? Creepy, living Vegetable creatures from the turn of the century! Like the Grim Reaper and Monster Choke 'n Gag series these, too, are old timey retro-Stalgic style. Set comes in it's own wrapper.\nN104 Dukes Comic Characters\nFourth and final is the 'treat' in 'trick or treat' -- for the first time in 130 years a complete reprinting of the non-sport classic N104: Duke's Comic Characters. This 25-card set has been completely remastered, capturing all the color of the original series but in a STANDARD trading card size (instead of the elongated size of the original series). And let's face it, who here has $1,000-$1,200 to spend on a 25-card set? I sure don't -- so here, for ALL of us, is the classic N104 series of 1888. The backs feature the original checklist artwork like on the originals, produced in a candesce uncoated back 'retro-stalgic' front sheen offset. Set comes in it's own wrapper.\nAll FOUR different card series, with bonus promos and inserts and wrappers\nSo that's four different sets for Halloween --  for me it just wouldn't be Halloween if I wasn't loading a bunch of spooky sets into my collection. And hopefully some of you feel the same -- that after 4 years, it's part of Halloween to have RRParksCARDS monster sets to collect. \nAll 9 cards in 3-card set -- Gold, Silver and White Metal\nIn addition to the basic four sets above it wouldn't be a Kickstarter without special stuff, right? So that great couple team at Faerie Metal will be doing gold, silver and metal special limited edition cards for Kickstarter. There will be:\n3 Gold Metal Vintage Halloween cards (images NOT in the regular set) ...\n3 Silver Metal N104 Duke's Comic Character cards with the 1888 images from the classic series...\nand\n3 White Metal Chronicles of the Grim Reaper cards series.\nThese metal cards will be limited to the number of backers (well, \"plus one\" because I want a set, too).\nExamples of printing plates -- each plate is either cyan (blue), magenta (red), yellow or black.\nIn addition to Faerie Metal cards backers at the special pledge level will ALSO get genuine printing plates from Chronicles of the Grim Reaper Series 3, Halloween Trick or Treat Series 5, Monster Choke 'n Gag Series 4 and N104 Duke's Comic Characters. \nError cards will be a surprise!\nIn addition to all THAT, master set backers will ALSO get at least TWO error cards. How on EARTH could I know there will be error cards? Because I got in the production run of N104 this afternoon and FOUND error cards. How cool is THAT!\nSpecial Promo Card Set\nIn addition to all that additional stuff, we're NOT quite done... master set backers will get special wide promo cards! These promo cards are not being given out 'free with SASE' or included with other purchases. There's only TWO ways to get them -- one is this Kickstarter, in the master level pledge (and the other is SOME subscribers of The Wrapper will be sent one with their renewal subscription notice). And that's IT! No conventions, shows, requests, etc. So if you ever want to own a complete set of all the exclusive promos for Duke's Comic Characters, Grim Reaper Series 3, Monster Choke 'n Gag Series 4 or Halloween Trick or Treat Series 5 this...is...IT! Right now. And there are over 15 of these different promo cards!\nBonus 3-card promo set\nONE more 'additional' thing for master set level backers -- the THREE different RRParksCARDS 2017 regular Halloween Series Promo cards.\nDuring this Kickstarter I will actually be engaged in production proceedings so that the only thing left to do when this Kickstarter ends is to submit my order for Faerie Metal for the metal cards. This way I can assure all backers that they'll get their packages full of Halloween cardboard goodies BEFORE Halloween. \nFor those who have not been following my annual sets I'm creating a special pledge level for ALL my past Halloween sets and series ... that includes Halloween Trick or Treat Series 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ... Monster Choke 'n Gag Series 1, 2, 3 and 4 ... Chronicles of the Grim Reaper Series 1, 2, and 3 .... The Dungeon of Doctor Dreck Series 1 and 2 ... Gary Saves the Graveyard with ALL 8 ACTOR AUTOGRAPH cards ... Japanese Horror Yoshitoshi in 3D with 3D glasses ... and The Monster Times Boxed Set. And since 'The Most Irritating Man in the World' series includes severed heads, flaming skeletons, blood and gore let's throw it into the mix, too. \n... As always, if you want a customized pledge level created that's not a problem. Just message me during the Kickstarter campaign and we'll hammer out something that works for you -- uncut sheets, multiple sets, additional printing plates ... perhaps one of the limited edition Hans Holbeing Dance of Death etching sets... If you can think of it, we can figure out how to make a custom package for you.  Unlike some Kickstarter campaigns, I will actually be producing DURING the campaign... so that as soon as the campaign ends and 'funds' clear I'll get in the order for the metal cards but ALL other card sets will be produced so I will actually be mailing out packages FAST ...   I want ever backer on this campaign to get their trading card package well in advance of Halloween and will do all I can to make sure that happens. Expect the 'usual' RRParks CARDS Kickstarter 'updates' throughout the project and afterwards, keeping everyone regularly updated on progress and shipping. Questions? Just message me...

The back of each card features a bio of the character on the front.  The set is strictly limited to 500 packs!\nABOUT ED REPKA\nEd Repka is known worldwide for his many illustrations of Vic Rattlehead, Megadeth's skeletal mascot and is widely regarded as the undisputed king of thrash metal album cover art with hundreds of covers to his credit. His art has also appeared on numerous magazines including Horrorhound and Revolver, Star Wars and Mars Attacks trading cards from Topps, as well as apparel, posters, and action figures. He has also created concept and design work for hundreds of toys and collectables, and designed several mascots for heavy metal festivals.\nABOUT SIDEKICK LAB\nThe set is produced by SideKick Lab, who manufactured Topps' Mars Attacks: Occupation trading card series, and Dan Brereton's CREEPING FLESH trading cards, both of which were successfully funded on kickstarter.\nThis project is being run by Tom Lichtman, owner of SideKick, and Adam Levine, formerly of Topps. Both were responsible for running the Mars Attacks campaign, while Tom & SideKick handled both manufacturing and shipping/fulfillment for those projects.\n  Digital Mock-Ups\n\u2022 Wax Pack Sticker Set: the wax wrapped sticker set will include 12 full color stickers.

It is BEAUTIFUL -- collecting over 240 lobby cards and one sheet graphics all into one place for both Three Stooges fans  and card collectors to enjoy.  \nBackground Story on the Creation of this Card Series\nVintage Lobby Cards, One Sheets and Poster Art\n A perfect case of being in the right place at the right time. In 2014 I'd gotten the licensing agreement to publish Chronicles of The Three Stooges Trading Cards. A Stooge and trading card collector's dream come true for me. I was provided access to some 2,200+ hi res archive images of The Three Stooges (but no lobby cards or one sheets) ... I then built myself a small library of Three Stooges reference books and materials ... and the licensing company was enthusiastic, encouraging and extremely helpful in assisting me putting together the largest Three Stooges card series ever (and with already six trading card series and some 1,200 different cards perhaps one of the largest non-sport series of all time). Just about the time I got the license and began pre-production of Chronicles of The Three Stooges Series One the major auction house Robert Edwards Auctions began handling the largest Three Stooges lobby card and one sheet collection... I can't recall how I got wind of it but I did and at EXACTLY the right time, right before they sold and shipped the items to buyers (after that they obviously couldn't take high res photos). I contacted them. And I worked out a deal at the last second to have them take high resolution TIFF format images of the entire collection. ALL of them. Over 240 different images. Cost me a pretty penny (well... more like a quarter million pennies). I wasn't sure if I would be able to have time or authorization to publish the card series because Chronicles of The Three Stooges was pretty darn MASSIVE for this newbie publisher to tackle in the three short years I had to publish. And so I set the TIFF files aside -- I was willing to take the chance because such a collection would never again be all in one place at the same time in order to photograph them all. But after Chronicles of The Three Stooges Series Five was finished the licensing company granted me an additional year on my contract. YAY! That meant two things -- firstly, I had enough time to publish the SIXTH trading card entry (The '1959 Three Stooges Reprint' card series) AND also just enough time before my revised contract expired to create SEVENTH series:  'The Three Stooges Theater' series. Which I've done. Which is ready to go to press. Which is why I'm running this Kickstarter. With this seventh series I will have covered (I believe) every single aspect of The Three Stooges from 1930 to 1959 and even the 1960s. I honestly can't think of a thing I haven't covered (and I've had a lot of emails and phone calls with fellow fans trying to figure out if anything was left out) -- and so this seventh Three Stooges series is the grand finale to one of the funnest projects I've ever worked on.\nThe Three Stooges Theater Trading Card Series\nEnough back story. Onto the card series details. This series is currently designed to include 106 different base cards featuring the lobby cards and one sheet poster art from 1934 through 1959 -- the cards are being printed on high gloss quality 16pt UV stock with high end offset printing with the lobby card cards featuring a full card view on the front of one with two lobby cards presented on the backs of the cards... and for the other cards, a full-card image of a one-sheet poster on each side of the card. This seventh series also includes 16 'retro stalgic' style cards (like the 1959 continuation cards from Chronicles of The Three Stooges Series 2, 3, 4 and 5 and the '1959 Three Stooges Reissue Series') each featuring a lobby card on the front and on the back of the card, 4 new 'Faux Scratch n Sniff' Stooges cards, 20 different tobacco style card panels with -- you guessed it -- classic lobby cards ...  plus beautiful silver metal box toppers AND 5 gold metal and 4 white metal Kickstarter exclusive cards. Might even be a few additional surprises.\nTobacco Style Cards\nThe Three Stooges Theater Trading Card Series is being issued in a retail style pack box -- with 24 10-card packs. A box is guaranteed to contain a complete base set, complete retro stalgic continuation subset, complete set of Faux Scratch n Sniff Stooge cards. Each box will also contain 1 of 9 different silver metal box toppers (don't worry -- there's a master set pledge level in this kickstarter so you can get it all). The box is designed to have mini clipout cards like Chronicles of The Three Stooges Series 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nThe Wrapper Design\nPublishing Timeframe\nThe going plan is to publish around the end of April and release the product late May or early June. Let's call it 'June' for the moment. If you've backed my previous Three Stooges Kickstarters you already know that I issue product almost ALWAYS on time (usually early... and only once with a 2 week delay from planned release date). And I'll naturally post updates regularly to keep everyone informed regarding production and assembly and shipping. \nThe Three Stooges Theater Trading Card Series Kickstarter Exclusives\nGOLD METAL EXCLUSIVES\n  White Metal Exclusives\nThe GOLD and WHITE METAL Exclusives will be limited edition releases and available ONLY to Kickstarter backers. They will be limited to the number of backers online, phone-in and snail mailed during the Kickstarter. So I'll know how many sets to have the fine folks at Faerie Metal produce once this kickstarter is over. I'll post this information as an update as the campaign goes forward. These GOLD and WHITE METAL cards feature 5 of the most beautiful and iconic of the poster art of the 1930s-1950s as well as my all-time favorite lobby card set \"Whoops! I'm an Indian\". Each of the GOLD and WHITE METAL cards will have a signed and numbered certificate of authenticity on the back (similar to the 1959 Commemorative metal set in my last Kickstarter). \nSilver Metal Box Toppers\n9 DIFFERENT SILVER METAL BOX TOPPERS\n The SILVER METAL box toppers will be issued at the rate of ONE per box with 9 different total to collect. Each SILVER METAL box topper will have a signed certificate of authenticity on the back. These feature the classic and iconic 'credit cards' from the Columbia shorts -- Curly era, Shemp era and Besser era graphics as well as title cards from Woman Haters (the first Three Stooges Columbia short), Punch Drunks, Men in Black (nominated for an Academy Award), Pardon my Scotch, Three Little Beers and Hold That Lion (Curly's last appearance in a Stooge short and the only Three Stooges Short with all 3 Howard brothers in the same short). These are being produced by Faerie Metal so you already know, I'm sure, that means BEAUTIFUL metal cards!\n PLEDGE LEVELS\nI'm setting up this campaign with levels to satisfy (hopefully) all collector levels and budgets and I want long-time backers to see this as not just a fun series but also the BEST PRICED 'grand finale' to a 4-year long endeavor to create The Three Stooges trading card series that always should have been. \n$4 PLEDGE. This gets you the two basic promo cards, promo card #1 and promo card #2.  \n$20 PLEDGE. This gets you 5 10-card packs plus promo cards #1 and #2. \n$50 PLEDGE. This gets you a full complete BOX of 24 10-card packs and ONE (of 9) SILVER METAL box toppers. As mentioned above, a 24-pack box is guaranteed to contain a complete base set, complete 'retro stalgic' continuation subset, complete 4-card 'Faux Scratch n Sniff' insert set and one box topper SILVER METAL card. I'm also planning to include at least ONE genuine printing plate 'chase' card per box featuring an authentic 1 of 1 printing plate from Chronicles of The Three Stooges. Plus the 2 different promo cards. After the Kickstarter is ended boxes will be repriced to $75/box (so this is everyone's chance to have an early bird special price on a full box).\n$100 MASTER SET LEVEL PLEDGE. This gets you everything from the $50 pledge level PLUS you'll get all 9 different SILVER METAL box toppers, all 5 different GOLD METAL exclusives and all 4 WHITE METAL \"Whoops! I'm an Indian\" cards. Plus all promo cards that are published for the card series. GOLD and WHITE METAL limited edition cards will ONLY be available during the kickstarter. \n$350 DEALER LOT PLEDGE. Since this series is being issued in retail boxes (as opposed to a factory set style release) with packs being barcoded for individual sale by dealers I've created this option for dealers who want to sell packs in their store... or 'case breakers' who want to open packs and build sets... or simply those collectors who want a LOT of packs to open and enjoy building sets for their collection. This level will get you EIGHT boxes, each with a different SILVER METAL box topper... and I'll include the 9th SILVER METAL box topper as a bonus. So you'll get EIGHT boxes and guaranteed complete set of all 9 different SILVER METAL cards (plus one printing plate per box... you already know what RRParks CARDS printing plates sell for on ebay... the plates alone would cover your entire cost of this pledge level). Am sure I'll also be including error cards and other bonus items.\nADD ON LEVELS: For those who are just now discovering RRParks CARDS Three Stooges card series these following levels are designed to 'catch you up' with the series. This way you can back the 'The Three Stooges Theater' series (above) and then ADD ON a level that includes all previous card series. If you have any questions just message me -- I realize there is a lot of data in this Kickstarter so let me know if something isn't clear and we'll get through it! \n$350 \"I WAS ASLEEP\" pledge level. This level is to help late comers 'catch up'. It includes Chronicles of The Three Stooges Series 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 PLUS the 1959 Three Stooges Reissue box. If you're only just now finding out about the Three Stooges trading cards here's your chance to catch up. Series 1, 2 and 3 were all pack-style retail box releases and guaranteed to contain complete base sets. Series 4 and 5 were factory set releases each containing complete sets (with Series 4 being perhaps the LARGEST single non-sport card series ever published in a box). You get it all ... base sets, subsets, foil box toppers, Christmas foils, candid foils, all the retro-stalgic continuation card subsets, all the 3D Stooge cards, all the Glow in the Darks, Film Cell Relic cards, 1960s style pack sets, tobacco card panels, and more. The 1959 Reissue box even includes a full color metal portrait card. \n$400 \"I WAS ASLEEP\" DELUXE. You get everything listed in the \"I WAS ASLEEP\" pledge level PLUS a complete set of ALL promo cards for ALL series. Plus an extra printing plate from Chronicles of The Three Stooges. PLUS the expanded collectors kit (which includes about 60 collector kit exclusive cards, binder cover inserts for 'Chronicles' AND for '1959 Reissue' series, Chronicles 'title' header cards, uncut gilded (gold) foil panel of Larry, Moe and Curly PLUS uncut foil 'manga style' Larry, Moe, Curly and Shemp. Considering modern trading card series and how hard they are to complete this is the HOLY GRAIL of non-sport card deals. \n$750 \"I WAS SLEEP TWICE AS LONG\". With this pledge you get everything in the $400 pledge level... except TWICE. Double everything. One collection for YOU and one collection to squirrel away... break up and sell on ebay or shows... give as a present to someone (which is likely more than they deserve, you're such a good friend!).\nCUSTOMIZED PLEDGE LEVELS. If you don't see a pledge level that suits your needs just let me know. I've done customized pledge levels before -- it's no bother. Be advised, requesting a customized pledge level is NOT for 'haggling' over pledge level prices -- the prices listed above are what they are (and if you've ever published trading cards you can already see they are very low). A customized pledge level can be created for those seeking a bulk deal... or if someone has Chronicles series 1 and 3 and the 1959 and wants a level that includes 2 and 4 and the 'Theater' set. Or for collectors seeking certain printing plate package deals, uncut sheets and so on. I'll do what I can (within reason) to accommodate special requests. You get the idea... this is to fine tune a package that covers everything you want, need or gotta have or you'll die.\n I'll post updates during and after the Kickstarter campaign letting everyone know progress and production 'milestones' and finally 'shipping date' once production is done and 'backer swag' is packaged up and ready for mailing. Printing production of this series is planned to take place around the end of April and last minute design changes may occur depending on licensing.  Questions? Please just message me. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS: This Kickstarter campaign marks my 10th Kickstarter ... perhaps 11th. And my 23rd trading card series. All of my prvious Kickstarters were successfully funded and products issued on time ... or within about a week or two of scheduled release date. The Three Stooges Theater Card Series is designed, formatted, concept approved through licensing and in the final stages of fine tuning. My print broker, the amazing Karen Cowan of ICONIX is lining up the printing companies involved (ALL of which we've worked with before) ... I've sent in prototypes to Faerie Metal for the metal cards ... packaging and wrappers are designed. Everything is ready to launch and publish. And once this Kickstarter has ended and funded I'll be going right to production. The release date is tentatively set for late May or June. I foresee no problems. So the risks involve asteroids crashing to earth around the vicinity of Carson City Nevada... catastrophic earthquakes... or alien invasion. Otherwise, as with the previous 10 or 11 Kickstarters everything gets published on time and everyone gets what they pledged on ... I'm no stranger to publishing, production, time frames, product assembly and shipping. If you've backed my projects in the past you already know that I post many updates to keep everyone informed of production, progress and release date changes [and sometimes even BONUS stuff being added to the 'swag' packages] ... and I answer all questions within 24 hours (whenever possible). Note, packaging and cards may have some design changes (no changes are currently planned, but sometimes last minute legal notice or template changes are needed for production and logistics. The box in the above photos as the design right now and while the final box will be retro style there may, or may not, be slight changes for logistical reasons). If you have any questions or if something is unclear by all means message me -- with your help and support we can make this historical trading card series possible and the BEST it can possibly be.

You try to trick and deceive the other players until you kill their monsters. When you have the last monster alive, you win.\nThis game is all about deception and manipulation. After playing games where you have to follow the rules and be honest, I got bored. I wanted to lie. This game lets you do that. You can use any card in the game as long as the other players think that you have it in your hand. Easy, right? You would think so. If they call your bluff, your monster dies! However, if you were telling the truth, you get to live!\nThe Idea\nI'm taking a game design class for college, and this is where the idea came from. I'm not sure how many people are taking their game seriously, but I for one wanted to create a game that others wanted to play. Throughout play testing, it was evident that others wanted to play this game, so I got some help from my friend Jake and together we fleshed it out into the game it currently is. Now we're here and I would love to see this game become something that is played outside of my own house.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThere are two reasons that people go to Kickstarter for funding. One is money. Money is a big deal for things like this. The other is the people. I want to be able to connect with who buys my game. I can't go license this to a big game company while keeping the same level of communication that I can on Kickstarter. I like that I have reward tiers that let you suggest ideas for cards and even fully design cards! That is why I chose Kickstarter.\nWhy $16,000\nThat's a lot of money. Why do I need it all? Well, I want to create two versions of the game, a version to possibly sell in stores, then one exclusively for you guys, a Kickstarter edition that will never sell outside of this campaign. I need $11,000 do this. Between the Kickstarter fee and processing fees, I can expect about 7-10% of my funding to disappear, so I need say at least $12,225 so that after the fees I will have $11,000 that I need. The reason for that amount is that each game costs roughly $5000 for a printing run, leaving me with $1000 to deal with any hiccups in the manufacturing process. After this I need to increase the price, because shipping costs account for funding the project, but they will not be able to go towards the project, as I have to ship the games, meaning I can't spend that money. This is my first Kickstarter so I don't know any special tricks to bring the price down, but if I make more games in the future, I can bring this knowledge with me. The goal of this campaign will meet the bare minimum needed to make this game while also leaving a small sum of about $1,000 if there are extra fees in manufacturing.\nIn the Box\nWhat's included in the box are the base game cards, which I will update with pictures when we have the art. The eight cards featured in the game are:\nHunter, Gorgon, Werewolf, Oracle, Vampire, Shapeshifter, Kraken, Cyclops\nAny reward tier that includes the Kickstarter edition of the game will also include an undetermined extra cards (at least five) decided by us and backers, and potentially any special cards from the I AM BECOME MONSTER tiers. These cards will not be available in any sale of the game not from Kickstarter.\nStretch Goals\nI am still talking with the production company about pricing for all the upgrades that I want to do, so I don't have a clear price yet. I will update this section when we meet the goals, when I have clear prices, and maybe even to add more goals!\nBetter Art!\n     With this level of funding, I'll be able to pay artists instead of doing the art myself. While the current art isn't bad, it could be a lot better!\nBetter Instructions!\n     As of right now, the instructions are a one page, front and back sheet of paper that doesn't look very nice. It effectively communicates the goal of the game and how to play, but at this level of funding I can upgrade the instruction booklet to be just that - a booklet!\nBetter Boxes!\n     At this level of funding we could have way better boxes. Its something you don't really think about, but the game needs a nice home!\nBetter Quality\n     Better quality says all needs to say. We can get nicer cards with every game and nicer 'resource' tiles. It will make for an all around nicer experience!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but I have done research and I plan to do it justice.\n\nAfter getting funded, the only foreseeable challenge is to make sure the rewards are printed and sent out on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Braden Ledford\nFirst created \u00b7 6 backed"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Art!", "update_content": "As of right now, we're still finalizing art.

It is the greatest project in the history of mankind! \nFor many years now, a large part of the society present strong resistance to hearing the words \u201cNew World Order\u201d. But it is we alone who can create such a \u201cNew Order of the World\u201d as we deem appropriate. This is the noble goal I am encouraging you to pursue. It is not about the well known \u201cNew World Order\u201d but about something completely different, which I have called a \u201cNew Order of the World\u201d! In the fight against the introduction of the \u201cNew World Order\u201d we will be assisted by supporting the plan of introduction of a \u201cNew Order of the World\u201d! Each of you may contribute to introducing momentous changes in the history of mankind!\n I want to emphasise clearly that my main objective is to convince the society around the world so that they want to introduce the New Order of the World and publishing the book is essential to convince people to be willing to introduce historical changes. As regards the book that I have the honour to present, I have been working on it for about ten years (with brief pauses). The book is full of great, interesting NOVELTIES. Many ideas presented in it may soon indicate the direction for future human history!\nAt the moment, my main goals is for the book titled \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d to reach the largest possible portion of society; afterwards, we will reach a completely different stage. (I assure you that everybody will have the guarantee of free choice. Everybody has a right to the freedom of thought and freedom of speech).\nThere is no doubts that initially, this book may cause a lot of controversy. However, very soon it will be the case that global society will see for itself that we are now faced exclusively with the truth and the most precious values cherished by all people.\n If there is anybody now who believes that I exaggerate in using the phrase \u201cintroducing the New Order of the World\u201d, I would consciously like to declare that if the solutions I want to present in my book had been introduced before, there would be no person on earth who would claim that these changes are too insignificant for us to be talking about the New Order of the World. In some aspects, these will be great changes that humanity has never experienced before! It is also worth adding that if these changes had been effected in the world before, I don\u2019t know whether we could find one person willing to return to the order observed nowadays \u2013 or previously, in any period of history. (At the same time, I want to assure you that every person searching for truth will probably agree with the ideas included in the book). Dear all, let us think about the future and support the most precious values of this world!\n The main topics of my book are \u201cRELIGION\u201d and \u201cWARS\u201d. To be more precise, in my book I mainly present: \n- A new, genuine Religion \n- A new, effective way to solve the problem of wars around the world\nAs regards the topic of RELIGION, the main reason why I wrote part of the book on this subject was that so far, we have never had a TRUE religion in the world. So far, people have made many significant errors as regards religion. The time has come to reach some wise conclusions. In my book, I have shown a new, true religion and I precisely described all its teachings, prayers, celebrations, symbols, names and evidence pointing to its authenticity, as well as considerations of various religious topics, etc., etc. Since this is the only TRUE religion that has ever appeared on earth, I hope that a large part of the global society will quickly want to become its followers. (I have also seen to it that the authenticity of this religion may be proved not only to the followers of other religions, but also atheists and agnostics). I would like to add that this religion is BRAND NEW, meaning that it is not an offshoot of any existing religion in the world, nor is it similar to any of the religions that have so far appeared. I have created this religion from SCRATCH. (I would like to emphasize that this religion is no \u201cparody\u201d or a \u201csuspicious cult\u201d, but a genuine religion). Let me mention one curious detail, namely, if one were to adopt a concept that \u201call the people on this planet will follow one and the same religion\u201d, I am convinced that only the True Religion (which I have created) could prove to be the one. This is my opinion, because I believe that in order for the whole global society (or at least a large part of it) to be able to follow one and the same religion, one important condition would have to be fulfilled beforehand, namely: this religion would have to be fully based on TRUTH. (Unfortunately, so far no religion has manager to fulfil this condition). [Looking at some parts of the world, where religious divisions and conflicts are exacerbating, you will probably guess how many advantages there would be if there were a true religion in the world. (However, the main point and meaning of this religion rely in its TRUTH)].\n[If anybody believes that \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d, \u201cgetting rid of all the untruth\u201d and \u201erespecting the truth\u201d in religion is a stupid idea, it\u2019s enough to look at history again to see what trouble humanity had for this reason. (Also in the modern world, religious conflicts are numerous)].\nI did realise that until people start to read my book, there is not the slightest chance e.g. \u201efor atheists to stop wanting to be atheists\u201d, \u201efor agnostics to stop wanting to be agnostics\u201d, and \u201ethe followers of other religions to stop wanting to follow them\u201d. (A simple discussion will not change anything, but the chance becomes clear only after reading the book, which is ca. 2000 pages long and presents certain topics precisely). This means that initially, everybody will have negative attitude to religion and my other ideas. (However, I do hope many people will change their point of view after reading my book \u2013 this is also why I titled it \u201eOpen Your Eyes\u201d). Today, I only want people to become familiar with my book. As regards their decisions, they will follow afterwards or whenever the people wish.\n On the other hand, the main reason why I wrote part of the book dedicated to WARS, was the fact that mankind has never managed to find a System that could guarantee lasting peace on earth. So far, people have made many significant errors as regards war. The time has come to reach some wise conclusions. As we examine the topic of wars (to see how many casualties and victims there were), we wil conclude that the topic of war is a very important one. (If there is still someone who does not understand it by now, they will surely understand once they are themselves affected by an armed conflict. The problem is that it may be too late then). In the part of the book devoted to wars, I have presented a new, reliable System, which will definitely guarantee stable, lasting peace on earth. (We would actually receive a warranty that it would be impossible to wage World Wars and other major armed conflicts). By way of an example, I am 100% sure that if we implemented my project regarding world peace \u2013 as described in my book \u2013 we would never again be faced with World War III! If anybody thinks it\u2019s stupid, please examine the world history, e.g. shocking images that the society witnessed during World War II.\n  Dear All, I guess you will think I have lost my mind. I know that at first sight, these words may seem too fantastic to be real. However, each person who reads the book will see that my ideas are most REALISTIC in the world. We are now facing a historic moment, when a process of introducing the greatest changes in the history of mankind is about to begin! To prove this fact I can reveal that this book shows the KEY to creating the New Order of the World! The New Order of the World is nothing less than TRUTH in a dose so large that mankind has never seen before! (It is not about the \u201cNew World Order\u201d but about a \u201cNew Order of the World\u201d! I wish the opponent of the \u201cNew World Order\u201d support a \u201cNew Order of the World\u201d).\n I would like to emphasize that the ideas I have come up with (both as regards wars and religion) are COMPLETELY NEW and have never been presented to the global society before. Our generation will be the first one to hear about brand new, unheard of solutions. (New ideas will also come as a surprise to the governing classes).\nMy ideas are not only ideas written down, but also ready materials, full of various written information, content, drawings, tables, graphs, symbols, guidelines etc., which will allow the global society to go straight to the execution of these projects in practice.\n I do realise it may seem strange that I have included 2 different topics in one book, but I would like to make it clear that there are 2 SEPARATE topics. (That\u2019s why in my book I have placed them as two SEPARATE sections).\nMy goal is to make the new, true religion followed by as many people as possible. Please note that with such great religious changes all around the world, many people (especially some elites) may replay some occurrences from the past (and even from the present), reaching for the tool known as war. E.g. a group of people may persuade others to frighten, hurt or kill the followers of the new (or another) religion. I cannot let this happen, which is why I do not only call for \u201cRELIGIOUS FREEDOM\u201d, but I have also created a \u201cRELIABLE SYSTEM\u201d, WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO guarantee STABLE PEACE all around the world. (Of course, I have many other reasons for which I have included \u201cwars\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d in my book).\nEverybody who manages to \u201cOpen their eyes\u201d to the surrounding reality, will see for himself that my projects are no UTOPIA, but REALITY! This is mainly why I have titled my book \u201cOpen your Eyes\u201d.\n The period of ten years (when I was writing this book) made me more and more convinced that I was completely right in everything I wrote and the time has come to start implementing the greatest changes in the history of mankind. The modern generation is now ready to see some new, important truths. I hope that each person who gets this book will \u201cOpen their eyes\u201d and realise that \u201cthe world is no longer what it used to be\u201d. (I also want to assure you that I am doing my best to make sure that the New Order of the World would be introduced in a PEACEFUL WAY). In order for you, not to be afraid of any threats that may arise in the process of creating the New Order of the World, I have decided to make it clear that in all my projects, I am ready to assume full responsibility for each single detail of my work. I am doing this because when writing this book, I was driven by such motivations as: truth, wisdom, goodness, justice and other precious values in human life. When creating my literary work, i did not have in mind my personal gain, but I did my best to do my job conscientiously, well, reliably, precisely and justly, considering the wellbeing of all the people in the world. There is no price in the world for which I would renounce the highest values. I personally advocate the protection of human rights and basic freedoms.\nWhen promoting the religion (which I have created), I personally encourage people to respect one another\u2019s decisions and to grant every man the right to religious freedom. [Religion is a private, personal matter and nobody has a right to force other people to change their views (be it religious, or atheistic, agnostic or other views)].\nSumming up: It is very likely that thanks to this book, we will witness the greatest changes in the history of mankind. However, nobody should be afraid of any possible threat that could arise from the execution of my projects. For this reason, I keep making it clear to all the global society that each person has a right to choose (and to change one\u2019s point of view with time). I want to guarantee COMPLETE FREEDOM to every person in the world! Each reader may \u201cbecome the follower of the New Religion\u201d, and at the same time, the same person may not accept the plan related to Wars as presented in my book, [or alternatively, they may not accept either of these ideas (or the other way round)]. Supporting my project means supporting the goal that is \u201cpublishing my book\u201d. However when the book has reached the audience, then everybody can decide for themselves as regards topics such as religion and world peace.\n I knew perfectly well that I was in for many negative comments. It is impossible to propose new things related to \u201cwar\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d without encountering comments and publications that are not only opposed to the idea, but downright negative, wrong and even hateful attitudes and views, both towards my statements and toward myself. (I would like to say I have known people who said and published far worse things about me. However, with time, many of them changed their attitude and now strongly support my noble goals \u2013 for which I remain truly grateful). (I would like to thank very, very much to all those people who officially support me). However, (at this early stage) generally people only support me anonymously (declared waiting for the further development of the project...). They claim they are afraid to support my project officially. They are afraid of criticism (insulting, threatening, mocking...) from various people and institutions. They fear they might lose some benefits to which they already got used etc. Nevertheless, with all my heart, I would like to thank people who support me anonymously and I hope there will come a beautiful day when they will not have to hide their support for my ideas.\nThe possibility to speak and express one\u2019s views is so important that even if it makes me sad to read insulting and hateful comments, at the same time I am glad to see the abovementioned value respected. The right to express one\u2019s views in public is one of the most valuable elements in the society!\n[(Get off the subject) I am extremely grateful to those who post comments on my websites, because thanks to this, more people can witness the discussion. It is very important that as many people as possible may follow the progress, if slight, even if they don\u2019t participate in the discussion itself].\nIn the topic addressed, apart from various people expressing their opinions, there is also something called the TRUTH. As there is only ONE TRUTH, there is a chance we will discover this one truth after some time, after a constructive discussion. We will then accept it and confirm the existence of the same truth. Then, it is enough if we all support this truth together.\n(Nobody will force you to pay money or read the book, or to offer a particular opinion. Everybody is free to decide for themselves. Everybody has a right to the freedom of thought and freedom of speech).\n You don\u2019t need to be afraid that I would bore the readers with my statements such as: \u201cBeing a religious person will allow us all to avoid wars\u201d, (etc.) \u2013 I want to mention that although the above remark is indeed wise, in my book I will show MANY OTHER, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IDEAS! My ideas will not only include proposed THEORETICAL solution, but most of all PRACTICAL ONES!\nI am absolutely convinced that the topics of religion and wars do not have to be boring, but can account for very interesting and wise literature, not seen so far by anyone in the world. These novelties will define new directions, which will probably attract a considerable part of the global society even at the moment. Literature has great impact on shaping human attitudes, that\u2019s why my assumption was that the book must be full of basic values indispensable in the life of every human being. A list of advantages of the book \u201cOpen your Eyes\u201d is extended to innumerable, noble borders, as this book to a great extent shows the key to creating the New Order of the World!\nMany issues discussed in my book are beautiful, amusing and very IMPORTANT projects for all the people on our planet, because they will allow us to \u201cfind another way to continue the process of nations getting closer together and creating important shared values in order to be of use and benefit to everyone\u201d.\nEach detail of my book has been meticulously adjusted to modern trends, which are of interest to people of various nationalities, ages, interests, views and backgrounds. In each second of writing my literary work, I also took care of the unique, precious values for individuals and societies, which make this book something that NEEDS to exist.\nDear All, I need your help! The world needs your help! Future generations need your help! We all need all the help we can get!\n I can assure you that everything I wrote is not just a colourful advertisement full of fantasy, but a proposal rooted in the real, objective world and for many years now I have been fully convinced of the seriousness of this proposal. I strongly believe in the meaning and success of my plans and this is the only reason why I have dedicated so many years of work to this end. Each of my proposals has been created exclusively on the foundations of TRUTH! It is the TRUTH that, in my opinion, is the most precious treasure in my book!\nIn my opinion, the book \u201cOpen your Eyes\u201d may be a great success in the whole world, because the world has always been in need of such solutions! It is only now, in the 21st century that a hope appears that this noble goal shall be achieved. My literary work seems to bring about positive results already when you look at its theoretical assumptions, and it gives us hope that it will quickly become one of the great bestsellers in the realm of world literature! In my literature, apart from \u201cgreat entertainment\u201d and \u201cvarious benefits\u201d, you will also find \u201cprecious human values\u201d. Once you make an in-depth analysis of my proposals, sooner or later will you conclude, that the world actually NEEDS THEM A LOT. \u2013 Does the humanity not need TRUTH as regards Religion? \u2013 Does the humanity not need PEACE in the whole world?\nMy intention is to CONVINCE THE SOCIETY OF THE WHOLE WORLD TO CREATE A NEW ORDER OF THE WORLD, WHERE EVERYBODY\u2019S LIFE WOULD BE BETTER.\nThe literary work I want to present to you, is not a normal, common book, but it is: my MESSAGE. This is a LETTER addressed to all people in the world. This is a Description of New Systems. In this book I have described a VISION of the future world. This book is a \u201cCALL to the mankind\u201d. This book is an encouragement to the Greatest (Peaceful) Fight in the History of Mankind! This book is full of various ideas, which will open new opportunities to mankind! The solutions described in this book are the greatest chance that humanity has ever faced!\n Dear all, you will surely have noticed that nobody knows the details of my book as yet, but still they present negative attitude. I encourage PEACE IN THE WORLD! I encourage the TRUTH as the basis for the genuine religion! Unfortunately, these words seem empty nowadays, because they need to be supported with details \u2013 which have been described in the book. Please have some patience and consider whether it would be worth reading this (as the author claims, \u201eexceptional\u201d) book.\nEven if the modern generation is not ready to create the New Order of the World, I hope that one day a generation will be born that will understand my words and introduce the New Order of the World following the guidelines presented in my book. Now I am heading for the great beginning, when I am still full of positive thoughts, faith, joy and hope.\nI think that every minute of waiting for a decision is unnecessary, because all nations are waiting for those who are ready to offer something beneficial to mankind. Each nation in the world has its own rich history of making life beautiful for all the people on earth. I can assure you that projects related to my literary work will expand the great success not only for nation chosen by you, but for all the other nations in the world.\nEverybody who becomes familiar with the total of the material included in my book will probably notice that the world is now facing serious challenges (in a very positive aspect of this phrase).\nRegardless of the mode in which my ideas are implemented, the process of global changes has already been set in motion, so nobody will be able to stop it now. For the past few years I have worked and elaborated on every single detail, so that our generation may be ready to start the New Era!\nI put my trust in you and I hope you will become interested in my book and soon it will be able to reach readers in the whole world. Your decision is extremely important, because it is not only about fulfilling my personal dreams, but most of all about using the chance that may bring benefits to the people in the whole world. (I am convinced you will all experience personal, individual success as well). If your decision concerning my proposal is positive, not only I myself, but also the society of the whole world will be able to rejoice and be grateful to you for your dedication. (Regardless of the final decision you make, you will soon understand that my words were not just an empty, pathetic advertisement of my own work).\nMy project needs a big support of society. However, at this initial stage, brave and clever people are needed to give a good example and encourage the others to continue this important way for achieving the noble goals. I cordially invite everyone to cooperate! I am immensely grateful to those who believe in and support this historic project! Dear All, be strong and don\u2019t give up! Do not fear! \n Thank you very much for your support and your help necessary to achieve the noble goals. \n I wish you further success and luck in making the decision on this important matter.\n Below I will present you with a couple of quotes from the introduction and conclusion to the book:\nIntroduction to the book: \u201cOpen your Eyes\u201d\nI used to have a great dream, but I knew dreams hardly ever come true. Years went by, until I finally said \u201cENOUGH\u201d! At this special moment I decided that my dreams will leave the sphere of fantasy and will be transferred to the REAL world.\n- What dream am I specifically writing about? (I must warn you that after the first sentence you may think I have lost my mind).\nMy dream was: \u201cI would like to change the world\u201d!\n- I would like to convince the society in the whole world to introduce the greatest changes in the history of mankind!\n- I would just like to change the world for the better!\n- I would like you and me, and all the people to have a better life on earth!\n- I would like us all together to create the New Order of the World!\nUnrealistic as it may sound, I would like my dream to remain real from now on. My dreams include all people. My desires are as follows:\n- To finally have a New, TRUE Religion in this world, which will be followed by a large part of people in the world (and with time, it is hoped that all the people on earth will become the followers of this religion).\n- For the peace to rule the world, so that we finally receive a real guarantee that it would be impossible to start World Wars (as well as other major armed conflicts).\n- Do you think I am joking? Or maybe you believe you are now holding a fantasy novel?\n- NO, NO!\n- I am one hundred per cent SERIOUS!\nMy dear, I have had enough of illusion and disappointment! I want visible changes, and I want them NOW! Thousands of years have passed by and what? AND NOTHING! \u201cVarious religions keep dividing people\u201d - none of them being true - and \u201cwars are being waged every so often\u201d!\nI don\u2019t want to wait one minute longer! I don\u2019t want to die leaving this world as it is now. I don\u2019t want anyone to have to wait and I don\u2019t want next generations to wait in the hope that someday something may change to the better. I refuse to live in silence and die satisfied that I have done whatever I could, without actually doing anything! Until this world gets rid of its greatest problems so far as well as the most serious falsehoods, I will keep blaming myself for this wrong status quo!\nI hope once you have finished reading this book, the World will no longer seem the same to you. I hope this book will strongly shake all the people and wake them up! I hope this book will shake all the world! I hope the society of the whole world will soon become united in certain topics and announce that: They support the Image of the New Order of the World (proposed in this book). I hope that some solutions and names, yet unknown (as well as many, names, symbols and ceremonies), will soon become a sort of special bond, not only personal, but also social. I hope that once you have read my literary work, you will personally contribute to creating the New Order of the World. I hope this world will soon change forever. I hope that each person who opens this book (and reads it to the end) will: \u201cOpen their Eyes\u201d and realise we are facing one of the greatest opportunities mankind has ever seen!\n(If you are afraid that this book may be too shocking for you, I can assure you that it would be far more shocking to realise that so far you did not know these important truths)!\nNobody knows the last century of mankind, but if human life were to end on this planet today after a few thousand years, I would have to admit with sadness and shame that as a whole global society, we have not only failed to address the greatest problems of mankind, but we have often disregarded something as precious as truth!\nMany truths that originated on earth found it hard to survive at the beginning and I am afraid that the truth contained in this book may be in for a similar fate (at least initially). This is usually the way with truth that before it becomes popular, there are not many honest, wise, responsible and brave people ready to support the truth.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. (this is continued in the book)\n I have decided to change a lot of what was considered PERFECT by a large part of the global community for thousands of years!\nI thought: - Why would I withdraw and be a coward, when all the world could benefit from it?!\nSince then, since I \u201cOpened my Eyes\u201d, the world has never been the same to me. Since then I have perceived the world with a great hope that one day humanity will take a similar step and follow the truth, just like I did.\n\u201cI opened my eyes\u201d and promised myself that: - I will never again close my eyes to certain significant truths.\nDear all, wishing well to all human beings, I only wanted each of us to Open our Eyes to the truth encountered in the world around us. That\u2019s why I titled this book \u201cOPEN YOUR EYES\u201d.\nEvery evening, before I go to sleep, I think: - What a pity. Another day has passed and nobody could become familiar with my book\u201d. Each morning, I wake up and think: - Will there be a breakthrough today? Will the book \u201eOpen Your Eyes\u201d soon be available to anyone who wants it?\nMy dears, DO NOT BE AFRAID OF TRUTH! Do not be afraid of what is good, because the good is needed both to our generation and any future generations!\n There are many scenarios for commencing the process of introducing the New Order of the World. Regardless of the manner of implementing my ideas, the process of global changes has already been INITIATED; that\u2019s why nobody will be able to stop it right now.\nToday, nobody will be able to imagine how much goodness will come from this great truth presented in this book, although at this point this truth may still be unaccepted and unwelcome by a large part of the society. One day the people will understand that this was inevitable. Putting it off for much longer wouldn\u2019t do us any good. In this scenario, we would actually exacerbate the situation in the world, because what needs to be changed in many areas of the world threatens the stability, safety and peace of all of us! Humanity still don\u2019t know certain IMPORTANT TRUTHS!\nDear all, I......... had to do it ........ If it were not me, someone else would have done it. Maybe it would have been you, maybe your grandchildren, maybe someone in a few thousand years, but the fact is that sooner or later somebody would do it anyway. Truth will be revealed sooner or later, even the truth I am going to describe, which was lost or hidden from people for thousands of years!\nWhat I want to tell to the whole world today will end the old, familiar Era in which humanity has lived for thousands of years. It will open a brand New Era in which future generations will want to live.\n Final speech\nDear all, nothing will be changed of its own accord. I cannot change the world without your help. I need your help! I need all of you! We all need the help of all the other people!\nThis book is only a seed of certain thoughts of mine, which I have planted in fertile soil. This seed will only grow when a large part of society takes good care of it. This seed will produce crops only when it is provided with proper conditions for living, and protected from those who want to pluck it out and destroy it. My dear friends, let us protect the planted seeds, and the sowers who sow them. Let us protect the people who support the sowers, and the earth that shields the seeds. But most significantly, we must \u2026\u2026.(this is continued in the book).\nI hope that once we begin the greatest fight in the history of mankind, we will manage to introduce the New Order of the World! In order to be able to enjoy the victory, I encourage all the people on this planet to become united as we have never been before! If we stay together in these hard moments of Global Changes, in order to achieve a common goal, then I believe we can change the history and accomplish something that no previous generation has achieved before! Let us support one another in the name of the highest values!\nThis greatest fight in the history of mankind will be the fight for TRUTH! This will be a fight for better future not only for the present generation, but also for all the future generations! This is the FIGHT FOR THE NEW ERA! No previous generation has even manager to win this Fight! Dear all, do you realise WHY nobody has yet won this fight in the history of mankind? The answer is easy: \u2013 Because nobody has even STARTED THIS FIGHT! This fight starts with the following words: \u201cOPEN YOUR EYES\u201d !\nPS. (I also want to assure you that I am doing my best to make sure that the New Order of the World would be introduced in a PEACEFUL WAY).\nThe End\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn case of a successful money collection, I see no obstacles to fulfil all of my promises. (Even in case of a failure to collect money, I have some plans to reward with time all those people who have supported my project in any manner).\n\n My wish is that the message I reveal on the 2,000 pages of the literary piece could reach the largest possible number of people. On that occasion, I request for supporting the project of publishing my book. \n [The record amount of money (\u00a31,000,000) I asked for is supposed to draw attention of the largest possible part of the society to the project and to help achieve the noble aim.\n$ 500,000 for Project Backers.\n$ 200,000 for \u201cOne More Chance\u201d Project (for Project Backers and Project Creators).\n$150,000 will be assigned to awards].\n I want to contribute my own money to pursue the noble goals for the benefit of the society, rather than make money on it. (For me there are more important values than financial ones). If I have more money in the future, I will happily (even more) support right causes with my funds. \n It\u2019s not of utmost importance \u201chow much money you will collect\u201d, but \u201ewhat you do with the money\u201d. (Besides, there is also another form of support, because money itself is not the most important).\n\n I request everybody who can afford it to pay at least $1 (\u00a31) for that noble project. Otherwise, please express your willingness to read the book on one of my Websites. I hope that in case I will not be able to obtain financial support there will still be some hope that one of the publishing houses will get interested in printing my book seeing the high interest among the potential readers.\n\n Just in case, I have prepared some other scenarios. One of the interesting solutions is the possibility of publishing my book in the Web in the form of an e-book \u2013 an electronic version of the book for everybody to download it for free. (I would like to translate the literary piece in many languages of the world). Therefore, I would like to ask all translators in the world to engage in the translation of at least some part of my book to another language. \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d has nearly 2000 pages, so please specify how much of the text you would be able to translate for free and in what language pair. (For example one person may agree to translate only one page of the book, but I will be requesting for reading many other pages of the selected text to understand the subject well). Additionally I would be grateful for stating your competencies when expressing your good will, as I care for the book to be translated at the highest possible level. (This means that not all translators will be able to translate the book and, of course, every translator will be free to resign from the assumed job at any time). The name of each translator will be provided under the translated text and as a reward, next to the name they will be able to print the address of their Website or other contact details (all in very small font for the book to keep its due high quality).\n [This idea may also prove useful in traditionally printed paper books, specifically because there are many people who refuse to read electronic books].\n\n\n Summing up, the support of the project does not have to be \u201cfinancial\u201d. It is enough when you pass the information about this important social project to other people or support it in another way. (However, the simplest and fastest way to arrive at printing a book is assigning of a certain amount of money for that purpose).\n As I mentioned earlier, among all my plans, there is also the possibility to upload my book on the Internet, so that everybody can download it for free. There are some obstacles, though, e.g. how do I encourage a few hundred translators to translate my book for free into various languages?! Where do I get the money to set up and maintain offices with teams of people to help me pursue noble goals in various parts of the world? Where do I get the money to help people in need?\n (If I am ever able to afford it, I will see to it that many people who don\u2019t have the money to purchase my book can receive it for free).\n\n \n I promise that as time passes, I will reveal more and more of the content included in my book. However, at the beginning, my main goal is to make people want to read my book \u2013 and of course, I keep working towards overcoming any difficulties and obstacles on my way to publishing my book.\n I gather that many of you would already like to know some bigger details of my\nbook. However, I would like to emphasise that in this special case it is not only the matter of publishing the book, but mainly about the introduction of the New Order of the World. I am deeply convinced that everyone who reads my book will readily understand that for the benefit and wellbeing of the people on earth, I cannot disclose the details of my book yet. (At the same time, I want to assure you that every person searching for truth will probably agree with the ideas included in the book).\n If I were to disclose the details of my 2,000-page book, you can probably imagine how many complex and broad issues I would need to present, so that people can understand the meaning of certain novelties, previously unheard of. If we were to add the fact that I am going to encourage people to introduce immense changes in the world, it will be easier for you to understand why I could not divulge the detailed description of the book at the moment. (I need to share much more information with people at a time, and this information has been included in my book). \n Let me add that many people working for the publishers told me that if I ever make a mistake and reveal more about my book, no publisher in the world will ever want to publish my book. (Let me remind you that one of my plans is to find a publisher to publish my book). \n I intend to publish the book \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d in many countries around the world. I would like my literary work to be translated into many different languages and printed in a great number of copies. As soon as the full amount is gathered, I will announce a sort of a tender, where the best companies and individuals will be selected to execute the described project in particular fields. The donors\u2019 money will mainly be spent to this end. I would also like to add that it is my wish for the large part of the money made on the sales of the book to be spent, in the years and centuries to come, on printing more copies. (I cannot rule out the possibility of electronic publications - e-books).\n I would like to remind you that it is not only about publishing the book itself \u2013 the main purpose is to introduce the New Order of the World. For this reason, I would also like to establish an office, where the employees will be ordering the subjects related to my plans and wishes for the global society; they will also be collecting and sharing the information with the whole world, etc.\n I want quick, effective and speedy changes to be introduced in the world! I don\u2019t want to limit myself to informing others of noble goals addressed only at a narrow social group. I want to address the society of the whole world! (But pursuing this goal involves higher costs). \n\n I will always remember everybody who supports my noble project without expecting any gains (in the form of a charity) and will try to reward their efforts also in a financial manner. (However, the best reward is the very awareness that so much good has been done to the society, including future generations). In case of your positive decision, not only me but also the world\u2019s society will be glad and will thank you for your efforts.\n\n I wish to clearly emphasise that describing this largest project in the history of mankind, my major objective is not my private advantage but the common good of the whole world\u2019s society!\n I want you to trust me that the book titled \u201cOpen Your Eyes\u201d is needed in the world. Believe me that the world could become a better place if the people reached for this book. Be patient and wait until the book is published and trust me that the book is worth reading by each inhabitant of the planet Earth.\n Dear All, we still have a chance to achieve historic success quite soon!\n I want to thank all those who don\u2019t lose hope! (I will never lose it).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Marek Magiera\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nMy name is Marek Magiera. I am 46 years old.

Opperman, Ashley Dioses, Frank Coffman, Pat Calhoun, Kenneth Bykerk, and Jason Hardy; Insightful essays by Nicole Emmelhainz, Karen Kohoutek, and Jeffrey Shanks; reviews by Charles Hoffman, Bobby Derie, Keith West, Todd Vick, Paul McNamee, Brian Murphy, Deuce Richardson, and Josh Adkins; and with illustrations by Mark Schultz, Tom\u00e1s Giorello, Samuel Dillon, and David Cullen.\nOur plan is to make Skelos the framework for a community of like minded fans, writers, artists, and scholars that love horror fantasy and weird fiction. This Kickstarter is only the beginning! \nShipping \nPlease view the table below for shipping charges. You can add the appropriate shipping cost to your pledge amount or you can wait and be billed for shipping when the issues are ready to mail. Thanks!\n   During the Kickstarter we will also make available for purchase as add-ons some of the original art from the first issue of the journal. Watch the updates for more details!\n  The base funding goal of $2000 covers the costs of issue one. This includes payment to the contributors, costs of editing and layout, and overhead expenses. We are already gearing up for our second issue which will be out later this fall. For future issues we want to add more artwork and improved content so there will be slight cost increases.

Because your body hears deep bass audio through vibrations, traditional headphones shortchange you at low frequencies.  Hearing is ultimately a physical sensation.  Out in the world you feel sound, especially at the low end. Sound waves don\u2019t just travel in air, they travel through whatever they encounter, including your body.  A bass drop on the dance floor.  The deep thump of a drum at a concert or symphony.  A heavy truck rumbling by.  When you hear those sounds you are also feeling the combination of the physical impact of the sounds waves and the way they resonate within your body. \nThe lowest frequencies \u2013 60Hz and below \u2013 are diminished and frequently missing entirely in conventional headphones.  Even with the best audio drivers that may reproduce sound down to 30 Hz, there still seems to be something missing.  Why?  Because your body \u201cfeels\u201d as much of the sound in that frequency range as it \u201chears\u201d it.  True realism comes from being able to feel low frequencies as well as hear them. \nPLAY\n\nFans of bass audio \u2013 Bassheads \u2013 have been on a long, intensive search for a headphone that can truly deliver a convincing bass experience. Now that long search is over. \n Taction Technology (TM)\nTaction Technology has designed the Kannon headphones with a unique haptic driver that accurately delivers low frequency audio through vibrations, so you hear the full range of audio, complete with deep, resonating bass that is missing in conventional headphones. Each earcup in the new Taction Kannon headset has both a traditional driver and a haptic driver. The traditional driver transfers higher-frequency audio \u2013 treble and mid-tones \u2013 as well as the high end of the low-frequency spectrum. The haptic driver delivers a clean strong bass sensation down to 15 Hz, well beyond the capabilities of a traditional driver. \nTaction Haptic Driver\n        \u201cThrough innovations in engineering and product design Taction was able to take a good concept that had yet to be effectively realized and launch what we believe will be a market-changing product in the Taction Kannon.\u201d \nThe few attempts to use haptic technology in the past have been fairly simplistic, similar to the rumble employed in game controllers. They also lacked the power and range to render lower-frequency audio, where vibrations can have such intense impact. Even worse, these attempts at haptic drivers actually degraded the overall quality of the audio by interfering with the sound coming from the traditional magnetic driver.\n      \u201cFor other brands, a haptic headphone in their lineup is little more than a marketing gimmick. At Taction, haptic is all we do, which is why the Kannon has the first haptic driver that actually improves rather than degrades audio quality in a headphone.\u201d \nTaction\u2019s haptic drivers have been re-thought from the ground up. \nUnlike prior market attempts at haptic audio technology, the Kannon drivers move parallel to the side of the head: the new design is planar, older designs axial. This innovation is critical because it leaves the volume of air in the ear cup unchanged, preserving the fidelity of the audio coming from the traditional driver. In addition, some nifty engineering advances allowed the team to generate 20 times more power than the few haptic drivers in the market can muster. \n Combined these two advances allow the Taction haptic driver to deliver lower bass and more accurate fidelity across all frequencies.  \n\"\u2026 a masterfully accurate vibration that mirrors what you would feel in the real world.\" \n-- Ryan Shwayder, Basshead Club \n\"...heightened degree of musical realism.\"...\"artfully combines a traditional dynamic driver with a well-crafted, proprietary Taction haptic driver.\"\n--Chris Martens, Hi-fi+\n The Advantages of the Taction Kannon\nThe Taction Kannon is designed for audio enthusiasts and headphone users who value high-quality, immersive audio when listening to music, playing video games, and watching movies. \nMusic Fans:   The home audio goal for most music fans is to try and recreate the live music experience as closely as they can. The Taction Kannon builds upon an audiophile quality headphone experience with the addition of unmatched bass audio delivered by finely tuned haptic drivers to provide a music experience that you can truly feel. \nCinephiles:  Now movie buffs can enjoy the immersive audio experience of a cineplex or home theater with a headset. The Taction Kannon lets movie watchers physically experience all the intense rumbles, bangs, growls and thunders that their favorite films have to offer. \nGamers:  The Taction Kannon provides gamers with a unparallelled immersive audio experience. It also provides a documented competitive advantage by decreasing response times and improving spatial accuracy. The vibrations from haptic drivers have improved the response time of individuals in lab studies by an average of 60 milliseconds, which represents between and 15 percent and 40 percent improvement depending upon the individual. In addition, the physical sensation enhances the ability to distinguish left from right, improving spatial accuracy. \nReaction Time for Audio Only vs. Haptic Feedback\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nVirtual Reality:  As VR transforms from a curiosity to a mainstream reality, the industry is focused on improving the experience by enhancing realism and immersion. Taction intensifies and clarifies spatial audio, providing orientation cues that can be the difference between simulation and the sense of \u201cbeing there.\u201d \n\"The Taction Kannon puts all of my basshead cans to shame \u2026 it takes the top seat on the list without contention.\" \n-- Ryan Shwayder, Basshead Club\nIntroducing the Taction Kannon\nThe Taction Kannon is a premium over-ear, closed-back headset with audiophile-quality sound and high-fidelity tactile reproduction. Low-frequency sounds that the body both feels and hears are rendered with unparalleled clarity. The experience is immersive, powerful and precise and unlike anything currently available on the market.  The anticipated retail price is $499 USD with a fourth-quarter 2016 launch date. \nThe Taction Kannon will be available for $389 through our Kickstarter campaign, a 25 percent discount and a savings of $110 off the anticipated retail price. \nTo try these headphones in person is to understand a new level of musical realism, immersion, and audio depth.  But not everyone can try them during the short span of a Kickstarter campaign.  Accordingly, we offer a 15-day unconditional money-back guarantee (buyer pays return shipping).  If you don't like them, send them back and we will refund your money, no questions asked.  \nFeatures \nRemovable, high-sensitivity boom microphone \nNoise-isolating, around-ear leather ear cushions \nPremium finishes and durable construction \nInline control of haptic intensity, on/off switch for haptic drivers, and mic mute \nPowered via Internal re-chargeable battery (8-hr capacity on a single charge) or through USB directly from an alternate source\nOptional latching hard case with precision-cut foam insert \nSpecifications\nStyle:                   Closed-Back Circumaural\nDriver:                 40 mm Neodymium Magnet\nTaction Driver:    Planar Nd magnet pairs, 0.8 N\nMax Power:         1.7 W\nImpedance:         38 Ohms\nFreq Response (Acoustic):  10-30,000 Hz\nFreq Response (Haptic):      15-200 Hz\nWeight:                11 oz (312 g)\nTypical acoustic data from a Kannon prototype\nTypical tactile data from Kannon prototype\n Taction may also provide a long-term hearing preservation benefit.  With Taction, listeners can get a natural and intense experience with lower acoustic volume. Lowering acoustic volume 4.4 dB corresponds to cutting sound power by more than half, consistent with long term hearing preservation. Below are some measurements collected by a friend of the project - Dr. Christopher Schwetizer, board certified audiologist, university professor, and committee member for ANSI standards on hearing aids.\nListeners choose lower acoustic volume when Taction is available.\nHow it Works\nUsing the Taction Kannon is straightforward.  No software installation is required.  The attached headphone cable ends in a standard 4-pole 3.5mm plug for audio.  \nInsert the 3.5mm audio plug into your audio source and enjoy. If you have both a stereo and microphone port on your device, simply use the included cable splitter.  \nThe inline controller has a mute button so you can easily turn your mic on and off.  The entire button lights up red to let you know that your mic is muted in case you forget mid-game.  The controller also has a button to turn the haptic driver on and off.  \nOnce you switch the haptic driver on you can adjust the Taction intensity using the knurled metal control knob to set a level anywhere from subtle to intense. \nPackage contents: \nTaction Kannon Headphone with inline controller \nRemovable microphone \nUSB wall plug with USB charging cord\n3.5mm stereo cable splitter \nProduct manual \nEarly Reviews\nFind the early reviews of the pre-production units at the following sites.\nhttp://www.hifiplus.com/articles/canjam-socal-2016-report-part-4/?page=3\nhttp://www.head-fi.org/t/791787/taction-technology-kannons\nhttp://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20160320/taction-technology-reveals-bassrich-haptic-headphone/\nhttp://www.computerpoweruser.com/article/20431/haptic-headphones-from-taction-use-vibrations-to-render-low-frequency-audio-03-18-16\nhttp://www.basshead.club/taction-kannon-prototype-review/\nhttp://www.head-fi.org/t/795171/taction-technology-kannon-headphone\nhttp://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-news-wire/PRNews_20160317NY50022/taction-technology-launches-bassrich-haptic-headphone.print.html \nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/taction-technology-launches-bass-rich-haptic-headphone-300237906.html\nhttps://www.vrfocus.com/2016/03/taction-technology-launches-haptic-headphone/ \nhttp://drhelium.website/watch/C4JVVrsbiGA/taction-kannon-headphones-full-review.html\nhttp://openworldpcgaming.com/2016/03/18/taction-technology-launches-haptic-headphones-vrfocus/ \nhttp://arkonetwork.com/biztrend/product-launch/taction-kannon-bass-rich-haptic-headphone/\nhttp://vrboard.io/taction-technology-launches-haptic-headphones.html\nhttp://www.superbestaudiofriends.org/index.php?threads/tactile-transducers-bass-shakers.944/ \nhttp://manypost.com/haptic-headphones-from-taction-use-vibrations-to-render-low-frequency-audio-031816/\nhttp://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Taction+Technology+Launches+Bass-Rich+Haptic+Headphone/11430157.html\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com/news/taction-technology-launches-bass-rich-191500144.html http://vidsok.net/watch?v=C4JVVrsbiGA\nhttp://www.cbs58.com/story/31497212/taction-technology-launches-bass-rich-haptic-headphone\nhttp://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/02/23/the-next-big-headphone-innovation-isnt-better-sound-its-built-in-rumble.aspx\nMeet the Taction Team\nTaction Technology is a dynamic and fast-moving start-up focused on bringing transformative technology to market.

And this project, Chronicles of The Grim Reaper, is one I've wanted to tackle since about 2001.\nAs most collectors know (those familiar with RRParks CARDS) horror and humor are my favorite subjects ... I even turned Chronicles of The Three Stooges Series Four into a Stooges and Halloween extravaganza with LOADS of Stooge monster and horror subsets, foils, retros and glow in the dark spooky goodness. And among the horror genre, the Grim Reaper is the most fascinating. In the early 2000s I took on the project of Hans Holbein's Dance of Death (the classic appearance of the Grim\nReaper) -- collecting the wood engravings of the 1530s and remastering genuine intaglio etching plates of the standard classic series of 36 different images and producing the first etched series of Holbein's classic in over 200 years. The series -- sized about the dimensions of a classic tobacco card -- was limited to only 60 sets, which came in a small folio\nand insert checklist. The complete edition of 60 was a quick sell out and finding a set anywhere is  essentially impossible. In the early 2010s, right before I launched RRParks CARDS, I remastered  larger version set -- standard trading card size of 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 -- which included the full 49 suite of Holbein's chronicles of the Grim Reaper. This set was limited to only 100 complete sets and each and every card of the series is a hand crafted miniature etching.\nAfter years of searching, in 2015 I finally acquired the complete 1815 original hand painted etching set of the Tom Rowlandson classic The English Dance of Death. This series of fine art etchings is delightfully wicked. Each of the 74 artworks was etched and produced and hand painted in 1815 ... and so the issuance of this trading card series will mark the 200th anniversary of the classic of the macabre.\nTHE CHRONICLES OF THE GRIM REAPER TRADING CARD PROJECT\nThis planned trading card series, The Chronicles of The Grim Reaper, will showcase the ENTIRE Tom Rowlandson series in full color and produced in 'widevision' -- just the way it was issued 200 years ago. Card fronts will feature a retro style full color reproduction of the suite in it's entirety\nand the backs will feature other artists' depictions of everyone's favorite bone head throughout history. In addition to the card series being especially art heavy it will also feature a fun overview chronicling\nthe history of The Grim Reaper. A gothic horror series designed by a horror card fan for horror card fans. The card series is planned as a trading card set of 74 cards, produced in 'retro stalgic' style and in widevision (Rowlandson did his etchings in an extra wide style and I don't want to 'pan and scan' the artwork... so will be done in Rowlandson wide-vision style. This means you'll need some 6-pocket pages for your trading card collection binder). The master set will also include 4 different limited edition metal cards (which I'll have produced through Faerie Metal -- they do amazing work!). One promo card is currently planned -- if others are published then ALL promo cards associated with this set will be included with the master set. Please browse through the pledge levels... I think I've got awards that can be accomodated by all types of budgets. Also, even if you're just seeking some stuff to flip on ebay and want numerous limited edition metal cards you can certainly 'send your friends in' to pledge.\n\nTo help raise funds for this project I'm creating this Kickstarter campaign so fans of monster and horror trading cards can contribute and be part of the project and add some ghoulish swag to their collection. This campaign features pledge awards at all conceivable levels ... backer awards for those with modest budgets include promo cards, exclusive metal cards (produced by those great folks at Faerie Metal) and sketch cards on up through complete sets to 'patron of the arts' levels which feature not just a complete set of Chronicles of The Grim Reaper but ALSO the actual, original 200-year old production art etchings (to put that in perspective, the artist was alive before the Grim Reaper came for George Washington). Am also including a couple 'horror holidays' levels which include ALL the horror card series published by RRParks CARDS. Note, this kickstarter is being run to help raise completion funds ... I have most of the money needed already but this campaign will hopefully raise the balance needed so I don't have to rely to heavily on my credit cards.\nADD ONS\nOnce in awhile when I've run a Kickstarter campaign I've had some backers want more than one pledge level. Well NO PROBLEM! All I ask is that you message me what you have in mind PRIOR to pledging... just\nso I can make sure what you want to do is possible. I'm easy... I'll work with you... the goals here are for me to raise money to produce this card series AND to make sure you have some really fun stuff for your\ncollection. So it is to BOTH our advantages for me to work with you on whatever you want to pledge on.\nRELEASE DATE\nIf all goes well this card series will be produced in April. It's planned in conjunction with the production of Chronicles of The Three Stooges Series Five and some aspects (such as the packaging) will be done at the\nsame time as Stooges. So am figuring April but am stating 'May' in this Kickstarter just in case there are production delays. In other words... plan on receiving your 'swag' in May or earlier (ALL my previous card releases through Kickstarter have ALL issued earlier than stated).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChronicles of The Grim Reaper marks RRParks CARDS' SIXTH Kickstarter project.

But those who have pledged on my campaigns before have come to find out that when I take on a project I see it through and make sure all backers are well rewarded for their help in getting these projects into the realm of 'existence'. \nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign I will post regular updates to this site to keep backers and fans informed as the project progresses.

Simply: In 'ancient times' a knights\nshield would often be 'etched'. This involved taking the shield, made\nfrom a metal that could be corroded quickly with acid. The shield\nwould be covered in a thin layer of wax and an artist, using a needle,\nwould draw through the wax whatever design was desired and then\nthe shield treated with a highly corrosive acid. The acid, when touching\nthe metal, would corrode that lines exposed through the wax. Once\nthe etching process was done the wax would be removed and the\netched design would be visible. In the 1500s Rembrandt (or rather\nmost notably Rembrandt) revived this lost art form but instead of\netching a shield he etched a sheet of copper utilizing a similar etching\napproach. The resultant etched copper was called an 'etched plate'.\nThe etched plate was heated and an oily ink was applied and\nsqueegeed into the 'intaglio' plate. He would them thoroughly wipe\nthe plate with cheesecloth-like material so that the ONLY ink\nremaining on the plate was in the etched lines. This plate was\nplaced face-up on an 'o' roller intaglio press and a damp sheet of\ncotton paper was placed on top. Three different thickness felts\nwere placed on top of this and then run through the press. The damp\nsheet, subjected to the high pressure of the 'o' roller of the press\nwould 'suck' the ink out of the etched linework and the result was\na thick sheet of paper with the artwork beautifully transferred from\nthe plate to the sheet. And this print is called an etching."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Update April 23rd", "update_content": "Another quickie update (both Grim Reaper and Three Stooges Kickstarter sets):  \n1.

What's actually involved that 60 straight hours of work can't get it all done? Series Five ended up having more cards than originally figured. And while I bought a special 'chopper' that does an amazing job, I actually have to cut EACH card for the series. I'm not Topps with inhouse printing and production and bulk slicing machines, blah blah blah. To create the initial 100 boxes needed for Kickstarter backers and individual pre-orders it involves roughly 15,000 individual, precision cuts. Much of Series Four was like that as well -- ALL the 9 card subsets were cut by hand by me and it just takes 'ages'. Series Five is taking ages but I want it to be the best series I can produce and so am not rushing through anything.

Every Topps card set involves many moving parts: from production and design, to business and marketing. For Mars Attacks we have the added necessity of working with more than a hundred freelance artists.\n\nHowever, as a company with more than 75 years of experience delivering high quality collectibles, as well as a pool of well-respected, veteran artists at our disposal, we have added resources that most Kickstarters don't. We will be doing everything we can to both keep this project on-schedule, as well as deliver the best, highest quality product possible. \n\nOur superstar illustrators are already working on new base card art, while our sketch artists are well underway drawing their allotment of cards. One of the many advantages of Kickstarter is that with a more flexible production we can give our artists even more time to produce their very best work-- for YOU!\n\nMeanwhile our production partner (Sidekick Lab in Vermont) has already begun test printing the various card types, and has mapped out the printing and packing of the entire series to ensure we are ready to go as soon as the campaign concludes. Along with Sidekick, we have spent many months preparing for this campaign, costing out the printing, production, packing, shipping and creation of everything involved. \n\nBut whether issues arise or not, we plan to communicate to our backers throughout the entire process and update the status of our project in real time. We hope that in addition to reassuring you of our commitment to creating the best set possible, it will give you a unique insight into the behind-the-scenes making of a Topps card series!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #145", "update_userinfo": "FINAL WEEK to Pledge to Mars Attacks: Uprising!", "update_content": "Only 8 more days to pledge to the sequel to Occupation!
