(Ray and I later worked together at BBN.  Ray died just a few days ago, way too young).  He was one of the greats and an all round good guy.  We miss you, Ray.)  During my four years at school, the ARPANET started to become a primary vehicle for academic communication and collaboration.  I had a front row seat to the first email, electronic publishing, virtual teams & communities, electronic commerce (RFPs and Proposals exchanged via email), and early Internet governance.  I caught the bug that\u2019s driven my life.Ever since, I\u2019ve been an observer of the Internet\u2019s growth, evolution, and adoption - with a particular interest in how the Internet changes the capacity and behavior of organizations and communities (physical, professional, and otherwise).  I've been fortunate to both observe and contribute to Internet adoption in a broad range of settings, including academia, small and large corporations, government (at all levels), communities, non-profits, and households.Over the course of my career, I've alternated between the entrepreneurial world, government systems contractors, and the non-profit arena.  During & after school, I spent a few years working as an engineering consultant - including a short period working for Ray Kurzweil on the speech synthesizer for his reading machine - talk about fortunate timing).  During those days, I also  a small company that sold email services to small businesses.  (in later years, that business evolved into a web design and hosting business.  These days, those computers keep humming away, providing pro-bono list and web hosting to a gaggle of local community groups.)I then joined Sanders associates, where I designed command & control systems, intelligence systems, and large training systems.  And from there, I went on to spen seven years at  Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) \u2013 the company that built the ARPANET -  helping to build pieces of what became the Internet.  Since then, I\u2019ve worked on military command & control networks, training systems \u2013 massively multiplayer roleplaying games for folks who come under real fire, networked mapping systems, and most recently \u201cintelligent transportation systems\u201d (air traffic control for busses and trains).As the Internet grew, people started talking about \u201celectronic democracy\u201d and \u201celectronic town meetings.\u201d  At BBN, I watched the evolution of Internet governance \u2013 the loose, global, collaboration that built and manages what has become our society\u2019s nervous system.  I became convinced that Internet governance looks a lot like a 24 by 7 global town meeting \u2013 a model for broader electronic democracy.In 1992, I left BBN to start a non-profit, the Center for Civic Networking \u2013 to put this idea to the test \u2013 by performing early demonstration projects in \u201cInternet town meetings.\u201d  (I sometimes describe my life\u2019s ambition as being the systems engineer and stage manager for a global town meeting.)  Over 12 years, we focused on pilot projects that pushed the Internet into new areas, serving the public.  We led public engagement projects in community planning, and broadening participation in federal rulemakings.  We deployed Internet workstations into the Cambridge Public Library - the first deployment of high-speed Internet connectivity in a library setting, and an alpha site for early cable modem service.  We worked with economic development agencies to market rural microenterprises over the net (our \"Public Webmarket\" project, funded by the USDA, was one of the very first web-based marketplaces).  We worked with municipalities in the days leading up to and following passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 - as they wrestled with major changes in cable franchising and right-of-may management.  We helped plan municipal broadband projects.  In the process, I got to write two books \u2013 one on planning Library Internet Services (published by the American Library Association), the other a handbook on telecommunications planning for local governments.PoliticalRevolution.net is my latest project.Beyond the workplace, I live in Newton MA with my wife, 2 step-sons (another son and daughter are out in the world, along with an ex-stepdaughter), and 2 cats.  I've served on various local government committees and on the board of my church (UU Church of Medford, MA).  Along the way, I helped start the MIT Enterprise Forum.  Occasionally, I manage to do something other than work (right now - volunteering for the Sanders campaign).", "websites": ["linkedin.com", "web.archive.org", "web.archive.org", "facebook.com", "twitter.com", "plus.google.com"], "url_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1947703258", "name": "Miles Fidelman", "no_of_backed_proj": "Backed 18 projects", "location": "Acton, MA", "joined_date": "Joined Apr 2012"}, [{"title": "The Book", "content": "The Ultimate Guide To Rebuilding A Civilization.

The store was a a local success until they decided to sell it in 2007. During this time they also ran a yearly game convention called GrailQuest from 1999 to 2006. Many fans still long for its return.Emi and John moved on to \"real life stuff\" as wives and children came into the picture but made sure to keep gaming on a regular basis. Fast forward to November 2011, we began talks on a game concept we came up with in 1998. After some refining and play testing When Zombies Attack! was born. In January 2012 ATTACK DICE LLC was founded and on June 1, 2012 When Zombies Attack! was released, the first of three games using the TrioDice Game System.

Growing up he was able to foster this need alongside with his cousin, who was another strong creative influence in his life.
