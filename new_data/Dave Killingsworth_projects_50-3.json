During that time, we have worked with multiple factories and international freight companies to ensure our high-quality games are delivered on-time and in excellent condition. For this Kickstarter, we are working with experienced partners like Quartermaster Logistics to continue that pattern of quality.\n\nWe are estimating a May 2022 delivery date for this game, but please keep in mind this is only an estimate. There are always elements beyond our control when working with manufacturers, such as virus outbreaks, production delays, shipping delays, and delays with customs. Should these occur, we will make sure that we quickly communicate any delay or challenge and keep our backers updated.\n\nIn addition, the game has already gone through substantial production, which further limits the chances for delays. The artwork is mostly complete, the plastics have been sculpted, and many components are at or near a print-ready state.

If this is your first Meeple Source Kickstarter project, welcome! And if it isn't, welcome back!\nThis is our 15th Kickstarter project, so it really means something when we say that this project includes the most exciting variety of game upgrades to date. We hope that you will pull up a chair, stay a while, and take this journey with us.\nThis is expected to be our only Kickstarter project in 2021, so we are giving you everything we've got! We have new upgrades for popular series like Scythe, Wingspan, and The West Kingdom Trilogy. We're adding beautiful pieces to our line of upgrades for Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Concordia, Caverna, Agricola, and Grand Austria Hotel. Hot new games are definitely represented here as well, with sets designed especially for Lost Ruins of Arnak, Obsession, Darwin's Journey, Creature Comforts, Hallertau, Bonfire, New York Zoo, Dominant Species: Marine, Tekhenu, and Tawantinsuyu. And that's not all! Isle of Cats, Taverns of Tiefenthal, Fields of Arle, Carpe Diem, Keyper, Keyflower: The Farmers, and Key Market, Dice Settlers, A Feast for Odin, Cat Lady, Clans of Caledonia, Wendake, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, Reykholt, and Underwater Cities are all shown some massive love in this project!\nWith so many game upgrades offered in this project (and likely a few more to come along the way), we are offering some of our pledge levels in a different way than we have in the past. We are calling these first few upgrades \"Featured Pledge Levels\", and you can pledge for them by simply browsing the list of Kickstarter pledge levels and selecting it, just as you normally would with any Kickstarter project. If you scroll down further, you will get to the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which will be used for all of the other upgrades.\nAll of the other game upgrades, including partial sets (when shown as a project option), are being combined in the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which shows a cost of $1. You can/should still pledge for the combined amount for your desired game upgrades. Although different from the way we have done this in the past, we are hoping that a simplified format will make a project with as many options as this easier to navigate.\nIn Kickstarter, you will only choose one pledge level as your primary pledge, but it is certainly possible to pledge for multiple things here.  To do so, simply select one of the upgrades as your \"main pledge level\", then select \"add-ons\" for your other upgrade(s) you want as well. Additionally, there will be an intuitive process in BackerKit (the post-project order management and survey software we use) to handle the multiple upgrades and choices. You can take advantage of our flat-rate shipping offer by bundling an unlimited number of upgrades from this project with no additional shipping cost.\nThe popularity of flat-rate shipping cannot be understated, so that's what we're doing. The amount varies by country, but the shipping amount is fixed, no matter how many upgrades and add-ons you pledge for. The flat shipping rate within the United States is $7, and other countries have a flat rate of $9-$15.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties and/or fees owed at delivery, these are still your responsibility. This used to only rarely happen though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind. BUT, things are changing, at least in some countries. Read on...\nIf we are required to collect VAT for your order before the project ships, that cost will be collected in BackerKit (our chosen post-project management/fulfillment tool). This will almost certainly be necessary for UK backers (see more below), and likely EU backers as well. If at the point we need to collect the VAT for your shipment, you are unhappy with the amount or process, you will have the opportunity to cancel some or all of your pledge, but we will have to reduce the refund at that time by the amount of the non-refundable Kickstarter fees for your transaction. \n2021 has already seen huge changes in transit, tariffs, and international business. We are running this project in good faith, and will be transparent with what needs to happen to get you the fancy upgrades that you desire! :-) \nThere are also a number of countries that we are not able to ship to, due to known limitations and/or difficulty delivering successfully in the past. The list of countries that we CAN ship to are: United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. Other than the UK (see special circumstances below), if you don't live in one of these countries, pledging for this project will be difficult. Options that you may have are to combine your order with a friend who lives in a serviced country, or to use a US-based mail/package forwarding service. There are many out there, and some of our customers from around the world use them regularly. \nYou might be aware that we are not currently shipping to the UK on our website. We hope to change this soon, but Brexit-related changes to importing/exporting (at least for small companies such as ourselves) have proven maddening. Our distinct expectation is that it will be a thing of the past by the time we are fulfilling this project. Assuming so, we will have to collect the VAT for your pledge, and will file that on your behalf at that time (resulting in a seamless and fee-free delivery). But, if we are unable to accomplish this, we will refund 100% of your pledge (we will absorb the Kickstarter fees mentioned above, in this case). For a variety of reasons though, we would like you to make your pledge (no matter what it's for) as a $1 (+shipping) pledge in the \"UK Backers Only\" pledge level. We can sort everything else out with you individually in BackerKit afterward. We apologize for this admittedly wonky process, but our alternative was to exclude UK backers from the project, which we really didn't want to do.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Siblings Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions (in a non-COVID year!), you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for most of these upgrades is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our Wingspan birds, Raiders of the North Sea upgrades, Architects of the West Kingdom meeples, as well as a number of our other more recent upgrades! \nWe are also excited to offer a set of meeples by a guest artist for Darwin's Journey, Paolo Voto, who is the artist for the game itself!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with our a few of our most recent upgrades...\nWingspan: Oceania Bird Meeples\nNectar Tokens for Wingspan: Oceania\nPaladins of the West Kingdom Meeples\nRaiders of the North Sea Meeples\nResources for Raiders of the North Sea\nTomesaga/Overlord Meeples for Viscounts of the West Kingdom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for over nine years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 14 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. We quality-control every meeple individually by hand and ship all orders in-house, and we also use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you probably know that we are very straight-forward with regard to the progress of our projects, and will let you know if we encounter any delays. We did have an unfortunate technological hiccup with regard to Kickstarter emails/messages during the final phase of fulfillment of our last project, and can assure you that we will pay closer attention than ever, and won't have a lapse in response like we did at that time. \n\nWe believe that we have allotted enough time in the production and delivery schedule to account for the types of situations that could arise, but unexpected delays are still always possible. Our last few Kickstarter projects delivered early, and although this could occur again, we obviously can't promise that.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges. So don't worry, we've got this!\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Meeple Source reserves the right to cancel any pledge, although we have never had to exercise this right in the past.\n\nAny VAT that Meeple Source is required to collect and remit on your behalf will be collected in BackerKit (the 3rd party pledge manager that we use) - it is not already built-in to the listed prices on Kickstarter that are applicable to all backers.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in BackerKit and the package is returned to us as undeliverable, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any selected add-ons.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason, Meeple Source will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nIf you do not log in to BackerKit and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. If you need more time to complete your BackerKit survey, you must contact us. Meeple Source reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into the BackerKit system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge for this project.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email meeplesource@gmail.com for further information.

It seems that Kickstarter was actively changing the way that looked to backers even throughout the day of our last update. In the morning, the app showed add-on money as \"bonus\" money and described it in a way that made it sound like it was a donation, not support in exchange for rewards. The website still worked the \"old way\" where you could simply change your pledge dollar amount. But by the end of that day, both the website and app were both showing \"bonus money\" as the only way to add funds to your pledge. We don't expect any donations, don't worry!

Taking inspiration from countless hours of Anime, LokDown will allow players to enjoy the bombastic conflicts, colorful atmosphere, magical heroes, and amazing worlds found in the best Anime, while also crafting your own deep and well-versed characters (or just go with a tormented edge lord or a nerdy/shy-yet-still-charming high schooler with a destiny) to inhabit them.\nCheck it out Now!\nBut please, you do not have to take our word for it. We have an early version we are releasing, for free, so people can see what the game is about. There are over 170 pages of content showing you what LokDown will be. It has everything you need to begin exploring the LokDown world!\n  LokDown Early Edition Free Download! 180 pages of Anime TTRPG Awesomeness \nThe Luminous Dawn\nWhen the Calamity struck, the Luminous Dawn Settlement Fleet was mid-transit to an uninhabited world, well past the edges of Neo-Spine Space. Controls failed; life support systems faltered. In short, the 100,000 inhabitants of the escaping fleet were destined to die.\nThrough frantic effort, onboard engineers managed to repair basic life support systems, allowing the fleeing fleet's crews and their families to enter into stasis chambers, hoping to sleep out the danger until a rescue could be found. All four ships were linked to the controls of Admiral Keanu Lok, commander of the Luminous Dawn. He alone would stay awake, and he alone would determine all of their fates.\nBut what quickly became clear to Admiral Lok was there would be no rescue. After the Calamity, there was not a ship in the empire or perhaps even the entire galaxy that could find them. So, while they slept without dreams, Keanu Lok guided the fleet through the void of space on only the most basic of gravitational controls, completely alone, and without hope.\nPlanet LokDown\nWhen the alarms blared, announcing the end of stasis, the crews and their families slowly awoke to find their vessels had all crashed on a strange alien world. The only message from Admiral Lok: A call for hope, a plea for determination, and an inspiring farewell. He placed their ship on the best course he could towards an inhabitable world they would not reach for over 2,000 years. They found Admiral Lok\u2019s ancient mummified corpse still at the controls and gave him a burial in the planet he had died getting them to.\nThe world Admiral Lok found was tidally locked in orbit around its star. One sweltering side perpetually faced the sun, and the other in permanent frozen darkness. Only a narrow ring circling the planet from pole to pole, in perpetual twilight was inhabitable: The Eventide Steppes. Millennia ago, Admiral Lok had managed to somehow place the Luminous Dawn Settlement Fleet inside this narrow habitable zone on the northern hemisphere.\nDubbing the world LokDown, the peoples of the Luminous Dawn Fleet set about finding a means of surviving their new, brutal home. The ships that had ferried them for millennia were damaged beyond repair, and the precious fuel sources needed to propel them, completely spent. While able to support life in several forms, LokDown proved to be as hostile a life-sustaining world as any on record. The atmosphere was breathable, if barely. The wildlife was savage, and on par with the bio-engineered attack creatures bred for war in the Old Empire. The native peoples found on LokDown, while not necessarily hostile, were of little assistance, nearly impossible to track, and the closest translation they could work out of their name was Daemon.\nWorst of all, a thronging creature, later named murk swarms, moved in great grey masses across the Eventide Vale devouring everything, even the hulls of their colony ships. Without a means of adapting, the survivors of the crash would soon be left perpetually exposed to the harsh environment until they were devoured, one way or another.\n\nThe Adaptions\nEach ship had different specialties, and among the migrants were some of the greatest adaptive scientists in existence. In a desperate attempt to survive LokDown, the research teams set about devising means to adapt their peoples' bodies into something more viable with their new home. While most attempts failed, some with brutal outcomes, four methods of survival were invented, allowing the peoples of Luminous Dawn to live, if not unchanged.\n\nThe Quantum Geologists of the fleet discovered means of strengthening their own bodies with the native elements of LokDown creating the Godai. The biogeneticists used DNA samples from the hearty creatures native to LokDown to create the Shastra, near perfect hybrids of sapient and beast. Several of the engineers managed to adapt technology traded from the Daemons to create the Xenotons, a bionic people of metal merged with flesh. The last team used tissue samples from the Daemons themselves to create genetic hybrids, known as the Bloodbourne; fiendish looking people in appearance but not of heart.\nWhere We Stand Now\nAble to survive LokDown, but unable to leave, the four peoples of LokDown set about the most arduous part of their task: Making this new world into a home. Generations passed which had never seen a star, but the stories of the endless voids, filled with long lost peoples, never faded from the hearts and dreams of their souls. \n\n\nThe Setting\nLokDown takes place in the Reknown-Galaxy, and is part of the Carbyne Jungle universe. Unlike most expansions however, LokDown is designed to also work as a Stand-Alone game. So if you are a fan of Carbyne Jungle, you can use all of these options with your current campaigns. If Carbyne Jungle is new to you, no worries. You can enjoy all of LokDown without needing any other book or materials.\nLokDown is built on the Tri-Forge Engine, the same game system as Carbyne Jungle, an exciting action filled experience with customizable rulesets, and incredibly flexible advancement. With the Tri-Forge Engine, you can customize the rules to fit your table and use the simplified ruleset of Flip&Fight to introduce new players, all without slowing down your game. \nLokdown is designed to be a stand-alone game, but it can also work with Carbyne Jungle. So, you can use your LokDown characters in your Carbyne Jungle campaigns or Vice Versa.\nAnd if you have never tried Carbyne Jungle (or our Carbyne Jungle Mission Decks which are just absolutely amazing), we have good news! You can add those onto any Kickstarter order!\nWhat kind of setting is LokDown?\nLokDown is an Anime-Inspired Sci-Fantasy setting, meaning it has elements of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and a whole lot of goodies drawn straight from some of your favorite Anime/Manga series. We choose Sci-Fantasy because it has the most options. With a Sci-Fantasy setting, there is no limit on what you can create or who you can be.\nAt the same time, we know many players prefer a specific era or tech level to their games, so LokDown will also come with tools for running games in Classic Fantasy, Modern, or Straight Sci-Fi (no magic) settings. On top of that, we have optional rulesets for tables that want to emphasize a Shonen, Mecha, Cyberpunk Noir, or Cosmic Horror feel to their game. \nShort Version: You can run whatever you want, and we will give you the tools to make it fun.\n We Have Funded!!!\nWe've hit our goal, but we are not done! We still are reaching towards our stretch goals! In them, we will expand the premade campaign with the game and add in some special goodies: Our first is the Kaiju Invasion! With this comes a Mission Deck where parties will use special gear and tactics to try to stop the Kaiju attacking the Eventide Steppes. With the Mission Deck, every Kaiju will be a different random monster that provides a new challenge every time!\n\nWhat Will Be Added to the Early Edition?\nPlenty! While the Free Early Edition you can download above has some amazing stuff, the final release will have a ton more content. For starters, there will be 2 full books: A Player's Guide and a GM's Guide. There will be more lore, character options, monsters, setting details, and a full campaign. The final version will also have the Flip&Fight ruleset: a streamlined system designed for new players with simplified rules. Flip&Fight is designed to be played alongside the standard rulesets so new players can jump into a game with experienced players, enjoy the fun, and not feel overwhelmed.\nThat's right! You can get your favorite character into the LokDown Core Rulebooks! Choose the Shapeshifter package and on top of getting digital copies of all the stuff, you also get to create an NPC for the game! Take your favorite PC (or just a character idea that you like), and we will work with you on adding it to LokDown. Not only that, but that NPC will play a part in the campaign built for the LokDown GM's Guide. \nThe standard Shapeshifter package comes with digital copies of all books, but with Kickstarter's new Add-On feature, you can add physical copies of whatever books you want to go with it!\nNow, you can customize every Backer Package with Add-Ons! Once you click on the reward you want, you can customizing it by adding more copies of books or other related products such as the Carbyne Jungle Core Rulebook or the Haedus 8B Mission Decks which all work with LokDown!\n Shipping to unlisted countries\nWe will ship to any country in the world. To avoid over charging for shipping (and listing 110 nations on each option), we listed the most common countries we have received orders from previously. If you're country is not listed, shoot us a message and which packages you are thinking about, and we will setup the shipping prices for you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 3rd Kickstarter now, and we have delivered both previous projects on time despite one taking place in 2020 (gestures at everything).

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world.

This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address.

It's still the same great mechanics you've loved for over 10 years, now in a special, limited edition that includes all new art, plastic Walls and Towers for the Castle, plastic Monster minis that feature a unique spinning base to track damage, wooden Monster tokens, and more!\nCastle Panic is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players where everyone is working together to defend the castle from monsters coming in from the forest. The players must make it through all 49 Monster tokens and have at least 1 tower still standing in order to win the game. If the monsters destroy all 6 towers, the game ends and the monsters win.\n Castle Panic Deluxe takes everything you love about the standard version of Castle Panic and makes it, well, deluxe! \nAll minis figures come assembled but will need their damage bases attached. Don't worry, this is a snap! All plastics will come unpainted, ready for your painterly goodness! \n*Note: All images not final and not to scale. All components and upgrades subject to change.\nThis pledge level is only available to verified game stores. Verification will require detailed store information including EIN number. The verification process will be at the discretion of Fireside Games and the results will be final. When the campaign ends, you will have access to our pledge manager, where your pledge will be applied as a credit towards your order. Orders will be at a 50% discount and must be in case quantities (3 games per case). Your final order and payment will be determined when the game is ready to ship. Retail orders will be shipped at the same time as all other Kickstarter orders.\nShipping to be charged after the end of the campaign.\nPlease contact sales@firesidegames.com for more information. \nNOTE: The standard versions of the expansions will also be available as add-ons.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will be using BackerKit as our pledge manager which works like an online store where the amount you pledged is available as credit for you to spend as you wish. This is where you will provide your shipping information and can choose to add any additional products to your pledge.\nThere are 2 ways to pay for additional items. You can add products in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended and pay for the difference at that time, or you can pledge more during the campaign and spend that however you want in the pledge manager. Keep in mind, when you pledge more during the campaign, it helps unlock stretch goals!\n This game will be printed in enough volume to fulfill the Kickstarter plus a small amount to cover damages and other issues. We reserve the right to sell any remaining inventory on our website, at conventions, and 3rd party sites if necessary.\n In 2009, we launched our first game Castle Panic, a cooperative, tower defense board game. Over 10 years and hundreds of thousands of copies later, we're thrilled to bring you the ultimate edition of this evergreen family game.\nThe costs listed above are estimates only but are based on current pricing from our fulfillment partners using an estimated weight.  Actual shipping costs will be charged via our pledge manager.\nDue to complications with customs and regulations, we will not be shipping to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nFireside Games was started in 2007 by Justin and Anne-Marie De Witt. We decided to take our hobby of creating board games to play with our friends and turn it into a business. In 2009, Castle Panic became the first game we published and since then we've grown our catalog and published 18 other games. We founded Fireside Games with the core goal of creating fun, innovative, accessible board games that everyone can enjoy, and based on our growing fanbase, we're proud to say it's working.\nWe are committed to bringing joy and shared experiences to life through board games. We love hearing from people all over the world about how our games help them reconnect with friends and family, even in this hectic world. We\u2019re proud of the experiences we create, and we are thrilled when we can help you to bring fun home!\nCaste Panic Deluxe is a big project and a complex, expensive game. We've been selling games to Friendly Local Game Stores for over a decade, and we've seen the ups and downs of the 3-tier system (publisher, distribution, retail). We're in a challenging time right now, and selling games like this can be difficult to get right. Because this game is so costly to manufacture, there is a lot more risk if we were to publish this game through traditional means. A wrong guess on inventory could be devastating to a company of our size. We know that there are a lot of fans who have loved Castle Panic from the beginning, and we know that there will be new fans that are going to fall in love with this new version. The best way we can get a product of this scale into the hands of players who are excited to have it is to work directly with our customers via the Kickstarter platform.\n                                         This project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFireside Games has been publishing and distributing games around the world for over 10 years. During that time, we have worked with multiple factories and international freight companies to ensure our high-quality games are delivered on-time and in excellent condition. For this Kickstarter, we are working with experienced partners like Quartermaster Logistics to continue that pattern of quality.\n\nWe are estimating an April 2021 delivery date for this game, but please keep in mind this is only an estimate. There are always elements beyond our control when working with manufacturers, such as virus outbreaks, production delays, shipping delays, and delays with customs. Should these occur, we will make sure that we quickly communicate any delay or challenge and keep our backers updated.\n\nIn addition, the game has already gone through substantial production, which further limits chances for delays. The artwork is mostly complete, the plastics have been sculpted, and many components are at or near a print-ready state. Final layout, proofing, and editing still need to be done, but we are confident in our timing estimates.\n\nREFUNDS\nIf you request a refund within 14 days of the end of the campaign, we can refund your pledge including fees. Refunds processed after 14 days will still be credited, minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees, which we are not reimbursed for at that time. Refunds processed after 14 days may be refunded via PayPal or Stripe to the card used at our discretion.\n\nThis project is funded in USD and any refunds will also be processed in USD.\n\nAll artwork and materials shown are not final and are subject to change.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Fireside Games\n2 created \u00b7 14 backed\nFireside Games was founded in 2007 when we decided to take our hobby of creating board games and make it our livelihood.

That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar. Tag yourself:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and they just keep getting bigger. So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components. Fortunately, we've enlisted Tim Burrell-Saward and Andrew Sung, both with significant experience on these types of projects, to assist us in overseeing the manufacturing process.

And we're finally ready for you all to have an early look. I tapped Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer, to do a deep dive on the app's heroic journey to date. As with all of these updates, keep in mind that we are still refining and will continue to refine until the game gets into your hands and beyond. Everything here is still \"in progress\".

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense. It's a major checkpoint, where you're likely to run into issues that need addressing.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically.

Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

Car Wars returns in a bigger, faster edition. The detailed 1/64 scale cars move, shoot, and catch fire the way you remember, with faster car creation and play. Once again you can rule the roads!\nNOTE: All miniatures are pre-assembled at the factory and packed unpainted. Miniatures shown in the photos are prototypes. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. \nForeground: Warhawk, one of the six miniatures included in the Car Wars Sixth Edition core game. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. Displayed on Car Wars Playmat #1. All work shown is in progress and not final.\nNorth America, A.D. 2070. It's a new American frontier. The collapse of the U.S. government plunged the country back into the good old days -- days of wilderness lawlessness, banditry, regional dictators, and of the men and women who combat them. Modern-day knights and gunslingers are in demand; but the automobile has replaced the horse, and the machine-gun and recoilless rifle have made the sword and Winchester obsolete.\nWelcome to 2070. It's a rough world, but it's the only one around . . . \nCar Wars is the game of autoduelling; futuristic vehicular combat where the right of way goes to the biggest guns. Players design their cars -- complete with weapons, accessories, and crew -- and then take them into the arena where one emerges victorious . . . and the others are annihilated.\nFirst published in 1981, the earlier editions of Car Wars have sold over one million games and accessories during the game's near-four decades of life. Over the years, the Car Wars game -- as well as the world of Autoduel America -- has grown, adding more rules, expansions, and setting information. Car Wars has been featured in comic books, novels, solo adventure gamebooks, and even the fan-favorite classic Autoduel video game. \nNow, with your support, we're bringing Car Wars back as a faster, streamlined edition with detailed plastic models. The new Car Wars game was designed to put you in the driver's seat and into the action within moments of opening the game box.\nAfter six years of design, development, playtesting, and constant refinement and improvement, we've completed the core of the new Car Wars Sixth Edition game and we're now ready for your support. \nThe new core game includes:\n24-page rulebook, covering everything from building your car to movement and combat. All of the rules you need to start playing the game within moments of opening the box! \nTEN (stretch goal unlocked!) 1/64 scale highly-detailed plastic car models. Pre-assembled at the factory, these miniatures are ready to paint and take into the arena. Or, for those of you who want to jump into the action quickly, use the minis unpainted; the included car bases are color-coded so that you can instantly tell which car is yours during the heat of battle. \nFour color-coded player dashboards. These thick, durable chipboard player boards include spaces for your car's external armor, tire points, power plant points, as well as your car's current speed.\nFour car design decks, one for each of the included player colors. Using the Build Point and Crew Point mechanics, you can create a new car (and outfit your driver and gunner) in less than ten minutes! \nTwo different internal damage card decks, one for low-point value games and one for high-point value games. Once armor is penetrated, a card is randomly drawn to determine which internal components are hit by an attack.\nTwenty custom six-sided dice! These are used for all attack rolls, defensive rolls, and movement rolls in the game. \nA chipboard turning key. Use this when moving and maneuvering your car. The turning key works perfectly with the color-coded car bases; your car pivots over the turning key so that every swerve and turn made during the game is as accurate as possible. (Includes two copies of the key.)\nDozens of damage, control, Ace, and other types of tokens that are required to track the status of various parts of the game. \nA streamlined collision system that keeps the game flowing. See how the bases are used to push objects in a collision in this Facebook video. \nPlay on any smooth tabletop . . . or upgrade your game with one of the Car Wars playmats (see Add-Ons, below). The basic arena is a 36\" x 36\" playspace; scenarios expand play to even larger spaces for those of you who want to play a highway game, fight in a big arena, or tackle a custom scenario of your own design.\nDo you want to see Car Wars Sixth Edition in action?

There are a few minor issues, but nothing that we cannot address during the manufacturing process.\n\nOnce the factory opens, we'll officially shift the project into the production stage. There will still be a number of checks (photos and video, so we can confirm that those minor issues are handled). We will not skip steps during this process or sign off on \"meh, that kinda works\" components. We get one chance to do this right, and we are going to do what it takes to make the game (and all of the expansions) the best we can manage. This means that although we are moving into production, we may find an item or two that requires another round of tweaks during manufacturing.\n\nWe know the one question everyone is asking comes down to: When will I get my game? We cannot answer that question until the factory opens and together we can nail down a final production schedule. One of the biggest risks of a Kickstarter campaign -- especially one of this size -- is that everyone gets to see the behind-the-scenes delays and issues that can plague a project. We don't assign a release date for many of our games until everything is at print (and often not until we have the tooling complete). This makes it easier to hit release dates, but even that has been a major challenge over the last year as the global pandemic disrupts everything.\n\nWe'll be back with a new update in early March after the factory opens and we work out a tentative production timeline. Once we have a production schedule, then we can start to plan a shipping schedule, but even that will be subject to the issues that are delaying shipping containers.

But it appears that a mistake was made and material was changed during material changeover in the machines at the factory, affecting some of the games produced. We have already looked into the possibility of reprinting the cards, but this would be a time-consuming process and we would rather address this issue immediately. Because we pride ourselves on making components of the highest quality, we would like to rectify this situation by offering card sleeves.

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\n\nUse this link to access the Pledge Manager for Backer Rewards and Late Pledges! \nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. We successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. This Kickstarter features Barricades Mode designed by Bryan Reese - rules and components for Solo & CoOp play, plus Quest 6: What Lies Beneath. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter (but no new content), To The Barricades! which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion + Barricades! which combines both into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes the Champion Reward, To the Barricades, 6 packs of Premium Sleeves, the Epic Thunderstone Add-on for Champion, and the Neoprene Mat.\nNote for Expedited Backers: You can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Champion Expedited. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status. We will ensure that every Expedited Backer who wants this Add-on will be able to get it regardless of the quantity ordered by other backers.\n\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your Champion Expedited.\n\nNote for All other Backers (including $1 Backers): You will be able to upgrade your Reward in the Pledge Manager to Your Inventory Is Full! at the same price listed in this Kickstarter. QUANTITIES MAY BE LIMITED, so to guarantee that you get this Reward, select it now!\nAll Quests, including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath, and the Stretch Goals from this campaign, can be played in either Barricades Mode or normal Competitive Mode.\nFollow the story of our Stretch Goals through Kickstarter Updates!\nThe Backers of this campaign successfully unlocked all the contents of Quest 7: Frostbite(*)! Quest 7 will join Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in the To The Barricades! portion of the Rewards for this Kickstarter.\nThe Premium To the Barricades Box!\n(This packaging is for illustration purposes only. Actual box will differ in graphics and dimensions.)\nWith the completion of this Kickstarter the Thunderstone Quest product line will be quite large. 7 Quests, support for 6 players, and all the components of Barricades Mode, 8 plastic figures, plus Epic Thunderstone support and the Neoprene Mat.\nPlayers who sleeve their cards will have filled the original Champions box. Therefore the To the Barricades box is being engineered to complement the Champion box.\nIn addition, we\u2019re designing a plastic vac-formed tray that you can use to organize the various tokens and chits as you play. You can store those things in the tray in the box, and when it\u2019s time to play you can remove the tray and put it on the table! The tray will be designed to accommodate all the various tokens & chits included in Champion + Barricades and a little bit of future proofing as well!\nCurrently we envision a box with the same dimensions as the Champion box. The two boxes will be graphically designed to compliment each other on your shelf.\nWe believe that when you sleeve all cards including Epic the two boxes together will have room for one or two additional Quests beyond Quest 7, although the storage of the Neoprene Playmat Add-on will affect how many cards can be stored in the boxes.\nWe expect to provide a suggested setup for managing all the cards and components across the two boxes when To the Barricades is delivered. Some people will prefer to organize their cards alphabetically by type. Others will organize them by Quest. We will have suggested setups for both.\nThe To the Barricades! Box will be Kickstarter Exclusive!\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals are included in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory Is Full!, but are not included in the Champion reward.\nThe Champion, Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory is Full! rewards will include all the Kickstarter Exclusive Content from the 1st Kickstarter.\nKickstarter Exclusive content (\"KSE\") are game components and accessories that are available only to backers of AEG Kickstarters. Kickstarter Exclusive Content may be released in an alternate form more widely in the future (different art, different card titles, etc.).\nThunderstone is one of the most successful games AEG has ever published. The Kickstarter for Thunderstone Quest and delivery of those rewards to our backers has enabled us to continue to develop the game and expand its scope. \nThe major innovation for Thunderstone Quest is ... Quests! Each Quest consists of a selection of dungeon tiles and monster cards that create an engaging storyline. Each Quest includes rules for selecting Village and Dungeon cards to create a variety of Adventures. After you've mastered each Quest you use random setups of Quest cards to create new Dungeons and Villages - build your own Quests and Adventures!\nThe Champion Reward\nIncludes:\nReally Big Box that holds all Champion content (even sleeved!)\n5 Quests (each Quest includes approximately 245 cards and 6 Dungeon Tiles [except Ripples in Time which includes 4])\nOver 130 base game cards (starting cards, quest cards, treasure cards, wound cards, key cards, randomizers & dividers)\nWilderness tile\nVillage game board\n6 plastic Champion figures\n140 wood tokens\n5 six-sided dice\nRule book\nQuest book\nKickstarter exclusives & extras including The Yellow Knight card & meeple (googly eyes not included)\nBarricades Mode\nOne of the most requested features from the community was the ability to play the game solo or in a co-operative game. Our team has developed an extension to Thunderstone Quest called Barricades Mode to make that possible.\nIncludes:\n6 Guardian Boards\n[ In ongoing playtesting, Guardian Key cards were removed ]\n20 damage chits\n1 Damage chit bag\n2 Marketplace overlay boards\n8 Prestige Class boards\n30 Prestige tokens\n20 Guardian Dice (D12)\n1 Threat Level wooden token\n5 Barricade tokens\n2 Additional Player Packs (all components required for adding a 5th and 6th player to both Competitive Mode and Barricades Mode)\nQuest 6: What Lies Beneath\nWe area also presenting Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in this campaign. What Lies Beneath is designed to work with Barricades Mode to create a seamless storytelling experience. What Lies Beneath can be played in normal competitive mode too. All of the other Quests will be compatible with Barricades Mode.\nIncludes:\nApproximately 245 cards\n6 Dungeon tiles\nRulebook\nEpic Thunderstone support cards\nFull color storage box (will also hold components from Barricades Mode)\nThunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon is on Kickstarter so that we can bring all our current backers the content they've asked for quickly, and to create an opportunity for new backers to join the adventure and get access to all the Kickstarter Exclusive content from the first campaign.\nThe Stretch Goals in this campaign will be included in the To The Barricades! reward, and the Champion + Barricades!, and the Your Inventory Is Full! reward, but not the Champion reward.\n\n(*) Quest 7: Frostbite is a working title and is subject to change.\nThe rules for Thunderstone Quest are available for download on the Thunderstone page at alderac.com. \nUpdate 15AUG:  We have produced a special Print & Play package for Barricades Mode that you can download and assemble at home. This is version 2.2 of the Barricades Mode system! If you own Thunderstone Quest, you'll be able to play Barricades Mode with this Print & Play!\nThunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nThis new version of Thunderstone enhances the Dungeon mechanic introduced in classic Thunderstone. In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an Adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.\nThunderstone Quest uses a lot of the rules from previous versions of Thunderstone but the cards from previous versions are not compatible.\nThe heroes must travel through time and into the arctic waste in search of a legendary artifact of great power. Follow along as their story unfolds with each new Stretch Goal!\nEpic Thunderstone: \nOur 1st Add-On is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion and Champion + Barricades! Reward. If you backed the first Kickstarter and are backing this Kickstarter at the To the Barricades! level you can also order this Add-on.\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll new content (including Stretch Goals) in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play created by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook.\nThis Add-On is a pre-built Epic Thunderstone deck ready for play. You won't have to subtract cards from your main play set to play Epic Thunderstone.\nYou'll need a full copy of Thunderstone Quest to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the main game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern.\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within the To the Barricades box for this Kickstarter, rolled up. The length will be between 295 and 300 mm. The width is still undetermined; the graphics team will be redesigning the Village layout to accommodate the new size after the Kickstarter but the total will be smaller than the current Village board.\nPremium Sleeves\nOur 2nd Add-On are packs of Premium Sleeves. These Sleeves use the same plastic we used in the Mystic Vale sleeves.\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 1 more pack to sleeve the new content in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades!.\nThe Champion box holds all the Champion content, plus the Epic Add-on cards sleeved. You will need to store future Quests (including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath and the stretch goals from this campaign) in their own boxes if you wish to sleeve them.\nAdventurer Catch-Up Kit\nOur third Add-on is a way for people who purchased the Adventurer Reward in the first Kickstarter to get the Quests that they did not purchase in the first campaign. It consists of Quest 3: Risen from the Mire, and Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World. The Quests will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the To The Barricades! pledge level to order this Add-on (all this content is included in the Champion and Champion + Barricades! rewards.)\nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected the Champion+Barricades (Expedited US Only) reward you will receive your Champion box in an expedited early shipment soon after the campaign ends. We have 1,000 units of Champion in our warehouse in the US so we will be able to send the Champion part of your Reward on an expedited timeline. We believe we can have them delivered 6 to 8 weeks after the close of the campaign. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nBecause this inventory is already in the United States the cost, customs issues, and complexity of shipping to non-US addresses prohibit us from delivering the expedited portion of the Reward outside the United States.\nThe cost to ship the Champion Reward for expedited delivery will be borne by AEG. Backers at this level will pay for shipping & handling for the rest of the Reward normally based on weight, and the rest of the Reward will ship at the same time as fulfillment of all other Reward content for this Kickstarter in 2019.\n\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA (Canada and the rest of the world).\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! (including Stretch Goals) without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive. \nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! at 23lbs/12kg.\nUSA:$23 \nCANADA: $40 \nEUROPE: $27 to Germany. $39 to EU + Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nLATIN AMERICA: $80 to most countries. \nASIA: $33 to China and Hong Kong. $62 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $45 to Australia. $75 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $80\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping To The Barricades!

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nTo participate in the Kick It Here program for Thunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon please email kickstarter@alderac.com with the name of your store, the URL of your store's website, and your store's physical address. We will reply with details about the Kick It Here Promotion.\nParticipating retailers agree not to sell Thunderstone Quest product received through this promotion on the internet.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to - stores will pay actual Shipping & Handling for delivery just like regular backers.\nAEG would like to thank the following experts who helped make this campaign possible: \nMike Elliott, Original Design & Development of Thunderstone\nMike Elliott, Bryan Reese & Mark Wootton, Design & Development of Thunderstone Quest\nMatt Paquette, Kickstarter Campaign Page graphics\nBenjamin Sheedy, voice work for the main campaign video", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the end of the campaign we will cancel and refund any pledge of less than $50.

Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your Reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Each gameplay element brings a new life and a new application to these 16th century masterpieces which were created by some of the most iconic and gifted painters in the history of visual art. Graciously opened to the public domain by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, we consider it an honor and a privilege to apply these works of indescribable beauty, mystery, and majesty to the narrative of The Island of El Dorado.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Ship Naked, a well-known fulfillment company, to deliver the most efficient shipping experience possible. They did an incredible job on our first campaign getting packages to our backers quickly and undamaged. We\u2019ve also subsidized much of the applicable shipping and taxes to keep prices as low as possible for our backers.\nWe\u2019re at the beginning of something great. El Dorado Games came to life in 2017 when Daniel Aronson, Nick Tompkins, and Michael Howard had a dream and over 4500 backers like you made it a reality. Since then, we\u2019ve been working tirelessly on this game, this first expansion, and much, much more to pave the way for a long and exciting future of fun and engaging tabletop games.\nWe want you on this journey with us. The feedback we received before, during, and after the first campaign from our families, friends, and backers is a huge part of what made The Island of El Dorado what it is. We want to hear your ideas, see your islands, and know both the things you love about the game and the areas you think we could improve. Our success or failure is not our own; we\u2019re all in this together and we want you on board!\nThis is a game for every kind of player. We designed this game to be something that would appeal as much to heavy gamers as it would to people who aren\u2019t into the hobby at all. Simple rules and mechanics are combined with complex strategies and just enough luck to level the playing field. The result is an experience that\u2019s exciting for players of any experience or skill level.\nAvailability is Limited. While we intend to pursue retail partnerships in the future, we\u2019re presently using Kickstarter and Ship Naked as our only method of distribution for our games. It was astounding to see copies of our game from the first Kickstarter selling for upwards of $100 on eBay after fulfillment, and we hope that with this second printing everyone who wants to join in the fun has an opportunity to grab a copy of the game and expansion at a price less than what they\u2019d be sold for at retail! This KS Edition will include stretch goals and higher quality finishes than what is possible in retail versions.\nEvery one of you is needed. We were overwhelmingly humbled and excited to see the support we received during the first Kickstarter campaign. As a result, we were able to use the funds we raised to conceive and mass produce one of the most beautiful tabletop games we\u2019d ever seen. This absolutely would not have happened if we hadn\u2019t had the support of so many backers, and that need remains in this new campaign. Every backer who supports us and every dollar we raise helps us to pack this game with the highest quality components and materials that we possibly can. The sky is the limit!\nEl Dorado Games started with three friends just trying to make a game we could play together at game night. With the success of the first Kickstarter and overwhelming positive reviews, our new goal is to bring all the fun and excitement we\u2019ve had to friend groups around the world. We\u2019re thankful for every single one of you and we\u2019re excited you\u2019re on this rollercoaster with us!\nWhen designing The Island of El Dorado, we wanted it to be a game that our wives (who are not gamers) would actually play with us. Every decision was based on creating a great gateway game; one that hardcore gamers can bring to a casual gamer\u2019s house to ease them into a realm of experiences involving more strategy and focus. The mechanics are simple, but the tactical decisions are complex. Casual gamers have enough quick-and-easy fun to keep them engaged and there\u2019s just enough luck to keep a relatively level playing field. It\u2019s the intense strategy game that your grandma can play with you\u2026and win! If you\u2019ve been gaming your whole life or if this is your first time with a game like this, we\u2019ve worked hard to make The Island of El Dorado an experience you\u2019ll love.\nStill, there exists a subset of gamers who prefer their games to be entirely tactical, with little to no luck affecting the strategies they\u2019ve put in place. We want our game to be just as much fun for these players as it is for a first-time gamer, so we\u2019ve designed \u201chardcore mode\u201d, a supplementary set of rules which shifts the dynamic and feel of the game deeper into the realm of forward-thinking, calculated strategy.

Cultists are summoning one of the Elder Ones to consume our world, and it is up to the ragtag group of investigators to face the nightmarish forces and disrupt the ritual long enough to make the Elder One vulnerable. And then kill it dead.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Season 2 Expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, Art Book, Extra Dice, Frost Dice.\nDesigned by Rob Daviau and Eric M. Lang, the game features monster artwork by Adrian Smith and investigator artwork by Karl Kopinski. Investigators come from all walks of life, each bringing a unique skill to the team, as well as two other generic skills.\nArt by Karl Kopinski, sculpts by RN Estudio.\nMadness is always at your side when battling unthinkable monstrosities from other dimensions. In fact, the investigators already start the game with a diagnosed insanity, which will will be triggered by your encounters with the occult. You may be doomed by your mental breakdown, or learn to use it to your advantage. The closer you are to losing your mind completely, the more powerful your skills will become.\nArt by Filipe Pagliuso.\nSummoning the Elder Gods are fanatic cultists, and the hosts of nightmarish monstrosities aiding  them in their cause. Each of these enemies possesses its own special ability and combat strength. They are not controlled by any player, but instead have their behavior triggered by Mythos cards used for each specific episode.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Sculpts by Thierry Masson, Yannick Hennebo, Remy Tremblay, Michael Jenkins, Edgar Skomorowski, and Jose Roig.\nThe Death May Die core box contains smaller boxes that hold the modular elements to create each unique game session. Players choose one of the two available Elder Ones and combine their contents with those of one of the six available Episodes. Each of these boxes contain unique figures, tokens, and cards that are only used when playing with those elements. The Mythos deck used in each game is a combination of cards from the chosen Elder One box and the chosen Episode box. Each Episode not only indicates the map setup using the various tiles in the game, but also new actions the investigators can perform in order to accomplish the tasks required to disrupt that episode's ritual. They each also bring their own Discovery cards for players to explore, and the monsters' behaviors and abilities are tailored to each unique story.\nHastur, known as the King in Yellow, and his disciples brand the world with their terrible Yellow Sign. Those that suffer this doom quickly meet their fate by the hands of death or madness.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Disciple sculpt by Thierry Masson. Hastur sculpt by JAG.\nCthulhu, The Thing That Should Not Be, will bring his sunken kingdom of R'lyeh into our world, plunging the earth into a nightmarish reality.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Cthulhu sculpt by Michael Jenkins. Star Spawn sculpt by Aragorn Marks.\nThe Elder Ones start the game off the board; as they move along the summoning track their growing presence invites chaos and insanity into the world to accompany their grand awakening. Eventually they cross over and the real nightmare begins. If the investigators have managed to disrupt the ritual, the Elder One becomes vulnerable and may (just possibly) be killed for good. If not, the investigators now have to contend with an immortal behemoth hunting them while they try to accomplish their tasks. Either way, killing the Elder One will not be easy, not by a long shot, as each time it's bested it grows more enraged and powerful. In the end, either all investigators will fall or death will come for the Great Old One.\nInvestigators, Cultists, Star Spawn, Cthulhu and Hastur painted by Robert Karlsson. Byakee, Deep One, Ghoul, and Shoggoth painted by Fabrizio Russo. Cthonian, Fire Vampire, and Hunting Horror painted by Angel Giraldez. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nIn their mission to thwart the cultist's plans, investigators engage in more than combat. If they can get some respite, they can discover all sorts of things to potentially help them in their tasks. Discovery cards are unique to each Episode, and present the investigators with challenges or choices that will grant them different resources, companions or negative effects.\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box comes with:\n45 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n17 Terrain Tiles\n30 Plastic Tentacle Tokens\n8 Custom Dice\n5 Counter Bases\n10 Investigator Dashboards\n186 Cards\n120 Tokens\n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nUnspeakable Pledge - $100\nBackers with an Unspeakable Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSculpt by RN Estudio. Painting by Robert Karlsson.\nJulia is an incredibly level-headed investigator. Given the extraordinary circumstances she finds herself in, it's amazing how she can keep her wits about her. Her unique skill allows her to take wounds instead of stress, greatly increasing her chances of success in any given encounter. Though it may cost her life in the end...\nR'lyeh Rising Pledge - $250\nBackers with a R'lyeh Rising Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive R'lyeh Rising expansion, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nAs the production of this statue is extremely expensive and time-consuming, delivery of it will be staggered. However, all backers will receive the rest of the base pledge at the same time. \nCheck out THIS UPDATE for for answers to some pressing questions, extra gameplay information, and shipping cost estimates.\nLet's not be coy, the heart and soul of the R'lyeh Rising expansion is its colossal figure of Cthulhu! This cyclopean creation is something never before seen in the world of board gaming. Its base is 44 x 44 cm wide, and it stands 57 cm tall to the tip of its wings. In fact, this thing is so huge that his base becomes the board on which the game is played! This plastic statue was sculpted in terrifying detail and will come pre-assembled, with the exception of the clip-on wings, so it can be proudly displayed for all to see.\nSculpt by Remy Tremblay (Julia figure included for scale).\nR'lyeh Rising is a wholly unique Episode, the epic finale to Death May Die, not only bringing its own set of tokens, Discovery cards, Monster cards, and Mythos cards, but also drastic changes to the game's base rules, as the figures move and act freely upon the behemoth's rocky base.\nPainting by Angel Giraldez (Cultist figures included for scale).\nPLEASE NOTE ALL FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON team dives into a gameplay overview of Death May Die with Episode 1 - Blasphemous Alchemy:\nFind out more about the Season 2 Expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the Black Goat of the Woods HERE. \nFind out more about the Art Book HERE.\nFind out more about the Extra Dice HERE.\nFind out more about the Frost Dice HERE.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is July 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Cthulhu: Death May Die.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Most people survive by selling their souls to the megacorps, slaving away for their entire lives to stay safe and fed.  \n\nSome people, though, aren\u2019t willing to sell out. They don\u2019t fit into the mold the corporations have prepared for them. They live in the cracks and margins of society\u2014in the shadows. To survive, they do the things others won\u2019t, performing the grey ops the megacorps need in order to keep up with the competition.  \n\nYou are one of them. You are a shadowrunner. You may make your way by slinging spells, swinging swords, firing bullets, or hacking the Matrix. You have to be a step faster and a hair smarter than everyone else if you want to keep working, and you need to keep your wits about you if you want to stay alive. There are plenty of obstacles out there: corp security officers, ultra-violent gangers, vicious critters, and people who carry two hundred bullets and an equal number of grudges. To stay alive, you trust yourself, you trust your team, and you remember a few simple pieces of advice:  Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever cut a deal with a dragon.\n If you want to see the components in more detail, check further down the page and also watch our micro videos! \nCheck this out! \nWe've got some wiz options for you.

It comes with a few necessary caveats, however. Please review the process and the necessary legal mumbo-jumbo: \n\nProcess: You will be required to provide a photo of yourself, as well as a street name, catch phrase and archetype/racial preference. Artists will do their best to incorporate you into our standard style guide for the archetype and race you select, and Catalyst gets the last word on art direction as well as acceptable character names and flavor text. [Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.]\n\n[Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.] \n\nLegaleze: In order to make you over into a Shadowrun character, and for this character to become part of the Shadowrun universe, you will need to sign a release form that authorizes us to oversee creative direction and to use the final art and information. This release will also assign the copyright of the work to the Topps Company (the owners of the Shadowrun IP). Topps will own the creative work you are helping us create based on your likeness.  \nSince Catalyst Game Labs is a major supplier to distribution and local gaming stores, we want to make sure you are part of this Kickstarter's equation.  \nWho - For any and all retailers, local gaming stores, convention vendors and more. Must have a valid business license and accounts with reputable distribution channels such as Alliance, GTS, Universal,  Lion Rampant and more. \nWhat - A pledge level to help us gauge interest in exclusive product for retailers that revolve around Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops.\nWhen - After the campaign, we'll have a pledge manager level that will be open exclusively to retailers. This will include product specific to retail only and/or extremely good margins if you order through your regular distribution channels. \nWhy - Because we love our retailers, distributors and local gaming stores.  Without you we are nothing. Thank-you, and please note that we haven't forgot you. \nWe've got a lot coming your way in terms of LIVE Q&A's, LIVE Play-through's and more!

The players lay out the gameboard, the various cards and dice, and randomly select one of the Final Mission cards. Then each player starts by selecting a shadowrunner team\u2014taking the appropriate markers and player mat\u2014and placing three starting shadowrunners in their player area.\nEach player has a number of actions based upon how many shadowrunners they have on their team; all start with three, but you\u2019re able to hire up to four. Beginning with the first player in a turn, each player places one of their shadowrunner markers on a location on the gameboard, immediately resolving the effects there. \nA few location examples:  \nAt the Crime Mall, immediately spend nuyen to purchase equipment and place the card with any of shadowrunners.\nAt Max\u2019s Ironworks, get a cyberware upgrade for that shadowrunner.\nThe Eye of the Needle provides a host of different benefits for what you need to accomplish in a turn.\nGot a wounded shadowrunner? Dante\u2019s Inferno will let them lie low, make contacts, and generate some nuyen.\nOr make your way to Mr. Johnson and select a mission.\nAnd plenty more! Check out the game board! \nPlayers not only need to choose the appropriate location to try to maximize their gains each turn\u2014and act before other players can grab what they\u2019re looking for\u2014but each shadowrunner is a specific type, bringing their own strengths and weaknesses to a given location.\nShadowrun: Sprawl Ops includes the following shadowrunner types:\nStreet Samurai: Weapons master, often more machine than man.\nDecker: Computer hacker extraordinaire; the Matrix is life.\nMage: Slinger of spells and incantations; rare, precious, dangerous.\nRigger: Drones and vehicles; a mind-jockey for any mobile tech.\nFace: Charismatic and silver-tongued; confidence man for any deal. \nPlacing any shadowrunner into the Crime Mall location on the gameboard lets you snag any equipment card available for the list price. But if you place your Face there, you can get it for half price! Or if you want that perfect cyberware upgrade for your Rigger, you must place that shadowrunner in Max\u2019s Ironworks. Or send your Street Samurai to The Eye of the Needle to automatically pass the first Stage of a mission; or the Decker to gain extra Loot; or the Mage to move one of your other shadowrunners. That's just the start of the benefits of having the right runner in the right place.\nOnce all shadowrunners are placed and locations activated, players move into the last portion of every round: running their missions! \nEvery Mission card indicates several stages that need to be completed, via a series of icons corresponding to the shadowrunner types. Players then determine which shadowrunners they wish to send on the mission; they can send one, some, or all their team.  After reviewing their shadowrunners, they select a number of six-sided dice equal to all of their available icons\u2014based upon the shadowrunners, equipment, and upgrade cards\u2014and then roll their dice. \nEach die includes two \u201csuccess\u201d sides and one \u201cinjury\u201d side; the rest of the sides are blank. When rolling the dice, a player has three rolls to clear a Mission stage by matching the correct success icon from their dice with the needed icons on the stage. Additionally, a player can use any two of the same color successes to achieve one success for another color. \nIn all the chaos of fast-talking your way past guards, tossing fireballs, and flashing blades while getting the job done, injuries are bound to happen. A player can wipe out one injury die roll result by using any one success. But if they trade too many successes that way, then they won\u2019t be able to get the successes they need to complete a stage within the three rolls they are allowed. And if they can\u2019t wipe out an injury, those start to stack up, knocking shadowrunners\u2014and their dice\u2014out of the current mission, potentially losing them for a turn. So it\u2019s a fine push-your-luck balance. \nOnce you\u2019ve started a stage of a Mission, you must continue rolling until you\u2019re done. But when a stage is complete, you can decide to pull out\u2014sometimes, the pressure comes too hot, and it's time for duck-and-cover. Or maybe you feel you\u2019ve got this despite the injuries, despite the odds, and you push on through. You might see victory \u2026 or you might get half your team injured or even killed, and you\u2019ll spend the next turn (at least) rebuilding. \nKnowing when to walk away is just as important as when to push. If you manage complete the mission, you\u2019ll get the nuyen payout that will help you bring in better shadowrunners and more gear on future jobs. And of course all of this will lead to the big run of the Final Mission.  Check out one of them, the Rescue a Ritual Sacrifice job against Aztechnology.\nBrutal, right? Not to mention the brinkmanship with the other players. Push too soon, and you might not have the dice to make it through; both of the the six Mage and six Hacker successes are tough nuts to crack. And if you fail, you\u2019re left to rebuild for a turn\u2014time you may not have. But wait too long, and another player will sneak in front of you, and with the right set of runners, equipment, and a little luck, they\u2019ll snag your victory from you! \nThat\u2019s just a quick walk through of Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops. There\u2019s much more to experience and enjoy in this unique combination of worker placement and push-your-luck tactics! \nDownload the Working Rule Book HERE. \nWhen you back this campaign you are also subject to some serious stretch-goal mojo, or as we like to call it, SWAG GOALS!\nWe did the entire list!

But they don\u2019t have to do it alone! Fighting alongside them in this all-new campaign, the Heroes will have the aid of the Mounts, enormous beasts of burden!\nThis is an expansion for Arcadia Quest and/or Arcadia Quest: Inferno and requires either to play.\nThis expansion introduces a major new element to Arcadia Quest as these magnificent Mounts can carry Heroes across the map, pushing back against their foes and using their unique abilities to help their Riders!\nRiding in Style\nWith the introduction of Mounts, a few things are now different for the Heroes in Arcadia. For one, each Guild can choose one beastly friend for a Hero to ride upon. Mount and Rider move along the map together, endure attacks together and Shove enemies out of their way together! <3\nEach Mount has its own unique Natural Ability that can be triggered when its Rider is activated for some wild effects! Mounts can also absorb damage for Heroes, and likewise, when a Rider wants to drink a Healing or Refreshing Potion they can drink it themselves or give it to their Mounts - aw!\nMalkhor and his Jacklols\nYes, now hold that pose for a second!\nLegend holds that Malkhor fell to earth on a chariot of blazing fire. The Eternal Hunter has stalked large prey in the Wilds since time immemorial, and now that the Mounts have found refuge in the city of Arcadia, he's upped his game and encroaches the area. Whether he\u2019s truly a fallen god or merely some visitor from a very distant land, Malkhor\u2019s intentions are clear: Stalk. Hunt. Kill.\n\"Hehehheh hahahaha heee heeeee hahahahaaa!!!\u201d\nThe unnerving and insane laughter heralds the approach of the Jacklols and drive many Arcadians mad. These cunning monsters serve Malkhor with spears and jokes alike!\nMeet the New Heroes: Colette & Gaston\nColette is the elder of the Wildling Twins and, as tradition dictates, has led her brother to Arcadia in pursuit of Malkhor. She\u2019s always loved exotic new lands and loves exotic new weapons even more. Not many would employ a battle-axe as a throwing weapon, nor a flail as a whip to entangle legs and arms. Regardless, the Guilds have much to learn from such an unorthodox warrior and are lucky to have her.\nGaston is the younger of the Wildling Twins: impetuous, fearless, and somewhat lacking in common sense. This is not to say he\u2019s overly foolish, but his sister must restrain his more exuberant excesses from time to time. He rarely considers the odds when charging headlong into battle. That said, he often succeeds where others would not. His lightning reflexes and sharp eyes (and no small number of pain medications) make Gaston a fearsome combatant.\nShiny New Toys In Town!\nWith the arrival of new residents in Arcadia, the market street is bustling with shiny new exotic gear! You'll find not only an assortment of Upgrade cards like Saddles, Stirrups and such for your new riding companions...\n...but also new Upgrades for Heroes in the form of new Weapons, Armor, and Spells!\nA Whole New Campaign!\nArcadia Quest: Riders features a brand-new campaign that tells the story of the Guilds attempting to push Malkhor back from the city. In this campaign, 3 alternative scenarios plug into the previously released Beyond the Grave and Pets expansions, bringing a fun mix of Mounts, Pets and Undead together. There's even a scenario that mixes Riders with the other 2 expansions!\nThe Arcadia Quest: Riders campaign is structured a bit differently than other campaigns. As a flash Kickstarter campaign (running for 5 days only!) all pledges already include Kickstarter exclusives and no Stretch Goals or Optional Buys will be available during the campaign.\nIn order to expedite access to this product, we've broken down the pledges by hub. If you would like to receive this pledge by July 2018, make sure to select one of the First Print pledges. Select the Hub of your area/country. If you don't see your country listed in any of the Pledges, please select the United States Hub. Please note that First Print copies are limited to 1 copy per backer. You will be able to get more copies through the Geekfunder Pledge Manager after the campaign ends, but extra copies will be delivered at a later date. If your country's First Pledges are gone, you can choose to receive the Second Print, which will be delivered at a later date.\nPlease take note that if you choose to back with $1 only you will be able to update your pledge for a full reward on the Geekfunder Pledge Manager, but your pledge will ship at a later date - with the Second Print copies.\nRULES & CAMPAIGN BOOK\nCLICK HERE to check out the Campaign Book for Arcadia Quest: Riders. The Scenarios themselves are omitted in this Web version.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a single Arcadia Quest: Riders pledge - Inclusive of $5 shipping credit.\nUSA: $5-$10 to most states. $35 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$25 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $55 to most countries.\nASIA: $5 to China and Hong Kong. $15-$20 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $10-$25 to Australia. $15 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $70 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $10-$25 to most countries.\n\u2022 $30 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\u2022 $30-$40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n\u2022 $55 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 31st Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for the First Print Pledges is July 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde, with wave 2 shipping.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, HATE, and Zombicide: Invader, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Arcadia quest: Riders.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "First Print - EU Hub", "descp": "EXPANSION AND EXCLUSIVE ITEMS ONLY.

Watch the Man vs Meeple 5min video below to learn all the rules.\nIt is a deceptively deep game. The rules are straight forward, and the choices might seem easy at first. But by mid-game you'll find yourself in a pickle if you don't do some careful planning. Traditionally roll-and-write games have been lighter games, but On Tour is a bit heavier.\nWith any game there is a choice to be made. We could have made this game very small, with a pad of paper and golf pencils. We decided to go the opposite route, with the best graphics and components we could get. I wanted On Tour to bring component quality that matches the gameplay. \nOne of my favorite things about On Tour (this is my favorite thing, it can also be your favorite thing if you want, or you can pick something else), is that you can play with any number of people!\nMano a mano against your spouse.\nBy yourself, to pass the time while you are home sick with Mono.\nWith six people at game night when someone says, \"Did anybody bring a game that plays six?\"\nWith all 35 of your dad's weird relatives at Thanksgiving dinner.\nYou could even try to get a few thousand people together and set a world record. Just make sure you have a map for everyone.\nThe game ships with 4 maps, and 4 dry erase markers. 12 will fit in the box.\nIf you want additional maps and dry erase markers, they are $3 each (as in $3 gets you 1 map and 1 marker). Free shipping. I mean, seriously. We're going to put them in the same box. I don't think we need to charge for that.\nYou can pay in the campaign manager after this Kickstarter is over. (We will email you a link after the campaign.)\nOr just pledge at the $48 pledge level, which is the base game plus 8 extra maps (12 maps and 12 dry erase markers total).\nBig (15.2\" x 9.8\" / 38.5 x 25 cm) tri-panel boards, with tape reinforced folds.\nEach player board in On Tour has unique art, each representing a different genre of music. The \"Rock\" map is shown here. The artwork for the country map was reveled in update #3. And we will reveal the artwork for the \"Hip Hop\" map later in the campaign.\nThen we will hold a vote among the backers to decide what music genre should be represented on the fourth map. Leave your ideas in the comments. Right now it looks like Jazz and Electronica/EDM are leading the way.\nWhat's more fun than dice? 10-sided dice. What's more fun than 10-sided dice? Giant 10-sided dice. These dice are hand fillers. 1 3/8\" across. They are fun to roll, and easy to read from across the table.\nYou can write your number in any state in the region on the card, but if you write your number in the exact state listed, you get to circle that number. Circled states in your route are worth double points at the end of the game. How far out of your way should you go to visit a circled state? Should you write a number where you want to, or is it worth the risk to write it a little farther away so you can circle it?\nClick to view the rulebook pdf\n                  Games are great. New games are great. Learning games from the rules is a pain. We're trying to improve this situation.\nWe used tons of giant pictures because it is easier to look at a picture than reading a thousand words. We took feedback from over 100 people on the rulebook's clarity, and will continue to make improvements based on feedback during this campaign.\nThe On Tour box is specifically designed so that it isn't too big with 4 player boards, but you can expand the game with 8 more player boards (making it a 12 player game) and still fit everything in the box.\nYes. The cards will still fit if you sleeve them.\nRahdo and Jen did a special live \"Run Through\" of On Tour. You can play the game with them.\nPrint this low-ink version of the map.\nThen watch the video above to play the game with them. Over 100 people played along live. Through the magic of tape delay, you can join them now. Rahdo and Jen will roll the dice and flip the cards. You mark your route on the map you printed and see if you can beat their scores.\nThese stretch goals will be applied to all copies of the game at all pledge levels and for all extra player maps purchased (for those goals that apply to the map).\nNEW Stretch Goals Added!\n$45K: Hall of Fame Sheet. Keep a record of the best tours of all-time. Record every winner's band name, player, and score to compare against future games.\n$50K: Companion App. An Android/iPhone app that will flip the cards and roll the dice for you. You will still use the dry erase player board and marker. Handy if you want to play a solo game on an airplane, or on your couch.\n$75K: Full Game App. Play solo games of On Tour in the Android or iOS app. This will be a paid app, but backers will get it for free.\nThis is the last stretch goal. At this point I feel like the physical game is the absolute best it can be, and that adding anything more would only jeopardize the schedule.\nALL STRECH GOALS FUNDED. THANKS EVERYONE.\nPlease note that all these videos show prototype components, not the final quality.\n                      Tom also recorded a full play through, you can watch it here. \n The Dice Tower, Tantrum House, and Man vs Meeple were all paid for their preview videos. I had no say in the content of the video, but it is impossible to say how paying them for their time affected what they chose to say. The purpose of these paid videos is to give you an overview of the game from several points of view so you can make your own decision on whether or not the game is right for you.\nI've talked a lot about components and art. But those are all meaningless if the game isn't interesting and fun. Before we did any of that component stuff, we put On Tour through the wringer to make the game play great.\nJuly - October 2017 From idea to game: The game went through many iterations early. Eventually I got stuck. The game was good, but I knew it wasn't all it could be.\nOct - Nov 2017 From \"ok\" to \"really good\": Waitress Games is a professional game development studio. They took the core game that was working, looked at it with fresh eyes, and then started playtesting new twists and new ideas.\nDec 2017 - Mar 2018 From \"really good\" to \"polished and complete\": I started a whole new round of final refinement, which involved sending the game to people on BoardGameGeek that I'd never met and letting them learn from the rules.\nHere's what some of those final playtesters had to say: \nThe game uses simultaneous turns, which is a great plus in my opinion as there is little downtime when playing multiplayer.\nThe evolution of tactics within one play is really nice. At the beginning, there is a lot of long term planification, mid-game is more about pushing your luck, and end-game shines at damage mitigation based on beforehand planification. Overall, continuous adaptation is needed in order to get the most out of the game.\nOk. So I have just played my first game and jumped straight in playing it solo. How naive I was. No regard for any strategy to this and close toward filling all the boxes in I realized I had blocked any decent route possible and gave up mentally, tipping the table over in self frustration. At least I have learnt how not to play.\nStick the kettle on, reset the map. Let\u2019s take a different approach to this.\nOn Tour has a simple design but very deceptive. It invites you in with many options but without strategy and those number of options dwindling as the game nears the end, you will feel this game wasn\u2019t as simple as first thought. The pace of the game is quick but requires thought and calculation to achieve a tour worth talking about. Without a doubt I will be playing this game again and will be bringing this to show at game nights for my friends. I will have to pre advise them not to underestimate it. \nI realized this game is actually more strategic than I previously imagined, and each game is completely different because the starting numbers and positions are completely different. This would make an incredible one player game. \nI like roll-and-writes and I liked this one too. It's easy to explain, quick to play and I enjoyed the careful planning when placing the numbers each round. The doubles rule works well and can come in handy if they're rolled late in the game to connect routes. The four initial state cards make the game more interesting. \nPlease note this timeline is just an estimate. We have tried to make it conservative but realistic. But these dates are not guaranteed.\nThis is the timeline for US shipments. Expect shipments to other parts of the world to be a few weeks behind this. \nDuring this Kickstarter Campaign I'm going to be sharing a daily podcast. Each episode will be short (< 10 min). Over the course of the month, you'll get to hear the On Tour backstory and topics like: how the game came to be, design problems that we ran into, why I wanted to make a game in the first place, art directions that we followed or didn't follow, and the decisions we made that made On Tour the game that it is today.\nCheck out the podcast here.\nAfter this Kickstarter, we will be selling the game directly from our website. (After the campaign, you can go there via the pre-order button at the top of this page.)\nHowever, the price will be a little higher than it is during this campaign. That is the only fair way to treat those of you who help make this project possible by paying in advance.\nThe game won't be sold via traditional distribution, so if your friendly local game store wants to sell it, they will need to get a case from us (back at the $2 Retailer Pledge level during the campaign, or email help@boardgametables.com after the campaign). We will be happy to work with them.\nShipping charges will be charged in our pledge manager after Kickstarter.\nShipping will be $5 ($20 for the 8 pack of games). The game will be shipped from the USA, so there will be no additional customs or tax charges. \nShipping will be $10 ($30 for the 8 pack of games). You will also be charged sales tax/VAT in the pledge manager after the campaign. Your game will ship to you from within CAN/EU, so you will owe no additional customs or taxes when you receive the game.\nThis campaign has CAN and EU friendly shipping. \nAustralia and New Zealand\nWe have decided to partner with a fulfillment center in Australia to offer Australian friendly shipping. Shipping for 1 game will be $20 in Australia and $30 in New Zealand. I don't have a price on the 8-pack yet.\nNon-EU Europe\nShipping is $15. We won't charge you VAT, but you might have to pay duty when you receive your game. UK is being considered EU for this campaign.\nMexico and South and Central America\nShipped from the US. $45. You are responsible for any duty.\nOther\nShipping to South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, and probably most other counties in Africa and Asia. $38. Will ship from Germany. You are responsible for any duty. 8-pack shipping will be $69.\nWe all have regrets in life. Backing On Tour won't be one of them. If you regret buying the game, we will give you a full refund and pay to have it shipped back to us.\nNo questions asked. Actually, we might ask a question or two, but we will refund regardless of how you answer them.\nChad DeShon is the designer of On Tour. Chad has been playing hobby board games for 14 years since discovering Catan in college. In 2014 he founded BoardGameTables.com. He likes heavy games like Age of Steam, Napoleon's Triumph, and Die Macher, and easier to learn games that have surprising depth like Haggis and Konig von Siam.\nAnca Gavril is the artist and graphic designer for On Tour. She loves playing games that come in white boxes, like T.I.M.E. Stories and Food Chain Magnate or at least with white text, like Pandemic Legacy and Blood Rage. If neither of these conditions is met, she enjoys fighting monsters and looting treasures around Gloomhaven.\nKaty Adams is the head of customer support at BoardGameTables.com and for this project. She likes Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Terra Mystica, Scythe, and worker placement games.\nThis is the first board game we've published, but we have run one other Kickstarter.\nA year and a half ago, we ran a Kickstarter for a gaming table called The Duchess. It raised $2.6 million. It was a very ambitious project. We had significant problems. Many tables were damaged during shipment. We had production problems that caused delays.\nBut we did whatever it took to do right by our backers. We stopped production and reworked the product and packaging. And we shipped replacement parts for everything that was damaged. It cost a ton of money. But all the backers got the tables they ordered. In fact, here are some things that they had to say in response to the most recent Kickstarter update:\n\"I'm very satisfied ... You have been very transparent ... you have earned the trust of many of your backers including myself\" -frotes\n\"likely to do future kickstarters with your company\" -Caleb L\n\"I've never been more satisfied by a creators transparency and ability to resolve issues\" -Nick\n\"seriously, this is a very successful campaign for me. Period.\" -Jerome Cance\nI expect fulfilling this Kickstarter to be much smoother. The game play is already final. The art is 80% done. We are working with Panda Game Manufacturing, a leader in the game printing industry.\nCredits:\nDesigner: Chad DeShon\nArtist: Anca Gavril\nCG Artist: Filip Gavril\nCharacter Artist: Daniel Profiri\nRules Editing: Travis D.

I have been talking to my rep (hi, Joe) for months to make sure everything is lined up and on budget.\n\nI believe we have accounted for enough time to finish the art (4 weeks after the end of the campaign), but if we underestimated that, then it could lead to delays.\n\nPanda provided a range for how long each step will take, and we have based our timeline on the longest estimate in the range they provided. A miscommunication between me and Panda that leads to us having to redo one of the steps of the production process is another possible cause of delay.\n\nProduction-wise, this game isn't that complicated. I have seen sample (non-printed) player maps from Panda, but I haven't seen samples with the tape reenforced seam. I don't anticipate any problems there, but I haven't seen them in person. We will also be working with Panda to make sure we are getting dry erase markers that will last and the best possible dry erase surface on the player maps.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you", "descp": "Pledge here if you want to hang out but aren't ready to go all-in yet.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["117 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "Retailers, pledge here for information about how you can buy cases of On Tour to sell in your brick and mortar store.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "The Game (4 player)", "descp": "MSRP: $30\nOn Tour Board Game\nEverything you need to play, including beautiful tri-panel player maps, dice, and dry erase markers for four players.\nAdditional maps and markers to expand to more players available in the pledge manager after the campaign ($3 each).\nShipping charged in pledge manager after the campaign:\nUS: $5, CAN/EU: 10USD, Other: ask.\nVAT for non-US countries charged in pledge manager after campaign.\nYou may purchase additional games, just adjust the dollar amount of your pledge accordingly.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,002 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "The Game + 8 additional maps & markers", "descp": "MSRP: $60\nOn Tour + 8 additional maps & markers (12 player game)\nEverything you need to play, including beautiful tri-panel player maps, dice, and dry erase markers for twelve players.\nAdditional maps and markers to expand to more players available in the pledge manager after the campaign ($3 each).\nShipping charged in pledge manager after the campaign:\nUS: $5, CAN/EU: 10USD, Other: ask.\nVAT for non-US countries charged in pledge manager after campaign.\nYou may purchase additional games, just adjust the dollar amount of your pledge accordingly.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,068 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 179 or more", "title": "Case of 8 Games", "descp": "MSRP: $240\n8 copies of On Tour shipped to one address.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola.

Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

We anticipate that assembly will be finished soon and then games will then be shipped to fulfillment (Quartermaster). Once the games arrive at the fulfillment locations, they will make sure all pledges have the correct faction sleeves. To make up for the delay and since the games will be shipping from the manufacturer to multiple fulfillment locations, we plan to expedite the shipping to the locations that have the longest lead timing so that all of the games will be arriving to you, the backers, at the same time as intended.

But you realize something is missing\u2026 it\u2019s those scratches behind your ears\u2026 those enthusiastic belly rubs\u2026 the sound of a hooman calling you a \u201cgood dog\u201d...\nSo it\u2019s time to brave the apocalypse and search the city for hooman survivors, bring them back to Central Bark, and build a place you can call your forever home!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a cooperative board game, where everyone plays together as a heroic dog pack. Together, you\u2019ll explore a post-apocalyptic city while sniffing out scents, barking at the undead, and herding hoomans to safety.\nSomewhere out there, our hoomans are waiting!\nYour goal in Good Dog, Bad Zombie is to find the scaredy hoomans that are hiding around the crumbling metropolis. To do so, you\u2019ll have to investigate scent tokens in different city locations, such as Squirreltown, the Boneyard, and Worst Place.\nEach scent could reveal a hooman in hiding, or a lurking danger - like a zombie mailman, a barn full of bats, or too much kibble for one pup to handle!\nWhen you do find a hooman, your job isn\u2019t done yet. You\u2019ll need to use your energy cards\u2014and the support of the other dogs in your pack\u2014to lead the hooman to safety. Use cards like \u201cRUFF RUFF BARK GRR-RUFF RUFF!!!\u201d and \u201cHooman in danger! HOOMAN IN DANGER!!\u201d to guide the hooman away from hungry zombies!\nChase the zombies!\nAs you play, new zombies will spawn throughout the city and constantly move toward Central Bark! To keep all your hoomans safe, you\u2019ll need to fend off the zombies. Chase them far enough, and they\u2019ll tumble over the cliffs or be swept away in the river.\nZombies can\u2019t resist the smell of freshly rescued hoomans!\nRescue all the hoomans!\nFind and rescue 6 hoomans, and Central Bark will become your new forever home. Everyone wins!\nSix hoomans safe in central bark.\nBut every time a hooman is lost to the horde or a zombie slips into Central Bark, your pack becomes more feral.\nWe must strive to remember the kindness of hoomans!\nIf the feral track reaches 10, your pack reverts to the ways of their wolf ancestors and forgets what it means to feel the love of a hooman. Everyone loses!\nBe a dog!\nWe wanted to infuse our game with as much dogginess as possible. Be prepared to say things such as, \u201cI\u2019m going to lick myself!\u201d and \u201cI howl at you!\u201d\nYou\u2019ll help your fellow dogs by licking and howling, boosting their energy to help them outwit the zombies! Herd and bark at each other to escape dangerous situations and reach defenseless hoomans faster.\nIn Good Dog, Bad Zombie, there\u2019s no room for the lone wolf. Each dog will support the pack with their own unique skills!\nLupin\u2019s \u201cSnuggle\u201d ability unleashes an energizing flurry of licking!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is for 1 - 5 players, and takes 45 - 60 minutes to play. Choose your preferred difficulty setting when the game begins - take it easy with the \"Walk in the Park,\" or fend off a massive zombie onslaught with the \"Hounds of the Barkalypse\" setup.

Community Printers is a worker-owned cooperative, like Make Big Things, meaning that everyone who works there democratically owns and runs the business.

We know some people may want to wait to pledge until closer to the end of the campaign for financial reasons. Your payment method will not be charged until the campaign is completed on April 12th, no matter when you choose to pledge. Pledging early is also a big help in creating momentum for the campaign!\nCan I still pledge if you\u2019ve already reached your goal? Absolutely!

Players control a group of Survivors trying to defend their remote mining outpost from a swarm of infected aliens controlled by the game itself. The more experience and power the Survivors earn, the more Xenos invade the facility!\nThis sci-fi interpretation of Zombicide is as sleek as ever, playing fast and furious. The rules have been optimized to reduce setup time and make the game flow quickly, focusing the action on the struggle between the Survivors and the Xenos.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Dark Side / Promo Xenos / Plague Survivor Pack / Orphans Survivor Pack / Kabuki Survivor Pack / Tiles Set / Plastic Token Pack / 3D Plastic Doors / Deck Holders Set / Counter Base Set.\nThe game's character artwork was created by renowned artist Adrian Smith, and brought to life as miniatures by the talented team at BigChild Creatives.\nThe Survivors in the PK-L7 outpost came from all walks of life to aid in the Xenium mining operations, and are divided into two types: Civilians are incredibly resourceful, being able to find useful gear in any room of the facility, on the downside they tend to not be very well protected. Soldiers, on the other hand, usually wear heavy combat armor which give them an edge against the invaders. However, their military training means they'll only find gear in specific Security rooms.\nExplore the Survivors more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres. NOTE THAT MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED. CLICK THE IMAGE TO SEE A HIGH RES ALBUM\nWith some luck, Survivors may be able to use some advanced machines to aid their struggle. If you can find the right remote (or are a tech wiz) you'll be able to control the Falchion Sentry Gun to mow down Xenos, or maneuver the Peacekeeper Bot in coordinated attacks.\nIf they manage to last long enough, Survivors can become formidable fighting machines. The more Xenos they kill, the more experience they get, allowing them to unlock new skills as the game progresses. The equipment they find is arranged in their plastic dashboard, with slots for Hand weapons, armor and other gear that can be carried on the body, and a Backpack to store those things you may not need right now.\nSurvivor plastic dashboard.\nPrototype weapons are amazing silent killing machines, but they require an attached Energy Cell to use.\nSurvivors will need all the help they can get to face the Xeno invasion. These mindless creatures come in several different types. Workers are numerous, but manageable. Hunters are deadly fast predators you need to be always on the lookout for. Tanks can take a beating, and dole out an even worse beating. Keep your distance!\nThe different types of Xenos.\nXeno Worker figures 3D renders.\nXeno Hunter and Tank figures 3D renders.\nCertainly the worst of the Xenos is the hulking Spoiler Abomination! This nightmare can only be put down by concentrating your fire, or literally disintegrating it with Hellfire! Don't be fooled by its size, this thing can run you down when you least expect it. While its spawn cards give it extra activations, it will also leap forward if you ever run out of miniatures. The other Xenos may be threatening, but, make no mistake, this is the last thing you'll see before you die.\nSpoiler Abomination figure 3D render.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the Spoiler Abomination also fills any room it moves into with a terrible alien substance we call Mold. This thing eats through doors and walls, completely destroying the room and changing the layout of the map. This Mold may spawn even more Xenos, but worse yet, if it spreads too far, the base will be irrevocably lost (and so will you). Burn it down before it's too late.\nExplore the Xenos more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nUse a flamethrower to burn that Mold to a crisp before it can consume the base!\nThe base at PK-L7 is all you have. Walking out into the planet's surface may be necessary at times, but it's a dangerous endeavor. You'll need to get an Oxygen tank in the Supply room if you want to walk out the airlock. And you better arm yourself with a melee or energy weapon, since the outside atmosphere keeps bullet weapons or flamethrowers from working.\nThe tiles feature several different Zone types, like Exterior, Oxygen Supply Room, Airlock, Security, and Corridor.\nZombicide: Invader comes with:\n9 Double-sided Game Tiles \n72 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n6 Dice \n125 Mini Cards \n15 Mold Cards \n50 Tokens \n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nThe journey into the unknown doesn't end here!\nThe Zombicide: Black Ops expansion raises the intensity to new heights while bringing new challenges for an elite group of Survivors! The Soldiers of Black Squad can be added to your roster, allowing you to play the game with up to 12 players at the same time!\nThese battle-hardened soldiers have been called in to deal with the situation on PK-L7, and find a base already being consumed by the Mold. The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.\nThe Black Ops tiles feature explosive Xenium Pod Zones.\nThis dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.\nBlack Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 \"Crawley\" Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.\nExtra arsenal for the Black Ops.\nExplore Black Ops more in depth in THIS UPDATE.\nZombicide: Black Ops comes with:\n3 Double-sided Game Tiles \n9 Miniatures \n6 Survivor Plastic Dashboards, Color Bases, and ID Cards \n48 Plastic Trackers \n29 Mini Cards\n10 Mold Cards\n39 Tokens\n1 Rulebook \nMiniatures painted by Ruben Martinez, David Arroba, and Rodrigo Cipres.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China and Thailand, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n\u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 30th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is May 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely.

Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Zombicide: Invader.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

The reason this is is that the reward promos are donated by publishers and they only have the ability to provide a certain number of them to us - roughly 1500. We cant exceed those limits. So we have those limits imposed on all the levels that receive promos.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

But we\u2019re also announcing the next Expansion for Fireball Island: Spider Springs!\nThis new expansion is another island tray, like Crimson Cutlass, but it actually slots into the main island in one of the gaps between the side trays. You still get to it through the caves, but now it interacts with the main island. Specifically, a broken bridge connects them, with an ember marble on it.

The goats destroyed that Troll, and ever since that time shepherds have weaponized their herds to become weaponized monster goats called Gruffs! Gruff is a tactical combat card game where players duel to the death with custom teams of Mutated Monster Goats! Gruff features unique positional and timing mechanics that create a constant state of attack and counter-play.\nStuff of Nightmares is a stand-alone game that is fully compatible with the Gruff rules system and other Gruff games. Stuff of Nightmares provides the same visceral competitive experience as Gruff, but adds a new faction to the game, plushy nightmare goats called The Stuffkin! \n A Brutally Competitive Game- Stuff of Nightmares' combat mechanics create a constant state of counter-play. When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!  \nA Challenging Single Player Game- In Stuff of Nightmares you will be able to battle solo against the trolls that we unlock as stretch-goals in the campaign. Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging! \nAn Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!\nA Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Stuff of Nightmares can support a four-player tournament out of a single box! It also allows for three- and four-player free-for-all matches and a two-vs.-two mode!\n Stuff of Nightmares is a stand-alone addition to the Gruff line of games. The Gruff series has been honored with several awards, including these!\nThe Gruff series has received a lot of praise from the board game media!\n All stretch-goals will be included in the box of the game, so any reward that gives a copy of Gruff: Stuff of Nightmares will include all stretch goals. \n  You can get an extra physical copy of Gruff: Stuff of Nightmares, Rage of the Trolls, Clash of the Battle Goats, Gruff, or the Stuffkin play-mat by adding the amount listed per item to your pledge.

Buy magic items and gems from the Heroes. Smash them into raw materials! Use those materials to craft powerful Artifacts to sell to the dungeon's inhabitants. \nGet 'em Coming and Going. Spend your gold buying loot from the Heroes, then get your gold back by selling them potions and other useless crap.  \nScam to your Advantage. Use Scam cards like Bait and Switch and Sleight of Hand to manipulate the market and get an edge over your opponents.\nMake your Mark.

The Kickbacks Expansion will not be included in the retail version of the game. This $10 Expansion is free to all Kickstarter backers.\n This card entitles you to make the first move in any game of Heroes Welcome that you play.  \nOverview of a Turn\nOn your turn, you choose ONE of the following actions:\n> Run a Shop: Move the Heroes to an adjacent open shop. Run a shift at that shop, which will allow you to buy and sell from the Heroes. When you're done, put a \"closed\" sign on the shop. It can't be used by any other player this round. \n> Visit a Guild: Pick an open Guild and use its action. Guilds are special locations that the Heroes don't visit. Each one provides a special game action, like increasing your crafting skills, or adding a new shop to the city. Like shops, each guild can only be used by one player each round.   \n> Craft for a Monster:  Head over to the workshop to smash your loot into raw materials and craft an artifact for an eager customer. As soon as you're done, the monster will head back to the dungeon to fight the Heroes. This is where the real money is! \n> Call for Round End: Send the Heroes back to the dungeon to get more loot.

Players must decide if they should save tools for an epic late game point swing or grab points now to take an early lead. \nAI Variants: Experience the excitement of Fire in the Library on your own with the solo game or spice up a multi-player match by adding new challengers.\nHistory is burning\u2014take chances, be brave, SAVE BOOKS!\n See the rest of Gameosity's review here. \nYou can see Jeremy's full review here. \n Below is the How to Play video: \n Below is a full playthrough video: \n Below is the How to Play for the solo version: \nEach round of Fire in the Library begins with each player obtaining a turn order card. Turn order cards contain safe and risky spaces for different strategies.\nPlay then moves to the Saving Books phase where each player, in turn order, draws tokens from a bag to see what they save. If you stop, you\u2019ll score points for any books you save and earn points for bravery if you stopped on a risky space. Books will increase in value as Sections of the Library burn down. \nWatch out! Pressing your luck while Saving Books may pull out fire tokens. Pull two fire tokens out\u2014or just one in a risky space\u2014and things will all go up in flames as the fire spreads! Sections of the Library will collapse based on the tokens you pulled during the Saving Books phase if you've pressed your luck too far. This can cause more Fire tokens to be added to the bag, as well as increasing the value of the burned Sections. \nFortunately, not everything is left up to luck. As a resourceful librarian, you have tools at your disposal. You start with two and may gain more during the course of the game. All of the tools provide new options for saving  books, changing the odds, or giving more opportunities to press your luck.\n Once each player has taken a turn, the Round is over and the fire continues to grow.

The most important reason not to wait with Fire in the Library is that we currently have no plans to put this game into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.  \nKickstarter Limited \u2013 Fire in the Library might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions.\nHelp Us Improve Fire in the Library \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the quality of the components and add more content to the game for everyone! \nSubsidized Shipping \u2013  $5 shipping to the USA,  $10 to the EU and Canada and $15 to everyone else. We\u2019re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs. \nDiscounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost. \nEU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT fees for backers. \nMost importantly, without you, Fire in the Library would not get created. We definitely appreciate every backer\u2019s support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Fire in the Library to retailers during the campaign. Back the project for $1, send us a message, and we'll get back to you!

We intend to personally be shipping out the copies that have destinations within the United States. \n To order a second copy of Fire in the Library, add an additional $24 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost. \nI am happy to discuss group orders larger than two copies, but these need to be handled on a country by country basis. Please send me a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nFire in the Library is the third project of Weird Giraffe Games. Super Hack Override was our first project and it was delivered a month early to backers in March 2017.

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others.

Join either the Pan Pacific Defence Corps or the invading Kaiju, and face off in a battle with the ultimate stake: extinction.\nGetting started in Pacific Rim: Extinction is easy; the core set contains everything you need to start playing, including painted ~ 75mm Gipsy Avenger and Shrikethorn miniatures, dice, cards, tokens, buildings, terrain, Hex Gauge measuring tool, poster mat, and more.\nThe Miracle Mile All-In Pledge contains everything you see in the graphic here below PLUS all applicable stretch goals!\nNote too that the Miracle Mile All-in pledge level is only available during the Kickstarter campaign, though all expansions and bundles will be available on the pledge manager.\nExtinction Pledge Level\nThe miniatures of Pacific Rim: Extinction stand between 75-100mm tall, and close attention has been paid to bring the truly larger-than-life appeal of these huge machines and monsters straight to your tabletop!\nWith your support, we can add even more to the game, and offer expansions so you can choose your favourite Jaegers and Kaiju from both Pacific Rim films to bring into battle!\nHelp us break through these goals, and unlock two types of content:\nBonus content sets, which add more cards, components, and customisation options into the core set (and expansions).\nOptional Buys, which you can increase your pledge to purchase (see below for a guide on how to do this). These are full expansions containing new Jaegers or Kaiju.\nIn Pacific Rim: Extinction you\u2019ll be able to customise your force of Jaegers or Kaiju, using the machines, monsters, pilots, and mutations you favour to build up your personalised team! Take a look below to see all of the optional buy Expansions currently available.\nIf you want to expand your game with one or more of these optional buys, all you have to do is click on the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Pacific Rim: Extinction Kickstarter page, which appears once you have made any pledge. Then increase your pledge by the total value of the expansions you would like to purchase.\nFor example, if you have pledged at the standard core set level (which is \u00a335), and you would also like to receive the Saber Athena and Hakuja Expansions, you would click on the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button, and increase your pledge from \u00a335 to \u00a375 (\u00a335+\u00a320+20=\u00a375).\n\nAfter the campaign, we will be using a pledge manager to confirm which expansions you have paid for, so they can be added to your rewards! \nKaiju Red Combat Dice!\nThe Guardian Bravo and Raijin Expansion Sets can be purchased together in the Escalation Bundle for \u00a340, which will also include the Slattern Expansion Set when we unlock its stretch goal \u2013 meaning you\u2019ll be getting 3 expansions for the price of 2!\nCherno Alpha, Crimson Typhoon, and Otachi feature in this bundle. 3 Expansions for the price of 2!\nGipsy Danger is a true Jaeger legend, and a shining beacon of humanities\u2019 strength and courage in the face of insurmountable danger. A veteran fighter, Gipsy Danger\u2019s name has been etched into history for her heroic actions during the Kaiju Wars.\nDouble up on the buildings from the core set with this optional buy.\nGet another full set of dice and an extra hex gauge with this optional buy.\nA close-quarters combat specialist, Saber Athena is the sleekest and most elegant Jaeger ever created. With her ultra-light frame and hyper-tensile muscle strands, she can leap, tumble and kick higher and faster than any other Jaeger.\nA category IV Kaiju, Hakuja can harness the elements of stealth and surprise by plunging into the ground, burrowing beneath the feet of its target to emerge in an explosive surprise attack.\nKnown for her sheer stopping power, Bracer Phoenix is a Mark-5 Jaeger that manages to hold her own among her Mark-6 successors. Because of the complement of artillery she carries, Bracer Phoenix is one of the heaviest Jaegers in the PPDC fleet.\nObsidian Fury poses a unique threat to the PPDC. With an unknown origin, and a configuration and call sign not found in any PPDC database, this titanic mech is capable of moving faster and hitting harder than any Jaeger in the Moyulan fleet.\nOf the Mark-6 fleet, Guardian Bravo is perhaps the most well-balanced unit, capable of fulfilling various offensive and defensive roles. She is fully-equipped with next generation J-Tech weapons and armour.\nRaijin is the second of only two Category V Kaiju ever to be encountered by humanity. Its head possesses unique shield-like plates which act like a monstrous Venus flytrap.\nUnpainted render. Painted version coming soon.\n We will be updating this section to include new videos featuring Pacific Rim: Extinction. We have a lot planned, so more will be added throughout the campaign.\nAlessio Cavatore, one of the game designers, chats to the folks at Beasts of War about Pacific Rim: Extinction.\nTake a closer look at Pacific Rim: Extinction in the \u2018How To Play\u2019 video from Geek & Sundry! We\u2019re really excited to show off more of the game mechanics, and to show things in motion.\nPacific Rim: Extinction can be played with two or more players in either a \u2018Quick Play\u2019 or \u2018Constructed Battle\u2019 format. Quick Play involves using \u2018Quick Play Cards\u2019 which are included in the core set, and contain easy set-up guides so beginner players can focus on the fight without distraction.\nBUILDING YOUR TEAM\nIn Constructed Battle, you\u2019ll be able to fully customise the Jaegers and Kaiju to your own preferences, then pit them against each other in an intense objective-based battle. The Kaiju player chooses the scale of the attack based on the combined Category Rating of all Kaiju in play. This is known as the \u2018Threat Level\u2019. The Jaeger player then builds a PPDC response force. Jaegers, Rangers, and Upgrades all have points values, and the total points of a Jaeger team must be equal to or less than double the Kaiju Threat Level.\n\nThe goal of the game is different depending on which side you choose to fight with. As a Kaiju player, you\u2019ll uncover a secret objective at the start of the game. To win, you\u2019ll need to meet this objective, ideally without revealing what it is to the Jaeger player too early. As a Jaeger player, your goal is to fulfil the PPDC\u2019s task: the protection of humanity. You\u2019ll need to defend cities as Kaiju trample them, and take down the immense invaders.\nThe Jaegers and Kaiju each have their own abilities and customisation options. Using the 'Jaeger Conn-Pod\u2019, \u2018Upgrades\u2019 can be applied to improve the machine\u2019s weapons or other capabilities, while each 'Kaiju Signature\u2019 can be altered with \u2018Mutations\u2019, making the monsters even more dangerous and unpredictable. As they clash, \u2018Action Cards' are used to carry out the attacks and manoeuvres of both sides. Using these tools, the Jaeger and Kaiju must outwit, outmatch, and overcome their opponent.\n\nCONN-PODS AND SIGNATURES\nThe Jaeger Conn-Pod has a  number of key features are labelled in the image: \nJaeger Conn-Pod\n1) Jaeger stats, including Speed, Skill, Power, Armour, and Points values.\n2) Ranger slots, where the Ranger Cards chosen for this battle are placed.\n3) Charge counter, where the current charge of the Jaeger is displayed.\n4) Ammo counter, similar to the Charge counter, this displays the current Ammo.\n5) Structure points, which show how much damage the Jaeger can take before it\u2019s destroyed.\n6) Upgrade slot, where an Upgrade Card is placed. There are many different upgrades that are used to modify and customise a Jaeger.\nThe Kaiju Signature is used like the Jaeger Conn-Pod but by the Kaiju player. It has a number of gameplay relevant features as indicated: \nKaiju Signature\n1) Kaiju stats, including Speed, Skill, Power, Armour, and Category rating.\n2) Rage counter, where the current Rage of the Kaiju is displayed.\n3) Mutation slots, where offensive and defensive Mutation cards are placed.\n4) Structure points, which show how much damage the Kaiju can take before it\u2019s killed.\n5) Kaiju Blue counter, where the current Kaiju Blue level is displayed.\nACTION CARDS\nDuring a game round, players control either Jaegers or Kaiju on their turn by playing \u2018Action Cards\u2019. These represent all-out attacks, cunning tricks, solid defences, secret weapons, and everything else the machines and monsters can do!\nEach miniature has a set of 6 specific Action Cards, with four main features which are labelled in the image: \nAction Cards\n1) The identification, showing which model the card belongs to.\n2) The title of the card, the name of the weapon or ability.\n3) The action(s) you can choose to perform that turn.\n4) The \u2018Damage\u2019, the effect of which varies from card to card. This represents different parts of a Jaeger or Kaiju being hit and damaged.\nDAMAGE\nWhen Jaegers or Kaiju take damage, the player who dealt the damage takes an action card at random from their opponent and reads the Damage section of the card to find out what happens. There's a chance that a critical part of Jaeger machinery, or Kaiju biology, will be struck with massive consequences. The Action Card that was drawn as Damage is then discarded, and cannot be used for the rest of the game. In this way, dealing damage to an enemy not only brings them closer to destruction but can also render weapons or abilities useless.\nWhen a unit takes damage its Action Cards are flipped and discarded.\nWhen a Jaeger or Kaiju has taken Damage equal to their Structure Points total, they are destroyed! If either the Jaegers or Kaiju are all destroyed, the surviving side will have claimed victory, but winning isn't always that simple. If the Kaiju meet their objective before they are all killed, they win the battle and the PPDC will be forced to retreat. Every Scenario and Objective Card will change the way the battle must be fought and won, often drastically.\nKnowing your enemy and accurately predicting their actions will be an invaluable tool in defeating your opponent in Pacific Rim: Extinction. Below, the designers give some tips on how to gain the advantage in the battle:\nTACTICS\nKnow your Hex Gauge. Learning how to move your Kaiju and Jaegers with finesse is a very important skill. When moving, you may move your model up to its Speed value forward and make one pivot. Jaegers can pivot left or right, one Hex side after each move. Kaiju can pivot left or right, one Hex side before or after each move. This means that a Jaeger has to telegraph their moves whereas a Kaiju can be more fluid and react to changing situations better. Either way, learning how quickly you can turn and when to commit to a plan of action is very important!\nFlanking. In a one on one fight it\u2019s hard to get around your foe, but with allies, it can be considerably easier. When attacking a target from the back arc (the three hexes behind it) the target does not get to use their skill to defend, a great way to crack particularly defensive Kaiju! The worst position to be in is sandwiched between two enemies, with no way to turn without presenting your weak spot to someone! Some Jaegers and Kaiju have special abilities that allow them to get out of such sticky situations like Hakuja's burrow - allowing the Kaiju to dig underground and come up in another location. Saber Athena can leap into combat, sliding around her enemies to strike from behind with her special flying knee attack!\nWe will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs.

Your goal is to explore five islands floating around the gravitational force of a mysterious crystal.\nThe game is a carefully crafted fusion of hand-management and area control, with hefty player customization, asymmetric gameplay and a variable scoring system.\nThe area control aspect of the game is based on a dynamic map that is constantly transforming thanks to player action and choice.\nThe shifting game map means that player strategy has to take into consideration the possibility of change just around the corner, creating a new layer of strategic depth to time tested area-control mechanics.\nFor example, a player could suddenly move his entire army by shifting the land beneath them. He could split a rival Champion from his troops, or endanger him by driving him closer to a monster. In Mysthea monsters move and attack abruptly, and are almost invincible when challenging a single Champion. Players must cooperate for a chance to defeat them. These are just a few of the possible strategic outcomes that these mechanics enable.\nPlayers start the game with a small set of cards and they can acquire new ones from a common display during their turn, increasing possibilities and strategies. Each card is unique, making the hand management mechanism the other core aspect of the game. Deciding when and how to use a card is a huge part of Mysthea, since players will collect them back at the start of each new Era. This means that every card can be used multiple times in different ways. This creates a deep and tense tactic and strategic planning, always very different and highly customizable to your favorite play-style.\nDuring gameplay, players will face encounters with two possible paths on a card and will have to choose the one that seems to bring the best outcome for their Champion\u2019s journey. In this image, for example, you could choose to make a surprise attack on a camp, probably influencing other players. Or you could ignore that option to explore the curious crystal structure in the distance, hoping to find something that could empower your Champion. What would you choose?\nPlayers will combat monsters and other players, strategize and perform many other actions during gameplay that can grant endless strategic possibilities. Read our in-depth articles on our website, download the rulebook or watch a video preview to have a complete overview of all the game mechanics and the gameplay experience you can expect from Mysthea.\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\u3067\u3059\nMillenia ago, a planet called Icaion was hit by a giant crystal of unknown origins from the depths of space. With staggering force, the crystal pierced through the celestial body. The impact was so strong that the planet, and the forces governing it, changed forever.\nFast forward thousands of years. A region made of the chunks of land that broke off from Icaion due to the force of impact is now inhabited by a prosperous society. The lands floating above the clouds were named Mysthea by their inhabitants.\nThe shards of the crystals that were scattered across Mysthea have been found to possess great powers, which the people have harnessed to perform incredible feats. The crystals are called Qoam and the inhabitants attune themselves to their unique magnetic field to move them telekinetically. The lands of Mysthea are ruled by a Kingdom, but the King has long since ducked into the shadows of his empire, delegating the management of the state to sovereign Guilds. Each Guild is tasked with representing the interests of a particular part of the population.\nRecently, for the first time ever, humans have managed to create an artefact that is able to amplify the power humans have over the crystals. One artefact for every Guild was created. They were considered tools of immense power and for a while, they were used rarely, mostly in ceremonious circumstances, until one Guild realized that with the aid of the artefact, they could send an explorer to the uncharted islands floating around the Crystal. For the first time in history, they would be able to explore those terrifying, sacred places. They could touch those lands considered holy by some and damned by others.\nThe kingdom buzzed with excitement when each Guild announced that they would fund expeditions, entrusting the artefact to a Champion who would travel to these harsh new lands in hopes of finding great rewards.\nHumans are naturally able to interact telekinetically with Qoam crystals. But, some are more predisposed than others and are able to perform amazing feats. True masters can use Qoam as weapons, weightless to the user and deadly to their enemies, or to create armor stronger than any other worldly material that doesn\u2019t compromise their mobility. Each master has developed a unique and personal use of the crystals, sensing and seeking out shards that vibrate with a frequency that is easiest for them to attune to.\nThe Champions of Ilvash come from different backgrounds, and manifest different abilities when interacting with Qoam. They are highly revered and are able to live off their talent. They sell their services to Guilds or to private citizens. Some think they join the expeditions to the unexplored islands for monetary compensation alone, but each of them have ulterior motives for facing such great dangers.\nDuring the long years since the collision, new life spawned alongside humans. This peaceful, and sometimes advantageous, coexistence between monsters and people is taken for granted by the citizens of Ilvash. But those who have experience in the less inhabited regions outside the city walls know that creatures that are common and cooperative in the city can become aggressive in certain areas of the world. When hit by the energy of the Crystal they transform into mighty and terrifying beasts. \nWant to find out all the details of the game\u2019s lore?

They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content.\nHere is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager.\nClick on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack\n                      The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion\n This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster.

The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become.\nBut when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds.\nThe double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones\nTo better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment:\nA hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills.\nEquipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nFinally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt.\nBat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nA hero setup\nFacing the heroes is one player: the villain.

This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French.

Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $20-$25 to most states.\nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nEUROPE: $20-25 to France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands. $25-35 to Spain, UK, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic and to most other countries.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nBRAZIL: $120-130 to Brazil (including customs and tax fees)\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia. $50-55 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $50-55 to Morocco, $80-85 to South Africa, $140-145 to most other countries.\nDOM-TOM: $60-65 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries:\nCuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

Designed by David Turcziand illustrated by Mihajlo Dimitrievski, Dice Settlers features a modular board, over 40 Technologies to discover, and 51 custom dice.\nDice Settlers comes with a set of 51 custom dice, manufactured using the hot printing technology. This allows us to fully customize the image that appears on each die (and place a piece of Mihajlo's art on each die), which is then printed, and covered in varnish. The final clear coating makes the dice extremely durable - after dozens of plays you will see no wear on your dice.\nEach achievements set provides a number of quality upgrades or new content that can be unlocked during the project. We reveal new parts of each set regularly. For more details, see this update.\nDo you want to know how to play in detail? Check out the RULES or see the game played in the Runthroughs and Reviews section below\n.\nCurious to see the dice rolled?

While realistic resources are supplied by Stonemaier Games (many thanks Jamey for your support) and thus quality is guaranteed, producing quality custom dice is a long process, which will require us to approve samples and then check the final production quality on site, in China.\nEstimated production start date is about 3 weeks after the campaign ends and the lead time for most components is 90 days. The custom dice and all deluxe edition components may add up to 15 extra days, but we're confident that final delivery time will not be affected.\nAs soon as production is over, we will ship containers to our fulfillment centers. Our current plan is to ship rewards from at least 3 different locations. Backers from USA, Canada and Europe will receive their rewards from local fulfillment centres, while everyone else will get their game boxes from Poland. US, EU and Canadian backers will get their game boxes locally, without any taxes. \nShipping charges, listed under each pledge level, will be added in the pledge manager.

Now, during our thirteenth Kickstarter campaign, we already know the ropes, and we have the knowledge and the experience to face any possible challenges in our way.\n\nBackers from Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and most locations in Central America will most likely receive their rewards later than the rest of the backers. Backers from these regions will receive packages from Poland, send via local postal services. These packages are sometimes sent via surface mail, thus it may take up to 3 months for these packages to reach their destinations.\n\nOnce again we will be working with tried and true partners, whose procedures and production cycles we know intimately. Our current partnerships include fulfillment companies in the Europe and North America.\n\nHowever, in the unlikely event of anything going wrong, we have contingencies in place, as well as some spare time to deal with unexpected events. Still, an absolute worst case scenario may add a total of 15 to 30 days to delivery.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nWe are producing, packing and shipping large quantities of games, so there is always a chance of human error or damaging some game components.

Whoever can use their resources and automaton workers to earn the most Prestige when Opening Day comes will go down in history as the founder of the City of Gears.\nCity of Gears starts with 9 random city tiles placed in a 3x3 grid face down, waiting to be discovered.  With 18 different tiles, no two games are ever the same.\nOn their turn, players roll resource dice to gain Gears, Steam and Charges. Gears are used to either give yourself new powers or to make new connections that help you gain access to and control over new parts of the city (see example below).\nSteam can be used to deploy your automaton workers to city tiles.\nCharges can either rapidly move your workers around the city or can be used to destroy opponents' gear links or send opponents' workers back to their factory.\nWorkers on building tiles can activate buildings in the City of Gears, earning clever players a chain reaction of benefits (see example below).\nOnce the city is uncovered, Opening Day creeps closer and development speeds up in the city. The game will end immediately once the third Opening Day gear is drawn from the bag.\nPlayers who control parts of the city when Opening Day hits will earn extra Prestige. Whoever has the most Prestige wins!\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the add-ons are the most confusing thing in terms of pledging since they do not work on a \"cart\" system like everything else does on the internet. In order to \"purchase\" an Add-on, simply add the cost of the add-on(s) you would like to your pledge amount.  \nExample 1: You live in the US and want to add-on the Juggernaut. You simply add $10 to your pledge amount as there is no charge for shipping for this add-on.\nExample 2: You live in Taiwan and you chose the Founders Pledge and would like to add another copy of the Founders Edition and two Juggernaut add-ons. You would add an additional $59 for the game, $2 for shipping and $10 for each Juggernaut, increasing your pledge by $81.\nAt some point after the campaign, we will send you an email with a link to the pledge manager, in here you will \"spend\" that extra money you pledged letting us know what add-ons you wanted before we ship your stuff.\nCost:\n  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.  \nTracking:  \nWe will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \nDelivery time:  \nWhile we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.  \nOther:  \nLastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign?\nWhile we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you a discount off of the $59.99 MSRP planned for this title in the retail version or the exclusive Founders' edition of the game. It also gets you access to exclusive city tiles and any exclusive stretch goals we unlock that won't be available at retail. Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands long before someone can get it from an online retailer. If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to making the first ever board gaming yacht, the Monochromatic Vulpine, a reality (just kidding about the yacht...or are we?).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

The soothing sounds of a gently flowing river. The glow of the moon. A bountiful harvest. Basic human emotions such as fear and rage. Even death. They all have an unseen force guiding them. And while these forces work together to make the world what it is, they each aspire for influence over those who believe in them.\nDesigned by Kolossal's own AJ Lambeth, Kami-sama is a beautiful and intuitive strategy game set in rural Japan during the Edo period. Two to four players will assume the roles of Kami, the spirits of the land. Using a combination of asymmetrical player powers, area control, set collection, pattern building, and light card drafting, players will work to balance their Favor with the people and their connection to Nature in order to be crowned Kami-sama, the chief deity of the land.\n        The Spirit Way add-on expansion introduces four new kami\nDaikono, the kami of radishes\nKari, the kami of the hunt\nKitakori, the kami of ice\nYuma, the kami of dreams\nThese kami introduce new interactive strategies through their unique abilities. Additionally, the Spirit Way expansion includes the Merchant villager, one copy per villager deck, as well as the kami-specific components below.\nThe Awakened expansion will be unlocked upon reaching our first stretch goal. Throughout the campaign, more content will be added to make this a substantial expansion full of diverse content. The Awakened expansion will be an amenity at no additional cost to backers of the game! Further, it will not be available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama.

Though Kolossal is new to the industry, our President - Travis R. Chance - is not. Travis was a founder of Action Phase Games. He is an expert at Kickstarter, funding every game he brought to the platform, including Western Legends, Heroes Wanted, Kodama, and Aeon's End. Our team has spent the last 8 months preparing for the launch of Kami-sama in every way possible.\nThe game is easy to learn while providing interesting and diverse play each game. Combining familiar mechanisms in a unique presentation, we are confident Kami-sama will be in your game collection for years to come.\nThe game is beautifully illustrated by our friends at Gong Studios (Netrunner LCG, Charterstone).\nWe are committed to begin fulfillment of Kami-sama before the game is made available in retail.\nComponents and materials for the game are near completion upon launch. All files will be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within one week after the end of the campaign. This ensures timely delivery to our backers.\nBy backing Kami-sama through this campaign, you will receive - at no extra cost - The Awakened expansion. This expansion will include unlocked Stretch Goal content not available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama. We have many exciting and interactive goals planned for those who are backers of Kolossal's second release!\nHundreds of hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience. Through extensive global internal and open testing, Kami-sama provides a rich gaming experience like no other game out there.\nThe utmost thought and care were taken with regard to the theme and source material for the game. As with all of Kolossal's releases, we strive to show diversity and thoughtfully approach inclusion.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $50 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured.\nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps:\nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page.\nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page.\nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information.

Every backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share.

They use their Up Quarks and Down Quarks to create Protons and Neutrons, and use their Photo (Gamma Ray) cards to create Electrons. \nThey can either use these Subatomic Particles to either:  \n(1) Purchase Subatomic Particle cards that get mixed into a player's starter deck, making it more powerful, like this... \n(2) Build up the atom on their player mat (in order to claim Element Cards, which are what score them points) like this... \nWhen a player claims an Element, they also place two Goal Markers on the board, competing over control for additional end game points. The catch is, you can only place those Goal Markers only on End Goals that do NOT match the Element you just built. \nSo, if you built a Helium, you can place a marker on any End Goal spot except Helium. At the end of the game, you'll get points for End Goals based on the Elements you built during the game IF you have the most or second most Goal Markers on any given End Goal.\nPlayer can also remove weaker cards from their deck (cull their deck) by Annihilating cards from their hand for a cost of 2 energy, like this...\n         Play through the fundamentals of chemistry with Ion and Covalence AND Subatomic!

Players must win clans, either through an interactive bidding process that functions like a silent auction or through using their cards as actions, to take other players clans. Arkon's depth and replay-ability are tied to having cards that can be played in many ways and its use of interpersonal interactions (bidding, bluffing etc.).\n# of players: 2-4\nAverage game duration: 15-30 minutes\nArkon hinges around a few central dynamics. First, cards can be played in multiple ways. Players will constantly be challenged to make tradeoffs as they choose whether to use a card for some sort of advantage, keep it as a counter or use the card for its influence value to win a bid and move the player closer to winning the game. \nNext, Arkon employs a resource system based around silent auction bidding. Because all cards double as influence and winning bids is a key component of your victory condition, Arkon reduces the \"dead card in hand\" phenomenon.\n   \u2022 Unique Resource System: In Arkon, to acquire clans to win the game, you need to bid for them with influence. What this creates is a dynamic where players on all turns are looking at what they want to bid for and what they are willing to give up in terms of actions.\n\u2022 Pacing: After talking with our play testers, one of the most unique elements they highlighted was pacing. Most strategy card games are linear. You gather more resources, develop your engine and that creates momentum towards the victory. Arkon manages to have non-linear gameplay, while still making the win condition skill based through the multi-use cards. \n\u2022 Portable: With 52 cards and only one central deck, Arkon fits inside of a tuck box and can be played anywhere! \n \u2022 Stunning Art: Although there is a lot of visually beautiful games out there, we think Arkon delivers an incredibly high level of art for a small-box game, and we are really proud of that. We have top end artists and designers that have worked on games from Magic the Gathering to Game of Thrones TCG. \n\u2022 Replay Value:  One of the core focuses while building and testing Arkon was replayability. We play tested the game extensively, with over 200 external blind tests taking place at local gaming stores and meet-ups across California. If you look at reviews on BoardGameGeek from those who have played, we were blown away by the positive feedback! \n In Arkon players assume the role of a mysterious outsider who claims to be a fabled mystic from long ago. You enter the world of the Wildlands during a time of great unrest, where war and mistrust have sown deep divisions across the continent. As you wield your influence to amass support, you must choose\u2026.will you use that power to bring unity amongst the clans of the Wildlands... or will you seek domination....?\nRead more on the lore...\n                                             This tier is going to come with some pretty epic loot. First off, each backer will receive a custom etched wooden box with a deeply detailed engraving of the Wildlands world map on the lid. In addition, we will laser etch your name and backer # (or whatever phrase you prefer) on the inside.\nBelow are some shots from our early prototypes! These will continue to be refined as we play with modifications to the fine details to make this as crisp as possible in the final. THESE ARE NOT FINAL.\nOn top of that we will include a unique, brand new card in a speciality golden card border.

This kickstarter represents the culmination of 2 years of work on my gaming companies first product. Through ups and downs, managing of a 9 person team, and thousands of hours, we produced a tabletop game that I think is both beautiful and strategically deep. I was blessed to have the opportunity to work with my family and on something I believe in and for that I am immeasurably grateful.\nThis section is called, \u201cOur Story\u201d but really, I would love to tell you all about what I learned, why it matters and how that has shaped what we built.\nFirst, when you are working tirelessly on a project that is your baby, your interminable obsession, understand and respect that your team is not always going to be as obsessed as you. This is okay. These are people that are helping turn your vision into reality, and without them I would of never had the beautiful art, videography, cartography and graphic design that is in the game today.\nChoose something you care about. For me, gaming represents an amazing way to share a communal experience with people. In a game it doesn\u2019t matter your age, your religion, your race, your politics, your gender, your orientation or your income. It\u2019s about getting together over something common to all of us: a desire to have fun.\nSurround yourself with good people. This is easily the most important thing. Entrepreneurship is just flat out hard.\nListen to your playtesters. We playtested this game all across California and for well over a year. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it was harsh (especially at the beginning). Each time we recorded specific feedback on sheets and looked for trends and thus things we could improve. The best feeling in the world was going to our last dozen playtests and realizing that all our iterations and balancing had paid off with a game that was more interactive and more strategic.\nLearn that things will go wrong. Packages will get lost. The manufacturing will mis-cut prototypes. Your artists will ask for more money because you tell them to re-do something. Note that #1 this is inevitable and #2 when it comes to your team, take accountability. Your artist didn\u2019t screw up, you screwed up by not giving a detailed and nuanced enough description of what you wanted. Learn and grow from it.\nAll of these lessons went into shaping what Arkon is. I know you all have a lot of choices when it comes to games. I deeply appreciate you taking the time to look at Arkon, and I hope you will consider our game as an edition to your collection.\n If you are an retailer, with a verifiable brick and mortar presence, please contact us at admin@arkongame.com for bulk pricing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter and as such, there is always the possibility of delays.

Doctor Babylon, LEGION\u2019s head of technology and development, has unlocked the secrets of the cosmic power source Dark Matter and plans global armageddon. In the wake of LEGION\u2019s ascendance, a crack-shot team of hand-picked agents known as MAYHEM emerges, whose sole purpose is to destroy LEGION and take the world back. Will you use LEGION\u2019s Dark Matter-powered doomsday devices and super-weapons to wreak havoc on Seoul: The City of Tomorrow or will you join the band of gadget-wielding misfits to dish out some MAYHEM?\n\nAgents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is a team vs. team skirmish boardgame for 2 to 4 players. The game is played on a modular 3D board that is fully destructible. You and your opponents will play through a radiant story where every choice you make will have effects that ripple throughout the campaign. Play as either LEGION, an organization of super villains who have taken over the world, or as MAYHEM, a band of anti-heroes who will do what ever it takes to stop LEGION.\nIn every game, use the modular tiles to set up an entirely new cityscape in near-future Seoul, Korea!\n3D BOARD! - Play on a board made of modular tiles with 3D multi-level buildings that are up to 240mm high! Use the buildings as cover or to dodge an attack by jumping behind a wall. Take the high ground to gain elevation advantages and attack bonuses against your enemies. The modular tiles allow you to make hundreds of different game maps.\nLEGION troopers have surrounded a building in which they suspect a MAYHEM agent is holed up. Why storm the building and risk injury? Lets just blow the dang thing up and pick up MAYHEM souvenirs!\nDestructible Terrain - You can drive enemies from behind cover by triggering explosions. These explosions and your attacks will often cause damage to a building which will eventually cause it to collapse.\nPictured are MAYHEM's Fortune character and one of LEGION's Swarm Troopers!\nUnique Characters - Every MAYHEM and LEGION character has their own highly detailed miniature and a Character Board that outlines their stats and abilities. Each character has a unique gameplay style and you will have to choose the right team for each mission. Finding the right combination of characters and tactics is half the fun of Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon. The other half is blowing stuff up!\nHollywood's Character Board shows all of his abilities, actions, upgrades and gadgets. Between games you can upgrade the character board.\nCustomizable Characters - Customize your characters before each mission with an arsenal of gadget cards that slide into their Character Board and Mayhem Cards that let them unleash crazy and hilarious powers.\nHere new hard won Gadgets are added to Fortune's character board.\nCharacter Progression - After every game, you will have the opportunity to unlock new Gadgets and buy upgrade tiles for your characters. Upgrades stay permanently in the character\u2019s board until you decide to reset the game.\nFast Skirmish Gameplay and Tactics - Alternate taking turns with your opponent in quick game play that keeps you involved at all times. On your turn, you take actions with one of your characters while your other characters regenerate some of their resources. There is no downtime and you fluidly take turns back and forth until the Mission ends.\nBackstrikes and Flanking Fire\nAimed Attacks\nHeight Advantage\nA close up of a game in progress. Fortune goes for the loot while Hardtack keeps Gaunt busy!\nStory Campaign - Play through an immersive campaign with a radiant storyline. Decisions you make have ripple effects that impact your future missions, assets, and abilities. Every group\u2019s experience is unique in an open world that can branch into dozens of different story-lines full of humor and awesomeness with hundreds of ways to win.\nHumor - Agents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is full of over the top action and humor.

Now play solo or cooperatively with your friends against Athena as either MAYHEM or LEGION. \nThe Solo Ad-On will be shipped in a second wave three months after Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon has been shipped. This delay is necessary, since we estimate an additional total of 520 man hours to program the AI deck. A nominal shipping fee will be added during the survey.\nAfter saving the world in Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hell, Johnny Gat is back for more action and incredible campaign story lines!

When we were approached to develop a board game utilizing our military tactical engines, we were taken aback. But the more we thought about it, the more excited we became about the near future Agents of Mayhem world. We decided to go for it and founded our new Sci-Fi and Fantasy division - Apollo Games!  \nWe have applied all of our award winning experience into the over-the-top and humorous Anti-Hero vs Super Villain theme of Agents of Mayhem. Now you will need to utilize real world military combined arms tactics to succeed, even if you can jump over buildings, stop the bad guys with your looks, or conjure up monsters from the earth! On top of this, we have developed a campaign system like no other board game, in which every decision you make can affect you in the future. \nShipping will be charged during your post-Kickstarter campaign survey on which you will fill in your shipping address.

Our last two projects 'Mare Nostrum - Empires' and '878 Vikings' were so successful, that we unlocked all of our stretch goals. 878 Vikings English language games began shipping only 3 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Online Forum and BoardGameGeek ratings and comments are very high and positive.\n\n'Pride of Babylon' is 100% developed and project managed in the USA.

We will only be producing this game in English to speed up and simplify production and delivery. \n\nAs with every project, there can be unseen issues that can crop up.

Did you miss your chance to play it when the original edition was available? Did you play a friend's copy and can't understand why it ever went out of print? Did you play your own copy into ragged pieces like we did? Whichever one of those is true, or if this is your first look at the game, welcome to the campaign! It is a dream come true for us to bring this game from Jarratt Gray and Carl de Visser back to gamers everywhere!\nEndeavor: Age of Sail is a strategy board game set in the historic Age of Sail. Starting out in the crowded hub of Europe, you must struggle to dominate at home while sending ships to the closed regions of the world... and be ready to seize control when they open up! You'll compete to grow the most successful empire through a smooth combination of:\narea control (capture key cities and the routes that join them!)\nresource collection (get the assets to build your empire!)\nengine-building (construct the buildings to power your strategy!)\naction management (use your population and trade tokens wisely!)\nThe elegant gameplay is driven by five different actions (Occupy, Ship, Draw, Attack, and Payment), and five different attributes (Industry, Wealth, Culture, Influence, and Glory):\nThe way you build, combine, and manage those elements creates your empire. Your challenge will be to navigate the maps of the world as they unfold, and write the history books so that the Age of Sail describes your victory!\nFor a detailed description of gameplay, see the How to Play section below. \n      Endeavor: Age of Sail preserves everything about the original edition that you know and love. The satisfying pacing which begins briskly but grows richer and deeper with every turn, the always-interesting breadth of the choices available to you, that feeling of the world unfolding as the game progresses, it's all still there. And it's all driven by that surprisingly lean ruleset which draws its complexity from the interactions and tensions that it creates. So how did we improve on this? Let's take a look:\nExploits are the major new gameplay addition unique to Endeavor: Age of Sail. Sure you can play the game without them (and for your first play you probably should), but once you play with them you'll never go back!\nIn each game you'll deal out three random Exploits (or choose three you enjoy playing with). Like the regions of the world, Exploits are locked at the start of the game. Each Exploit is a historical event from the era that is related to two of the regions on the board. When both of those regions are opened during the game, that Exploit becomes unlocked, and players may now begin interacting with its unique mechanisms and scoring opportunities.\nFor example, the Spanish Main Exploit is related to North America and South America. When those regions open up, that means that the Spanish Main is now occurring in the story of our game. Players may now use the Exploit's actions to Fortify their cities using the provided tokens (making them costlier for foes to attack), and once they've fortified, can trigger a powerful mid-round payment of workers back home! In addition, a new scoring opportunity opens up. Amazing! \nEach Exploit comes with its own immersive new abilities and strategic possibilities, and the game includes all of the special components that are needed to carry them out. This exciting variety of possible Exploit combinations means that every game will drive player interest towards different regions of the world, and create new pathways to victory even for seasoned veterans!\nPlayers command major seafaring empires during the historical Age of Sail. You have your own player mat, where you track your empire\u2019s attributes, construct buildings that permit you actions in the game, and gather Asset cards to build your attributes and gain Glory!\nEach round, you\u2019ll construct one building (based on your Industry level), gain population (based on your Culture level), pay workers to free up buildings (based on your Wealth level), take actions, then manage your cards (based on your Influence level).\nAt the start of the game, player actions are mostly limited to interacting with Europe; using your population to activate your own buildings, you\u2019ll draw Asset cards to increase your abilities, and occupy Cities to gain their Glory and assets, and to control the valuable links between them.\nSoon enough, you\u2019ll construct buildings that permit ship actions, and this allows you to reach out to the closed regions of the world. By shipping to a region, you can begin drawing cards from that region; when its shipping track is filled up, the valuable Governor card is awarded and the region becomes open. An open region\u2019s Cities and links can be competed over just like Europe\u2019s.\nEventually players will run out of room to expand, and if you\u2019ve built buildings with attack actions, you\u2019ll be able to engage in combat. Drive your opponents from the cities they\u2019ve claimed, to deny them the city\u2019s Glory points and to break up their network of profitable trade routes!\nOnce seven rounds have passed, the game comes to an end and scores are tallied. You\u2019ll earn Glory for:\nHow well you\u2019ve improved your four attributes (Industry, Culture, Wealth, and Influence)\nThe Cities you occupy and the links you control\nGlory symbols on your cards and buildings\nSpecial scoring opportunities from this game\u2019s Exploits\nThe player whose empire has accumulated the most Glory wins! \n           Tom's Playthrough\n Tom's Final Thoughts\n       ...plus glowing praise for the original edition of Endeavor:\n\"A very elegant design with easy to grasp, easy to teach mechanisms. Rich choices of actions on a rapidly evolving world map. No randomness beyond initial setup. Plenty of strategy and tactics packed into a 75 minute play time window. A definite 10 after repeat playings. Bravo!\"\n~Thorwolf (bgg user)\n\"A fantastic game - just the perfect level of depth for non-gamers to grasp reasonably well, but plenty of room for strategizing as well! Well done to the designers! So many paths to victory - and each so beautifully balanced.\"\n~superbgg (bgg user)\n\"I was surprised at how simple Endeavor is. It looks so thinky and complex, but the game play is actually quite easy. What sets it apart is the uniqueness of its mechanics and how it covers its historical theme in a way that is much more complete and accurate than most games with the \"Age of Discovery\" theme.

Werewolves, Vampires, and other shadowy creatures reach out in the night to tear apart your people. But never fear, new Citizens have joined the fray - some specializing in taking out these dark creatures! \nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale brings in a whole new set of Citizens, Monsters, Domains, and Dukes that you can play stand-alone using components from the base game, or mix with card stacks from the base game and previous expansions for all new experiences.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Expansion Pack #6: RELICS  \nIn Expansion Pack #6: RELICS, you'll discover a whole new mechanic that will give you a slight edge during certain actions. During setup, shuffle up the Relics and give one to each player. Each Relic has a unique power. During the game, use your Relic to get bonus actions or discounts on performing actions to amplify your progress in the game.  \nThe Relic expansion pack will NOT be available through retail. It will be available at conventions and possibly at the BGG Store. \nWe have several Relic cards planned as Stretch Goals. So, the more money we raise, the more limited exclusive content you will receive as our thank you to all of our backers.\nGame Setup with New Content\n  Valeria: Card Kingdoms is a fast-paced card and dice game that will have you and your friends slaying monsters, recruiting citizens, and expanding your domain.\nIn Valeria: Card Kingdoms, 1 to 5 players compete to build the greatest kingdoms in about 30-45 minutes.\nMonster Card Anatomy\nDark monsters have risen to terrorize the kingdom of Valeria. Use Strength to slay minions like pesky Dire Rats... and titans like the mighty Darkstalker... to earn rewards. Then, defeat the boss in each area to clear the land and earn rewards based on the amount of monsters you've killed in that area.\nCitizen Card Anatomy\nPlayers start with 1 Peasant and 1 Knight. Throughout the game you and your friends will use Gold to recruit a tableau of loyal citizens like the hard-working Lumberjack... the blessed Exorcist... or the Hunter. In a single game, there are 10 different citizens to choose from, and with the Shadowvale expansion, you'll have a total of 32 alternate citizen types to create nearly endless combinations and challenges. No two games will be alike.\nDomain Card Anatomy\nOnce you've recruited the right combination of citizens, you can buy powerful domains like Karloff Castle - that gives you strength equal to the size of your army, or King Tower - that lets you give another player magic to gain a Victory Point. \nDuke Card Anatomy\nEach player drafts a Duke or Duchess card at the start of the game, giving you secret ways to score bonus Victory Points. Follow the wishes of your patron and you may find yourself basking in the glory of victory.\nRelic Card Anatomy\nWith the new KS Limited Exclusive expansion pack, RELICS, you'll also draft a powerful Relic that will give you a small advantage performing certain actions in the game.\n  35 New Monster Cards in 5 New Monster Stacks\n  60 New Citizen Cards (10 Stacks Of 6 Cards Each)\n  20 New Domain Cards\nAll of the content above will be in the retail version of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale along with all necessary divider cards to merge everything into your original Valeria: Card Kingdoms box.\nUNLOCKED!\nWe've unlocked the following content thanks to all of our backers: \n5 Domain Cards - Martin Road, Opera House, Laborium, Legendre's Keep, Ancient Tomb\n2 Event Cards - Good Omen, Blessed Lands\n12 Citizen Cards - Alt. Knight, Alt Peasant\nWe also decided to include a Warden for the Undead Samurai monster stack! \nThe Missing Warden Now Included!\n  10 Relic Cards\nFor backers, the RELICS expansion pack will be included inside of your box of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale. The expansion pack will include a divider card. The RELICS expansion pack will NOT be available at retail, but will be available at conventions or the BGG store.\nUNLOCKED!  \nWe've unlocked the following content thanks to all of our backers:\n5 Relic Cards - St.Aquila's Statue, Staff of Urdr, Dragon Orb, Philosopher's Tome, Lich Sword.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms and all expansions are in world wide distribution. Please ask your local FLGS to order them for you. That being said, we do have some stuff that won't be available at retail (unless those Retailers are backers). \nAdd an additional $20 to receive the Big Box.\nDepending on which printing of Valeria: Card Kingdoms your copy is from and, and how many of our previous expansions and expansion packs you have, and whether or not you sleeve your cards, it is quite possible that the cards from Shadowvale will not fit inside your original Valeria box. Also, we're not done expanding Valeria: Card Kingdoms and you can look forward to more added content in the future.\nPlease read the FAQ to determine your card storage needs.\nIf you are running out of space, we're making a Big Box that will hold more and giving you a set of dice and an enamel coin to replace the boring First Player token. We've updated the plastic insert inside to hold more and the Mico will be working on a unique piece of art for the cover. \nValeria: Card Kingdoms comes with lots of wooden tokens and multiplier chits to use if you run out, but some folks want all their resource tokens to be wood, so we are offering an add-on pack of 140 additional wood tokens.\nAdd an additional $12 to receive more tokens.\nAdding extra tokens might affect the storage capacity of your original box, so you might also want to consider the Big Box add-on.\nThe original version of the Playmat is sold out. We've decided to make a new bigger version that takes into consideration the Agents expansion pack. The artwork is in progress and will be based on the Big Box image. We're leaning towards just a huge white dragon. \nAdd an additional $25 to receive the new playmat.\n                                                     Dice Tower Approved!\n                                                  Click to try out the Shadowvale cards on Tabletop Simulator!\n                                                                                                                                            Once again, Schwerkraft-Verlag, Pixie Games, and Crazy Pawn Games will be joining us on this print run! You can back here for those languages and they will be delivered to you by them in your language (to certain countries).\nSchwerkraft-Verlag - Germany and Austria.\nPixie Games - France and Belgium.\nCrazy Pawn Games - Spain.\n          Rewards will be customs and VAT friendly for all of the major shipping regions: US, CA, EU, UK, and AU. If you're just getting the English Shadowvale expansion, your rewards will ship directly from China. If you're getting Shadowvale in any other language, or if you are adding on the Big Box, your rewards will ship from a regional hub or from that language's production partner.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.  \nWe ask that you commit to at least 1 case (12 games), but we only ask you for $1 until we are ready to ship out the games to backers. At that point, we will invoice you for $149 (wholesale price) and you will receive a discount on shipping. If you would like to be included, we ask that you back the campaign for $1 and email David at david@dailymagicgames.com. We will ship only to stores in the US, or to foreign stores with a freight forwarder with a US address.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule, its own budget for production and marketing expenses, and it's own timeline for funding, production, and delivery. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively.  \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...  \nFood Truck Champion shipped to all backers and will be in retail in February. \nSailing Toward Osiris is in final assembly and we expect to deliver it to backers 1 month late, in March 2018. Sailing Toward Osiris will be produced in English, German, French, and Spanish. Sailing Toward Osiris will debut at Origins 2018 and be released to retailers in June 2018. Available for pre-order.\nCrabs! is at the printer and we expect to deliver Crabs! to backers in March 2018 and to be on retail store shelves by July 2018. Available for pre-order.\nHorizons is at the printer and we expect Horizons to be delivered to backers in July 2018, debut at GenCon 2018, and hit retail stores in August 2018. Available for pre-order.\nSarah\u2019s Singularity did not fund on Kickstarter and is back into redevelopment. \nAlchemea, by Ian Stedman and illustrated by Claire Donaldson, is a reimagining of Ian's game, Magnum Opus. It is in beta testing.  \nCorsairs: A Valeria Adventure, by Wouter van Strien and Isaias Vallejo, illustrated by The Mico, was inspired by Wouter's game Wacky Pirates. During development, Corsairs evolved into a more strategic game than the original and is in beta testing.  \nSpaceways, by Philip duBarry and illustrated by The Mico, is a sci-fi pick-up and deliver / area control game set in the Horizons universe. This stand-alone sequel is in beta testing.  \nChocolatiers, by Isaias Vallejo and illustrated by Claire Donaldson, is a gateway game where players take on the role of chocolatiers boxing chocolates in crowd-pleasing arrangements. It is in beta testing and you can download the PNP at BoardGameGeek.  \nThieve's Den, by Alice Davis and illustrated by Denis Martynets, is a unique blend of card drafting and worker placement set in the world of 10 Minute Heist. It is in beta testing.  \nWe're hoping that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support Shadowvale, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up. By the way, if you'd like to help us with any of our alpha or beta testing, please send us an email at contact[at]dailymagicgames[dot]com.\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.  \nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer  \nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer  \nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer  \nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner  \nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer  \nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, King's Forge, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge, Villages of Valeria, Quests of Valeria, Merchants of Araby, Go Nuts For Donuts, 10 Minute Heist), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games: Sunrise City, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Villages of Valeria, and Quests of Valeria.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design files for Shadowvale are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delived. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Premium PNP Files", "descp": "Full-art, full-res, full-color Premium Print 'N Play PDF files.\nINCLUDES:\nPNP Valeria: Card Kingdoms\nPNP Flames & Frost\nPNP Shadowvale\nPNP Exp.

A mysterious outbreak has claimed the lives of nearly everyone there... what's worse is they are crawling the stores and commons as Zombies hungry for flesh. Only a few Survivors remain. Are you among the Survivors? Or are you one of the ravenous Zombies? The choice is yours in Tiny Epic Zombies!\nArm your Meeples for Survival with...\nBazooka and Katana included in Deluxe games only. Additional items unlockable through stretch goals.\n   Tiny Epic Zombies is a 30 minute, 1-5 player, game of survival that features 5 distinct play modes:\n1. Cooperative team-play with game controlled Zombies.\n2. Cooperative team-play with Zombies controlled by a non-team player.\n3. Competitive free-for-all with game controlled Zombies.\n4. Competitive free-for-all with Zombies controlled by a player.\n5. Solo.\nIn Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.\nWhy Back This Project? \nGreat Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action. Variable survivor and Zombie powers, and several objectives, keep you playing time and time again.\nGenerous Discount!

However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \n  GENERAL INFO: 1-5 players, 30 minutes, 5 play modes including competitive and cooperative play.\nTHEME: Modern day Zombie outbreak at the Echo Ridge Mall.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable, and tons of replayability. Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!\nWIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.\nOVERVIEW: Simplicity shines in Tiny Epic Zombies. \nBased on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.\nExample Survivor:\nNote: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.\nIf you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.\nAs a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! However, due to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

This new board game, designed by Adam Kwapi\u0144ski, is the result of a collaboration between Awaken Realms (creators of This War of Mine: TBG, The Edge: Dawnfall and Lords of Hellas) and Rebel (creators of Drako, Dream Home and K2) . It's a 1-5 players semi-cooperative Sci-Fi horror where you and your friends try to survive while attempting to fulfill your secret objectives that may sometimes collide. It will also enable full co-op as well as solo play experience. \nNemesis offers one-of-a-kind gameplay, that you currently won't find anywhere else in the board game world. It has been in professional development for over three years, so it already plays very well, provides good balance and contains a multitude of interesting mechanics, as proven by the prototype reviews below. \n\nIf you like Sci-Fi survival settings and ships swarming with alien life forms, you will love it - and if that genre was never on your radar, this game is likely to change your mind! \nBy backing this project on Kickstarter you will get all unlocked Stretch Goals for free to every Core Box! \n        Click to see details about sundrop\n                   *Out of all reviews / movies two were paid: Cardboard Rhino (rules presentation / tutorial how to play that took a lot of time to make!) and Man vs Meeple (which is a preview showing the game in detail). All other videos were not paid. \n Asymmetric crew members \n                                                                                                       During the game, you will control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. Soldier on the other hand... \nYour characters complement each other and will need to collaborate in order to survive. There's one catch: you are never sure who can you trust! \nCinematic experience\nYou drift back from the cold void of the hyper sleep. At first, you only feel a tingling in your mouth and a taste of your blood, but soon all the other symptoms hit you. Your head is exploding. Your stomach is turning. A strange noise rings in your ears. This sound is loud, piercing. An alarm!\nFighting through dizziness, you open your eyes, the lights of other hibernation chambers blinding you momentarily. Broken glass. Wet floor. A stasis pod burst open like a ripe watermelon, dripping with red. The thing inside was once your friend. Now it barely resembles a human, ripped open from the inside - damage too severe for a simple stasis pod failure. You raise up and check if your other mates are all right. The good news is: they are. You all gather in the middle of the room, shivering, half-naked. The bad news is\u2026 plentiful. Ship stuck in the middle of nowhere. Many systems damaged. Bulkheads breached. Unknown contaminants in the air. You also hear noises in the hollow halls of the ship. You\u2019re not alone! \n\nPlaying Nemesis will take you into the heart of Sci-Fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A hacker breaks into ship\u2019s navigational system and enables self-destruction. A pilot sets the alien nest on fire, while his friend seals himself in the control room. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. All this \u2013 and other memorable actions \u2013 await! \nShip exploration\nOne of most important parts of Nemesis gameplay is exploration. Every room of the ship may contain useful items and enables a different special action, from activating fire extinguishers to cutting out infected tissue. This makes it necessary to reveal as many room tiles as possible. But beware, while searching for a proper room, you will make noise that may draw some uninvited guests. \nShip's layout is randomized before each game, so you are never sure what to expect behind next corner... \nUnique combat \nThis game is more about surviving than killing. When you face horrors from outer space, you may panic, and even if you manage to put up a fight, you will never know how much punishment your opponent can take. Killing intruders is a tough challenge, especially since ammunition is a rare commodity on the ship. \nEvolving Intruders \nJerry, big news! We\u2019ve received the first transmission with some preliminary data. It seems it\u2019s an auxotrophic, anaerobic, mineral-based trans-dimensional life form (what a mouthful). No DNA, XNA or anything else we could expect. Instead, a strange self-propagating crystalline structure. Outer skin layer? Pure Lonsdaleite! We've never seen more than few grains on Earth, and this thing is covered in it! Fifty percent tougher than diamond, go figure. \nIt sheds this outer skin during each development cycle, thanks to a violent thermochemical reaction. But that's not the worst part. You've heard about this research into weird crystals with a structure partially hidden in other dimensions? Well, our guys say these creatures employ a similar process. Much of their growth happens... elsewhere. Then, when they gather enough energy, they shift modified organs and body structures back into this world. The may also be native to deep space, as they survive vacuum well enough to put Tardigrades to shame. Anne also believes they\u2019re an extremely adaptable omnivore. Sounds scary, right? I hope the top knows what they\u2019re doing with this one.\nIntruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. \nTime pressure\nEncroaching enemies are not the only thing that pushes you to work faster. The ship is already counting down to the emergency hyper-jump. If you fail to repair the engines before that happens, or if the jump catches you outside of your stasis pod, extreme acceleration is going to turn your character into a red splatter on one of the walls. \n\nWorld and design \nWe've reached for the stars. Asteroid mining was booming. Colonies on Mars and Venus approached self-sufficiency. Then, a wanderer came from far depths of the universe at half the speed of light. It glanced the Earth's moon, ripped it apart, threw out of its orbit, and caused catastrophic damage below. Solar system plunged into crisis.  \nStill, many chose to focus on profit, as the residue from the impact contained unknown minerals and exotic matter that made our plain old asteroids seem boring. Obsolete spaceships, previously used for colonizing the solar system, were refitted and crewed by people desperate enough to spend years in vast spaces between the stars, hunting for the next big catch. They became whalers of deep black, scavenging for comets, asteroids, dead proto-planets, and other strange objects coming from far corners of the universe.  \nClick to see full Intruder design\nMany disappeared. It was to be expected. Intercepting unknown objects at incredible speeds was not exactly safe. Then, there are rumors at least one crew found something they were not supposed to...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully finished 3 Kickstarter projects. While the Nemesis campaign goes live, we're in the middle of shipping the first wave of Lords of Hellas game. Soon after the end of this campaign, we estimate to start the shipping of The Edge: Dawnfall, which was delayed.\n\nThese two projects at this stage are managed production and delivery team, while Nemesis is on creative stage, so they do not collide. \n\nWe are confident about the delivery of the game - we have accumulated vast experience working on other titles and projects. The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. Even though the bulk of design work is already completed, as proven by many reviews, Nemesis is a huge and complicated title, and in pursuit of great quality it might take more time to complete. \n\nPlease note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed.

Of course this won't be a quiet night of relaxation! Gamble, brawl and drink the night away as you prove you have what it takes to keep up with the heroes you handle night after night. The Red Dragon Inn 7 can be combined with all of our previous releases, letting you mix up the characters (and the mayhem) for games with four or more players!\nIf this is your first time joining us, we suggest you check out our introduction to The Red Dragon Inn series of games here:\nClick this header to learn more about The Red Dragon Inn\n  For those of you returning to us from previous campaigns, we have some exciting news: The Red Dragon Inn 7 campaign is unique in that we are featuring no funding stretch goals. All game content is unlocked from Day 1!\nSo instead of stretch goals or social media achievements, we're just going to lump all the unlocked stuff into what you can pledge for RIGHT now. Check out the bonus content you're getting for just showing up:\nInstead of unlocking Promo Drink Cards with Social Media Achievements, we're just going to include 2 New Promo Drinks in the rewards for every backer getting a copy of the game!\nInstead of using Funding Goals to unlock them, we're going to include 2 New Drink Coasters and a bunch of New Drinks baseline in all copies of RDI7.\nDrink cards and example coasters for scale.\n  Kickstarter is giving us the opportunity to release multiple variant editions of the game giving long time fans a chance to save some cardboard with our unique ECO editions and uber-fans a swanky collector's edition filled with fun extras.\nShipping: Rewards are all shipping from the United States and Canada. Unfortunately we can only offer reduced shipping to some other international regions. Backers from regions outside of the United States and Canada are responsible for their own customs and import duties.\nDrink Coasters: Last year we introduced some fun new swag to our Organized Play prize pool. Seeing as how this set is intimately tied to our beloved tavern, we decided to come up with two new ones just for this game! The Collector's Edition will include a set of 4 different ones that were previously available through Organized Play.\nShown coasters are included in the Collector's Edition.\nPromo Drinks: Our promo drinks have been wildly popular and we've been listening to your feedback. We are including 2 new Kickstarter Promos that will be in all backer rewards. The Collector's Edition will also include 2 new Promo Drinks that will be released later on in 2019 or thereafter for other promotions plus an additional 4 reprints that were never offered on Kickstarter before!\nShown promos are the reprints included in the Collector's Edition.\nMetal Turn Marker: Finally, the Collector's Edition Metal Turn Marker will be brand new, thicker and have enamel inlay. All befitting the gravity of the hallmark drink it'll represent: Dragon's Breath Ale!\nSample turn markers and the new draft courtesy of Campaign Coins. Click here to check out their other cool stuff!\n  ECO Edition: The Eco Edition is a great way to save a little money and enjoy a smaller carbon foot print. This edition comes in a much simpler lower production value box with no plastic insert. This box is designed to get your your game in one piece and be disposed of with as little hassle and impact as possible.\nThe plain white ECO RDI6 box compared to a standard RDI4 box.\n  Throughout the campaign we will be revealing each of the new characters joining the party as well as spoiling their mechanics and story.

Furthermore, our artists are human and human stuff may come up that knocks them off schedule.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have worked with our manufacturer for a very long time now. We have a great relationship with them and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, unforeseen problems can arise.\n\n3.

It is designed completely with open-market components allowing for customization of board features for specific applications. Central to this platform is a family of community supported system-on-chips.\nTritium 2GB Prototype Back Side\n* shared hardware form factor, not boot and Linux kernel compatibility \nTritium vs Raspberry Pi 3 Comparison Chart\n  Tritium can be used to tinker with electronics such as Arduino, teach programming in a variety of languages, build media centers with up to 4K video playback, create digital signage solutions, play popular retro games, establish bi-directional video calls, interface with amateur/ham radio, and many other possibilities. It is available in 512MB 32-bit 1080P, 1GB 32-bit 4K30, and 2GB 64-bit 4K30 configurations while utilizing the large existing collaborative hardware ecosystem for Raspberry Pi so  that creators to build more new and exciting products and services.\n  Once again, we're collaborating with Baylibre to get Tritium fully supported in mainline Linux. Baylibre specializes in development for Linux-based devices, including Android and Yocto operating systems. Their team of Linux Kernel maintainers and Android experts know how to work with the community to provide long-term support and bring products to market. We're excited to continue to support the impressive upstream work that they do so well.\nWhy is this project important?\nThe Libre Computer Project is a brand rather than a manufacturer. We carefully select manufacturing partners and designs to make sure that the platform as a whole will meet our requirements for open-source support and maintenance. We shy away from proprietary interfaces, vendor lock-in, and \"secret saucy\" magic because we feel strongly that those things are only redundancies hindering progress.\nWe are expanding our lineup to cover popular solutions in use today. We want to continue to simplify education, accelerate product development, and facilitate the inception of other technologies. Reducing barriers to entry is part of our mission.\nTogether with our partners, it is our goal to provide reliable and long-term supported platforms that you can depend on to create even more innovative products and services. We are open to cooperative ventures with companies willing to offer the same level of care and attention to their products throughout its lifecycle.\nWhat are the differences between the rewards?\nThere are three different boards and they share the same layout. The only difference between them are the main System-of-Chip (SoC) and the amount of RAM. They all operate at 1.0GHz.\nTritium IoT: Allwinner H2+, 32-bit, 512MB DDR3, Mali-400MP2, 1080P60, Linux\nTritium 1GB: Allwinner H3, 32-bit, 1GB DDR3, Mali-400MP2, 4K30, Android 7 Nougat, Linux\nTritium 2GB: Allwinner H5, 64-bit, 2GB DDR3, Mali-450MP4, 4K30, Android 7 Nougat, Linux\nBasic Kit Contents:\n8GB eMMC 4.x Module\nPush-Pin Heatsink with Thermal Tape\n5.1V 2.5A MicroUSB Power Supply\nActive Cooling Media Center PC Case\nPush-Pin Heatsink with Thermal Tape\n  LoveRPi Active Cooling Media Center PC Case\n   Complete Kit Contents:\nBasic Kit\nLarger eMMC Module\nHDMI Cable\nMicroSD Card\nGenBasic Omni Remote Air Mouse Keyboard and Touchpad\nGenBasic Omni Remote Air Mouse Keyboard and Touchpad\nWhat technologies does it use?\nAllwinner's H2+/H3/H5 series of chips are built on the 40nm fabrication process just like the system-on-chips used in Raspberry Pi 3. The H2+ forms the basis of the IoT model and H3 SoC offer higher HDMI solution, slightly better media support, and faster IO interfaces but utilizes slightly slower and older ARM Cortex-A7 core designs. The Allwinner H5 SoC in the 2GB board offers 64-bit capabilities just like the Raspberry Pi 3's BCM2837 and cryptographic acceleration.\nWhat about software support?\nLinux mainline is very active due the contribution of the linux-sunxi community and Free Electrons. Linux-based distros such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Armbian are readily available for Allwinner Hx. Our platform extend a greater lead on Android. We will provide extensive software support for this platform alongside the existing open source community. Please read the software section further down for more information.\nWhat about the proprietary ARM Mali-400/450 GPU?\nThe ARM Mali-4xx series of 3D accelerators is among the most popular 3D GPU IP due to its age, cost, and software support, albeit proprietary in nature. ARM inherited most of the design from its Norwegian acquisition of Falanx Microsystems but never open sourced the software IP. The 3D GPU utilizes compiled binary firmware tailored to specific SoCs. The GPU does not feature a 2D display engine and the binary must be tied into different display engines via customizations from the SoC vendor. The firmware connects to a passthrough kernel driver and this is the mechanism of 3D enablement for our board in our operating system images.\nInitiatives to develop an open source driver never achieve the critical mass to provide resources to drive adoption by the community like with freedrino and other drivers. Due to the number of deployments with this 3D GPU series, we know that having this would open new possibilities. We really want this to happen and have contributed resources to this effort. We will continue contribute resources when presented the opportunity to affect meaningful progress on this front.\nWhat is \"libre\" about it?\nLibre implies having the freedom to do as you wish. In the software world, libre means having the source code with a license permissive of changes. In the hardware world, libre means having the the ability to make and modify the hardware. Libre should not be confused with gratis. We are designing libre hardware while promoting libre software. The components we use are open-market items. Unlike the Raspberry Pi 3, there are no exclusive sold components that prevent you from designing, customizing, or improving on your own version of this board.\nTritium's SoCs upstream has been maintained by the linux-sunxi community and they have made great progress on the H2+, H3, and H5 SoCs with most of the work already upstreamed in Linux 4.12. The Tritium board device trees will be upstreamed as well.\nHow does it compare to other boards?\nBeing a cost-effective product, it compares favorably to the Raspberry Pi 3 in applications where price, IO performance, and fewer blobs are critical factors. While it does not perform as well as our AML-S905X-CC platform that was Kickstarted a few months ago, it does offer a CMOS camera interface for simple camera and vision applications. The four USB 2.0 ports, ethernet interface, MicroSD card slot, and eMMC interface all have independent bandwidth for maximum IO performance.\nCan I use this in commercial applications?\nThe board can utilize a lot of existing hardware infrastructure already in place since it shares its form factor with the Raspberry Pi 3. Software tweaks are definitely needed to port existing projects to this platform.\nThe boards can be ordered with header pins either on the top or on the bottom for more flexibility and integration with carrier boards. They can be customized to use any of the 3 SoCs and anywhere from between 256MB to 2GB of DDR3 RAM. Customization requests start at 500 units depending on the changes needed or complexity.\nWill it run existing software?\nDepending on the board, you can run ARMv8 (2GB Board only), ARMv7, ARMv6 compiled code compiled on Linux. However, it requires a different boot loader and kernel to be installed on the MicroSD card for existing Raspberry Pi images to be bootable. We will provide tooling on Github to do this. If the software on the image is tailored to the features of a specific board, software work will need to be done to utilize the features of this board instead.\nAndroid based on Android 7 Nougat has been running on the 1GB H3 and 2GB H5 boards via eMMC and MicroSD card. The latest mainline Linux together with a device tree will work on this board. Some features of the board are still not in mainline per the linux-sunxi mainlining page. We hope to have the dts for all three boards in mainline by Linux 4.16.\nWill it be compatible with existing add-ons?\nTritium has a 40 pin GPIO header that maintains as much compatibility as possible with the existing standard set forth by the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. The placement on the header of I2C, SPI, PWM, UART, 5V, 3.3V, and GPIO are equivalent. Raspberry Pi ecosystem has quite a few years of support from numerous vendors and we can only play catch-up at this point. Most Raspberry Pi HATs can be supported by the hardware but the software bits to get them working on this board is simply not there yet.\nWhy did you not add onboard WiFi or Bluetooth?\nThe certification process for single board computers with radios is incredibly painful and long. We want to make this product as convenient as possible to procure in any country so we refrained from adding radio components. Additionally, the performance of onboard radios are generally poor while USB dongles are cheap, certified in many countries, and offer better performance.\nWe recommend using USB or carrier boards and mezzanines to add functionality to the base hardware. This reduces design and certification cost on both our side and customer side.\nHow far along is this project?\nThe product design, initial software support, and testing have been completed by our internal team. Your contributions will be used towards the manufacturing and distribution of the boards.\nWe will be providing the following:\nSchematic Diagram\nAndroid 7 Nougat for eMMC and MicroSD card\nUbuntu 16.04 Linux\nCan I get multiple rewards?\nFrom our previous experience with Kickstarter, it is easier for us logistically if there is only one reward per person.

What are we all about?\nThere is a resurgence of women empowerment happening right now and we at andieanderin want to support and contribute to this momentous social conversation. \nAnd what better way to do so than to bring back the pussybow or what we are calling \u2018neckties\u2019 - made popular during the rising power of women in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\n'FLOTUS with the MOSTUS' women necktie inspired by the fabulous Michelle Obama\nWe create neckties for women and girls that are designed to reflect the genius behind some of the most influential women from the past and present. Our hope is that these thoughtfully crafted neckties can transform any ensemble and give the person wearing it a sense of superpower - similar to the women the neckties were designed to emulate. \nOur first collection consists of seven neckties representing the fabulousness of Beyonce, Frida, Hillary Clinton, Malala Yousafzai, Michelle Obama, Mother Teresa, and Oprah.\n'Queen of Pop' inspired by the one-and-only Beyonce\nThe women we are celebrating are truly inspiring. And to really paint a picture of their influence, each necktie will also come with a storyboard that illustrates the accomplishments of these women.\ncollection of andieanderin storyboards that accompany their respective necktie\nWe are also passionate about giving back. With each necktie sale, andieanderin will donate a portion of the proceeds to an organization that is supporting the empowerment of women and girls, starting with the amazing Step Up charity organization. \n'The Brave One' designed after the inspirational Malala Yousafzai\n  'The Hilz' necktie inspired by Hillary Clinton\nPussybow blouses are certainly a current trend, but with the andieanderin necktie, you aren\u2019t stuck wearing it with just a blouse, you can mix and match with any outfit while also repping your inner badass. There is nothing stopping you from wearing the necktie with a hoodie - trust us, we\u2019ve done it :)\n    andieanderin neckties are a versatile statement piece for any outfit\n Why are we raising money through Kickstarter? \nWe are a friend-duo that are pooling our resources to make our first necktie collection come to life, but we need a little assistance to see it to the finish line and tied around the necks of fabulous women and girls across the US. \nWe are also dedicated to using premium materials and producing our neckties in the USA. With this comes some additional material and production cost, but we believe we can\u2019t represent these amazing women on the cheap! We also don\u2019t want to stop after just one collection! \nThere are so many fabulous women to celebrate and we hope to create a large library of neckties that represent a highly diverse group of women. \nAnd if we are totally honest, our dream of dreams is to have an exhibit in a museum showcasing hundreds of our neckties. But that is for another Kickstarter campaign\u2026unless Anna Wintour comes calling for a women empowerment Met exhibit and needs some neckties ;)\n  The 'Queen of Media' necktie is designed after Oprah\nWhy we need funding: \nWe need the funding to complete the production of our first necktie collection as well as to help in the design and execution of our second collection.\nOur second collection will represent another group of amazing women and we would love to partner with female guest artists on textile design and storyboard illustrations to help bring it to life.\nWe need funding to scale the project. Our first collection will be offered in limited quantities because we are currently working in small production batches, which drives up our costs. However we hope to grow with our second collection and having additional funds in advance of production will help us secure larger quantities at lower cost. We also want to work to reduce our production and material costs so we can donate a larger portion of proceeds to charitable organizations.\nWe also need to reach more people to grow the project. Hiring marketers and dedicating funding to advertising will be important in helping us grow our brand organically versus immediately partnering with retailers.\n'The Saint Teresa' designed after Mother Teresa\nWho\u2019s featured in our first collection: \nNecktie: \u201cQueen of Pop\u201d\nBeyonce Knowles-Carter aka \u2018Sasha Fierce\u2019 aka \u2018Queen\u2019 is a pop culture force that will likely create 100 more internet-breaking headlines before we can even go to print, simply by getting insta-dressed in the morning. And she hasn\u2019t been dubbed \u201cQueen Bey\u201d for nothing. Beyonc\u00e9 has 20 Grammys to her name for her solo career alone and her Lemonade album from 2016 is one for the history books.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Mexican Icon\u201d\nFrida Kahlo is a woman who endured more than your fair share of tragedies. And she took those tragedies and made them into some of the most provocative paintings the world has seen.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Hilz\u201d\nHillary Clinton...oh Hillary...in short, she started a movement and not just for pantsuits (which look great with a necktie, \u2018wink\u2019). Not only is Hillary Clinton America\u2019s original \u201cnasty woman,\u201d she is also America\u2019s first woman in history to top a majority party presidential ticket.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Brave One\u201d\nMalala Yousafzai. If Superwoman had a mission to bring education to all the children of the world, that would be Malala Yousafzai. She is an astoundingly strong and passionate young woman who started this fight at an age when most kids are celebrating their elementary school graduation.\nNecktie: \u201cFLOTUS with the MOSTUS\u201d\nMichelle Obama. What is there not to love about Mrs. Michelle Obama? A gutsy, smart, bold and determined woman equal to her husband (ahem, the former president), she is a true symbol of femininity and strength.\nNecktie: \u201cThe Saint Teresa\u201d\nMother Teresa is a saint amongst the saints.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

Mythic Games had pictures of hard plastic miniatures painted up, and they looked incredible.\u201d\n Techraptor at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cWithout a doubt, hands-down, my big giant experience at (GenCon) was Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.

EXTRA METAVIRA MINI CAMPAIGN ADDED!\n   Jagged Alliance: The Boardgame is a rich and variable co-operative tactical combat game true to the game\u2019s digital predecessor with 999+ minutes of replayable campaign and extra scenarios. Take the role of your favorite Jagged Alliance mercenaries and fight the armies of an evil dictator to free the nation of Arulco from oppression. JA:TBG is full of tough choices, always keeping you and your team on the edge of victory or defeat.\nIn JA:TBG you encounter a succession of challenging scenarios with a variety of goals you need to accomplish, taking your hard earned equipment and experience with you into each successive scenario. Ultimately you will face the tyrant Deidranna herself (or one of the other dictators in the game), who is ruling Arulco with an iron fist, and try to defeat her once and for all.\nJA:TBG features an inbuilt risk-reward system at every level of game-play, forcing players to make fateful decision with every move. They can manage the amount of actions and how good a chance for success they have by spending Stamina - however any Wounds are also deducted from the same pool, so the more they exhaust their mercs, the more they risk being taken out by the opposition. Players will decide who goes first, when and which sectors to liberate, whether to spend hard-won funds on hiring new merc allies, black-market weaponry or bribing enemy officers to keep escalation low, thus preventing counter-attacks. Jagged Alliance always keeps you at the edge providing the immense satisfaction of a hard-won victory.\nEvery playthrough is different thanks to the many variations in the game setup. From choosing a different dictator, who will change the conditions of a game, to the variable encounter and enemy set-ups or the 100+ cards of weapons, allies and gear, you will never play the same game twice.\nWhat's more: With the modular sectors and variable set-ups, you can create your own scenario, so you are basically getting a tool set to make your own campaigns and missions with the game!\nAt the heart of every Jagged Alliance game are the mercs, who have their own skills and stats and can be individually equipped with weapons, armor and gear. They will progress throughout the game and collect other beloved JA characters as allies to help them in and out of combat.\nApart from kicking Redshirt ass, mercs can repair damaged equipment, train rebel troops to protect liberated sectors, heal injuries and gather experience. Each merc will be an individually sculpted miniature and more mercs will be added via stretch goals and OUR BACKERS WILL DECIDE WHICH MERCS TO ADD TO THE ROSTER!\nOn a strategic level you will have to deal with Deidranna\u2019s (or one of the alternate dictators available in the game) ever escalating counter-attacks and special abilities. Dictators are the nefarious powers behind every game and can change the rules and conditions for scenarios, and bring their own set of events and extra missions.\nPlayers will have to decide whether to risk an increasing escalation that brings stronger counterattacks and more dangerous missions but higher rewards, or try to keep escalation in check and get to their goals faster.\nAlongside each dictator are their trusted Lieutenants, who will make player's lives even more difficult. Lieutenants are tough to overcome and will require players to devise special tactics. Finally facing (and hopefully beating) the dictator in the game is the high point of every campaign!\nMissions are enemy schemes influencing the scenario from outside the currently contested region and play a vital strategic role, as they can modify enemy strength, recovery and mechanics in the game. Players will need to decide whether to split forces to resolve them or focus on the regional map progression and deal with the conditions set by the active missions.\nMissions can range from helping wounded in a village, hijacking the local radio station or capturing a well-guarded convoy. As always, the risks and rewards need to be considered carefully. \nEnemies in the game come in different flavors and sizes, from the base Redshirt grunts to elusive snipers or deadly MG teams, each with their unique attack patterns and abilities. As the game progresses, these enemies get replaced with elite versions and become more dangerous. There is always the chance for a random bloodcat popping up in your sector!\nRebel intelligence provides some information about how guarded each sector is, but you never know exactly whom you will be facing. Outnumbered and often outgunned you need your wits, skills and a plethora of weapons to overcome the opposition's troops.\nEach scenario represents a contested region made of sectors, divided into areas, that need to be liberated and may feature a unique objective as well. Capturing strategic targets will make your life easier, with mines that produce funds or villages that allow you to recruit workers and train militia. With 40 different sector maps there is always something new to discover.\nTerrain types in an area influence enemy and mercenary abilities, adding to the challenge further. Hide in lush jungles or go close-combat in urban areas! With its modular map tile system, wide range of scenarios and flexible progression that you can save from one game to the next, JA:TBG allows for brief skirmish games or 666+ minutes of ongoing campaign play.\nAlso - with 20+ double sided sector maps, random cards and variable enemy set-ups, you hold all the tools in your hand to create your own scenarios and we will publish the best user generated content as a scenario sheet on our website. You can build your own campaign or skirmish scenario and we will do community challenges from time to time to build scenarios based on specific premises. Endless challenges await!\nJA:TBG is a truly co-operative game playable solo or with up to 4 players, where you need to coordinate your team's efforts and skills to the best of your ability to free Arulco...or die trying.\nThe game will come with printed versions of the rules and scenario booklets in English and pdf versions in German, French and Polish. Cards only have limited text and should be easy to understand.\nMinis will have 27-30mm (Tank not to scale)\n  Something is stirring below...and it's on you to keep it down.\nUnderground! adds a new threat to the game: the infamous JA2 Crepitus creatures, including 3 new enemy types (adolescent, male and female Crepitus) and the terrifying Crepitus Queen as a Dictator with new event cards and mechanics. Take them up in new scenarios or incorporate them in you base campaign.\nDescend into new sectors, such as mineshafts and secret research facilities, that host new dangers and top secret tech-inventions like the Rocket Rifle and lasers.\nNew rules for lighting can be integrated into the base game, bringing darkness and night-vision equipment to Arulco!\n  The bucket does not stop here: If we reach the upcoming stretch goals, we will be able to get you even MORE gameplay for your greenbacks! Spread the word and help us to make YOUR game better, snapperheads!\n     Want to help even more? If we manage to reach these nifty social stretch goals we will make the game even more attractive by adding the below to your game.\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK!\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR BLOG!\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER!\n    Our friends at Orkenspalter TV were nice enough to play through an early prototype of the game (with hand-made dice and lego miniatures to boot), so you can watch a sample play session. Be advised that rules will still change (also: we do not include hand-crafted dice by Jan)!\nDEATH RULES HAVE CHANGED FROM VIDEO!\nEnglish Session\n \nGerman Session\n   Games will come with German, French and Polish rules as pdf \n  Shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.  \nWe expect shipping cost to range between 10 to 20 \u20ac/USD for the base game and 16 to 25 for the base game plus add-on. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs:   \nUnited Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers) \nUSA (US backers)  \nCanada (Canada backers)   \nGermany (EU backers)   \nChina (Asia Pacific backers)   \nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers)    \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the closest usable hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.  We will update you on estimated shipping boxes once we have the final box layout and dimensions sorted. All shipping will be done by carefully selected shipping partners to minimize any chance of damage to the shipment! \nWe are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have playtested this for 100+ hours and will continue to do so during the next months as we gather feedback. So the game will change a little still, which may affect our delivery schedule.\n\nWe also invite our backers to provide feedback on the current game version, so this may also change the exact number and types of components that will make it into the final game.\n\nWe have already worked closely with manufacturers and have successfully shipped other kickstarters outside our current company, but as always delays in manufacturing and shipping may occur.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced in China, the common ones being delays in production, shipping, and customs. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others.\n\nREFUND GUARANTEE\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter; however, we will refund pledges in the amount we received (so after fees) if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Spotter", "descp": "1,20 USD\nSupport the campaign with your goodwill and keep an eye on things.

Then cunningly manipulate your dice in challenging combat with dangerous monsters. \n  In this strategic dice placement game, you compete with your fellow players to venture out of the Citadel, the last bastion against marauding Monsters. You will fight Monsters in the Lands they have occupied, hopefully winning them back for the crown. \n        The LEADER pledge is for the base game that will be available in retail, plus all the nice stretch goals, most of them KS exclusive, we will hopefully be able to unlock during the campaign. It only excludes the stretch goals marked as MONSTER stretch goals.\n  Want to go in for a real treat? With the MONSTER pledge, you will get deluxe components on top of everything you get in the LEADER pledge, and MONSTER stretch goals that add further deluxe components. Please see here for a look at the gorgeous printed wooden tokens.\n                                                                            Monster Lands is a game of fame, a game of bravery and wits in which you prepare yourself to fight monsters that have overrun the Kingdom of Queen Gimelda.   \n This Euro-style dice placement game combines resource management and battle action, it puts you in the role of the leader of a small clan of brave warriors which you will try to guide to victory by amassing glory and reputation.  \n     For those of you who speak Spanish:\n For the French-speaking mercenaries:\nThe game is played over a maximum of 6 rounds, each divided into 4 phases  \n1) Dice Pool Generation  \n2) Deployment  \n3) Adventure  \n4) Clean-up  \n  At the beginning of the game, dreadful monsters are holding the Queen\u2019s lands ransom and you are commissioned to fight them and free the Lands.  \n  Your Clan Progress Track is the base for your actions, here you record your glory and reputation. In the Dice Pool Generation phase you collect dice from the track and all your mercenaries, these are your tools to prosper.  \n  You will use your dice to take actions using a \u201cworker-placement\u201d mechanic. In the Citadel, your dice allow you to improve your clan, acquiring traps, shields, potions, venoms, mercenaries, and more. The timing of your dice placement and the type of dice you use affects both yourself and other players.  \n  All of the mercenaries, resources, and items you acquire go back to your clan base, and once you feel equipped enough, you go out to the wilderness and face the monsters.  \n  Outside the Citadel, your dice become battle tools. You roll them in missions and battles, aiming to surpass target values. Careful, though, the choice of position in the battle is strategic, you compete with other players to take down the monsters or free the lands.  \n  You will have many opportunities to manipulate your dice results and increase your chance of success, using a multitude of items and abilities. You cannot simply hope for lucky rolls to snatch the crown, you will need to carefully manage your resources and do some proper planning to be successful.  \n If you capture or eliminate a monster or re-conquer a land, you will reap substantial rewards in form of glory and money. Use them to improve your clan even more. At the end of the game, the crown is handed to the clan with most Victory Points, which are generated by glory, reputation and a few more aspects which enrich the game even further.   \n  MONSTER LANDS will come with a printed English rulebook by default, but you can also choose to receive it in either Spanish, French, or German. All these core languages will also be available as downloadable PDF.\n                We can proudly tell you that we have worked the rules with a professional board game rules editor, a big THANK YOU to Paul Grogan from GAMING RULES! Investing money into a professionally edited rulebook early gives you the reassurance that you will have no difficulties learning the game. \nOn top, we also got valuable input from Richard Ham (RAHDO RUNS THROUGH) to fine-tune and perfect the flow.

They are all handmade by the fantastically creative glass artist Jenefer Ham in Malta, all unique, all lovingly shaped into these cute bubbly forms by melting colored glass rods with a 2500\u00baC/1400\u00baF flame torch. They replace the 1st player marker and although you only need one of them for the game, you may want to go for the full collection of four colors, one for each Affinity featured in the game, Jungle, Fire, Water, and Air.\n Pledge 32 \u20ac for a monster with a color of your choice or 100 \u20ac for the set of all four colors. The glass monsters will come safely snuggled in a bag with a note from Jenefer, and will be posted certified directly from Malta in April 2018, postage for this item already included in the add-on price. \n       This is Second Gate Games\u2019 second Kickstarter project, but the first we will do as an independent publisher. We are extremely excited and motivated! \nHaving learned from our partner CMON in the launch of B-Sieged, a game we authored, we now look forward to applying these learnings and \u201cdrown you with stretch-goals\u201d ;) \n But even more important than the campaign itself is the desire to provide you with a game that is both fun to play and beautiful to behold. \n Second Gate Games as publisher does not only release its own games like Monster Lands, but has also successfully started to publish licensed games of other authors, like Cat Box and Kitty Paw. Why is this important? Because it gives you reassurance that the company is not a one-off stunt, we are here to stay, with a long-term commitment. \n The people behind Second Gate Games: \n    Quite simply, because we couldn\u2019t do this without Kickstarter. As a new kid on the block in the board game publishing industry, we do not have the funds to finance a full production nor the means to gauge demand.\n  Kickstarter is a great tool for us as a company, but is also good news for you as a backer. We are creating Kickstarter exclusive stretch-goals and a Monster pledge level that would never have been possible in a retail environment.\n    The USA, the UK, the European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cFriendly Shipping\u201d. This means we will mass import the product into these regions and handle and pay all the import taxes, you won\u2019t have to incur additional cost.\nThe games will be produced in China by LongPack Games, an experienced board game manufacturer with a proven track record. Prototype quality has been outstanding. For the overseas freight, we are working with global forwarding agents that allow visibility of the shipment at any time, as they are on their way to the various distribution centers. We will be using established fulfillment companies like Ship Naked, Quartermaster Logistic, VFI, Aetherworks, Happyshops, and others, specialized and experienced in the fulfillment of Kickstarter projects, to cover the distance from distribution centers to your home. \nAll steps included, we calculate the product should arrive at your home end of September 2018. [EDIT from Nov. 2: we have adjusted the expected delivery time to end of SEPTEMBER 2018, in order to include the Heavy Weapons and 5p expansion set. Unfortunately, we cannot edit this information in the original pledge boxes]\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, which we will do with the help of Backerkit, the leading Pledge Manager platform. Above you will find the shipping cost you will have to expect per region. In the case of single unit pledges, these are maximum prices.\nWe say \u201cmaximum\u201d because these prices may go down further, but never up. Shipping prices fluctuate, but our pledge to you is that, for single unit shipments, we cover any potential additional cost beyond these shipping quotes, which are already subsidized by about 4\u20ac. And what\u2019s even better: the more volume we ship, the better we can streamline and optimize shipping, and we want to give back to the community by reducing shipping cost further.\n              ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe creation process for a board game is a complex enterprise, especially for a game like ours with hundreds of components: design adjustments, approval processes, pre-production samples, printing & assembling, freight shipping, handling in logistic centers and finally the last shipment to your door. If anything goes wrong or isn\u2019t perfectly right, there is a risk of delay at any of those steps. This is a simple reality that you as backer need to be aware of. If anything did indeed go awry, we would communicate this to you openly.\n \nHowever, we feel that we are well prepared for a good fulfillment process and minimize the risk of delay, for the following reasons:\n \n1. We have done about 95% of the illustration work and graphic design of the game, we are almost ready to push the button.\n2. We already went through the production process with LongPack, while producing prototypes with mass-production techniques. So we are familiar with their requirements, leadtimes, and processes.\n3. Our manufacturer has a proven track record in the gaming industry and the quality of our prototypes has been outstanding. Communication has been very smooth so far and we are sure this will continue.\n4. We are working with specialized fulfillment companies like Ship Naked or HappyShops, we are sure they can handle all your pledges easily, they have the systems and the experience.\n \n Let us also point out that Monster Lands is not a one-off stunt for us. This is our first self-run Kickstarter project, but with B-Sieged we already gained considerable experience.

The Earth lies in ruins. In an instant, 99% of the world's population was dead or would be soon. Life as we knew it was over, and those of us who were \"lucky\" enough to survive the initial nuclear fires have had to adapt quickly to our harsh environment, or join the fallen. It has been said that no person has ever been promised a tomorrow, but now, the same could be said for the entire human race.\nThe red player\u2019s peaceful farming operation faces encroachment by the food-starved survivors of the green, pink, and blue players\u2026\nThis post apocalyptic setting is the world of Downfall, a brand new game from designer John D. Clair (Mystic Vale). In this 4X strategy game, each player will take control of a unique faction in the year 2213. It is a bleak and unforgiving future where survival is never certain and there is no prize for second place - you either rise to the top, or you fall into ruin and decay.\nUsing a unique card drafting mechanism, players will have several options on their turn. Will they forage for resources, abate radiation, or travel and explore the desolated wasteland with their citizens and airships? As the game proceeds, will they spend time researching new technologies or triggering conflicts with their opponents? All of these choices can earn a player points, albeit in different ways.\nCards have consistent major actions and different minor actions: \nWhen you choose a major Gather action, turn 1 raw resource token to its gathered side in every space with a regular survivor (equipped survivors do not Gather). Gathered resources can be stored or used to feed, Build, and remove radiation.\nWhen you choose a major Regrow + Excavate action, first place 1 raw food on each plains and clean water space you occupy. Second, place a raw matching resource on each space with one of your outposts.\nWhen you choose a major Bunker action, choose to either A: gain 1 survivor, B: gain 1 raw building resource, C: gain 1 culture point, or D: all of the above. Be careful not to gain more survivors than you can feed!\nWhen you choose a Build action, you may spend gathered resources from your storage or any space you control to equip survivors (1 metal), build airships (1 metal), bunkers (3 stone), or outposts (1 stone). You may also remove adjacent radiation (2 oil).\nWhen you choose a Command action, first place a command token on any space. Next, spend up to 2 movement points on separate units (airships may carry up to 2 survivors). Lastly, you may spend 1 oil to place an additional command token, or to gain an additional movement point.\nWhen you choose a Research / War card, you'll decide between the two options. If you choose Research, you'll look at your 10 technology cards, select one, pay its cost, then slide it under the corresponding column of your player board. That technology will be available every time you choose that action in the future.\nIf you choose War, you initiate conflicts in every space you occupy. First, battle strength is compared: the player with the most battle strength gains 2 victory points, and the loser gains 1. Command tokens are removed, and the winner may then either convert 1 enemy structure or airship to their own or kill 1 survivor. Any remaining survivors must then retreat to an adjacent space. (In the example above, the blue player gains a total of 5 vp, green and yellow gain 1, and red gains 2.)\nOnce all of the actions are completed, the cards chosen are discarded, and a new one is drawn by every player. If a \"Winter\" card is drawn, the game timer advances, causing a myriad of events (such as the spread of radiation, or having to feed your starving citizens) that will affect everyone. Once the Winter Track reaches the end, the game is over, and a winner is determined.\nEven though her exo-suit prevented the cold wind and driving sleet from reaching her skin, Abranna still felt the cold. She held onto her Ferro Rod while surveying the ruins around her, looking for anything useful.\nDownfall will be published in glorious Deluxified\u2122 format, with all the quality you have come to expect from TMG.\n  First, why don't we let the designer, John D. Clair, tell us in his own words what was behind his creation of Downfall:\n\"The design of Downfall came from a desire to create the perfect game for me and my tastes as a gamer. An epic, main-event, true 4X game. I wanted it set on an earth-based board (not space), with primarily economy based area control, but with the constant tension of tactical, non-luck based combat. I wanted it to play for a high player count without adding downtime, and I wanted the game to maintain a constant urgency in every decision beginning with turn one. It was a long road to go from initial concepts for a game this scale to a finely tuned game. Along that road there were quite a few major redesigns and months of sitting on the shelf while I worked on other games, but in the end I ended up with a game that I am more excited to pull off that shelf and play than any other game. The satisfying difficulty in each decision, the tension filled fast pace of each round, and the story arc building to a climactic ending make for a game that will take a really long time before I get tired of it. But take all of that with an ounce of salt because I designed the game for me. Hopefully it sounds like something that will fit for you as well!\"\nIf you would like to hear more from John Clair, he was recently a guest on the TMG Podcast.

(Click to zoom in.)\n  Tasty Minstrel Games is committed to not only publishing amazing and excellent games, we also want those games to look amazing and excellent as well. Our past Kickstarters for Orleans and Yokohama have set a high mark for Deluxified\u2122 components, and we will continue that standard of quality with Downfall.\nThe additional cost for the Deluxified\u2122 components matches our cost with no additional profit, to make and deliver them to you the backer. For this reason, TMG will only make a Deluxified\u2122 version through crowdfunding. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some convention sales in Limited Quantity. \n  Check out this fantastic How To Play video from Paul Grogan at \"Gaming Rules!\"\n  Still want more?

Though we have pored over them and done our best to cover every possible scenario, we still consider them \"work in progress\" - feel free to offer your feedback! Our development team will review any/all comments prior to final proofreading.\nReach these stretch goals one at a time and help rescue civilization from its Downfall!\nDownfall is an epic 4X game about trying to prevent the end of humanity. For something of this magnitude, and for those of you who have the space on your table, we are offering Upsized Map Tiles!\nThe artwork will be identical to the standard tiles, but enlarged to give you plenty of extra play space and to show off the incredible detail.\n\nThe tiles will cost $20 and will be shipped in their own box separate from the base game.\nThe Upsized Map Tiles will be compatible with both the Deluxified\u2122 and Retail versions of Downfall!\n  TMG is excited about Downfall, and we think gamers are going to enjoy it immensely. That being said, we wanted to get the opinions of some of our favorite reviewers, so we sent out some prototypes for them to play.\nJeremiah the Boardgame Renegade let us know he loved the tension of the game and really liked the card drafting mechanism!\nAnd here is what Kristi thought over at Peace, Love & Games!\nOur friends over at Epic Gaming Night gave the game a great review as well!\n  Moe's Game Table did an excellent written review of Downfall - you can find it HERE\nStay tuned for more reviews!\nPeople have come to expect a premium experience when choosing to support a Deluxified\u2122 TMG game.

This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy. The following is an unboxing of a Deluxified\u2122 Yokohama, to illustrate what we are offering:\nPLAY\n\nNote: While the town of Yokohama was one of 1% of the Earth that avoided the desolation and ruin of the 19 day war, the TMG game bearing its name is not able to be combined with Downfall for even more epic playing purposes.\nIn addition to premium packaging this project is:\nWhat does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of these countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places. This is done so that you get your game the earliest we are able to get it to you!\n\nShipping prices for some of our backers for Downfall can be found on the table below. \nIf your country is not listed above, please refer to your selected pledge level to determine shipping costs.\nTMG is offering a Retailer Level pledge for Deluxified\u2122 copies of Downfall. These will include all of the stretch goals and be identical to the other Deluxified\u2122 copies. Only Brick and Mortar retailers can pledge at this level. \n\nRetailers can order 4 or 8 copies for $240 or $480 each which will include shipping. This is for US delivery addresses only. Retailers outside of the US will need to use a US forwarding address.  \nThe pledge tier cost of $30 will applied toward the final payment and final payment will be due just prior to shipping the games.\nAt the close of the Kickstarter campaign, retailers must provide a copy of their business license or similar information as proof of their retail business to qualify for this pledge level.\nWe are excited to offer this option to our Retailer partners so we can explore even more ways for people to enjoy the Deluxified\u2122 version of our game.\nAll of us here at TMG realize that a good relationship between publisher and backer during a crowdfunding campaign is paramount for it to be a success. It is our goal to make sure that the communication in the Kickstarter projects run by Tasty Minstrel Games will among the most active and connected to be found on the crowd funding platform. To achieve this, TMG will do the following:\n\nFor the first 7 days of the campaign, we will post updates at least once every 72 hours. In addition, during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on weekdays), the comments page will be monitored for questions and those will be answered by the TMG Staff. \nAfter the first 7 days, while the campaign is live, we will update the campaign at least once a week. The comments page will continue to be checked on a regular basis (but not continuously monitored) every day and questions will be answered at those times. \n After the campaign has concluded, the comments page will continue to be monitored on a regular basis, but with less frequency than before. Any questions posted will be answered when they are seen. Updates will be sent whenever new, pertinent information about the campaign can be relayed to backers. If 30 days go by without new, pertinent information, a quick \"all is well\" update will be posted to maintain communication with our backers. \n After the games have been sent to our backers, and fulfillment has been completed, we will consider the campaign to be concluded, and any further communication would need to go through our normal support lines.\nIt is our mission and our intent that with these guidelines, our backers will enjoy an unprecedented level of connection to the campaign, ensuring a satisfying experience from the beginning of the campaign to the day that the game is delivered to them, and beyond.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

Free Bonus dollars will be added to your pledge manager account for you to use.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - UNLOCKED - All dice now available in Cotton Candy color.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - UNLOCKED - All backers will now receive an extra 2% in dollars (rounded down) to spend on the dice menu.  Free Bonus dollars will be added to your pledge manager account for you to use.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - UNLOCKED - A true 3 sided D3 (the Apple D3) was added as a free die to many sets and one you can purchase individually in all colors as well.  \nTHE STORY BEHIND THE DICE   \nImpact! Miniatures is seeking to add to their dice of unusual size with mass production of the final 4 dice we need to complete two different dice chains (a D17, D19, D26 & D28 sided die in 9 opaque and 2 speciality colors).  These 4 dice will allow Impact! to offer D20 dice chain sets with all the dice from D3 to D20 and D30 dice chain sets with all the even dice from D4 to D30 to RPG developers and players.\nImpact! has a lot of experience producing odd sided dice and the designs for these dice look great and have been tested to be as fair as possible despite having an odd number of sides. Due to assistance from Andrew at the Dice Shop Online (thank you very much Andrew!) and Joseph Goodman from Goodman Games (thank you Mr. Goodman!), we have been able to research the shapes and receive a small batch of the D17, D19, D26 & D28 to test the production designs. We are very happy with the test batch and want to get the dice into full production but really need your assistance to get the mass production run of the dice created.\nDICE CHAINS  (What are they?  Why are they great?)\nI have helped several game companies design rules for games.  When I was introduced to Dice Chain Mechanics for RPGs by Dungeon Crawl Classics and Freeblades I realized they created just a smoother set of rules for RPGs.  \nWith a standard RPG as your character progresses he/she receives +1 or more to their dice rolls but then you need special rules that a roll of a natural 1 still fails in the rules.  With Dice Chain mechanics as you character progresses the next dice in the chain is used.  So at level 2 your Barbarian rolls a D11 instead of a D10 when using an axe.  No need for special rules for failure as a 1 is still possible when they roll.   The problem was that no one made all the dice needed for a full dice chain for a D20 system or for a D30 system.   Four years ago, I started a quest to offer those two chains.   This KickStarter gives us the final 4 dice we need to complete those two dice chain sets.\nNew D24s and D30s and Compressed Resin\nAll sets in this KickStarter will contain my new D24 and D30 dice.  These two dice were redesigned to make them roll better based on customer feedback.   In addition, all the dice for this KickStarter will done in compressed resin instead of acrylic.  We used acrylic dice on our first 2 KickStarter but have moved to the heavier and more durable resin for all our dice we manufacturer now.  These give the dice a better feel when being used and hold the color better as well.\nAlphabet D26\nDue to an investment from angel investor, a 26 sided die with one side for each letter in the Alphabet has been added to the KickStarter.  For now it is available in Black and Purple opaques as well as all the Specialty colors.\nCOLORS\nBelow are the colors that you can choose from for all of the dice sets in the project.  9 opaque colors and 2 specialty colors. \n DICE MENU\nBelow is a menu that you can use the amount you pledge plus any bonus dollars your reward level offers to pick your own custom reward.  When the pledge manager is released after the project is over, each backer will be able to select the dice sets, dice and colors that you want from the below menu.  All backers can add extra to their amount pledged to any reward level to use to shop with on the dice menu.  Stretch Goals many add on additional bonus dollars for you to use for free.  \n     STANDARD SHIPPING\nShipping will be charged after the KickStarter is over as part of the pledge manager based on current shipping costs.   Currently I expect these charges to be $5 for US shipping, $10 for Canada shipping and $15 to the Rest of the World.   PLEASE NOTE:  Shipping is EU friendly.   In the 3 previous dice KickStarters I ran I did not have anyone report paying customs so there should be no risk of customs charges on your reward.  \nWAVE 1 EARLY SHIPPING\nYou can add on money to your pledge for shipping your order early (or in 2 shipments).  Wave 1 shipping will be in February 2018 instead of July 2018.  Black, Purple, Rainbow, Translucent Teal and Glow in the Dark dice sets should be ready to ship by February 2018.  For an extra $5 for US addresses, $10 for Canada or $15 Rest of the World, your reward will ship (or as much as possible will ship) in February 2018.\nSOCIAL MEDIA  (or How you can help get yourself and everyone else more free dice and options)\nBelow are a list of stretch goal for the project.  I will do everything I can do get the project out there but nothing works for unlocking stretch goals like the backers of a project giving it some assistance.   Share the project on Facebook, Send out a Tweet that you backed it, Let friends know about it on group pages and forums.   If you want to get the most out of the project in terms of free items from stretch goals, a few seconds to plug the project will go a very long way and is deeply appreciated.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n   THANK YOUs\nThank you to Andrew Weir from the www.thediceshoponline.com for all of his support in helping fund the prototyping expenses throughout the project of creating these two dice chains.\nThank you to Joseph Goodman from Goodman Games (www.goodman-games.com) for taking a chance on an incredibly small company to provide the dice for a game as up and coming as Dungeon Crawl Classics.   This KickStarter would not exist without that support.\nThank you to my wife and 2 sons for supporting my business and assisting me getting my dice projects out the door so we can keep growing this part of the business.\nThank you to Casey Nordell, Magic Vince and Matthew Cornelisse for your assistance in designing the dice.\nThank you to my son, Sparrow, for all his help making my dice shop on Amazon.com successful. The Stretch Goal #3 color was designed by both of us and is a special thank you to him for his assistance with my dice business.\nAlso another thank you to Casey Nordell for naming the color of the dice for Stretch Goal #2.   My son and I tried to think of one better and could not especially when his birth name Andy is in the color name!\nThanks to http://worldartsme.com for the Dice border art\nFinally thank you to all the first day backers who make this project fund on its first day and all the backers who help us break stretch goal after!

Set in Aughmoore, the world of Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Heroes of Land, Air & Sea.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable co-op, with a unique turn-deck mechanic.\nWIN: Defeat the Epic Foe!  \nLOSE: Let your Capital City get destroyed!\nBASE STORY: After the Great War (Tiny Epic Kingdoms), many of the factions, shattered and defeated, looked for something to cling to. One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nEXPANSION STORY: Aughmoore is in ruins. The evil could not be contained and its darkness has spread to every region of the world. Shattering villages and infecting all forms of life. There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.\nTiny Epic Defenders: The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly, it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.\nThese new features include a Campaign Mode with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.\nCaravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.\nSkills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.\nThe Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times, facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.\nThe Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part in the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As players progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans is critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.\nOwn the original Tiny Epic Defenders and curious about what the changes are? Here's what's changed: \nAll new art, component upgrade to include ITEMeeples\u00ae, gameplay changes to give players more control over the outcome of the game, and as a result, it's more fun! Try it yourself by downloading the FREE Print 'N Play below.\n    Everyone loves stretch goals, us included!

We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Avoid the curses that will trick the unwary in these dark times. \nThe clans offer aid to each other, but only the leader of the most prepared clan will be named Guardian of the Realm.\nEach round, replenish your hand to 6. You can draw from the common face-up pool, or unseen from the deck.\nNow you must make an offer of resources to another player, by choosing 1 or more cards that are all the same.\nYou may tell the truth about what type of card they are, or you may bluff. You must not lie about the number of cards though.\nThe recipient must decide if you are truthful or bluffing.\nWhen you lose an offer, the Council takes pity on you and bestows to you a coin. You can also win coins by acquiring cards that match your affinity bonus. This can be from an offer you receive or that you make!\nIf you have enough coins, you can buy resources directly into your tableau for 3 coins.\nOr you can spend 5 coins to dispel a curse from the open market and score 5 points.\nAs you add supplies to your tableau from successful offers, each scores differently. See the breakdown below. How will you choose to pursue victory?\nThe Council convenes near the midpoint of the game, and scoring takes place with quests and the Castle track. Then finally War is at hand when its card is drawn, triggering the last round of the game. \nThe dragon and orcs have arrived at the city gates.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game.

Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page\n2. On the next screen, click on the \u201cChange your pledge\u201d blue button\n3.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\n \nIf you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys).\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats?\nAfter 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games.

A miniatures board game designed by Sen Foong-Lim and Jessey Wright, The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena pits 2 players against each other in a sports game that features deep, strategic, head-to-head gameplay, highly detailed and dynamic miniatures, deck crafting and building, and team customization.\nThe game play of The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena is closely modeled after the popular Pro-bending sport featured in the first season of Avatar: The Legend of Korra. As such, the game is designed for 2 players, each controlling a team of 3 benders: earth, fire, and water.\nBased on the events of Avatar: The Legend of Korra, Pro-bending Arena focuses on the championship match between the fresh-faced Future Industry Fire Ferrets and the sneaky and brutal White Falls Wolfbats.\nThe objective of the game is simple: be on the other team's side of the arena when the game ends and you will be victorious, or dominate the competition, pushing all their benders off the back of the arena to end the game immediately and claim the championship as yours!\n  The below videos will give you an understanding of not only how The Legend of Korra Pro-bending Arena plays, but also an understanding of how to play it, plus the strategies involved.\n      The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena encourages players to experiment with their team's techniques and trick load out. This deep customization rewards players with endless ways to build their teams and defeat their opponents. \nDuring your match, you'll be able to focus your benders' chi and purchase new technique cards from one of their three strategy decks, each one separated by bender type. Not only does this mid-game deck building give players a chance to turn the tide of the match when a powerful card comes up for purchase, but it also allows players to min-max each of their strategy decks. \nThe strategy deck can be crafted before the game by players really looking to give their team an offensive edge. Being selective about what cards go into each one of your bender's strategy decks will give you the opportunity to control the plays you'll have access to as the game progresses. \n  Not only can you customize your team by crafting your strategy decks before the game, but you can really show your style via the trick cards you can load your team with.\nThere are two types of trick cards: incredibly powerful ones that can only be used once, or slightly less powerful but much riskier cheats that can be used multiple times but require players to roll a referee die each time they're used.\nCollect 2 yellow fans on a single bender and they're out of the game, putting you at a serious disadvantage.\nTricks allow players to supercharge their attacks, escape incoming barrages of elements, or even make their benders impervious to being pushed back. Deciding which tricks to take, and whether or not they're the risky yellow-fan cheats or one-time powerful tricks really allows players to make a team their own.\nDuring the course of this campaign, we will be unlocking 7 mystery teams as a free upgrade for your pledge. These are not stretch goals, they are guaranteed to be a part of your pledge no matter what our funding level ends up being! \nAdditional teams offer you a ton of new strategies. Not only will each team come equipped with their own unique special ability and strategy decks, but they also come with 6 universal trick cards that can be used by any team in the game. Meaning that even if you've already built your favorite team,  any additional team you add to your game will expand the options you have for your perfectly-tuned machine.\nOnce you've learned your new teams' quirks and perks, maximized their power potential, and earned your first championship, why not switch it up and draft your dream team?\nAdding teams to your core game will also allow you to participate in the Fantasy Draft variant. In this game mode, players can mix and match their favorite members from their favorite teams and experience the fantasy of combining two powerful special abilities into one devastating power play. \nWhen missing team members, all members still get their specific special ability, triggered by their technique cards. This can allow for unbelievable power combinations that will have Fire Ferret team members counter-bending elements alongside Wolfbats, dazing the opposition with illegal techniques.\n        The White Falls Wolfbats are the reigning Pro-bending champions. Being fan favorites, any question of the legality of their techniques and the legitimacy of their champion status is often brushed off as loser jealousy. Still, something about the way they play does ring a little unfair to even the most die-hard fans.\nIn The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena, the White Falls Wolfbats have access to the some of the dirtiest tricks in the book. Their team special ability, Daze, allows the Wolfbats to put their opponents at a serious disadvantage with cheap-shots that cripple their next plays.\n    Fresh-faced and newly-formed, the Future Industry Fire Ferrets are the surprise stars of the Pro-bending league. Hailing from Republic City, the Fire Ferrets are best known for their teamwork and mastery of the elements. Well, okay, that's the second thing they're known for; they're primarily known for being the team with Avatar Korra playing for them.\nFocusing their chi on mastering the elements, the Fire Ferrets have become proficient in redirecting overly aggressive plays back against their opponents. Counter-bend takes your opponents' element tokens and adds them as part of your attack. These counter-bend techniques can change the course of the game in a single, well-planned play.\nKnown on the Pro Bending circuit for their teamwork, the all-female, all-amazing Rabaroos coordinate to unleash a rapid-fire flurry of elemental attacks. Ada, Ula, and Umi are guaranteed to bring you to your feet with their lightning fast bending. It\u2019s always action-packed when the Rabaroos are in the Arena!\nRally and Blitz \nWhat makes the Rabaroos unique are their twin icons, Rally and Blitz. Activate Rally to gain Rally tokens which you can then spend when you activate Blitz. Blitz permits you to draw a card from the top of your Main Deck, immediately launching an additional action!\n  The self-proclaimed \u201cBullies of Black Quarry\u201d, the Boar-Q-Pines specialize in relentless pressure. Many a team of Pro Benders have withered under the attacks of the rough-and-tumble Boar-Q-Pines. Chang, Xin, and Shui may be a little prickly, but they should never be underestimated!  \nPressure\nPressure tokens are this team\u2019s unique modifier, making your elemental tokens count for double when they hit. Even the weakest attack from the Boar-q-pines is a credible threat to be taken seriously!\n  The nimble and evasive P\u2019Li is one of the rare fire benders who has the ability to focus Chi into a concentrated line of concussive force. This Combustionbending is nigh impossible to block and nearly as difficult to avoid. After years of being held deep in the frozen wastes for 13 long years by the Order of the White Lotus, P\u2019Li has escaped and is once again after her quarry - Avatar Korra! Do not stand in her way!\nP\u2019Li's unique and powerful bending type makes her such a fierce competitor that she doesn't need any teammates by her side to be a Pro-bending champion. Her combustionbending cannot be stopped, meaning that elements placed in an attempt to defend against her attacks cannot annihilate her attacks. P'Li is limited by the amount of combustion she can bend, since she is only allotted 6 combustion tokens. Players using her as a team will need to be careful about how often they deploy those tokens, as after all combustion tokens are deployed any combustion icons played are ignored. \n  The pride of the Golden Temple, Haka, Josei, and Kano come to Pro Bending with years of experience under their belts. As they\u2019re not spring chickenpigs anymore, the Tigerdillos rely less on their athleticism and more on their wisdom as veterans of the sport. They know when it\u2019s best to fight and when it\u2019s best to regroup and refocus.\n Veteran\nThe Tigerdillos, while capable benders, may be past their prime in terms of raw athletic prowess. However, their Veteran status in Pro-bending gives their team members a sense of when to take advantage of the shift in battle gain even more of an edge over the competition.\n  The Buzzardwasps have mastered the art of attacking pressure points at a distance, making precise strikes against opponents instead of using brute force. Their infamous \u201cSting\u201d technique can make even the most iron willed Pro-bender lose focus. Shan, Ko, and Loong are aiming to take the championship trophy back to Bau Ling! \nThe Buzzardwasps deliver precision attacks directly to identified weak points. Their famous sting has a powerful bite, distracting opponents, causing them to lose focus and opening them up to more attacks.\n  Kuvira is not only a political and military genius, her Metalbending is without peer in single combat and her acrobatics allows her to dance between multiple foes. Kuvira can switch from attack to defense and back again within the same, seemingly effortless, sequence of complex moves. Underestimate the grace of \u201cThe Great Uniter\u201d of the Earth Empire at your own peril!\nKuvira, Superior Combatant\nKuvira\u2019s prowess at executing advanced techniques makes it impossible for a referee to judge whether she's cheating or not. As such her Prowess ability is versatile and powerful if you choose from all of the tricks available. To ensure that the game is fair, Kuvira cannot use Tricks that prevent her from being knocked back (such as Determination).\n  Unalaq's infamy goes beyond his devious machinations and his skilled waterbending, his ability to siphon off his enemy's spiritual energy makes him a foe unlike any other. Pro-benders find themselves imagining what facing-off against such an unconventional bender would be like. How would Unalaq's soul siphon affect them in the arena, how wound he combine his most peculiar ability with his incredible waterbending skills?\nSoul Siphon\nIf you have your Spiritbending token on your Villain board, you may spend it (return it to the supply). If you do, choose 1 bender in the target space of an attack. Your opponent must discard a card of that bender\u2019s element from their hand. If they do not have a card, return your Spiritbending token to your Villain board.\n      If you'd like to add the Amon expansion to your pledge please press the \"Manage my Pledge\" buttom at the top of the page and add $30. \nThe Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena Amon's Invasion expansion includes 3 game modes: \n1.

You must explore the station to discover powerful technology in the hopes of preparing your team, restore the functions of the Station while uncovering its true power, and battle against the other races that seek to control the Station as a means of ruling the galaxy.\nWhat is the Station? - The Station is a technological marvel that is currently floating nearly derelict in space. You are unsure of its origin, how it was damaged or how to fit it. But one thing is for sure, if you do not repair its systems in enough time to repel the enemy forces that are bearing down on your location, you will surely be destroyed. A fate that will most likely be shared with the rest of the galaxy.\nWho is Sil\u2019ahan? - An Ancient One, known as the Empress of R'lyeh, is your greatest enemy. She and her Eldritch forces have not only destroyed the Seraphic Homeworld but also eliminated nearly all of the escaped refugees as they were ruthlessly hunted down. You are unsure why she has such a hatred for the Seraphic, but you do know that the two cultures have existed for nearly all of recorded time and have been at war with one another for just as long. Her advanced fleet is commanded by her four daughters, their hunger for genocide appears to be a long standing family tradition. They destroyed your world and the station is now your last hope of survival. You must find a way to stop the reign of this ultimate evil before she and her forces destroy the galaxy.\nWho is Captain De\u2019sotoh? - The Captain is a Starling and a mercenary. It is not uncommon for those of the Starling race to take up this kind of trade, but it is shocking that De\u2019Sotoh would agree to work with the Ancient Ones and spread their villany throughout the stars. She is well known in the galaxy of being cunning and heartless. Some say she was not always this way. \nWhat kind of story can we expect from the Core Game? - The Secrets of the Lost Station core game will first help train you on how to play the game before you embark on two fantastic campaign expeditions. The first campaign will peel back the veil of secrecy that shrouds Captain De\u2019sotoh as she hunts the Station, seeking to capture it as a prize for her master Sil\u2019ahan. In the second campaign you will encounter the full wrath brought upon by the Ancient Ones. Your only advantage is that both Sil\u2019ahan and De\u2019sotoh seem fearful of the Station. Perhaps if you can discover why, you may have a chance of surviving the encounter.\nThe Inside Scoop: Secrets of the Lost Station was conceptualized during the creation of Secrets of the Lost Tomb. Together their stories weave an Epic tapestry of adventure, treachery and survival. Once you have explored both sagas, you will truly understand the Secrets that each hold.\nOverview: Oblivion uncovers the secrets behind the war of the races and offers a new level of difficulty as you battle against those tainted by Cosmic Dark Energy. Beware of the Darc Arc, as its powers rival that of the station and it has the ability to assimilate its technology. Also unlock new Darc abilities and items that have untold power, but also great consequence.\nWhat is the DARC? - The DARC is a new race of beings born from a cosmic energy that has entered this universe by untold means. All the EOP knows about this energy is that it corrupts all those who are infected by it, its affinity skews towards evil and the source is a titan known as Cosmos.\nWho is Cosmos? - Cosmos is a god-like being that is more powerful than anything the EOP has ever encountered. His origins do not appear of this dimension. His intentions appear to be of self-preservation and assimilation by feeding off of planets and the beings that inhabit them. A unique characteristic of this titan is that he is so powerful that he ensnares small planets and uses them as a satellite shields around his body, connected by Darc energy, to use as defense against any that try to stand against him.\nWhat happens to those tainted by Darc energy? - Both organic and mechanical beings can be infected by Darc energy. Once they are affected, they become possessed by the symbiotic energy and are enveloped into the collective mind of Cosmos. In addition to cosmos having complete control over these creatures the Darc energy also has the ability to synergize with its host making them more powerful than their native state of existence.\nThere seems to be lots of extra components in this expansion, what do I get? This expansion has content equivalent to that of a Core game. As you explore the galaxy you will encounter planets tainted by the Darc. These encounters may yield the assimilation of infected rooms to be absorbed into the Station. There are also Upgrades and Items of \"Untold power and Consequence\". These resources are infused with Darc energy, if you use them in an attempt to gain the power for an ultimate victory... be careful, you may also end up paying the ultimate price!\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - The Story Arc in Oblivion features the climax of the Secrets of the Lost Stations Series. You will go on a cosmic \"CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE\" journey where the Station attempts to track down the Darc Arc in a race to rule the galaxy. During your journey you will be orbiting planets seeking resources to defeat the Darc Arc while trying to rid the planets of the corruption spread by the Darc Energy. This Epic conclusion will yield multiple boss battles including a station stand off and the ultimate battle against Cosmos. If your team can survive the encounter, you will ultimately discover the secret of the Lost Station... AND the Lost TOMB!!!\nThe Inside Scoop: There are multiple ways to defeat Cosmos, one of which depends on your ability to unite the races of the galaxy to form a collation. This special union is symbolized as part of the self-expanding nature of Secrets of the Lost Station by collecting the special tiles that are found in each of the expansions. Don't worry, you won't need every expansion to conquer the oblivion expansion, but if you do, you will be able to unlock a special ending!\n Overview: Machinations continues the Starling Saga cliffhanger introduced in the Core game. Further explore the backstory behind the Starlings and why members of their noble race would resort to piracy to survive. Reveal the story of Kon'hor the 1st mate of Captain DeSotoh and why he now must wear his exo-mech to survive.\nWho are the Starlings? - The Starlings are a noble high-born race reminiscent to a breed of space-elf-like creatures. Next to the Seraphic and the Ancient Ones, the Starlings are the third oldest race in the Stations universe. Similar to the other ancient races, their origins are not known by many, the only thing that is commonly known is that they are a very old race, not many of them exist in the universe, and they are well known for their sense of self-entitlement. They respect the other ancient races but look down on them nonetheless. The lower races however, they view them with such intense indifference that they see their freedom and culture are an opportunity for Starling expansion. This is why many of the Starlings have resorted to Mercenary tendencies. Another interesting point about the Starling culture is their breeding practices. Over the years, perfection has become a standard, and imperfection is not tolerated. Thus, the Starlings turned to science to engineer their culture to ensure not only survival but dominance. This point is exemplified by the existence of their caste system. At the top of the hierarchy stands the royals, which become captains of the pirate Armada. Next in line are the Quartermasters who act as the mutated bodyguards of the Royals. At the bottom of the social ladder are the Pirate Crew. These sniveling space lemmings are basically the Laser fodder of the race. However, be warned, what they lack in strength, they make up for in their numbers.\nWho is Kon\u2019hor? \u2013 Kon\u2019hor\u2019s is one of the only known humans to work in the service of the Starling race. He is also well known for his loyalty to Captain DeSotoh and the exo-skeleton that is required to keep him alive. The reason he requires the exoskeleton is both a story of legend and myth. The stories have been so wildly exaggerated over the years that the true story may be lost to history. One thing is for sure though, at the root of the story is Captain DeSotoh.\nWhat is Kon\u2019hor\u2019s relationship with Captain DeSotoh? \u2013 Kon\u2019hor is Captain DeSotoh\u2019s 1st mate, even though they command separate ships. *** The remainder of this section has been classified ***\nHow did the Starlings become enslaved by the Ancient Ones? Much of the Starling race are mercenaries. They have been under contract by the reigning queen of the Ancient Ones for hundreds of years, so it is a common misconception that they are enslaved, but in actuality, they are actually employed. The most infamous relationship is that between Captain DeSotoh and Sil\u2019ahan, empress of R\u2019lyeh. Their notorious partnership has held captive most of the galaxy for generations.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - The story arc in Machinations reveals the hidden story of Captain DeSotoh that is initially developed in the core game. You will also be introduced to the backstory of Cassy Opia and how she became a member of the EOP. At this point in the Epic saga you will have already experienced the treachery of Starling pirate mercenaries, however, this expansion will take all that you know of this race and blow it out the airlock! Expect the unexpected and brace for impact in this hard hitting expansion to Secrets of the Lost Station.\nThe Inside Scoop: If played in order, this story will reveal one of the 1st Special Paladin Tiles in the Story. Its function will be hidden for some time, but with great power comes great responsibility. Do you have what it takes to learn the secrets of the Starlings and survive?\nOverview: The challenges of Earth have become the challenges of Mars. You thought that part of your history was left in the past, until now, where you find you and your team caught between a long embattled civil war between the human resistance and their mortal enemies, the Draconians.\nWho are the Draconians? - For those that are fans of Secrets of the Lost Tomb, you already know the backstory. For those that are new to the lore, the Draconians are a race of half-human, half-dragon creatures. The pure bloods originally enslaved humans thousands of years ago, however after the uprising, their numbers were diminished so greatly the Dracs needed to breed with the humans for survival. Over the years their inherent magic ability has been almost bred out of existence. There are still a few that have enough blood of the elders running through their veins to harness the power of magic, but those with this ability are hunted with ruthless intent. Needless to say, the humans and the Dracs don't quite get along, in fact it's this relationship that brought the downfall of Earth and turned Mars into an Alien wasteland.\nWho is Kammora? \u2013 Kammora is one of the last Drac magic casters. She is the warrior princess of the wastelands and stands as the only opposition to \"King Rex\". Her might on the battlefield is well known on Mars... and will soon be known on the station!\nWho is Rex? \u2013 \"King Rex\" is the self-proclaimed ruler of Mars. He is the leader of the humans and of the Draconian resistance. Although he claims his manifesto is that of survival of humankind, his methods are more reminiscent of genocide, and his totalitarian style of rule has him more feared than respected. With the appearance of the Station over his planet, his aspirations to imposes his will now extend to the stars.\nWhy does the EOP have a Drac part of the team? Balthazar is a very unlikely ally of the EOP. His alliance makes him a lighting rod of hate from both narrow-minded humans and Draconians alike. The EOP however, has a great respect for their alien hero and are proud to call him a brother and advocate of peace. His skill on the battlefield is only matched by his understanding of alien technology.\nWhy are the Dracs and Humans at War? - For just about all of recorded history, from the time of the Elder Dragon Haltuth, though the reign of Emperor Dracus, to the current domination of Kammora, humans have been at war with the Dracs. The biggest difference is that now both human and Draconian are on the brink of extinction and both races are determined to help the other achieve this status. The root of this conflict for the humans is their long standing vendetta they have held against their original subjugators. For the Dracs, it's a matter of pride. They were born from the flame and being forced to breed with the low-born humans for survival makes them want to destroy them as a way of erasing the regrets of their past.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - The Station has sought refuge in orbit around Mars and its arrival activated local dormant technology. When a dirt-side portal activates and a moon-sized silhouette appears in the sky, it was only a matter of time before the Station would become enveloped in battle. Now that Rex has come to know of the station, he seeks to expand his influence beyond Mars. It won't be long until Kammora shows that she too has similar intentions, and with this, you know the EOP will be the last line of defense.\nThe Inside Scoop: A double boss expansion makes Resistance a must have. Double the story, double the threat. Do you have what it takes to survive and defend the Station from apocalyptic domination?\n Overview: Resurrection brings to life an evil thought destroyed over 1000 years ago. Battle against D.O.M.I.N.U.S. as he and his Cybermorph army try to take over the Station. A true battle of man vs machine in a struggle to either protect or enslave the galaxy.\nWho is D.O.M.I.N.U.S.? - The origin of the D.O.M.I.N.U.S. battle Satellite stems back to his creation by the humans back in circa 1980-90. But one can argue that he was actually his own creation. Humans originally created him as a Defensive Orbital Missile Interceptor and Neutralizer of the United States back during the Cold War against Russia. However, when his artificial intelligence prompted him to save Earth by eradicating its biggest threat, humans, the world found itself part of the Metal Dawn! Now 1000 years later, the Station faces a similar threat.\nWhat are the Cybermorphs? \u2013 Cybermorphs are the spawn of D.O.M.I.N.U.S. they are hive-minded machines that are sourced from local resources and used by D.O.M.I.N.U.S. to overpower local inhabitants as a means of protecting them. This artificial race consists of three designs, each with a specific purpose. First are the drones, they are flying sentinels that are the spotters for the stronger ground forces. They are many and come equipped with a mini railgun. Next are the Cyborgs, they are the soldiers of the A.I. army. They are nimble and come equipped with double Gatling guns. Next are the Exterminators. As the name would have it, these roving tanks have one purpose, to eliminate opposition. They are slow but very powerful enemies. And last, let's not forget D.O.M.I.N.U.S., he currently is an orbiting satellite, but you have a feeling there is more than meets the eye...\nWhy was D.O.M.I.N.U.S. orbiting Mars? \u2013 You can only speculate how he arrived around the red planet. With the limited intel you were able to gather from the Station archives, all indications are that he was destroyed back on Earth over a millennia ago.\nWho is T.I.M.? - You found T.I.M floating in an escape pod drifting in a distant orbit around Mars. When you brought the pod aboard the Station there was nothing inside it accept a silver metallic liquid. Once you entered the lower orbit of Mars, the liquid morphed into the shape of a human-like figure. Jack was the first to find him. Initially his programming was still activating, so when he introduced himself as a Technological Intelligent Mechanism, Jack just referred to him as the acronym T.I.M. and that is what the E.O.P. has called him ever since. His is believed to be an ally, and a very resourceful one at that. With limited resources, you need all the help you can get. So fingers crossed, he seems to be on your side, for now.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? - Just When you think things can't get any worse... During a recent battle you hurriedly requested Darwin warp the Station to the nearest Human-sympathetic world. As luck would have it, you arrived at your own home world of Mars. Shortly after arriving, a sensor sweep of the area accidentally awakens dormant technology. Your question of what you activated was quickly answered as the portal activation system was hacked and the Station becomes overrun with Cyborgs. You have become accustomed to fighting aliens with enhanced technical weapons... but fighting enemies that are themselves technical weapons, is a whole other story!\nThe Inside Scoop: D.O.M.I.N.U.S. is one of two cross-over bosses of Secrets of the Lost Station. He was originally designed for a separate game called Metal Dawn that was designed earlier in 2017. He became such a beloved enemy of the Epic roster, we decided to extend his story into Secrets of the Lost Station.\n Overview: Rhaz-Azul Ahmet, an ancient evil well known by the EOP, exists in the future and in the past. He has arrived on the station to impose his will on the universe. Battle against this foe of legend, protect the station from his Fallen Seraphic minions, and learn more about how the Secrets of the Lost Tomb and Station are interconnected!\nWho are the Seraphic? \u2013 In the Secrets of the Lost Station universe, the Seraphic are the race with the highest affinity towards good and they live in opposition to the only race to rival their inherent power, the Ancient Ones. On the surface, the Seraphic seem to be a race of benevolent, god-like beings, living in a utopian society. But the E.O.P., having firsthand experience of their culture, know this perception is only partially true. The only way this \u201cgolden\u201d race is able to maintain its prestige and power is through a strict code of rules, which if broken, yield an ultimate consequence. To maintain a perfect society, there is little margin for error, thus most punishment usually results in banishment or exile. For non-Seraphic races that are exiled, they are cast out, which in most cases, results in death as these adopted lifeforms were usually unfit to survive on their own. For the Seraphic that are banished, they are no longer considered part of the society, and to ensure they are no longer seen as representation of the ideal race, they have their most distinguishable feature removed, their wings! Now they must live the rest of their life marked as \u201cunworthy\u201d. Over the eons, this practice has resulted in the unintentional creation of the counterculture known as the Fallen.\nWhy did the Seraphic save the Humans from Mars? \u2013 The Seraphic by nature look to bring balance to the universe. Those that are worthy of being saved from overwhelming opposition are granted safe passage to the Seraphic home world to rehabilitate and become emissaries of peace. It is not a surprise that the E.O.P. qualified for this stay of extinction, as they had acted as the protectorate of humanity for centuries. However, not all Seraphic agree with the decision to have saved this select group of humans, and in the end, some actually blame the humans for having brought the destruction to the Seraphic home world.\nWho is Rhaz-Azul? \u2013 For the fans of Secrets of the Lost Tomb, you know Rhaz as the iconic pharaoh-villain from the first Scenario of the Core Game. For those new to the Secrets of the Lost Station universe, you will come to know Rhaz as a futuristic Dark Paladin, hell-bent on revenge against the humans. His character Arc is one of the most dynamic and twisted reveals of the Secrets storyline!\nWho is Feonix, and why does she not have wings? \u2013 It is true that although Feonix does not have wings, she is in fact a Seraphic. To be more specific, a Fallen. She is an amazing warrior, but very secretive of her past. Some of the E.O.P. know of her deeds and why she was banished, but none dare to speak of it. Some remain silent out of respect, but most do so out of fear.\nWho is Brey\u2019del? \u2013 Breydel is a powerful friend of the humans. She had been completing her training to become a paladin when the Seraphic home world was attacked. She never completed her training, but was successfully able to find the Seraphic caravan and reunite with her father one last time before the final fateful attack by the Ancient Ones. She may be young and inexperienced, but one day her greatness will be known throughout the entire galaxy.\nWhat kind of story can we expect from this expansion? \u2013 The Seraphic story line revels a key narrative that joins the secrets of the Lost Tomb with that of the Lost Station. Many backstory plot lines will be uncovered as you seek to protect the Station from the fury of Rhaz-Azul. On the horizon of your timeline, you see the past and the future converge. Can you muster the courage to press on? Will you look into the mirror of fate and survive? Have your brothers in arms taken up arms against you? The only way to find out these answers, and many, many more, is to step through the portal to discover the Secrets of the Lost Station!\nThe Inside Scoop: Rhaz-Azul was a keystone character from Secrets of the Lost Tomb. He was such a recognizable boss from the franchise we had to have him make a triumphant return in Secrets of the Lost Station.\nAll shipping will be charged in the pledge manager for this campaign. Below are the estimated shipping costs for the different pledge levels.

Sunday dinners, deli runs... and \"Pizza Night\" was almost every night. A big family with seven hungry sons, we were always fighting over that eighth and final slice.\nNow we have our own families, and we can eat as much pizza as we'd like, but something seemed missing. Maybe it was the nostalgia... or maybe just a few tastebuds. Whatever it was, we found ourselves putting hot sauce on everything... especially pizza!\nThere's Sriracha for Asian cuisine, Cholula for everything south of the border, but what about Italian food? How about a legitimate hot sauce made for pizza, pasta, and paninis? A lightbulb went off, and \"The Original Italian Hot Sauce\" was born.\nWe've spent the last few years perfecting our recipe and jumping through all the necessary hoops to get Italian Hot Sauce ready for market. It's too great an idea and too damn delicious not to share with the world. So, here we are! With your help, we can keep the dream alive!\nOur handcrafted recipe begins with red hot cayenne peppers, aged to perfection to ensure a rich and earthy taste. We add the classic Italian flavors of garlic and oregano to create the ultimate hot sauce for pizza, subs, and all things Italian food. Buon appetito!\nMade with only five simple ingredients (peppers, garlic, oregano, vinegar, and salt), Italian Hot Sauce is preservative free, gluten free, fat free, sugar free, non-GMO, vegan, all natural, and hippy friendly.\nOur ultimate goal is to bring Italian Hot Sauce to every table across America. Your generous pledge will allow us to:\nOrder bottles, equipment, and ingredients for larger scale productions.\nProduce thousands of bottles of Italian Hot Sauce for commercial sale.\nDevelop an impressive online presence and social following.\nPresent and contribute to trade shows, local festivals, stores, and restaurants. \nThank you for helping our hot sauce dreams become a reality!

The book contains a series of five or more adventures set in the Hockomock swamp in Massachusetts to be used with 7th edition Call of Cthulhu RPG.\nThis product is produced under license from Chaosium Inc. (www.chaosium.com). Call of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\nThe Devil's Swamp includes adventures that can usually be run in one or two evenings. They can be run as independent one-off adventures or strung together as a mini-campaign using the same characters. All of the stories are set in the Hockomock which literally means 'the place where spirits live.'\nAs a member of the Bridgwater Preservation Society, you and your friends investigate the stories people plague the city and area with. The stories the police won't investigate, or quit on way too easily. Living next to the Hockomock, at the heart of what will later become known as the Bridgewater Triangle, gives you easy access to delve into any of the stories that arise. \nThe Hockomock Swamp, named the Devil's Swamp by the original English settlers, is a known site for paranormal activity. Everything from Bigfoot, aliens, thunder birds, huge snakes, strange lights, Puckwudgies, Native American curses, cultists, mutilated animals and more have been reported in the area. So join me and my team as we help unravel the Mythos tied to the mysteries of the Hockomock.\nThe Devil's Swamp is written by Ben Burns, features the artwork of Evgeny Maloshenkov, the cartography of Bryan McWhirter, player handouts by Elizabeth Bakowski and edited by Alex Burns. In other words the entire team that produced The Star on the Shore. We are the same company, just a change of name.\nJoin us in completing this great adventure book, so that we can share it with the world. Please back our Kickstarter today to help make these adventures a reality.\nThe funds will go toward the artwork already commissioned, extra adventures by guest writer(s), allow for more artwork, commissioning of the cartography for the maps, the editing, printing and shipping.\nStretch Goals\n$5,000: We successfully funded!!

Evgeny Maloshenkov was the main artist for The Star on the Shore and will be doing 90% of the art work in Devil's Swamp. He is a professional artist from Ukraine. He now lives in Kiev working for Frogwares doing software CGI art. He still freelances commission work for several companies including Chaosium as well as New Comet Games. You can see more of his work at his portfolio site here: emaloshenkov.carbonmade.com\nPage Count\nWhile we will not guarantee any minimum page count, the first 5 adventures are almost finished, and the book is currently around 60-70 pages. The more people pledge, the more adventures we will add in and the longer the book will be. If we hit the stretch goal for 6 adventures, it will probably be 70-85 pages. If we hit the stretch goal for 7 adventures It will expand to be 85-100 pages. If we hit the stretch goal for 8 adventures, it will expand to be 100-120 pages. If we get all the way to 9 adventure modules, we could push this well over 130 pages!\nThe delivery time for the books includes the anticipation of the extra adventures.\nGuest Writers\nOur first guest writer is Brian Courtemanche. He will be joining our team at the $10,000 stretch goal level. He wrote one of the adventures in the award winning 'Doors To Darkness' book produced by Chaosium. In addition, Brian has been in Arkham Now; Terrors From Beyond; House of R'lyeh; Atomic Age Cthulhu; and More Adventures in Arkham Country for the Miskatonic River Press.\nOur $20,000 stretch goal level will open up the 7th Adventure. This author worked with Brian on the award winning 'Doors to Darkness' book, Christopher Smith Adair.  https://csmithadair.com/  His works include A Cold Fire Within, Atomic Age Cthulhu, New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley, Strange Aeons II, and articles in the Arkham Gazette.\nOur $30,000 and $40,000 stretch goal scenario authors will remain under wraps until we draw closer.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is almost no risk at all unless we sell a million or more copies, then there might be some delay in shipping, but I am willing to take on that challenge. Otherwise I do not see any real chance for any delays barring real life tragedy, or perhaps the stars aligning and Cthulhu rising. \n\nThe adventures are almost finished. The initial art is complete and the artist, Evgeny, is standing by ready to draw any stretch goal art. Our cartographer, Bryan, is ready to start on the maps as soon as we fund.

News@11 is a cyclical story-telling game for 4 to 11 anchors. Fill in cue cards, incorporate the topics on them into your segment as you build the story. Stories from the morning news come back in the afternoon and evening, getting stranger and more tangled each time. No points, no scoring, just a hilarious time telling the news! Lights, Camera, you\u2019re on in 3, 2, 1...\n  Learning to play News@11 is super easy!\n           Want to learn more? Awesome. Here's a link to the rulebook for you readers... and a gameplay video below for everyone else.\nCheck out the Rule Book Here\nTo help you get a feel for how the game works, we gathered up some friends and recorded a play through for you. Enjoy!\nFor this demo, we only filled in 1 cue card each (to keep things moving). Normally you'll fill in 1 blank on each card during setup\nNews@11 will come in a sturdy, portable box -- easy to bring with you, and has room to sleeve your cards. Besides a full color rule book, each box is packed with high quality components:\nCue Cards (130) - Every card is unique! Each card has 1 topic supplied by us and 2 prompts to customize. You'll fill these in with your group's topics each time you play.\nSegment Cards (10) - The Lead Anchor uses these to pick which Segment each Anchor delivers during a broadcast.\nProducer Cards (6) - The Producer uses these to help the game move smoothly - or to cause a little chaos. No talking required to use the Producer cards!\nMarker (1) - A permanent marker, used to fill in the Cue Cards. Style TBD \nRulebook - Learn to play quickly with game play examples.\nTechnical Details: All cards are 63 x 88mm. The box will come with room for the cards to be sleeved.\nWe have 2 reward tiers available, depending on if you want to get 1 or 2 copies of News@11. Want 1 for friends, 1 for family? Got 2 gaming groups? Planning to make 1 clean and 1 naughty? Great! Get 2 copies of News@11 delivered to your door.\nShipping will be added on based on your country after you select your pledge level.\nShipping to Canada, UK, EU, and Australia will be Customs Friendly and should not incur import duty.\nIf we hit our funding goal, we'll be able to put even more great content in the box for you! More to come...\nWhat are stretch goals? Great question! Once a Kickstarter project reaches its initial funding goals, stretch goals give us new targets to strive for to make News@11 even better!\nThe Tabletop gaming community is thriving! It's been an incredible experience as a publisher watching the community grow so much over the past few years. It's an exciting time for us as gamers with so many unique and interesting games, and I'm honored to have you consider News@11 as one of those options. \nHere are just a few reasons why we feel this project is worth your support: \nApproachable Gameplay - You can learn News@11 in just moments and get right into playing. The game is designed to give structure and flow to your experience while leaving room for players to take the story where they want it to go.\nHigh Customizability - As you play, you're creating a customized copy of the game that's unique to your group. The topics you add can be anywhere on the spectrum of family friendly to edgy; it's up to you!\nSupporting Independent Game Design and Publishing - Everything you see in this project is the product of a massive effort by several passionate, independent creators. The efforts that went into the game design, graphic design and publishing are all crafted by individuals who absolutely love our hobby. Without you, we wouldn't be able to bring these creations to life!\nWe're excited to partner with the Infectious Play team to bring you News@11. It's been great working with the designers (Jon Gilmour, John Burns, Ian Moss, Travis Magrum, James Schoch, Earl Tietsort). They've worked hard to refine the game's flow and tune the content to help facilitate the best possible story-telling experience. Peter Wocken,  our veteran graphic artist, helped make sure the look and feel of the components make gameplay as smooth as possible.\nGreetings News Anchors!   \nFor those who are new to our games, welcome! For those who have supported us in the past, it's great to have you back! We're thrilled to be back on Kickstarter with our 9th project! Starting with Legacy: Gears of Time in 2012, all the way through Sagrada and Dome Crushers most recently, running these projects have each been incredible experiences, and I cannot wait to see where this one goes! Partnering with Infectious Play, News@11 is our 7th game (not counting expansions) and we're really proud to share it with you. I'm looking forward to communicating with you throughout the project and after. Please reach out directly in a message or in the comments if you have a question or concern -- I'll do everything I can to make your backer experience on this project the best it can be!

Coupling that with its approachable ruleset, Mint Delivery is a great tool for introducing new players to the genre of pick up and deliver.\nCheck out the Mint Delivery rules to see more detail about what makes Mint Delivery tick.\nAll Cards contained within a copy of Mint Delivery are printed upon Premium 305GSM blue core card stock. Mint and Truck Tokens are made of Wood and all other tokens are made from 2mm thick chipboard.

Similar to Mint Works, even though it's small there's a lot going on.\" - MichaelDyrud\nYou can download the rules here\nIn Mint Delivery, players take the role of a mint delivery truck driver, driving around the area taking orders for mints, then delivering them. Each player has two actions on their turn, such as moving, loading their truck, and upgrading the mints they are carrying. Once enough orders have been taken, the game ends.\nWhoever has fulfilled the highest value of orders will be deemed the employee of the month and win. \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nDiscord\nMint Delivery was created after the success of Mint Works, with the idea to introduce another mechanism to non-gamers while still being interesting enough for gamers to want to bring it to the table.\nI wanted to come up with another quick easy to teach game for a mechanism that I felt didn't have a lot of options that didn't take a long time to play, while also straying away from games with direct conflict between players.\nPick up and deliver seemed like a really good place to start. Since the vast majority of these types of games tend to be quite long, and have a lot of gotcha kinds of rules.\nThat gave me this set of constraints that I utilized for making Mint Delivery:\nHas to fit in a mint tin \nHas to be taught as easy or easier than Mint Works \nHas to play quickly \nWith those constraints in mind, I started the task. \nSince it was to fit in a mint tin, I decided to continue the same visual style that we used with Mint Works, and also to continue the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. It seemed logical to me that Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has started to branch out and provide mints to more than just the local neighborhoods.\nThat gave a great foundation for the supply/demand chain that would be the foundation of the pick up and deliver mechanism. I didn't want the mint requests to be too flat, so i added some \"improved\" type mints to the mix at that point. Which essentially gives us 3 forms of currency instead of just one.\nFrom that point, it was all about creating orders for mints, a few locations to pick mints up from, and a map to lay it all out. And that's where we are now.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Delivery that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Delivery as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advance copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advance copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nPhoto Credit Eric from whatsericplaying.com\nBecause Mint Delivery is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs.\nThat said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US. Here is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nWe have partnered up with Mr. B Games to assist in the fulfillment process to ensure that everyone gets their rewards quickly, correctly and in great condition.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Delivery before the game makes its way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email md.retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe will also be funding a re-print of Mint Works with this campaign, you can add extra copies of Mint Works at $10 each during the campaign, or later on during the pledge manager.\n\nNote: Any add-ons that you select will be delivered at the same time as the rest of your rewards from this campaign.\nSince the map doesn't change from game to game, we came up with the idea of using a mat for the game to play on during demos, it worked out so well that we have decided to add custom mint delivery mats on as add-ons to any pledge level as well.\nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of two Mad Scientists myself and Mel (you might recognize him as Mort) and our awesome testing group. \nI'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them. I have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations.\nThey are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects.

Explore new worlds to grow your knowledge and Adapt to living in the varied habitats you discover. Expand your presence in the cluster with new colonies and Exploit the metal and energy resources you find. Ally yourself with assorted interstellar species and Acquire covert missions to increase your influence. Do all of this and you could become the dominant species in this cluster and to begin your reach into the galaxy.\n5-player Setup\nWe love the scope and majesty of 4X games but don't look forward to hours, or even days, that it can take to play the best of the genre and we weren't wild about all the extermination. Game designer Levi Mote set out to create a friendly 4X experience in an hour-long game and, after years of development and play testing, Horizons has proven itself to be just that game \u2013 a Euro-friendly, decision-driven, 4X-style game that 2 to 5 players can enjoy in about an hour. \nHorizons has multiple paths to victory. Will you explore and ally your way to knowledge-win, or expand and exploit the worlds for a build-win? Perhaps allies and covert missions will bring you a missions-win, or you'll balance all three paths to create a well-rounded dominion. The choice is yours and the stars await. \nOne of the many Mission Cards.\n  We turned over one of our preview prototypes to Jon Gets Games and he delivered an amazing 1-hour video that takes you step-by-step through a three-person game of Horizons.\n                        Rahdo runs through the prototype! (Note: we will be adding player count numbers on Mission cards to tell you which Mission cards to play with according to player count.)\n\nAfter we reach our projects $20,000 funding goal, we've got a long list of stretch goals planned that will, hopefully, entice you and your friends to support Horizons. Spread the word, share our project with your friends, and let\u2019s see if we can unlock things like asymmetrical player powers, more ally species, new suns for your star cluster, and lovely component upgrades.\n                                           We're looking at alternatives for the punched player board that fit within the budget. For now, it will not be punched through in the final version until we can provide you with something we can all appreciate. \nHorizons will come in a box similar in size to Stone Age and will come with all of the components shown below, plus whatever you unlock through stretch goals.\nUnlocked Stretch Goals added to the game:\n6 New Star Classes, O, B, A, F, K and M\nBlackcore and Linen Finish Cards\n5 Optional Species Ally Cards with Exterminate Gameplay\n5 New Asymmetrical Starter Ally Cards\nUnique Faction Art for each Player Board\n5 Asymmetrical Player Boards\n10 New Mission Cards\n5 New Ally Cards\nAs with our other recent projects, Sailing Toward Osiris, Food Truck Champion, and Valeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost, we'll be working with our European partners to produce Horizons in multiple languages. You'll be able to select the German, French, Spanish, or English version when we send out the backer surveys after the project is successfully funded.\n    Rahdo's final thoughts! (Note: we will be adding player count numbers on Mission cards to tell you which Mission cards to play with according to player count.)\n                                                                                                                                                             This is a full PNP file for Horizons. It included the rules, 35 double-sided hex tiles, 60 cards, and 5 player boards.  It is 113MB. There are bound to be a few adjustments as we close in on the final rules and graphic design, but this will give you a good look into the components and concepts of Horizons.\n                                                It's always great to try before you buy, so why not give Horizon's a try on Tabletop Simulator. This build was created by Alexander, a frequent backer of our project, a fan of our games, and a skilled modder.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       We do everything we can to keep shipping costs low and we subsidize a substantial portion of the actual shipping fees we are charged when we fulfill your rewards.\n  This project is EU Friendly, Canada Friendly, and Australia Friendly. Rewards to backers in those countries will be shipped from fulfillment hubs within their regional borders. We pay VAT when we import the games and utilizing the shipping hubs means you do not have to pay customs fees.\n\nGamers in Brazil, Mexico, and Russia, have a much higher risk of package \"loss\" once it reaches the local post offices. For this reason, we need to ship your packages by a registered delivery service like FedEx, UPS, DHL, or Global Priority. The higher costs we incur are reflected in the shipping fees added automatically when you make your pledge.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of our games to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release the regular retail versions into distribution, giving you a head start on your competition. You can see the Retailer 6-Pack pledge level in the right-side column of this project page.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and its own budget for production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively.\n\nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...\n\n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower delivered to most backers 2 months early and will hit retail stores on September 20th.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost shipped to 80% of backers for on-time delivery in August. The remaining 20% will begin shipping in September. Valeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost will hit retail stores in October.\nFood Truck Champion is at the printer and we expect to deliver to backers in October.

We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called PlaytestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis.

We realize that the publication of a tabletop game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running successful Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers started the gaming frenzy on Kickstarter), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as Executive Producer at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful tabletop games (Sunrise City and the \"Valeria\" series of games).\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. Whether the news is good or bad, you can expect us to report it honestly and openly.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Horizons are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We are working with publishing partners in Germany, France, and Spain, to bring Horizons to a wide audience, expanding our economies of scale in production and logistics.\n\n5. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Premium PNP", "descp": "A Premium PNP PDF file with final print-ready rules and game components for the ENGLISH version of Horizons.

This Master will produce an Element Token every round that will be allocated to a Building.  \n  Each player gets to draft 3 permanent Artefacts at the beginning of the game. They sit on an extra player board provided with this expansion.\nEach of these Artefacts will provide powerful and asymmetric abilities to all players around the table.\n  In this expansion, we wanted to move the type of decision you make from \"attack vs defense\" strategy to a more elaborate combo-oriented thinking.\nMost Units now carry an extra function that can be activated using the Elements on your buildings!\n  At the beginning of the game, everyone is given a God randomly. If we manage to unlock more than the 4 base Gods, each player is actually given 2 Gods to choose from. The special effect of this God is immediately available as soon as you reach level 3!\n                                                                       Congratulation for unlocking Borr, father of Odin!\nLucky Duck Games Facebook Fan Page is here. \nLucky Duck Games Twitter Profile is here.\nVikings Gone Wild Official Facebook Forum is here.\n                             This pledge contains:\n   - Masters of Elements Expansion\n   - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n   - Money-back Guarantee\nThis pledge is ideal for someone who already bought the base game on Kickstarter or in retail and is looking for a deeper and more strategic experience of the game.\n  This pledge contains:   \n  - Vikings Gone Wild (Base Game - Retail Version)\n  - Masters of Elements Expansion\n  - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n  - Money-back Guarantee\nThis pledge is ideal for someone who has not bought the base game yet and wants to experience the most strategic experience this game has to offer.\nThe Base Game included in this pledge is the Retail Version, without any Kickstarter content from the first campaign.\n  This pledge contains:\n  - Vikings Gone Wild (Base Game - Retail Version)\n  - Masters of Elements Expansion\n  - It's a Kind of Magic Expansion\n  - Guild Wars Expansion\n  - Ragnarok Expansion (Solo/Coop experience)\n  - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n  - Money-back Guarantee\nGet yourself the full range of experiences this game system has to offer. From the spell oriented strategy of It's a Kind of Magic to the 2 vs 2 mode of the Guild Wars expansion, or as a cooperative/solo experience to survive the flow of the Undead Army in Ragnarok, you will get it all in its beautiful Viking Glory!\nThe Base Game included in this pledge is the Retail Version, without any Kickstarter content from the first campaign.\n     We are very excited to announce the release of 3 unique Booster Packs. Each pack is unique (no random cards) and always composed this way:  \n1x Divine Favor \n1x Artefact \n10x Unit Cards \nWe have built one pack per Element. We are leaving you the surprise to open them. Want to bet what is inside? :)\nPS: $12 gives you 3 Packs. That is all you need.\nPS2: These cards are unique and totally different from any cards we will offer you in Stretch Goal or in the expansion.\n   We heard it during the entire campaign: \"Give us the big box\" :D  \nWe wanted to make sure we would provide a box big enough to cover this expansion and any future ones (yes there could be more!). So we are producing a custom-sized box almost 2 times higher than the original box in order to contain everything:  \nAll cards.\nAll boards. \nAll tokens. \nAll rulebooks. \nAll neoprene boards (yes, you read right!).\nWe provide dividers by expansions and by type of cards, depending on the way you prefer to sort your cards!  \n  In Vikings Gone Wild, players take the role of heads of clans fighting against each other to prove to the gods who is the best.    \nDuring each turn, you play the cards in your hand to buy Units or Defense cards, erect Buildings and attack other players. You will have to find the right balance between investing in your economy (buildings, specials cards) and growing your army! \n     It's a Kind of Magic expansion introduces original core concepts through new Buildings, Units and a new type of card: Spells!    \n  It focuses on deck manipulation and will transform your experience of Vikings Gone Wild in a very interesting, magical, way!\n     Guild Wars expansion introduces new core concepts through new Buildings, Units and Defenses!    \n  A brand new 2 vs 2 mode is at the heart of this expansion, but most cards can be used in a regular game.\n    The Ragnarok expansion is a solo or cooperative expansion for Vikings Gone Wild.        \n  In order to win, you have to defeat the Undead Army before your time runs out! Will you be able to save us all? \n   This 1st Season Pack contains the 110 Kickstarter Exclusive cards of the previous Kickstarter! We saved you the price of the box (who needs boxes anyway) to put this pack at a very affordable price! \n     We have selected the perfect fit sleeves for you - BCW 58x89 Sleeves.\n\nAdding sleeves to a Kickstarter adds a fair layer of logistic complexity, but many struggled to find the right fit for this game before so we decided to do this for you. \n This add-ons won't add any shipping cost, no matter the quantity you pick or the pledge you select. \n $5 per pack of 100 Sleeves (2x50). \n $20 per pack of 500 Sleeves (10x50).\nCards quantities per game:\nBase Game: 220 cards\nIt's a Kind of Magic: 110 cards\nGuild Wars: 110 cards\nRagnarok: 55 cards\nKS 1st Season: 110 cards\n5th Viking: 55 cards\n3x Boosters: 36 cards\nMasters of Elements: 219 as of Stretch Goal #27, can we get the last one?\n  Many of you have asked for ways to upgrade their gears, and more specifically their player board! We love neoprene mats ourselves, so it did not take too much convincing to put us at work on the idea.  \nBringing these playmats to life, we wanted to bring something different enough that the upgrade would feel truly special. Mateusz spent some time redesigning our standard player pad and came up with 4 unique ones!\nThis add-on contains:\nx1 Thor Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Grendel Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Ragnar Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Valkyrie Neoprene Playmat\n  We first wanted to have both mats joined into one large play-mat. But looking at every single play-tests we ran, tables were never big enough to put the Artefact board on top or at the bottom of the base game player mat. So we decided to separate them to give the freedom of arranging your table the way you want!\nThis add-on contain:\n4x Masters of Elements Artefacts Neoprene Playmats\n  Many of you have asked for that 5th player expansion! It took us a while to find a proper way to include only a cardboard mat. Since we will include for free a 5th Artefact cardboard pad in the Master of Elements, you only need the base game player mat.\nThis add-ons contain:\n1x Base Game cardboard player mat.\n55 cards (including 1 Starting Deck, more Missions, Units, Defenses, Odin's Path, etc).\n  If you simply want to upgrade your 5th player to the full neoprene experience, this add-on is for you!\n1x Hel's Neoprene Playmat.\n1x Masters of Elements Artefact Neoprene Playmat.\n  How to add an Add-On to my pledge?\nIt depends if you already pledged or not.\nIf you didn't already pledged, then when you do, simply change the pledge amount. You just need to add to that amount the total cost of all the add-ons you want. For instance, if you want to pledge for the Masters of Elements Expansion alone at $35, but you also want to add one pack of 500 sleeves at $20, then you'll select the $35 pledge, and change the automatically filled up \"$35\" by 35 + 20 = \"$55\".\n If you want to add something to your pledge, then go to this page which lets you manage your pledge, and change the amount. You can do so by adding the total cost of all the add-ons you want. If you chose the $35 pledge for the Masters of Elements Expansion alone and decide to add one pack of 500 sleeves at $20, then change \"$35\" by 35 + 20 = \"$55\".\n                                               Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 notre distributeur Atalia, qui s'occupe de la livraison de tous les jeux Vikings Gone Wild en France et en Belgique, nous pouvons offrir les frais de port pour la France et la Belgique dans certaines conditions.

All we need is your support!!!\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nBones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade. Inexpensive, high quality, soft gaming models that are easy and fun to paint and won't break when you actually use them for games! \n  All Backers must use the Reaper Pledge Manager to select their rewards and provide shipping information\n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories: \n1) Overall Non-completion \n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates \n3) We do not produce a specific model or change a specific model\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and delays. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is with within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored. \n \nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by July 31 2018 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after July 31, 2018. \n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after July 31, 2018) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit. \n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges. \n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer. \n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Europe, Africa, Middle East, Russia", "descp": "2017 Bones 4 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 4 Kickstarter.

If you\u2019re already a fan, now is the time to complete your collection!\nIf you have been waiting for the opportunity to get in on Cthulhu Wars, this is your best opportunity!\nCthulhu Wars is a competitive strategy game in which 2 to 8 players face-off to determine the fate of the planet. You'll recruit cultists and summon monsters, cast spells, open interdimensional gates, and awaken your colossal unearthly Great Old One!\nEvery game is different - as you play, you unlock new spellbooks, giving new amazing powers unique to each faction. Play is asymmetric - every faction has a unique set of rules and victory conditions.\nThe core game offers an asymmetric, two to four player strategy experience (up to eight players with expansions). Each player controls a faction of cosmic evil competing with its rivals for the remains of the defeated, dying Earth. Players push and battle each other to control areas, build gates, gain power, achieve personal goals, and unlock special abilities in the form of spellbooks to render their own faction supreme. The miniatures are conspicuously monstrous, appealing and evocative. \n                                                                                                                                                                                    Arthur said click a link.

Cthulhu Wars is a large, heavy, board game (about 5kg or 11lbs). The shipping prices reflect this.\n  For most regions, including Europe, the VAT and any import taxes are included in the shipping cost. There are some countries in which we cannot include import taxes. These include Central and South America, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, UAE, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. If this changes and we are able to pay for your import taxes on your behalf, we will update you, but we cannot do so at this time.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first Kickstarter.

That\u2019s it! Cards can be played as treasure or as an action. Every card has a different ability, and the first player to reach 21 treasure is the winner.\nNinjitsu! is fully compatible with Scuttle! - just shuffle the two games together and you're ready to go! Itintroduces hidden treasures, which are played face-down in front of you. These can be stolen by your opponents, but watch out! Some hidden treasures are trapped; swipe the wrong card, and pay the consequences!\nCheck out the free print-and-play!\nEveryone who gets the game through Kickstarter will also be sent a special promo card: Jellybean Ninja. \nThis colorful character lets you guess what treasure you\u2019re stealing. If you\u2019re correct, you are rewarded with a great bounty!\nOur stretch goals will unlock other promo cards as well - check out the stretch goal chart below! \nLike all Jellybean Games, Ninjitsu! is simple enough for young gamers to enjoy, but with enough strategy to engage grown-ups as well. The hidden treasures add a unique bluffing element to the game and keep everyone engaged at all times. \nIs that treasure going to guarantee your opponent victory...or is it a carefully laid trap? There\u2019s only one way to find out! \nThe Traps! expansion offers 14 new cards, including a whole new type of trap: cards with long-lasting effects! Stealing treasure has never been so risky, with new traps which prevent you from drawing, swiping, or even playing hidden treasures of your own!\nWith more treasure, more ninjas (the fiendish Master of Tricks, the devious Master Thief, and the dastardly Master of Escape) and more ways to bamboozle your opponents, this Ninjitsu! expansion will totally change the way you play the game. \nAn ancient grimoire has been uncovered, unleashing the secrets of elemental magic! These 15 cards add a unique twist to the game, and can be shuffled into any game of Ninjitsu! OR Scuttle! to add a little magic touch.\nGive yourself the power of Flight, Alchemy, Healing, and more! The magical tome\u2019s abilities will leave your opponents stunned as you duplicate your cards, transmute treasures, and invisibly steal their cards\u2026\nCombining either Traps! or the Supernatural expansion with Ninjitsu! adds the fourth suit to the game, which means the game can be used as a standard deck of playing cards.\nSeize the powers of the elements with these unique player abilities! Master the forces of nature to crush your opponents.\nAt the start of each game, each player is dealt an element - they choose which of the two elemental powers to use and play the rest of the game with that ability.\nWill you use the powers of Fire to protect your treasure, or to steal cards from your opponents? Will your Earthly abilities give you a boost at the start of the game, or grow your treasures? Will the power of Heart be enough to overcome your opponents?

As you can see from the review copies, the game is fully designed, the rules rule, and the art is all complete; all we want now is your help to print the game and distribute it around the world.\nNinjitsu! is the fifth project from Jellybean Games. The company was formed to bring you awesome experiences for gamer kids (and their parents) which can also be enjoyed by the wider gaming community.\nOur aim is to make games for kids that grown-ups love.\nAll the money we raise will go towards making Ninjitsu! even better, and furthering development on all our future games.\nIf you like the game, please support the project (every dollar helps!) and tell your friends...especially if they have kids, know kids, love kids, or love great games and gorgeous art!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur first game, Scuttle!, delivered on-time to most backers (and only slightly late to the rest). \nOur second game, Dracula\u2019s Feast, is now shipping.\nOur third game, The Lady and the Tiger, is about to hit the printer.\n\nWe have learned a lot of valuable lessons from our first few campaigns, and we are confident that this game will arrive by the anticipated delivery date at the very latest.

This game was inspired by my love of animals and food. I created \"bite me cutie\" as a way to bring awareness to endangered animal species. Each character aka CUTIE has a story that comes from the heart... My heart.\n  Every design from \"bite me cutie\" is created and designed by, Thien Vuong. They all have a cute lore.\n  Every game package comes with 3 decks: \"CUTIE DECK\", \"FLAVOR DECK\", & \"EFFECT DECK\". The goal of the game is to collect the most cuties by the end of the game, the player with the highest tallied cutie class points wins!\n   OFFICIAL HOUSE RULES:\n* At the beginning of your turn draw one card out of the FLAVOR DECK & EFFECT DECK.\n* When your turn ends say \"Done\" to let the other players know that your turn is over.\n* Players can have a maximum of 10 cards in hand, every card after that must be discarded until you have only 10 cards in hand.\n* When it's your turn you can use as many EFFECT CARDS & COLLECT as many cuties as you can afford. STRATEGIZE!\n* When you COLLECT a CUTIE it is replaced by another CUTIE CARD from the CUTIE DECK. Rinse & repeat until all CUTIES are COLLECTED.\n* When a cutie's bite point is reduced to zero its' class points will not count until healed by a buff card.\n* Each deck has a discard pile next to them, once you run out of cards from the respected decks shuffle the discard pile to have a new deck to draw from.\n* The player with the highest class points wins! They become titled the \"Cutie Chef\" for this battle.\n* If any players have the same amount of class points the player with the most cuties & and matching flavors win!\n* When the last cutie card is collected no more cards can be drawn from the deck and everyone has one last turn to deal out their trap and buff cards to knockout and heal their cuties. Trap cards that bring cuties back to field are negated.\n STORY LORE.\nIn the not so distant future, a world where many animals have faced extinction, over poaching, and harsh environment, exists \"bite me cutie\". Cuties are creatures made from the SPIRAL DNA of animals long gone by imprinting the DNA traits of that animal into what ever object the spiral DNA is placed on. The first CUTIE was created when our mascot \"CUTIE\" aka a slice of cheese pizza was infused with a happy trait. After that humans went over and beyond experimenting with infinite combinations to make all kinds of cuties in order to cope with the loss of real animals in their current age. Though a few animals have survived throughout the ages, things have only gotten harder for these animals fighting near extinction. That's why we have to fight to preserve these animal and cuties to alter history. Learn what you need in order to collect cuties and help them grow and live. \nThat's right, this game is about animal preservation, BAM! Didn't see that coming.... right?\nBe the first to have access to our exclusive merch! All pledges above $10 unlocks the ADD-ON SHOP! Shirts, posters, & more to add a lil'extra CUTE to your collections. :)\n       INTRODUCING \"THE CHEFS\" YOUTUBE COLLABS YOUTUBERS: \nRealTDragon - D-Piddy - Caleb Hyles - BeatDownBoogie\nStarting from a sketch pad > to Illustrator > to After Effects > back to Illustrator for the final deck. So many steps, right? Overall each card takes about 10 hours to make individually, from early stage sketches to final story & card design. Now just multiply that by 70+ cards and you have \"bite me cutie\"! Hours of my life devoted to something that I hope won't disappoint you.\nTHE ORIGIN STORY.  \nHello my name is Thien Vuong and I'm an artist. I've been making online video content on the \"RealTDragon\" Youtube Channel for the past 6 years, and through this project I wanted to showcase that anything is possible if you can dedicate your heart and mind to it. Designing and creating illustrated characters was never in my skill set but through creating this passion project, \"bite me cutie\", I was able to build my skills as an artist. Through persistent grit, I made my dream of becoming a well versed graphic artist a tangible goal. Inspired to create cute animal and food designs inspired by the kawaii/chibi art style and culture of Japan! Before this project, roughly starting December 2016, I could barely sketch out my ideas. However, after spending thousands of hours to make \"bite me cutie\", I can confidently say that I have achieved something I would never have been capable of otherwise. \"bite me cutie\" is a reminder to myself and to other creators to never limit yourself, don't make imaginary boundaries... Just do what makes you happy. <3 \nHELP US MAKE THIS A REALITY.  \nThis has been an on-going passion project for me that I feel could really be a great way to spend time with friends, family, and people you've just met. You can play \"bite me cutie\" anywhere, whether it be at a friend gathering, card game night, Anime & Comic Conventions, or pizza party. I felt that the Kickstarter community and platform would be a great way to gauge interest for \"bite me cutie\" and allow me to send the package straight to you!\nAll the cards are custom designed, sized, and each deck will have over 100+ cards. My initial goal for this project is to raise $5,000 in order to fulfill the minimum quantities to start producing the cards at top notch quality. 75% goes to production costs, 15% goes straight back to your rewards, & 10% are to pay the rest of the payments and fees.\nGet a shout out on our Social Media! Be featured on our website! Be a cutie!\nNot mandatory, but some fun goals to reach. When all are achieved a special gift will be placed in all $20+ pledges. :)\nSpecial Thanks:\n\u2764 Much love in appreciation to everyone that helped inspire me and help get this project going!

If we meet our goal, the bite me cutie card game (with the original backer rewards) will be put into production immediately! To get to you as soon as possible. The process takes approximately 2-3 months for production to complete and 1-2 months to ship all items to our warehouse. Approximately being able to be in your hands this summer!  As soon as the card game and reward items are in hand we will make multiple announcements here and on all social media and shipments will begin. Additional Stretch Goals? Any funds that are over our original goal amount will be used to fund our stretch goals. All funds beyond that will be reinvested into future \"bite me cutie\" projects.\nSHARE THIS PROJECT ON SOCIAL MEDIA! :)\nFacebook - Twitter - Google Plus", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny risk for the campaign is difficult to think of. All the art for the card game has already been completed and now simply waiting to reach the goal. Once successful the cards will be printed and sent out accordingly as well as, shirts, pins, posters, and plushies! That being said, \u201cMurphy's Law\u201d (Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong) could possibly occur. From printing and manufacturing delays, products getting lost in the shipping process, or human error ending in something not being sent.\n\nI will be working hard to cater to our Kickstarter backers.

The total funding goal equals the sum of both campaigns. For more details see March 19th Update.\n                                           The Hill hides many treasures and all it takes to collect them is to DIG! However, these are not the only things the Hill hides... Creatures and traps await, the galleries you will create might either mean wealth or despair.  \nDelve into the hill and gather ten gems to win the game! Take some risks, push your luck, hire recruits to dig deeper and win favours of companions (Knight, Wizard, Scout, Hunter...) to protect your galleries from the many creatures (Thieves, Skeletons, Orcs..) and traps the Hill hides.  \nDIG finds its path between adventure, strategy, luck and resource management. In this card-driven game for 2 to 4 players ages 10 and up, fun meets strategy, luck meets roleplaying and fantasy meets pixel art design within 20 to 45 minutes.  \nDIG is easy to learn. It is a great game if you are looking for adventure in an universe filled with eye-catching 8-bit graphics.\nDIG was designed with the following principles: keep the mechanics simple, mix strategy and push-your-luck, propose a fantasy RPG atmosphere and give the game a retro look from the NES golden age. The result is a neat game which has received great reviews all around the globe. While easy to learn, DIG will challenge you to take some risks in order to enjoy it to the fullest. Whether you choose to dig carefully alone or gather as many Precious Stones as you can to hire a Companion, the game will always feel different each time you will play it. With your help, I intend to give the game more depth and add a competitive aspect with the addition of new trick cards, creatures and bonuses that will extend the already entertaining gameplay.\n        In addition to the core game I also designed a playmat. This mat is absolutely not mandatory to play the game, I created it because I love to play games on a board and I think some of you might like boards and playmats as much as I do. It matches perfectly the pixel-art design of the cards. The mat will be made of thick neoprene rubber and will allow up to 4 players to dig in dedicated cards slots. Companions will fit and sit nicely at the Tavern's tables and, of course, each player will have room to keep the cards and Gems she has collected.\n      DISCLAIMER: the following videos were made with prototypes (see \"We did it\" update fur further details) - cards sizes and components quality are below the final product's.\nHow to play video ENG by Bearded Meeple\nHow to play video FR provided by \n   How to play video GER\n  1. \"Dig\" by drawing one card at a time\n2. Collect the Precious Stones\n3. Hire a Recruit for 5 Crystals \n4. Put your Recruit on a card to start a Gallery\n*Whenever you place a Recruit, draw another card right after and add to it the Gallery!\n5. When your turn comes choose either to \"dig\" in your Gallery(ies) - add one card per Gallery you own... or choose to \"dig\" aside from them an either collect the card drawn or choose to place a Recruit on it to start a new Gallery.\n6. For each set of 5 cards a Gallery creates a Gem!\nWhen your turn comes you can choose either to\"dig\" aside from your Gallery(ies), close one of your Galleries (i.e. retreive everything in it) or push your luck and try to create more Gems and even to draw special cards...\n7. Some will make your Gallery(ies) wealthier...\n8. ...but other can mean despair.\n9. Dig faster and safer by hiring one or several Companions with unique abilities!\n The first player to gather 10 Gems wins the game and becomes THE KING OF THE HILL!\n          The core game contains quite some cards - over 140! - but, with your help I'd like to add some more! Not just to acheive a higher Hill, but also to add new mechanics, new trick cards and more Companions - in short: to extend the gameplay!\n    The following are honest, unpayed and unbiased reviews. Every reviewer did an awesome job.

Therefore, I started my micro-enterprise to handle every legal aspect of the creation and the paperwork, playtested my ideas a lot and figured out that the time had come for me to make one step forward. So here I am, submitting my very first game to you. Well, actually I did a first Kickstarter for DIG but I decided to cancel it since there were a few things I did not take in consideration. \nLuckily, I met Daniel from Board Game Circus who offered his help and support to rise a new campaign. He and his teammate Alexander have given me great advice on how to avoid traps and how to build a great project from start to finish.   \nSo here I am - really excited about your feedback and ready to work my ass off to improve the game with your help! In the end, my biggest wish is to succeed in this project so that I can give you more of them. Thank you if you choose to back my project, thank you if you read so far, thank you for taking the time to wonder what DIG is about!\n    Please note that prices other than Euros (\u20ac) are estimated according to the exchange rate available at the time the campaign was launched.\n    Check out Board Game Circus' website for more details on board game marketing, promotion and other services they provide!\n  Stay tuned, subscribe to my social media channels and receive exclusive news on DIG's development and upcoming Mangrove Games projects!\n                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is my first project, I might face some unforeseen issues.
