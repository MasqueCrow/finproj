We stage massive theatrical monstrosities with a massive cast, live band, costumes, stunts, jokes, in cool restored Vaudeville theaters, outdoor venues, and dive bars. We're different from a lot of burlesque because the music is original and written specifically for the dancers, every show also follows a theme and tells a story. Think Gilbert and Sullivan meets Rocky Horror!\nThe time has come for us to spread the Super Happy all over the country. We will be spending some of July and all of August on the road, performing our show at venues all over the US of A.\nTo take a 25 member cast, crew, and band on the road is an amazing task for a work of DIY underground theater. We need to rent an RV.\nWhy an RV? Its a dressing room on wheels. We can't perform in jeans and t shirts. We need to be clean and pretty in our fantastic costumes. When we show up for a gig we show up 4 hours early, thats not gonna work when we're driving 6-8 hours in between shows. We need a room on wheels we can prepare in, and live in, while we're undertaking this project. We need to fill it with gas, pay the electricity costs for the generator, keep it filled with water, and keep the fridge full of eggs and bacon. Renting and fueling an RV for a month costs an insane amount of money!!!!\nFor a show like ours to hit the road seems nearly impossible but we're going to do it, we have to do it. If you're one of our thousands of fans in Michigan you know why we've got to do this and we hope you can help!!\nHere are some ways you can learn more about us:\nour myspace (contains lots of video samples of our show): http://www.myspace.com/superhappyfuntimeburlesque\nour website: http://www.superhappyfuntimeburlesque.com\nfacebook: http://www.facebook.com/group.php...\n***VIP TOUR KICK OFF SHOW IS ON JULY 29 AT THE WEALTHY THEATRE!!!!***\nAnd here is our tour schedule:\n2010 Summer Tour!!!\nAugust 4, VNUK'S LOUNGE, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nAugust 5, The Vault, Minneapolis, Minnesota\nAugust 6, The Blue Moose, Iowa City, Iowa\nAugust 7, Club David, Sioux Falls, South Dakota\nAugust 8, The Vaudeville Mews, Des Moines, Iowa\nAugust 11, Knickerbockers, Lincoln, Nebraska\nAugust 12, Granada Theater, Lawrence, Kansas\nAugust 13, Record Bar, Kansas City, Missouri\nAugust 14, The Triple Nickel, Colorado Springs, Colorado\nAugust 15, Hi Dive, Denver, Colorado\nAugust 18, Bash Riprocks, Lubbock, Texas\nAugust 19, Launchpad, Albuquerque, New Mexico\nAugust 20, 910 Live, Tempe, Arizona\nAugust 21, Orpheum Theater, Flagstaff, Arizona\nAugust 22, MBar, Los Angeles, California, 11pm\nAugust 25, TRiP, Santa Monica, California\nAugust 26, DNA Lounge, San Francisco, California\nAugust 28, Reno, Nevada\nAugust 29, Aruba Theater, Las Vegas, Nevada\nAugust 30, Burts Tiki Lounge, Salt Lake City, Utah\nAugust 31 Omaha, Nebraska\nSept 1 St Louis?\n\"As a collective performance constructed from a super-concentration of talent, mostly harvested in the Grand Rapids area, Super Happy Funtime Burlesque says anything, shows almost everything, and makes fun of anyone. And they do it very well. Some easily chalk it up as mere entertainment. But, at the end of the show, for every pair of hands that come together as result of being satisfactorily entertained, there is another whose clap is a thank you for provoking liberation of thought; a dissection of convention. In this regard, Super Happy Funtime Burlesque has been successful in cementing its status as one of the most unique destinations in West Michigan.\" -Drew A.
