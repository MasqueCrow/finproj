Join the Partisans (Postani partizan) is a WW2 board game with a historical background where players play as Slovenian Partisans to liberate their country.  \nYou have to roll the dice to win battles against the evil Axis powers, answer quiz questions on WW2 and perform various other tasks, including  singing, drawing or even preparing food for your fellow comrades, all to win the liberation war!\nHave fun while learning history\nRelive exciting historical events\n Spend great time with friends and family \nThere are 5 different wooden Partisan figurines to choose from.\nTake a look at who takes the role of the enemy:\nPer each year of war you have to conquer one wooden white guard tower and one wooden coloured guard tower.\nYou can take a look and see how to battle in our game.\n\u201cAll had one thing in common:\n          an intense pride in their Movement and in its achievements.\nFor them, the outside world did not seem of immediate interest or importance.\n          What mattered was their War of National Liberation,\n          their struggle against the invader,\n          their victories, their sacrifices.\n          Of this, they were proudest of all, that they owed nothing to anyone;\n          that they had got so far without outside help.\u201d\n- Sir Fitzroy Maclean\u2019s understanding of the partisan movement and its motivation\nComplete more than 150 missions (based on real events) from General Headquarters (HQ) and answer over 200 questions in The Partisan school! \nAnd draw a Special ops card from the pile to: Liberate the prisoners, Blow up the bridge, Evacuate the wounded, Destroy the enemy airfield and many more.    \nWhen players scan our QR code on Special Ops cards they will be diverted to our page where they'll recieve over 40 video orders - like this one:\nWe added a few more things:\n Stars & Traitors\nIt is the most essential add-on to have for our game.

Please allow me to welcome you to my Kickstarter campaign. After months of work with lots of sleepless nights, I'm very very excited to finally announce the (drumroll please) ...\nFant\u00f4me tarot deck is a full card deck. As a tool for spiritual guidance, it enables you to receive a tarot reading to connect to your inner wisdom. The name itself honors the guiding hand of tarot and your inner spirit in the cards. The design is a culmination of my love for geometry, mystery, and traditional brutalist artwork all blended together with the storytelling of tarot. The deck is also accompanied by a special multidimensional guidebook in the form of an augmented reality app. The app will help beginners learn more about the cards and how to practice tarot. It will also contain intriguing content for more advanced readers. A printed version of the guidebook will be included as well. Please check out this campaign to learn more about Fant\u00f4me.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe deck will consist of the full 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana, broken into four suits of wands, cups, coins, and swords. When making this deck I focused on three things:\n GREAT DESIGN - I wanted to offer you a gorgeous tarot deck,\n TOP-NOTCH QUALITY - I wanted it to survive the rigors of everyday use,\n UNIQUE EXPERIENCE - and last but almost most important, I wanted to offer you a unique guidebook experience.\nA Bewitching Design\nFant\u00f4me's design draws inspiration from brutalist architecture - a style that was an ethos of \u2018social utopianism\u2019 in the previous century. This style is generally characterized by its rough surfaces, unusual shapes, straight lines, and small openings. The night atmosphere and light illuminated icons symbolize how tarot helps us find our way even in the darkest moments. The iconography of its 78-card is based on the classical Rider-Waite-Smith tarot but reinterpreted through modern geometric design. Please take a look at the individual card designs below.\n For a more detailed view, you can access the cards here.\nHigh-quality materials\nA core concept of this deck is exceptional and unparalleled quality, both in its imagery and experience as well as in its construction and manufacture. Fantome aims to set a new standard in build quality and execution. The deck will stand up to the rigors of everyday use. Cards will be made from high-quality three-layer Italian card stock. The front part of the cards contains the beautiful full-frame artwork and the backside is partially covered with gorgeous ice blue foil. It's all packed in a rigid Lid-Bottom box to keep your deck safe wherever you take it. The size of the cards is 70 mm (~2.75 inches) wide and 120 mm (~4.75 inches) tall.\nFant\u00f4me's sturdy design and high-quality print make it easy to shuffle (it's a GIF, give it a second to load).\nWorld's First Multidimensional Guidebook\nBesides a printed guidebook this deck also comes with a beautifully designed multidimensional guidebook app. This augmented reality (AR) guidebook elevates the beauty of the card as well as pushes the idea of merging the reality which we live in and the expansive more energetic reality of Tarot.\nThe guidebook app will allow you to learn more about tarot and individual tarot card meanings. The app will also help you see other things - from popular card spreads to hidden design gems. The technology behind it is based on augmented reality and it provides a one-of-a-kind experience. Take a look at some of the things you will be able to do with this app below. \n\nChose your guide.\nThe app will contain a personalized guide in the form of a cat (yes, I'm a cat lover) that will take you through the app experience. You'll be able to choose between different guide designs to personalize your guidebook experience.\nLearn more about individual cards. \nThere's a lot of symbolism in each tarot card.  With the Guidebook App, you will be able to see the most important symbols visualized through 3D models. If you click on them you can read more about each symbol.\nJust point your phone towards a card to learn more about the symbolism behind it (it's a GIF, give it a second to load).\nLearn about tarot spreads and when to use them.\nAnother thing you can do is use the app to learn more about different tarot spreads. Choose one of the available spreads, learn more about its use, and see how it should be laid out on the table. \nTap where you want to place your virtual spread to see how it's done (it's a GIF, give it a second to load).\nThese are just a few things you'll be able to do in this multidimensional guidebook app. I have hidden plenty of easter eggs and additional content in the deck. It will also be continuously updated in the future. The app will support a list of Android and iOS devices.\nMain reward: Fant\u00f4me Tarot Deck \nAs this is a crowdfunding campaign for a tarot deck, the main reward is of course a tarot deck. Every deck will contain:\n78 cards (22 major arcana + 56 minor arcana) + any bonus cards from Stretch goals\nPrinted guidebook - a pocket-size version\nDigital multidimensional guidebook in the form of an AR app\n\nREWARDS AVAILABLE: \n One (1) deck - a great choice if you want to get a deck for yourself.\n Two (2) decks - 2 is better than 1, get one for yourself and one for a friend.\n Five (5) decks - this option is a good friends & family choice. Tarot for everyone.\n Ten (10) decks - if you're looking to buy wholesale then this is for you.\n Check the Add-ons section for more goodies available through this campaign.\nThere are additional items available. They are in two categories:\n Add-ons - items you can add to your selected campaign reward.\n Referral rewards - items you can earn if you refer a friend.\nRead more about both categories below.\nYou can read more about the add-ons below.\n\nArt prints\nBesides being one of the main campaign rewards for backers, you can also get an art print as an add-on if you decide to purchase a deck. If the campaign is successful and you select this option you will be able to select one card which I will print for you as an A5 print (148 x 210 mm ~ 5.8 x 8.3 inches). \nTarot cleansing kit\nIf you ever find that the energy of your tarot deck is feeling dull or you are having a difficult time connecting with your deck, it is likely that your cards need to be cleansed and charged. Cleansing your tarot cards before or after every use will ensure there is no residual energy from previous use affecting your readings. Amethyst, palo santo, smudge stick, and rose quartz will help you to cleanse and charge your tarot deck.\n\n Fant\u00f4me Designed Tapestry / Pareo \nWhat you can see on the image below is a beautiful Fant\u00f4me-inspired wall tapestry that can also be used as a pareo (wraparound summer beachwear). It will be about 55 x 55 inches big (140 x 140 cm) and made from velvet chiffon. Chiffon velvet is a type of velvet that is very lightweight, allowing it to drape in a variety of ways. It is a special Kickstarter exclusive (!) add-on.\nTarot cards bag\nMade out of lush deep blue velvet, decorated with enchanting embroidery, and adorned with adorable gold tassels, these tarot bags will keep your precious decks protected. Versatile as heck, you can use them to protect your precious tarot deck or for whatever else your heart so desires.\nTarot cloth\nInterested in getting a spread cloth? Well, look no further. I prepared a Fant\u00f4me inspired tarot cloth if you're thinking to get a full set. Hopefully, this cloth will bring magical energy of renewal into your altar. As beautiful as it is functional, the cloth helps you create and read your spreads. It is available in silk. The size of the cloth is 55 cm x 55 cm (19.7 inches x 19.7 inches).\nEnamel Pin\nGet this lovely Fant\u00f4me-style enamel pin that the awesome backers of this campaign helped unlock through Stretch goals!\nMystery Sticker Pack\nAs this deck's motif revolves around the mysterious nature of tarot I wanted to incorporate a mystery add-on for anyone looking to spice up their selected reward. Pick this sticker pack and you'll see what's included when you receive your reward. \nThere is another way how you can get delicious goodies from my campaign - refer a friend. I know that tarot is not the cheapest of hobbies, but I can truthfully say that quality comes at a price. I maxed out my cards and budget to get this deck to this point. Which means I'm kind of without any extra funds to promote it. But that's where we can help each other. Help me promote this Kickstarter campaign and you can earn some cool rewards. You will need a personal referral link to participate.\nHow to get your referral link?\n FIRST: Fill out this form - Application Form \n SECOND: I'll send you back your personal referral link. I'll check the form 2x per day, so please be patient if you don't get it right away.\n THIRD: Once you get the link, share it with friends and within your tarot community, but please be polite and respectful in doing so.\nWhat are the referral rewards?\nGet 2 friends to back this project by purchasing a deck - A free art print (value 15 EUR or 17 USD) \nGet 5 friends to back this project by purchasing a deck - A free tarot deck (value 55 EUR or 66 USD) \nGet 10 friends or more to back this project by purchasing a deck - A free tarot deck with all Add-on items included  (value of 125 EUR or 147 USD) \nYou are not able to use your referral links for your own purchases.\nIf you're new to Kickstarter, a Stretch goal is a point set past the original funding amount where a new aspect of the project is \"unlocked\". This is possible as the cost of production usually drops with increased order volume. If there is something you'd like to see included in the project, feedback is always welcome.\n\nThe idea to launch a new deck was rolling in my head for a while. I started working on it in September last year. Things really started to get going after the new year when I got some encouragement from the Tarot community. Right now we're in the middle of the Kickstarter campaign. If it's successful, the production will start at the beginning of June 2021.  If everything goes to plan, I believe I'll be able to ship out the orders in September 2021.\nUp to now, the project is funded by myself in its entirety. A big thank you goes to my existing customers whose support allowed me to be a tarot deck designer in the first place. By backing this project you will help turn Fantome into a tarot deck with a unique guidebook experience that will bring joy to countless tarot readers around the world.\n\nLast but not least, please let me introduce myself. My name is Esra and I'm the creative force (\"jack of all trades\") behind this project. I'm an ex-art teacher living abroad with my husband. The new environment and a break from teaching really allowed my love for the tarot to flourish. The result of that love is La Muci Design.  La Muci Design is a small boutique shop that delights customers with its tarot decks, oracle decks, and other spiritual items. Every item is crafted until perfection and created with lots of love. And based on the customer reviews, that love is felt all around the world.\n\nA final word\nI appreciate each one of you helping bring this project to life, truly, really. Your feedback throughout the design process was incredibly valuable. Please keep in mind, all of these images are of the first prototypes, there are bound to be changes to the design as the project evolves.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart thank you, thank you, thank you.\nFeel free to connect with me on social media:\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been designing and selling Tarot decks for a few years now.

It is meant for artists, game developers, software engineers, visual effects experts and computer graphics enthusiasts. Idea is to make Application as user-friendly, simple and fun as much as possible.\n\nApplications\nThere are 3 Applications that are currently available or in the development:\n ImaGen - Images Generator and Editor. ImaGen is a subset of 3Gen and It is already available as standalone application on Gumroad. ImaGen currently contains more than 100 nodes for manipulation of images and textures. \n 3Gen - 3D Worlds Generator. It is Autodesk Maya's plug-in (add-on). Maya is one of the most popular software for 3D modelling and animation.  3Gen contains all the features ImaGen has and many more for creating and editing 3D models. It currently contains more than 130 nodes.\n 3Vial - Trivial 3D Engine. It is in the initial stages of development. It will contain all the features 3Gen has but it is going to be standalone 3D Engine.\n\n Follow the development\nI am trying to post newly developed features and tutorials at least once per month. You can follow development on my:\n Youtube channel \n 3Gen Facebook Page \n Here are some previous demos for the new features. You can find many more on my Youtube channel. \nWhy am I doing a Kickstarter?\nPledged amount reduced by fees and taxes will cover all the costs of software licenses, books, scientific papers and publications for up to 3 years. More than half of the time I develop 3Gen is spent on research. Also, I'm collecting a lot of ideas from the already existing 3D Applications and Engines that are not cheap. If I however collect a lot more I will be able to work on these Applications full time which will drastically speed up the progress. But, to be completely honest, promotion that Kickstarter offers is what I'm currently looking for. \n\nWho am I?\nI am Nemanja. I have masters degree in Applied Mathematics and I have 5 years of experience as software engineer in several different areas: embedded software, compiler development, graphics programming, scientific computing, computer vision, image processing, procedural content generation, artificial intelligence, data science, automotive...\nContact:  LinkedIn,  Artstation ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am confident that I have the skills, experience and know-how to make this project a reality.

Now we are back for the MAKE 100 special!\nWe are making 100 unique wooden pocket watch stands that complement our pocket watches, transforming them into desk clocks.\nIn the 19th century Levi Strauss & Co. introduced the small pocket on jeans so miners, cowboys, railway, and other workers could keep their fragile pocket watches from getting broken. It has remained there ever since, despite pocket watches being replaced by wristwatches. Our mission is to bring pocket watches back to life.\nDaily, we get distracted by notifications and text messages that are screaming for our attention. We are forgetting about ourselves and the time that is slipping by. We realized that we should value our time more and that we should by no means be slaves of the hectic lifestyle and technology. The Itero Pocket Watch was born.\nTime is an important dimension we have created to order events in the past, present, and future. Keeping time is the key to success. With Itero Pocket Watches, you carry an important piece of the past in your pocket and value yourself and your time more.\nSlim design, decorative wood, the analog spirit in your digital world. Rest your eyes. \nPut your Itero pocket watch on the stand. We promise you won\u2019t stop looking at it.\nNot only is the pocket watch stand useful, but it also makes a great decoration for an office or a living room.\n\nThe name Itero comes from Latin and means \u00bbto do a second time, to renew\u00ab. And that is what we wanted to do \u2013 to bring the appreciation of time and tradition back to life.\nWe have decided to participate in the MAKE 100 Kickstarter January project.  Many of you have expressed interest in the Wooden Pocket Watch stands, which transforms Itero into a desk clock, which we have run out of.\nFor that reason, we are going to make a Kickstarter MAKE wooden watch stands made out of a single piece of walnut or oak. \nThe variance in the wood patterns and color gives every stand a bespoke look. To satisfy your specific preferences, we are going to enable you to pick the exact stand you would like to receive after the campaign.\nEvery stand comes with an Itero Pocket Watch.  3 distinct colors are available.\nWe designed a pocket watch stand, made out of solid wood from the local forests. Precisely crafted in Slovenia, EU.\nSolid walnut wood and oak will be used to make the pocket watch stands even more luxurious and durable. Every stand is treated with oil to provide the best natural conservation.\nAll the stands will be made locally from the woods of Slovenia. Our home country is the third most forested country in Europe, just behind Sweden and Finland.\n Our pocket watch stand has been carefully designed to perfectly fit the Itero Pocket Watch. We followed contemporary design guidelines to create a piece that fits well in every space. \n Modern design makes the Itero Pocket Watch suitable for a diverse range of styles. \nWith an Itero Pocket Watch, you will make a lasting impression.\nItero is designed for those, who care about fashion and tradition.\nAdapted to a modern gentleman.\nCustom engraving is available to make your watch unique. Put on your life motto, a quote, a special date, or something that you love. For only 10\u20ac you can give it a whole new meaning.\nOur mission is to bring pocket watches back to life. We decided to design pocket watches with a modern look, suitable for every style. Itero watches are only 8 millimetres thin, providing a slim fit for every pocket.\nThree color combinations are available.\n\nMIDAS BLACK\nMIDNIGHT BRONZE\nMIDAS WHITE\n\nCase diameter: 44 milimetres\nThickness: 8 milimetres \nCase material: 316L stainless steel, PVD plated\nDial window material: Sapphire crystal glass \nMovement: Swiss Ronda Quartz \nWater resistant: 3 ATM \nKeychain: 25 centimetres (included)\nKeychain material: PVD plated brass", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working hard and have overcome many barriers to make this project become a reality.

Its me.\nTHE REINVENTION OF THE BASKETBALL NET\n MEET KHARBONET \nThe Basketball net is arguably the most important piece of equipment in basketball -- equaled perhaps only by the ball itself. Without the net, there is no game. While having a net is essential, it's also highly important to have a net of an appropriate height.\nThere was a time when basketball nets were a simple thing. From wooden peach baskets attached to balcony railings to today\u2019s unbreakable basketball nets, the evolution of the basketball goal was influenced to a degree by 2016 NBA Hall of Fame inductee Shaquille O\u2019Neal. BUT first, why we need a basketball net on the hoop?\nFirst Carbon Fiber Basketball Net you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nThere are some benefits to having a net on the hoop. Now nets help break a ball's fall. The net helps control the direction of the ball when going through the rim, besides when the ball hits the rim first and bounces through, The net helps slow the ball down so it's not always bouncing the headlight after a make and usually makes the ball land in the same general area after going through. Nets give players a sense of depth for good aim and allow refs to see what the basket was made of. Without a net it's sometimes hard to tell if someone has made a bucket or not. Beyond these functions, nets add to the audio, kinetic and aesthetic experience that leaves players driving for \"nothin but net.\" Think about how your net might move, look, sound and function. Unconventional approaches are encouraged.\nBLACK & WHITE CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET.\nSo we carefully designed it to give you the most satisfaction on your basketball game.\n BUT WHY KHARBONET IS OUTSTANDING? \nEXTREMELY DURABLE\nThe unique material used in the KHARBONET assures good weather resistance. For extra protection against the harsh weather the fibers are also UV stabilised. ALL WEATHER!\nSUPER LIGHT & ULTRA FLEXIBLE\nThe special feature of the rope themselves is the low weight. The special material used assures extreme lightness. For better flexibility during temperature treatment double criss cross knitting was implemented.\nUNIQUE INNOVATIVE DESIGN, SAFE & HANDMADE\nCarbon fiber basketball net is being made by hand, which means each individual rope is being inspected from the beggining which provides high quality standard.\nCarbon fiber basketball net is also easy washable!\nThe way our basketball net is designed, a better visualisation can be achieved, which means basketball players can better evaluate the net depth, which is crucial for succesfull throws on larger distances.\nBEST MATERIAL\nThe basketball net is knitted out of carbon fibers. Some call it also the material of the future. This gives the net special values and uniqueness.\nFITS ON ANY HOOP\nNo matter what brand the basketball ring is - our net fits them all.\nSuitable for outdoor & indoor court !\n\nTOP SOUND\nSpeaking of sound. Get your own net and then we can talk which net gives the better sound. While scoring nets \"KHARBONET\" is the only option for the best satisfaction while playing basketball. You have to try!\nTHE LIFESPAN\nThe Lifespan of CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET  is 3X longer than nylon nets, so we say that KHARBONET breaks the rules! hehe :) Remember that!\nTECHNOLOGY\nCarbon fibers are fibers thinner than a human hair, about 5-10 micrometres in diameter and composed mainly of carbon atoms. Carbon fibers are classified in mechanical engineering as a group of composite materials. This means that the material is composed of two or more building blocks that are joined together. In this case, carbon fibers appear as nuts made from organic materials, followed by fillers. Carbon fibers are often presented as a composite of the future, mainly because of its mechanical properties and low weight, making the material much more useful. If the fibers are acting in all directions, the fibers are positioned in such a way that some fibers are horizontally left up and vertically, and the fibers intertwine and transmit forces in all directions, usually such fabrication of fibers is said to be a fabric. Everybody knows the carbon fiber fabric, but what about the carbon fiber rope?\nPrototyping...\nIntroducing the first Carbon Fiber Basketball Net on the market. WHITE EDITION.\nWhat you can't see, it's what matters the most. It\u2019s all about the little things that make the difference. BLACK EDITION.\nGALLERY\n\n\n WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT OUR KICKSTARTER? \nWe have put thousands of hours into this project to make it live! The team is full of enthusiastic and experienced individuals coming from various fields such as design, engineering, production and logistics. The complexity of this project required lots of knowledge and hard work. Together we have brought our dream project to life and we are excited about what lies ahead. We\u2019re starting our journey with Kickstarter because we believe the backer community will play an integral role in the development of carbon fiber ropes. Through Kickstarter we\u2019re not just pre-selling our products to early adopters, but rather forging relationships with a passionate community of innovative individuals. We want to show ourselves to the world, we want to share our product with the whole world. We want to show people what everything can be done from Carbon fiber.\nCarbon rope has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With the team , we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create. \nTHANK YOU!

As soon as we are funded, we will be able to fine tune the grinder, kick-off the production and ship it to our backers. \nWe have mapped out the critical path and have made all necessary precautions to ensure we can scale production if we surpass our goal. We are very confident in our timeline, but it's our core belief to never settle for a mediocre product, so we won't be compromising on the quality in order to save time.

Only a small amount of material in the grinder is plastic that is easy to remove and recycled if needed. \nThe motor for the electric grinder conforms with international standards for electric devices and due to a small workload, the motor is expected to be as durable as the body of the product.\nReusability and recyclability\nARCO is a coffee grinder, a tool, that is designed to be durable and long lasting without any defects. As a product with a long life span, it does not pose a threat for additional burden on landfills, also considering the fact that ARCO is manufactured of materials that are not bonded together for easy separation of materials and recycling (aluminium, steel, plastic).\nThe packaging will be designed using recyclable materials that will be easy to separate and recycle.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe building blocks of ARCO are sourced from Europe (Italy, Slovenia) with some additional parts manufacutred in China (Shenzen). We have high standards when it comes to choosing our suppliers and manufacturing companies. All the companies we work with are highly reputable companies with premium quality standards and good work environment for the workers.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe most important aspect of sustainability in our delivery is transport optimization. We have an established transport route from the companies we work with and thus we can optimize the delivery of all our products. ARCO will be added in our transportation plan with little additional transportation stress. \nWith precise planning of deliveries we optimize delivery cost and we ensure that no container leaves the factory unless loaded in full, thus ensuring perfect optimisation of transport.\nDelivery to end customers will be handled via our delivery partners with established delivery routes that are as well optimized to perfection.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac125 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird - ARCO hand grinder", "descp": "With superb grind consistency and simple grind adjustment, you'll be ready to take this hand grinder anywhere!\nINCLUDES:\nARCO hand grinder\nHandle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["429 backers", "Limited (21 left of 450)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac144 or more", "title": "Early Bird - ARCO hand grinder", "descp": "With superb grind consistency and simple grind adjustment, you'll be ready to take this hand grinder anywhere!\nINCLUDES:\nARCO hand grinder\nHandle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac250 or more", "title": "Super Early Bird - ARCO 2-in-1", "descp": "The 2-in-1 coffee grinder that will change the way you grind.

Cakewalk is working as an extruder so there\u2019s no need to change anything on the connections on your card or even your firmware. Slicing profiles are provided for selected materials.\nOpen design\nWe chose to make our products extendable, upgradable, and easy to maintain.\nExcept the food-safe core parts of the extruder, most parts are standard spare parts that can be sourced. This campaign is designed to help us fund the injection molds for the core parts.\n3D Printing lovers are part of a strong community and we hope that more and more makers will experiment and promote food printing thanks to Cakewalk 3d. We\u2019re eager to get feedback and don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll be always here to help!\n\nHi, my name is Marine. I\u2019m a 3D printing executive, a graduated pastry chef, and the creator of Cakewalk 3d. I live in Paris, France.\nI love innovating with food and that's why I started Cakewalk 3d, first as a side project during the spring. It all began when we were all quarantined in France, and I wanted to automate my own pastry techniques. With a mechanical engineer, we worked together remotely, each one testing and improving on its own 3D printer.  We gather our result daily, and we iterated over 3 months.\nOnce I started showing other pastry lovers the desserts I was getting, there was so much interest that I knew it was something I had to share with the whole 3D printing community. I worked and designed new recipes during months (mostly tested and approved by my coworkers!) and searched for the best production methods.\nEven if I always want to 3D print everything, I came to the conclusion that the core parts of the extruder need to be injected. So I worked with an engineering team to select the best providers and design the molds. The campaign is aimed to raise enough money to pay these molds.\nThanks to your support, Cakewalk 3d will be soon in production, and I am really excited to share what we\u2019ve built with the Kickstarter community.\nIf you\u2019d like to see some of the designs and recipes I\u2019ve been getting with Cakewalk 3D, you can find me on Instagram @marine_corebaillais\nMay 2020 : The first designs\nMay 2020 : First 3D printed parts\nMay 2020 : First prototype assembled\nJune 2020 : Corentin's trial on Creality Ender\nJuly 2020 : New version on Marine's Anet 3D printer\nJuly 2020 : Testing new recipes\nPLAY\n\n July 2020 : First tests with chocolate\nAugust 2020 : 3D Printing Chocolate on Thibault's Alfawise\nSeptember 2020: Prototype testing on Alfawise and Anycubic\nSeptember 2020 : Final version, ready for production\nOctober 2020: Burger printing in progress...\n Help us spread the word and receive an extra ingredient in your box !\n\nShare this with friends on Facebook.\n  Share on Instagram.\n  Mention and follow us on Twitter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing:\nAs the old saying goes: good tools for good works.

Without the net, there is no game. While having a net is essential, it's also highly important to have a net of an appropriate height.\nThere was a time when basketball nets were a simple thing. From wooden peach baskets attached to balcony railings to today\u2019s unbreakable basketball nets, the evolution of the basketball goal was influenced to a degree by 2016 NBA Hall of Fame inductee Shaquille O\u2019Neal. BUT first, why we need a basketball net on the hoop?\nFirst Carbon Fiber Basketball Net you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nThere are some benefits to having a net on the hoop. Now nets help break a ball's fall. The net helps control the direction of the ball when going through the rim, besides when the ball hits the rim first and bounces through, The net helps slow the ball down so it's not always bouncing the headlight after a make and usually makes the ball land in the same general area after going through. Nets give players a sense of depth for good aim and allow refs to see what the basket was made of. Without a net it's sometimes hard to tell if someone has made a bucket or not. Beyond these functions, nets add to the audio, kinetic and aesthetic experience that leaves players driving for \"nothin but net.\" Think about how your net might move, look, sound and function. Unconventional approaches are encouraged.\nBLACK & WHITE CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET.\nWe carefully designed it to give you the most satisfaction on your basketball game.\n WHY KHARBONET IS OUTSTANDING?\n   EXTREMELY DURABLE \nThe unique material used in the KHARBONET assures good weather resistance. For extra protection against the harsh weather the fibers are also UV stabilised. ALL WEATHER!\n\n SUPER LIGHT & ULTRA FLEXIBLE \nThe special feature of the rope themselves is the low weight. The special material used assures extreme lightness. For better flexibility during temperature treatment double criss cross knitting was implemented.\n\n UNIQUE INNOVATIVE DESIGN, SAFE & HANDMADE \nCarbon fiber basketball net is being made by hand, which means each individual rope is being inspected from the beggining which provides high quality standard.\nCarbon fiber basketball net is also easy washable!\nThe way our basketball net is designed, a better visualisation can be achieved, which means basketball players can better evaluate the net depth, which is crucial for succesfull throws on larger distances.\n\n BEST MATERIAL \nThe basketball net is knitted out of carbon fibers. Some call it also the material of the future. This gives the net special values and uniqueness.\n\n FITS ON ANY HOOP \nNo matter what brand the basketball ring is - our net fits them all.\nSuitable for outdoor & indoor court !\n\n TOP SOUND \nSpeaking of sound. Get your own net and then we can talk which net gives the better sound. While scoring nets \"KHARBONET\" is the only option for the best satisfaction while playing basketball. You have to try!\n\nCOMPARISON\n\nTHE LIFESPAN \nThe Lifespan of CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET  is 3X longer than nylon nets, so we say that KHARBONET breaks the rules! hehe :)\n Remember that!\nLifespan of nylon nets...\nTECHNOLOGY\nCarbon fibers are fibers thinner than a human hair, about 5-10 micrometres in diameter and composed mainly of carbon atoms. Carbon fibers are classified in mechanical engineering as a group of composite materials. This means that the material is composed of two or more building blocks that are joined together. In this case, carbon fibers appear as nuts made from organic materials, followed by fillers. Carbon fibers are often presented as a composite of the future, mainly because of its mechanical properties and low weight, making the material much more useful. If the fibers are acting in all directions, the fibers are positioned in such a way that some fibers are horizontally left up and vertically, and the fibers intertwine and transmit forces in all directions, usually such fabrication of fibers is said to be a fabric. Everybody knows the carbon fiber fabric, but what about the carbon fiber rope?\nPrototyping...\nHowever, if carbon fibers are oriented in one direction and are twisted or cast in a spiral during the temperature treatment, carbon ropes are formed. Carbon fiber ropes are the future!\nIntroducing the first Carbon Fiber Basketball Net on the market. WHITE EDITION.\nTESTING AND QUALITY\nCarbon fibers have very high resistance to mechanical forces, especially they are very resistant to tension. These properties have been used very well in the industry and in the technology, so carbon fibers are suitable for any kind of use. Since we wanted a very durable rope and Basketball Net,we simulated the most complex conditions and we designed the most versatile basketball net. We designed black and white version!\nNo net , no sweat...\nWhat you can't see, it's what matters the most. It\u2019s all about the little things that make the difference.\nThe world's most versatile basketball net.\nSPEND LESS WITH KICKSTARTER\nMORE EPIC PICS\nBlack CARBON FIBER BASKETBALL NET and white edition behind.\nTIMELINE\nFOUNDER\nDOMEN VRSIC Industrial engineer/Founder\nCreative problem solver since 1995\n WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT OUR KICKSTARTER? \nWe have put thousands of hours into this project to make it live! The team is full of enthusiastic and experienced individuals coming from various fields such as design, engineering, production and logistics. The complexity of this project required lots of knowledge and hard work. Together we have brought our dream project to life and we are excited about what lies ahead. We\u2019re starting our journey with Kickstarter because we believe the backer community will play an integral role in the development of carbon fiber ropes. Through Kickstarter we\u2019re not just pre-selling our products to early adopters, but rather forging relationships with a passionate community of innovative individuals. We want to show ourselves to the world, we want to share our product with the whole world. We want to show people what everything can be done from Carbon fiber.\nCarbon rope has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With the team , we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create.\n\nFOLLOW THE JOURNEY\nKickstarter, your feedback will help us and your support will enable us to reach our goals and beyond!

Pick up your action cards on the way to get ahead or slow down other travelers. It\u2019s super educational and engaging for kids and adults alike. The more you play \u2013 the more you know. \nWe will ship a free World Map Poster to every backer that pledges for the game. The map shows all countries and capital cities, along with flags sorted by continent. The map will help you master the game and become a Geography Wiz!\n\nThe World Map wall poster will only be available in this Kickstarter pack. It will later retail as a separate item.\nThe game's objective is to be the first player to complete the race around the world and cross the finish line. You move forward by winning with strong country facts or by answering geography challenges correctly.\nThere are 194 countries and there is a card for each country. Soon, you'll be able to recognize most of them.\nEvery turn each player draws a card from the country card pile. When it\u2019s your turn, roll one dice. Then you have to choose between 2 options. Calling out a fact or a challenge from your country card.\nPick a fact you believe is the strongest and try to beat other players. But be careful, if you lose, someone else will move forward. \nChallenge! In order to move forward you will have to answer a challenge question from another player. You will either have to recognize the flag, name the continent, capital city or show  a country on the map. If you answer wrong, other players will get a chance to move forward.\nThe difficulty level of the game is easily adaptable to players of all ages. You can play a variety of easy to hard challenges, depending on geography skill.\nThis is where it gets really interesting. There is another deck of cards which is full of action. These are the 26 action cards that you pick up along the way, every time you reach a new continent.

Each country is represented by a number corresponding to its country card.\nWe wish to bring geography and the scale of the world closer to people in a fun and engaging way, which will hopefully spark a future interest and curiosity about our world. \n\u201cStudents frequently mentioned learning things in their geography class that brought clarity or connections to existing knowledge, that led them to want to learn more.\u201d\nSDSU Study\nWe have been developing this game for quite some time. There were numerous prototypes, figuring out the length and structure of the race, deciding on illustrations and color coding while preserving the learning mechanisms that make it an effective educational tool.

Deductive reasoning requires a premise, a conclusion, and a justification linking the two. Sometimes called axiomatic reasoning, an invention of deduction has long been attributed to the ancient Greeks. Deductive reasoning is a skill that can be developed and Mag-Net Tiles is a tool for just that, more than a game that improves our deductive reasoning skills in a fun, effortless and an efficient manner.\n\n                      Majority of the schools today do not encourage creative approaches for learning and therefore our children are suffocated with deductive reasoning. Deductive logic provides a system of tools and techniques that allow the truth-values of certain classes of statements\u2014known as propositions\u2014 to be evaluated for consistency. Beginning with propositions properties known to be true or false, deductive logic allows us to derive other statements with already known truth-values. Simultaneously it allows us to identify incorrectly set truth-values and inconsistencies. Learning deductive logic provides a basic theoretical foundation that is helpful when studying more complex (and less exact) forms of logic.\nWe hope to bring the concept of Mag-Net Tiles - learning tool and Color TALE paint book to every school in the world.\nMag-Net Tiles are one of the most effective ways to give your child an exciting hands-on learning experience within a classroom, or alternatively among friends and family members. It basically provides a foundation for the kids to develop their creativity and keep them engaged for hours through building mind boggling creations of their own. Talk to your Educational professional and start presenting this fantastic learning tool which will contribute enormously when it comes to advancements of your child\u2019s thinking process and logic. Moreover, Mag-Net Tiles is not only a game for children, but it also helps us, as parents to spend our valuable time with our kids. This fantastic family game is also being used in the Homes for the elderly, and it is already being loved by many adults.\n If you are currently unable to afford or support this campaign, feel free to contact us and we are always happy to help and provide this Mag-Net Tiles and Color TALE paint book to you or your local educational providers.\nMany thanks to all of the team members for devoting their valuable time and skills from the beginning of the campaign and supporting Shape & Share in order to succeed at all stages of the development process.\nWhat age is appropriate?\nThe Mag-Net Tiles can be enjoyed from the age of 4, up to 120...\nToy safety\nMag-Net Tiles have been tested and approved in authorised laboratories of SGS (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance) for toy examination in France, Standards for safety and security are agreed with European regulations (CE).\n What are the cognitive benefits that the use of this game has for the user? \nThe main potential resides in the training of an abstract thinking, it helps in developing mental health with benefits such as increased focus and decreased anxiety, according to our research.\n  The given three-dimensional-shapes stimulate the sense of visual perception and allows us to create further images. The youngest ones benefit with a sense for \"serialisation, structure and order\". The black board guides your attention on your work and while adding more and more colour-tiles this effect gradually get\u00b4s stronger.\nWhat about creativity?\nThe younger child will probably form \"pictures\" of his or her own imagination. Just like the good old \"Tangram\", but today with our more appealing shapes and colours. The only limit here is your imagination! The older users are getting stimulated by our models as well as any other real World ideas (e.g. art, technology, nature, daily life items, logos...)\nCan my motor skills develop with this toy?\nSince the suggested models are challenging to work on accurately, it improves our eye-hand coordination (motor skills in other words). This means that you will, in the process of laying the tiles properly, enhance your motor skills.\n Is this game a family-toy as well? \nCertainly, it is always fun to create some innovative and engaging projects together, and do that as a game! The advantage is that you can keep your assembled works and exhibit them with pride at \"your united projects\" section.\nWhy do you think this game is motivating?\nOf course it may seem challenging at first, positioning the tiles in the correct way, but as you are progressing further you come closer to fulfil your chosen project! Which in result is very satisfying!\nCan the toy been played in more than one way?\nThere are numerous possibilities to play this game. Such as, you could work with your child on a picture and one will \"secretly\" change the previous one! Now would be the question: What has changed? Will you remember? This can be fun and could train your memory. You could compete in who can build the fastest, the opportunities are endless.\nIs the toy worth the costs?\nThe board and the tiles are produced from high-quality material and hold an approval from the SGS and CE certificate (see previous questions). You will feel and see that our product has a high-valency. Besides it is a one-time investment and if you look after it, you will enjoy the Mag-Net Tiles for a long time!\nDoes the toy reflect the child's individuality?\nThe fact that in \"playing\" there is no right or wrong, it`s evolving with our game!\n                     The beginner will first maybe get fascinated by just laying the tiles without a special order, but will soon lay simple \"pictures\" and will from there, develop more and more abstract and challenging models...

It is made from Pi\u00f1atex; a natural, sustainable textile made from pineapple leaves. All the materials are 100% vegan and cruelty-free. The backpack is carefully designed + ethically made in a small local artisanal workshop.\nWe support slow fashion and design and produce our bags using the same values.\nWho are we? \nWe are Fi by Gaja, a small startup fashion brand from Slovenia. Our sustainable bags have a clean and thoughtful design.\nOur brand emphasizes individuality, freedom and having a connection with nature. It is aimed at urban and environmentally conscious women.\nCollection\nWhy is Dahlia BAGpack multifunctional? \nBecause you can turn the backpack into a shoulder bag in just three easy steps! The shoulder straps of the backpack are removable with a detachable metal ring. The handle of the bag made from Pi\u00f1atex is also removable. \nRemovable straps\nMultifunctional\nDahlia BAGpack like a bag\nThe bag closes with a magnetic button and zipper. At the back, there is also a practical pocket with a zipper, where you can store the things you want to have to hand.\nDetails\nWhy is Dahlia BAGpack sustainable and what is Pi\u00f1atex?\nThe backpack is sustainable because we use carefully selected materials which are cruelty-free and have a low environmental impact. \nPi\u00f1atex is an innovative natural textile made from waste pineapple leaf fibre.\nPi\u00f1atex\u2019s journey starts in the Philippines where the pineapple leaves, a by-product of the existing agricultural industry, are collected. The leaves of the plant are processed to extract the fibres and these are manufactured into a non-woven substrate. No extra land, water or pesticides are required to produce the raw material.\nPi\u00f1atex is also R E A C H compliant. It is lightweight, durable and water-resistant. The material is sustainable, ethically sourced and has a low environmental footprint.\nThe dyes used for Pi\u00f1atex are GOTS approved and the resins comply with AFIRM standards.\nPi\u00f1atex\u00ae certificates\nWe already have great experience using the material when producing some small bag collections with it. It is pleasant to the touch and has an interesting texture.\nThe lining of the backpack is made from organic cotton with a Fi by Gaja original print. It has both a zippered and open pocket.\nMaterials\nThe shoulder straps are made using recycled ECONYL yarn. Econyl is made from recycled fishing nets and textile waste. The material is OEKO TEX 100 certified. The straps are removable with a detachable metal ring.\nStraps from Econyl\nAnother aspect of sustainability\nThe backpack is lightweight and the well thought out design gives it that timeless quality. It can be worn in all seasons and combined with different styles.\nYou can wear it for a walk around the city, for a business event or a weekend getaway in the countryside.\nHow big is Dahlia BAGpack?\nThe dimensions of the Dahlia BAGpack are: 30 cm x 33 cm x 10 cm (11,8 in x 13 in x 4 in). It fits a 13-inch laptop and everything on the picture: a book, a planner, a wallet, sunglasses, a mobile phone, 4 x Pencil case from Pi\u00f1atex, a tablet and 2 x mandarin orange.\n\nRewards\nAll the rewards that include the Dahlia BAGpack will be shipped to backers on Earth Day on 22 April 2021. We will send you a survey to collect information about your colour preferences and your shipping address soon after the campaign is finished.\nCollection of Dahlia BAGpacks: light grey, black, light green and blue colour.\nLight green and blue Dahlia BAGpack\nLight grey Dahlia BAGpack\nBlack Dahlia BAGpack\nPencil cases: light grey, black, light green and blue.\nTimeline\nWhat are we planning to do with the money that we raise on our campaign?\n70% of our goal will be spent on the purchase of sustainable materials (Pi\u00f1atex, organic cotton with a custom print and Econyl straps + all the metal accessories) and for the manufacturing. 10% will cover our other expenses (promotions, photo & video shootings). All the rest will be used for the future development of new products and collections and also for the expansion of the Fi by Gaja brand.\n\nDesigned and ethically made in Slovenia \nMultifunctional Dahlia BAGpack is designed and entirely made in Slovenia. We are collaborating with a small artisanal workshop from Vrhnika, where almost all Fi by Gaja bags made from Pi\u00f1atex are produced.\nOur collections are usually made in small series. If we will have the opportunity to widen our production, we will still strive to cooperate with other small local businesses.\nIt is our priority to keep our production in our local environment and to ensure our contractors have a fair wage and regulated working conditions.\n\n Fi by Gaja journey\nGaja Hanzel, Fi by Gaja founder and designer\nFi by Gaja fashion brand and startup were created by Gaja Hanzel in 2018. She is a fashion and graphic designer and she noticed that sustainability and design don't always go hand in hand. Her passion for design and caring for the environment motivated her to focus on designing modern looking bags made from sustainable materials.\nIn 2019, she signed up for a mentoring program in the business innovation centre Inkubator Se\u017eana, where her idea and the philosophy of the brand and products became clear.\nShe is collaborating with local small businesses who help her bring her ideas to reality.\n\"I have been carrying around the idea of this backpack for a while now; Kickstarter offers me a great opportunity to share our brand and our products abroad and make my idea a reality. We are a small start-up, any financial help and support goes a long way and I thank everyone that will support this project and our entire philosophy to allow us to expand and continue our journey.\" Gaja\nDahlia BAGpacks\nDon't forget to follow all of Fi by Gaja stories on social media.

The palm shaped wooden egg feels cozy and soothes your body and mind with the feeling of warm comfort.\n\nMASSAGE OBJECT: The rounded shape of the Zen Egg allows you to hold it firmly in your hand and apply pressure directly and easily to relieve body tension. The warmth of the solid wood and inherent aroma gives the egg the natural feel that your body responds to.\n\nCONVERSATION STARTER: Create a calmer and understanding work environment by starting an open conversation about stress and anxiety. Zen Egg has a strong \"wow\" effect that sparks curiosity and creates an opportunity to start the conversation about the things that matters to you.\nCONCEPT: Zen Egg was created with an emphasis on tangible sensations. We are tactile creatures; it\u2019s common for us to have something in our hands. I started to realize that every object that we hold is associated with some activity that we automatically start to do. It\u2019s for this reason that I wanted to develop an object that would be associated with taking time out.\n\nMATERIAL: Zen Egg is made out of different types of wood that you can choose to match your character, style, or environment. You will choose the egg material after the campaign in a survey: Oak, Walnut, Beech, Cherry, Maple, Wenge, Zebrano, Mahogany.\n\nLOCALLY PRODUCED: Zen Eggs are hand-crafted, following an age-old tradition of local Slovenian woodcraft. Even though the shape itself looks minimalistic, the process  behind it requires a great deal of expertise and focus on making it. Every Zen Egg is treated with organic oils to increase its durability. They are made with a high  level of precision, tested, and checked to ensure top level quality.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS: Measures, weight, and currently available wood types. We will add another wood types of wood for the Alter Eggo (+) when we overpass 50 orders for this size.\nRE-ENGINEERED: Zen Egg was re-engineered, from inside out to impress your with outstanding quality, attentively polished surface, and beautified shape. We improved the weight system insert, and optimized the gluing and assembling process to ensure the exceptional durability of Zen Egg.\n\nTHE ZEN EGG \"ALTER EGGO\" EDITION: You will elongate the calming experience with slower and longer swaying of bigger sized Zen Egg Alter Eggo. Its greater presence will enhance the zen vibe in your environment. Touching and fidgeting the huge wooden egg will satisfy your sensations with warmth and coziness. \nWhy did we name it Alter Eggo? The term \"alter ego\" is used for a second-self created by the individual, usually to live out a better version of the self. And that's the name of the game of the Zen Egg project.\n\nZEN TUNES are 5x few minutes long audio guided tapes, that help you to calm your mind and build a new perspective on situations that usually wreck your nerves. \nIn few minutes they will put you in good mood, where you will be able to gain the new habit o thinking. It will support you to change your reaction and act constructively in stressful moments. It is not just a quick calm down tape, it is a tutorial that help you to change. Zen Tunes doesn't give you fish, it teaches you how to fish yourself.\nTopics that are currently covered: (1.) Coming home from work, stressed out... now what? (2.) I had a fight with a partner ... how can I feel more connected? (3.) I feel stuck financially... how to solve the puzzle? ... and more\nWOOD TYPES: You will be able to chose the desired wood type later in a survey (after the Kickstarter campaign ends). For now you only chose the type and quantity of the Zen Eggs.\nADD ON: For more products use ADD ON options. When you click \"continue\" or \"pledge\" for desired Zen Egg, the new \"configure reward\" section appears. Here you can add on another products.\nEARLY DECEMBER SHIPPING / HOLIDAY GIFT REWARD OR ADD ON: We will be able to produce a very limited batch of new Zen Egg (the smallest one) for shipping before the December Holidays! Available woods: Wenge, Mahogany, Zebrano, Walnut. You can get this reward as a PLEDGE or ADD ON that adds it in your existing pledge. Holiday gift will be shipped in early December, the rest in march.\n\u275d I loved mine so much that my brother bought one for himself, it sits next to his couch on the side table in their family room. We\u2019re both very happy with our purchase and I\u2019ve always contemplated buying one for my home too. There\u2019s something about a nice clean shape with a beautiful wood grain. thank you for taking the time to make these, I think they\u2019re wonderful. \u275e\n\u275d I liked the story behind having something physical in my life where I produce mostly digital things. It helps me think. It helps me destress. It\u2019s also a conversation starter. I think at the end of the day -- it is what you make it. For me, it\u2019s a great product that I appreciate every day while I\u2019m in my office (I keep one at both of my offices). \u275e\n\u275d I appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail. More importantly, I feel connected to your energy and creativity, as if I were part of making your dream a reality.

We designed it and sourced the producers, but the tooling and material costs are simply too much for us to afford on our own. The crowdfunding campaign goal is to cover the costs of tools, optimizing the production on a large production scale and materials costs. After these costs are covered, we\u2019ll be able to run the Zen Egg project more sustainably.\n\nFIRST THANKS TO YOU. You took time to take a look at our project and we are happy you did. Fell free to write to us, ask question, comment, or share the project to people you care about.\nTHANK YOU OUR COWORKERS.

We use advanced high-quality food-grade impregnation to protect the wood from humidity.\n4. We make Zen Egg in a slow manner to ensure the wood is correctly dried and glued together.\nReusability and recyclability\n1. The packaging we use is 100% recyclable and made out of paper.

Bojan Zajc is a leading traditional woodworker with a workshop that follows sustainable production guidelines. For iron weight we cooperate with Griffing d.o.o. that has just won an AAA excellency of business in Slovenia.\nSustainable Distribution\nZen Egg has been designed to be as light as possible which minimizes the environmental impact caused by shipping.

We can now hardly imagine a life without all of that, but have you ever asked yourself what all those \u201caddictions\u201d do to the quality of our lives? We socialize less, we, especially children, exercise less and that is why we are more prone to various illnesses. To prevent that, we must create a better future for all of us. Physical activity and socializing, especially through playing games, are a recipe for a long and happy life. HopaGame is a solution as it offers the whole package. Did you know that by playing one game you could burn up to 300 Kcal?\nIt is all about the personal contact which was an integral part of personal and social development through the whole history. We need socialization, affability, fun, and more. That is why we decided to offer you something sociable, affable, fun, playful and all of that live and personal. The answer is HOPA.\nWhat came out of your mouth the last time you tripped? The answer is HOPA.\nWhy did you cheer when you toasted with your friends? The answer is HOOOOOOPAAAAAAA!\nIt is almost unimaginable to have a day go by without HOPA. Hopa is among us, you might have just not been aware of it.\nWhy not making the most of your travels by meeting people from different continents, communities, religions, traditions and hanging out with them, playing and having fun? Has anyone ever offered you entertainment, fun, and pleasure and at the same time income? How many times did you want to make changes in your life? Unsatisfied with your job. Stressful life. Not spending enough time with your loved ones. Wanting to make new friends. Peace, understanding, unity, game, fun, etc.\nOur vision is to connect as many people around the world as possible into the HOPA Community \u2018HOPAASSOCIATION\u2019. We are going to achieve that though tasks that are pleasant to us all: travelling, fun, socializing and games \u2013 Holidays Organization & Playing Association (HOPA). And income.\nDid you know that HOPA is a registered trademark, a brand that promises H appiness, O pportunity, P leasure, A dventure?\nHOPA.GAME can be played all around the world and you will always feel #Happiness when you are winning, #Opportunity to win your best score, #Pleasure to score HOPA Bonus and #Adventure to play all around the world.\n\nWe have developed a HopaGame. The first prototype was manufactured by the students of Carpentry school from Maribor, Slovenia, so it was made in EU, made from wood and was thus environmentally friendly. After we subjected the game to rigorous testing, we decided to create the final version of the game from Eco Silicone because it makes no noise and can be played indoors as well as outdoors. The game is easy to use. Everyone can compete and every amateur can become a professional. The game does not distinguish between short and tall, thin and fat, young and old, etc. WE ARE ALL EQUAL WHEN PLAYING THE HOPA GAME!\nWe have all once had or still have a role model, an idol. Usually, those people are athletes, movie stars and singers and most of them have the amount of wealth they would not be able to spend in more than one lifetime. Where is your current financial security?\nHopaGame offers financial stability or even independency. And the monetary fund will increase each year.\nLook for the HRCC\u2014Hopa Red Carpet Competition\u2014near you and qualify for the grand finale. Check Hopa.Game for updates.\n\nHow do I become a member of the Hopa Association? Become HOPA family member\nIt\u2019s very simple. Just like everything else that we do. Enter your data into the system.\n\nCOMPETITIONS\nCompetitions will be held on different locations and for different levels:\nRecreational (pubs, cafes, birthdays, garden, picnic, team buildings, etc.)\nInternal (companies, clubs, schools, universities, retirement homes, etc.)\nExternal (all \u2013 pubs, companies, schools, retirements homes, etc.)\nLocal\nRegional\nNational\nEuropean\nInternational\nOther options, suggested by you.\nHOW TO PLAY / RULES\nThe chips are tossed from the 295 cm distance (9.7 ft).

Even today, the feelings of joy and happiness are vivid.\nNow I am also the father of two children, to whom I wanted to give just the same experience as I had as a child. In my search for an original and slightly different model from the flood of cheap plastic copies, I noticed that nowhere can you get a ride-on car made of wood. All that was available was cheap plastic copies of cars. \nThe idea then developed on its own. I wanted to create a wooden children\u2019s car. With my experience and technical knowledge, I studied the possibility of making such a product and together with my colleagues implemented ideas and perfected it. \nWoody was born \u2013 THE FIRST ELECTRIC RIDE-ON CAR FOR CHILDREN MADE OF WOOD. \nMatev\u017e Reber\u010dnik, creator of Woody CAR\n\nHow it  all started?\nStory of project Woody starts more than one year ago. First designs were created several months later, and first fully functional prototype was bringing joy to kids in spring. \nWith proof of concept complete we got overwhelming support and praise from our peers. This pushed us to develop this idea into something more than just side project.\nWe learned from first prototype, greatly improved design in every way with safety and reliability at the top of our priorities. \nWe sourced only the best, well proven components and materials, performed daily real-world tests and carried out laboratory tests to confirm our product meets or exceeds EU directives and harmonized standards for toys.\n Still, we never stop improving. By the time we send you rewards we plan to make many more improvements, get our product tested by independent lab and upgrade our workshop machinery and knowledge - all in the name off better, safer product. \nFrom one-off experiment, to side project, to complete Kickstarter product with message for better future.\nMatev\u017e\nMatev\u017e is where it all started. With degree in mechatronics engineering, many years in e-mobility sector and hands on person from early age this project is his personal passion and challenge. \nInnovator and car enthusiast coming from one of the greenest countries in the world where wood-craft culture is rooted in its people it is no surprise Woody CAR was created here. \nLike all his projects Woody CAR is constant work in progress, constantly finding ways to improve existing design as he prides himself as perfectionist who wants to create the best possible creation each time.\n\u201cWhen you become parent and you try to spend as much time as possible with your children you realize that time will not last forever. Years fly by and you want to make each moment count; no really, read that again and let it sink in. I choose toys with educational value, not just physical but also mental, to help develop motor skills and real-world learning experience. And why limit fun only to young ones, Woody is made to bring fun, joy and pride to all.\u201d\n\nBut this project could not be realized by only one person. \nJaka\nJaka is one of the first supporters and part of this story from its beginning. With many successful business ventures under its name it provides valuable support to this project. \nAndrej\nAndrej is seasoned master carpenter with many years of craftsmanship experience. His resume includes many unique, hand crafted wooden products under his own brand name.\nWoody CAR team\nWe all share common vision - to offer the world environmentally friendly alternative to plastic ride-on vehicles. We take pride in what we do or create, and we strive to continuously better ourselves and our products.\nKnow someone who would love Woody CAR?

Not sure how Kickstarter crowdfunding works? Let us help you with some quick basic facts regarding our project.\nHow Kickstarter works?\nKickstarter is crowdfunding site used as launchpad for companies or individuals to raise funds for their ideas to become reality. This could be used for development, production or just to prove market viability of the product.\nWhat happens if you back the project (pledge)?\nWhen you back a project you contribute funds to overall goal of making product a reality. For this you are rewarded with exclusive discounts, early deliveries and other exiting rewards that depend on pledged amount. In our case, backers can get fully functional final product with discounted prices before they are available anywhere else and additional individual perks. Sooner you pledge, sooner you get accesses to excusive content, project updates and important milestones.\nHow to back this project and collect rewards?\nTo back our project, select reward you want to receive and amount you want pledge. You will select your shipping country and finally set up your payment. Remember, in case funding goal is not achieved your pledged funds are not collected, so ether you get your reward, or you get your money back!\nAfter successfully funding campaign we will send order form with further instruction to e-mail address associated with your Kickstarter Account. In this form we will also collect your delivery address.\nWhen are rewards delivered?\nPredicted delivery dates are listed with each reward type. Generally, our delivery timetable plans for first units to be delivered to customers by the end of November, while other rewards will be delivered in first months of 2021. Please note that this are our best estimates, delivery dates can differ from country to country and because of production delays. \nSHIPPING & WARRANTY\nDoes Woody CAR have a warranty?\nYes. Woody CAR comes with standard 1-year warranty on all parts and battery. We want our customers to have confidence in our product and service. Termes and conditions of warranty are listed in User manual.\nHow long is shipping time to my destination?\nEU based addresses can expect deliveries in 14 days after dispatch. Non-EU based addresses will be shipped via Express Air cargo freight. Delivery times can vary substantially form destination to destination, but should be delivered within 14 days after dispatch \nAre there VAT or other fees related to shipping?\nNo. We cover VAT and other fees based on current legislation in country of origin (Slovenia). What we send you is a gift/reward for your donation, so there should be no import fees, but in some cases anchorites can still circumvent this, so we can't take any responsibility if there are additional fees for addresses outside EU. After delivery we will send invoice to your provided e-mail address.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMain purpose of our Kickstarter project is to see if you, potential likeminded backers have same vision as we have. With this project we want to unlock affordable alternative to plastic ride on vehicles, not just for small select group of people but for everyone, this is our goal. \nTo achieve this, we of course need confirmation from you, our backers, that you want us to make this happen. In turn, we can confidently order larger quantities of materials used in creating Woody CAR, we can negotiate better prices, lower shipping costs, constantly improve our product, all for you, our customers and for our environment. If our campaign is not successful, we will be very limited in production quantities, price and shipping option.\n\nWith your funding we will also be able to make product safer thru harmonized standard testing by independent testing laboratories. We want to make sure these tests are performed before we send out the bulk of our rewards to ensure maximum safety for all potential users. These of course can be delayed if we need to adjust several things according to test results. \n\nWith more than 250+ individual parts needed to make each Woody CAR there can be delays in manufacturing due to complications in part deliveries and supplier manufacturing. We do take these possible delays into account with our reward fulfillment timetable and set our initial production goals very low for this reason.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Matev\u017e\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nEngineer by education, creator and explorer by profession.

As free movement outdoors and physical gatherings became impossible, me and a few classmates started yoga classes online. I was a bit sceptic in the beginning for I believe in the energy of the physical presence but soon understood that these virtual moments were one of those that were saving my days.\nMy yoga teacher started working intensely on social media and asked me whether I would be interested  in drawing yoga poses in order to enrich and add value to her video explanations of each one of them. I have been thinking of drawing yoga poses for a long time but it seems like the time had to get ripe and here it was. I can\u2019t really move but I need to stay active. There is so much fear all around so I need to breathe consciously. The trick is to keep breathing. Practising and drawing yoga poses are all about what I mentioned before.\nThe trick is to keep breathing.\nSo I started drawing. The more I drew, the more it all made sense. The illustrations I was creating had a surprisingly strong impact: I percieved them as embodiments of pure stillness - active stillness - very conscious active stillness made of colourful lights; merging of spirit and matter. As my collection of \u201cillustrated yoga\u201d grew and with it my enthusiasm to do more I felt it is time for the next step: sharing it with the world.\nOriginal drawings, aquarelle markers.\nVirabhadrasana - Warrior II Pose.\nDirection and Path \nFirstly - with your most kind help - I would like to produce a limited edition of high quality art prints. (I am very much tempted to apply my yoga series drawings onto unique pieces of clothing on the next stage.) Each art print featuring a calmly up-lifting, vividly vibrant, strongly energetic illustration is a reminder about what truly matters. It is very simple and extremely hard at the same time - it is finding one\u2019s peace by merging spirit and matter.\nAnd that\u2019s what my project is all about. Your support will help me make it alive.\nWin - Win\nAs a thank-you gift for supporting my creative process and my project you could choose between a hand-signed and dated postcard from the drawing series Active Stillness,\nVrishchikasana - Scorpion Pose // Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana - Revolved Head-of-the-Knee Pose // Utthita Trikonasana - Extended Triangle Pose // Adho Mukha Svanasana - Downward-Facing Dog Pose // Tittibhasana - Firefly Pose // Urdhva Padmasana - Upward Lotus Pose (from top to bottom, from left to right)\n ... a signed, limited edition unique piece of clothing featuring one of my illustrations from the drawing series Active Stillness,\nVrksasana - Tree Pose // Padmasana - Lotus Pose\n... or a hand-signed, numbered and dated limited edition high quality art print from the drawing series Active Stillness.\nPadangusthasana - Big Toe Pose\nVirabhadrasana - Warrior II Pose\nPadmasana - Lotus Pose\nAdho Mukha Svanasana - Downward-Facing Dog Pose\nVrksasana - Tree Pose\n\nNext step\nI attend to create a 2021 calendar, full of graceful yoga poses.

The game covers the Balkan Peninsula theater where one small country, The Kingdom of Serbia, was invaded by three fierce Empires, Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.\nIf you want to sign up for our newsletter, please visit  March on the Drina and leave your email. Thank you!\nMarch on the Drina began development in 2013 as the centennial anniversary of World War I approached. We wanted to make a game about the lesser known theater of WWI \u2013 The Balkan Peninsula Theater.  Without further ado, we invite you now to enjoy experiencing historically grounded components, a taste for the exciting gameplay, and the immersion into the battlefront of the Balkan Peninsula.\nFor easier maneuvering we used magnetic tokens.\nMarch on the Drina is a game for 2-4 players ages 14+. The game duration is from 120 to 180 minutes. Each player controls one of the powers in conflict: Serbia, Germany, Austro-Hungary or Bulgaria. \nThe setting from July 1914 to December 1918 is divided in 14 periods, where each period is described in one Calendar Card. Each Calendar Card also brings some effect to the game, so by using Calendar Cards, you will also learn highlights about the most important events of World War I.  \nEach power has four types of units: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery and Generals. All units have their attacking and defending values used to resolve combat.\nWhen all Calendar Cards are used, the game ends. In order to win, Central powers (Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria) work together and they must occupy all Serbian cities and hold them for one round. If Serbia wants to win, it must liberate all its cities and hold them for one round. If the game ends after 14 periods and neither side completes its goal, the winner is the side who controls most Serbian cities.\nBefore players place their units on the Game Board, each side takes one mini map where, without knowledge of the other side, can mark a starting point for every unit under their control. In that way, the opponent has no idea where you will place your defense or from where the main attack will come.\nArea within 3 fields from the field with a general is called General\u2019s Area of Command and units within that area are under that general\u2019s command. Each General has a special ability, which is written on his General\u2019s card. General\u2019s special ability is transferred on the units under his command.\nArtillery have greater range of action than Infantry and Cavalry, so it can attack (fire upon) enemy units within a 3 field area.\nIn late October 1915, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria launched a synchronised major offensive against Serbia. That same month, France and Britain landed four divisions at Salonika, but were unable to move north to help their outnumbered Serbian ally caught between the invading forces. \nIf the enemy is pressing too hard, Serbian units may use the option of Retreat through Albania, which becomes available in January 1916.\nIf Serbian units stand on one of the five fields in northern Albania that are marked on the game board with dark gray color, it is automatically transferred to one of the dark gray color fields in northern Greece.\nCities have Military Capacity. The sum of the Military Capacity of the cities under player's control represents National Military Capacity and players can use Military Capacity Units to purchase reinforcements.\nWatch our How to Play video\n Click here to download English Rulebook for March on the Drina \n\nIf you would like our game in your store, please contact us on princepsgames@gmail.com.

By pledging from just $79 (Kickstarter discount) we'll give you everything you need to get started:\n1. Our new complete virtual drum kit that's silent and portable.\n2. A 3 month subscription to our app (iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows) that will teach you to play and much more.\nWe love playing the drums but they're large, loud, and expensive. That's why we've created an instrument that's silent, portable, and significantly more affordable.\nOur solution is a complete hardware and software subscription service that will give you everything you need to start playing the drums.\nThis tightly integrated relationship between instrument and app will transform the way that you practice and give you deeper insights into your improvements.\n\nLEARN TO PLAY ALONG TO MUSIC\nPLAY\n\nOur app takes learning to a new level of fun. We will include a catalog of licensed music so that you can learn to play along with your favourite songs. Our software will show you what you should play and how well you are playing it.\nTRACK YOUR PROGRESS \nThe activity analysis in our app removes the guesswork from tracking your progress. We'll summarise the following data in chronological order from each of your practice sessions so that it's easy to find and read:\nPlay time: how long did you play for and when\n  Intensity: did you take it easy or did you thrash it?\n  Your set list: songs you played along to\n  Recordings: listen back to your recorded practice sessions\n  Accuracy: how accurate you are with tempo, hitting the right drums, and muscle memory.\n  Notes: annotate your practice sessions to jog your memory later on\n  SHARE YOUR RECORDINGS \n You'll have so much fun improving your skills that you won't be able to keep it to yourself. We're making recording the drums easier than ever before. Simply share your recordings with the Freedrum community in a few clicks.\nOUTPUT MIDI TO ANY DAW\nOnce you\u2019re ready to take your drumming into production, output MIDI from our app to your favourite Digital Audio Workstation such as GarageBand, Ableton, and Pro Tools. You\u2019ll be able to remap the MIDI so that you can:\nTrigger different notes\n  Set continuous controller values\n  Define fixed velocities\n \nNEVER STOP LEARNING\nEven the pro's never stop learning. Our service will grow with your confidence level and keep challenging you to be better. We'll recommend exercises that encourage improvement as well as retention of learned skills.\nHAPTIC FEEDBACK \nPLAY\n\nNothing is going to replace the feeling of playing behind an acoustic drum kit but our new virtual drum kit will bring you closer. Haptic feedback (similar to what you feel with a game console controller) creates a unique sensation based on which drum you hit and how hard. We\u2019ve done this by recreating the vibrations you feel when playing an acoustic kit.\nHEEL UP\n\nOne of the most requested features from our customers is the ability to play the bass pedal with your heel up: increasing your speed and comfort. This will work for single bass, double bass, and the hi-hat.\nCUSTOM GRIP STYLES \n In our app you will be able to select your preferred drumstick grip style for both left and right-handed playing: intelligently re-calibrating the drumstick sensors to meet the ergonomic grip of your choice.\nPackages and Upfront Cost\nIt's our mission to make Freedrum compatible with as many devices as possible. As our name suggests, you should be free to use our product in a way that suits you best. Please refer to our FAQ for a full list of supported devices. \nSince Freedrum is using interactive audio, Bluetooth headphones and speakers have an inherent latency that makes it difficult to play. Please refer to our FAQ page for more information.\nThanks to you, the community, our first virtual drum kit reached over 400% of the Kickstarter goal and we delivered our rewards, on time, 9 months later. Since 2017 we've shipped 15 000 units globally and we've listened to all of your feedback. We're back, four years later to ask for your help once more.

By August, despite running almost every day for three months, I was no faster than I was at the beginning of the summer. I realized that what I needed was the competitive edge I got from racing alongside one of my faster friends. But with everyone busy all the time, we could never quite get our schedules to line up.\nAfter yet another subpar workout, I had a thought- what if we could somehow build the ultimate training partner? One that I could train with on my schedule that would still help me get the competitive benefits of training with a partner. And that\u2019s how the idea of the Ghost Pacer was born- a pair of glasses that project a holographic training partner that runners could run with anywhere, at any time. Not only would it improve my time, it would make each workout that much more effective.\nAt every step of the way, we have been advised by experts in both running and technology, helping ensure that we deliver the best product possible. And now, three years and countless solder burns later, we are ready to launch on Kickstarter and bring the Ghost Pacer to the world. Please back us today, and get the most effective and reliable workout partner the world has ever seen.\n- AR Bhatti (CEO of Ghost Pacer)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we prepare to deliver the Ghost Pacer, we are continuing to work very closely with our advisors who have delivered products like the Hololens and Emotiv headset.

The generosity of our backers has encouraged us that many share our values and vision, and want to help us transform the justice system through free technology. So, we are setting a stretch goal of $50,000. Prisons are still on lockdown due to COVID-19. Your contributions will fund free letters for 4,000 families over the next three months. Thank you for your support.\nWhat is Ameelio?  \nAmeelio is a nonprofit technology company committed to transforming prison communications. Through free letters, postcards, and video calling, we're supporting meaningful connection between incarcerated people and their loved ones outside. Our vision is to disrupt the captive prison telecommunications industry, decouple incarceration and profit, and reduce recidivism. \n\nAs of May 15, 2019, Ameelio Inc, EIN 84-1800611 is a registered nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization based in Connecticut, USA. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n Ameelio\u2019s work intersects the two issues most central to the public consciousness right now: COVID-19 and criminal justice reform. Prisons are on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19, and incarcerated people are more isolated than ever. 95% of Americans support criminal justice reform. Supporting human connection to reduce recidivism is the first step towards a more rehabilitative justice system. We are an innovative solution for this historic moment.\nN.B.

Continue as guest.\"\nPROBLEM\nThe $1.2 billion prison communications industry generates obscene profits (51% margin for Securus, 2015) by charging extortionate prices to the incarcerated and their loved ones. Families report spending up to $500 a month to stay connected to their loved ones inside. A 15-minute phone call runs as steep as $25.\nWhy? Exclusive contracts leave prison telecommunications companies unchecked by competition: former FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn called the industry \u201cthe clearest, most glaring type of market failure I\u2019ve ever seen as a regulator.\u201d \n\n\n\nPoverty and incarceration are bound in a vicious cycle. Over 50% of incarcerated people had no income in the 8 years preceding their arrest; four years post-release, around 50% of formerly incarcerated people are still without income. Industries like these entrench this cycle. One in three families with incarcerated loved ones is forced into debt (by $13,000, on average) by the costs of maintaining contact.\nThis is a social and moral disaster.\n\nSOLUTION\n  We\u2019re outcompeting profit-driven telecommunications providers with better, cheaper solutions that seek to serve, not exploit, the incarcerated and their loved ones.\n\nLETTERS FOR FAMILIES\nThrough our web and mobile app, users can send free letters and photos to any incarcerated person in the U.S. criminal justice system. We\u2019re removing financial barriers to contact between incarcerated people and their loved ones to build community and lift financial burdens from loved ones of the incarcerated. \n\nPLAY\n\nRichard Watkins of Emerge CT, a New Haven based nonprofit, discussing the importance of receiving letters while incarcerated.\n\nLETTERS FOR ORGANIZATIONS\n  Closing the revolving door of recidivism requires coordinated reentry support. Letters for Organizations, a paid add-on to Letters, connects incarcerated people who are nearing their release dates with organizations providing support in finding employment, housing, healthcare, legal support, and more.\nCONNECT: VIDEO CONFERENCING\nThe closest substitute for in-person contact, Ameelio\u2019s video conferencing platform will connect incarcerated people with their loved ones, lawyers, educational and telehealth resources, and more \u2014 for free. We have secured our first partner facility. By 2021, we will have launched the nation\u2019s first free prison video conferencing platform.\nMaintaining contact with family members and loved ones during a period of incarceration is essential, especially now during the pandemic, and even more so for juvenile offenders\u2026 Video visits can help provide an important emotional connection, and sense of normalcy during these very unusual and trying times. \n\u2014  Former CT Department of Corrections Commissioner, Rollin Cook\n\nPLAY\n\nIMPACT\nSince our launch just three months ago, we\u2019ve sent more than 22,000 letters to over 1,000 correctional facilities in the U.S. We have over 5,500 users in 49 states and 29 countries. Our growth has been completely organic. \nBut our growth statistics cannot capture our impact. Countless users have reached out to thank us and describe Ameelio\u2019s impact on their lives:\nI can't tell you how much difference your organization has made for me and my loved one\u2026 my LO gets one 15min call per day... how can you keep a father-child relationship strong with that? it rips families apart... you have been able to help... it means a lot... thanks again.    \u2014 Steven\nThank u for everything it really helps cause money is so tight and I can\u2019t afford stamps. I'm choosing stamps to talk to my husband or my heart meds that are expensive. I don't have insurance.     \u2014 Savannah\nWHAT ARE YOU FUNDING?\n100% of our revenue from this campaign will fund free letters for families impacted by incarceration. A pledge of just $100 will fund one family's letters to their incarcerated loved one for an entire year. By supporting our work, you're directly supporting families impacted by incarceration, and committing to building a more humane justice system.\nWHO'S BEHIND AMEELIO? \nWe're a team of over 50 engineers, students, and designers. Some of us have personal experience with the justice system. But most importantly, we're people who believe that everyone experiencing incarceration should be able to stay connected to their loved ones. \nUzoma Orchingwa, Ameelio\u2019s co-founder and CEO, is a P.D. Soros Fellow and student at the Yale Law School. His interest in criminal justice reform is rooted both in his childhood experiences, and in his desire to eliminate financial and social barriers that entrench cycles of poverty. He became passionate about the problem of prison telecommunications while pursuing his MPhil in Criminology as a Gates Scholar at the University of Cambridge. \nGabriel Saruhashi, co-founder and CTO, is a senior at Yale College, where he studies Computer Science and Psychology. He has experience working as a Software Engineer at Facebook and Product Manager Zippi (YC S\u201919), and is passionate about building technology that serves populations historically overlooked by innovators.\nPLAY\n\n\n\nSUPPORTERS\n\nPRESS\nYou can learn more about us on Tech Crunch, Fast Company, Business Insider, Trend Watching's Innovation of the Day, The Washington Post. \n\nWant to know where we're getting our stats?

Our body and home care products come in a bundle that includes a dispenser and powder refill doses that are both fully recyclable. An important fact of our product in terms of sustainability is that to avoid producing more plastic than it is already on our planet, we\u2019ve chosen to manufacture our dispensers out of 100% recycled single-use plastic bottle waste.\nSustainable materials\nEQUA CARE has been designed in a sustainable way with the full product life-cycle in mind, from the bottle production, packaging, and formula development. We chose recycled plastic as a long-term alternative solution to the glass material.\n\nWhen researching the carbon footprint of different materials, we found out that recycled PET is the most efficient option for body and home care products, since no new materials need to be produced in the process. Our dispenser creates 4 times less carbon footprint than a glass bottle would from the production and transport. More about materials\u2019 efficiency and their carbon footprint here: www.ecolizer.be\n\nAnother reason for not using glass is that it can break and therefore be unsafe, especially in the shower area.\nSustainable Distribution\nDistribution is an entire part of EQUA CARE.

I am an urban planner, architect, illustrator, painter and conceptual artist.  \nArtist Tom. Schlegl and his (Trump-like) Statue of Liberty (2019)\nIn the time of the Corona virus, my architectural work has completely stopped. The horrors around the world prompted me to start creating a fairy tale called The Invincible Seven. A fairy tale about a virus that changed the world. This story is now finished and it is here in front of you.\nStarting point  \nThe world is increasingly dominated by pride, greed, lust, wrath, gluttony, envy and sloth. People are neglecting their ethical values. One day they wake up in the middle of deadly pandemic, from which there is no escape. The virus plunges humanity into a giant crisis\u2026\nPerhaps the virus is not a curse at all, but a gift from God? Because of it, many began to realize that they could be better than the vampiric system of capitalism. The virus opened the door to a new society for us. A society that works in solidarity and cooperation. A society that will take care of the common good, for all people and all nature, animate and inanimate.\nWhat kind of society we will form is not a question of tomorrow, but a question of today.\nThe Invincible Seven tells the story of how the world can be different from the one in which our children are currently growing up.\nBook Trailer \nAt the top of the city of Babylon, seven giant chimneys rise into the dark sooty sky. Night and day, fire erupts from the chimneys, creating seven majestic pillars of smoke. Because they are so colorful, the townspeople of Babylon adore the mighty pillars of smoke.\nOne day there was a sudden flash and thunder. Annoyed by the pillars, mighty lightning strikes them. The lightning strike is so violent that little billows of smoke are separated from each chimney. Because the billows of smoke are incandesced by the lightning, they cannot return to the majestic smoke pillars.\nIn order not to extinguish too quickly, they merge into a small column of smoke. They want to see how far the mighty smoke pillars reach into the sky and what is burning at the top. So they start to climb\u2026\nWhat is up there and what happened will remain a mystery for now...\nIllustrations\nThe book is entirely new in the field of illustrated books. For me, this book is like an architectural structure - by turning it, the reader will have a special experience. Its design reflects the author's architectural approach, where the illustrations blend into each other in an original way. You will enjoy looking at 17 inspiring handmade illustrations, which are a pleasure to study for parents and children alike.\nWho is the book for? \nThis educational story is suitable for children age of three and older. It is suitable for all those who want to change the world.\nIt might be a little scary for a toddler. But that is not a problem, because your toddler will grow up. The book will be waiting for him.\nTechnical data about the book\nThe book is 32 pages long. The format is 22.4 x 29.0 mm (8.81 \"x 11.42\"). It is printed on 170 g satin paper. It is a hardcover, sewn with thread. For now, it will be available in English and Slovenian. As a quality artwork, it is ideal as a gift.\nTimeline\n1st July 2020 - the start of the campaign on Kickstarter\n1st August 2020 - in case of a successful campaign, the book goes to print immediately\n20th August 2020 - the book is compressed\n30th August 2020 - the book is sent to your address\nAbout the author  \n\nTom Schlegl is an architect and urban planner. He has shown his talent for drawing and painting from an early age. Although he focused professionally on urbanism and architecture, fine arts remained his true love and with them he expresses his view of life and the world in which we live. In addition to occasional painting exhibitions and performances (for example the famous Trump statue that went viral in August 2019), the author has also been regularly publishing his critical caricatures in Zarja, Slovenia's leading weekly magazine.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks to this project.

Then we figured out that nobody speaks on the phone these days and messengers with emojis and GIFs rule the world... and memes of course.  \n \n         Unlike your regular phone, this device does not need a cellular network or a SIM card to work because it creates its own wireless network and communicates with other Chatter devices you\u2019ve paired it with.\nIt uses the so-called \u201cLoRa\u201d low-power wide-area network technology in order to send text messages, emojis, memes, and GIFs. \nChatter uses a publicly-available set of frequencies that are allocated for use cases like this one.\nThe messages you send to other Chatter devices are encrypted and are not passing through an internet service provider so you can share as many secrets as you want with your friends (maybe we should\u2019ve programmed a pinky swear button). \nThis device is not a replacement for your regular phone and has the range of an average walkie talkie - around 1 - 7km depending on the surrounding area (concrete buildings and basements are usually not a good spot for getting a good range with this thing) but it can prove useful in certain situations.\n\nThe main purpose of Chatter is education and showing people that you can communicate free and remotely without big corporations and the internet.\n What you\u2019ll learn: \nWhat you can do with it:\nText your friends for free\nLoad custom emojis and memes on the device (you don\u2019t want to be a normy, this thing needs to be updated regularly)\nCode a jumping dinosaur game for your Chatter \nPlay the preloaded snake game on it\nWant to know more about Chatter? Click here.\nSTEM Box #6: Clockstar - Build & code your own smartwatch\nWith this kit, we want to show you how to make and code your own smart wearable device. \n \n         Clockstar is equipped with a dual-core ESP32 microcomputer and has Bluetooth low energy and Wi-Fi onboard.\nIt connects to your phone using our mobile app and can mirror your smartphone\u2019s notifications to its 128x128 TFT color display. \nClockstar is also equipped with a gyroscope, accelerometer, and a magnetometer that can be used for precise motion tracking.\n\n         The watch uses machine learning to recognize and memorize different movements that you can assign to trigger certain actions.\n\n         For example, you can train your Clockstar to play/pause your phone\u2019s music app whenever you perform the floss dance.   \n What you\u2019ll learn: \n\n\nWhat you can do with it:\n Check the time (yes, it actually shows time!)\nConnect it to your smartphone and mirror notifications \n Control the media app on your phone with your smartwatch\n Use machine learning to detect when you do a certain Fortnite dance and automatically send a laughing-crying emoji to one of your friends\nCode the watch to count the number of steps you make every day\nPlay the built-in Tetris game on your watch (do this only if you\u2019re really bored)\n Connect the watch to the internet and interface it with our other IoT products such as Spencer or Wheelson\n Want to know more about Clockstar? Click here.\nYes! Gift your loved one the gift of learning!\nOur STEM boxes can be delivered every three months to yourself or straight to the lucky recipient :) \nYour loved one will be reminded of you for a long time with fun electronics projects delivered to their door every three months.\n For kids, adults, and everyone in between \nCircuitMess STEM Box is for the curious minds of kids (ages 11 and up)  and adults interested in electronics, coding, and technology.\nWe\u2019ve done some research and here are the most common buyers of our educational kits.\n1) A caring parent that wants to teach their kids something new\nWhen the kids ask him if they can play Fortnite now, he asks \u201cwhat\u2019s Fortnite?  \n2) An adult who knows nothing about electronics and probably works as an accountant, but would really like to learn something new about the interesting world of technology. \n3) A child prodigy that is doing science and electronics experiments in his/her parent's garage all the time. \n4) A full-stack developer that spent 10 years behind a MacBook\nHe basically knows everything about computers, but he never saw what\u2019s inside a device  IRL.  \n STEM education is still not there, but STEM Box is here to change that \nSTEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education is crucial for everybody's future. Still, STEM education is not there yet.\nMost educational STEM products are not engaging enough for kids. They lack imagination, fun, and usability in children\u2019s daily lives.\nThat\u2019s why we designed a line of products that are going to teach you the skills of the future all while actually being fun to use. \nAll the cool kids are learning by doing!\nLearning about machines by reading a book is boring. STEM Box is going to teach you by doing something with your hands.\n CircuitMess Resources - our dedicated learning platform\nThis is a place for all our users to find tutorials, share their creations, exchange knowledge, and download apps and games other users have made.\nOur dedicated learning platform\n Learn how to code with CircuitBlocks - our unique coding platform \nCircuitBlocks is our graphical programming interface that helps newbies get into physical programming.\nWe really hate installations! That\u2019s why CircuitBlocks automatically makes sure all the necessary components and drivers are installed.\nIn CircuitBlocks, you code using puzzle-like blocks that represent logical steps your device can take.\nWhen the colorful puzzle blocks are placed, Arduino C code is automatically generated on the right side of the screen so that you can instantly see how your code would look in C!\nWe\u2019ve learned how to code and design electronic devices thanks to the internet and open-source technology.\nThus, we want to push our work back into the community. \nAll our products\u2019 software is fully open-source and available for you to download on our Github page.\nThe hardware schematics are also open-source and available online.\n So here\u2019s the plan: \nShipping costs\nPlease note that shipping is not included in the reward perks' prices.\nShipping will be charged in the pledge manager that will be sent to you after the campaign ends. \nThe amount will be determined depending on what you buy and your address.\nPlease check the table below for the shipping costs in various regions. \n\nWhat happens after I receive my Kickstarter STEM Boxes?\nAfter we fulfill our Kickstarter rewards, you will be able to continue receiving STEM Boxes by extending your subscription on our webpage?\nIf you do not wish to extend your subscription, you can do so. No commitment. \nThe story of CircuitMess\nWe are a team of young talented individuals that are designing and producing fun and educational electronic devices.\n We\u2019ve started in 2017 with our first product MAKERbuino that was successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter.  \nSince then, we\u2019ve launched our second product called Ringo (MAKERphone) and have sold over 15 000 devices to customers all over the world.  \n  We currently have 15 employees and are a small, but very ambitious, self-made business with lots of great ideas and big plans for the future. \nWe think technology is the future and everybody should understand it.\n        Help us build that future together!\nThank you!\nOur company was founded three years ago thanks to generous Kickstarter supporters just like you.\nThis wonderful experience allowed us to spread positive influence, open new jobs in our community, meet new people, and learn a lot.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Borna Bedi\u0107, Dora Ladika, Tea Bari\u0107, Tena Mar\u010dac, Matea Tepi\u0107, Doris Brala, Nikolina Dobrica, Erik Rudec, Emil Gaj\u0161ak, Robert Medvedec, Filip Budi\u0161a, Tomislav & Ana Car, Antonio Valenti\u0107, Fran Zekan, Matija Fu\u0107ek, Anton Premec, Luka Trava\u0161, Ante Medi\u0107, Dajgoro Labinac.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.\nAs seen on: ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving a hardware startup is hard work. \n\nMass production risks are real and we\u2019ve taken every precaution to prepare for them:\n\nWe\u2019ve developed 6 STEM Boxes in advance so that we are sure that we can fulfill our promises on time\n\n\nHired workers and helpers will be doing the production of STEM Boxes at our headquarters. We will directly control the manufacturing process and the quality of the finished kits\n\nWe already have certain experience with producing similar kits and a production line set up as we\u2019ve already successfully delivered a total of 15000 electronic devices to our customers all across the globe\n\n\nWe\u2019re a team of hard-working young technology enthusiasts living for what we do and believing in what we live for.\n\nWe promise we'll keep you updated about any issues that may arise.\n\nKeep making!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAll products included in CircuitMess STEM Box are made with durability, hackability, and the maker culture in mind. \nWe want to create new makers, tinkerers, future engineers and creators of any sort that are going to fix, modify, hack, and expand electronic devices instead of just throwing them away and buying a new one.\n\nWe think electronic waste is a huge problem and the main cause for this problem is the way modern consumers think and act. We're here to change that with CircuitMess STEM Box\nSomething else\nThe products that we will deliver to our customers in CircuitMess STEM Box can be interconnected and used in a different way when combined, which extends the possibilities and the lifetime of our products.\nFor example, our robotic autonomous car Wheelson can be paired with our educational game console ByteBoi so that you can use it as a remote controller for Wheelson.\nAlso, our DIY voice assistant Spencer can be connected to Clockstar in order to interface apps over the internet and trigger various IoT functions.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Give us some love\u2026 and coffee of course!", "descp": "You\u2019ll contribute to this project by giving us an extra shot of caffeine and support.\nWe love coffee, YUM.\nIn return, you get telepathic love and hugs.\nAlso, sharing our project on social media or with your friends costs nothing and helps our project A LOT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 79 or more", "title": "Single STEM Box -

It is a creative process developed during the period of limited activity and outings. The images question reality from a passive, restrained standpoint where the world is only as large as our view permits it to be.\nPhoto from the book \u201cWhile waiting for this to pass\u201d\n~ While waiting for this to pass [Dok smo \u010dekali da sve ovo pro\u0111e] is an upward view from the earth and memories, a view toward a segment of sky, calling for our exploration. The perceived flow of time can seem as a repetitive and continuous feeling of confinement and impaired movement.\n~ The things we didn\u2019t use [Stvari koje nismo koristili] is a return to the place and time we are confined to, the quarantine \u2013 a moment of reduced living conditions in which one searches for new meaning.\nThe next two volumes consist of photos taken in the period between 2016 and the beginning of 2020. They are reflective details of the Everyday, the situations and processes intrinsic to it. These photographic notes reference seemingly generic images, signposts of past emotions, with which we try to recall the world as it was (or as it is). The poetry of those times is transformed today, when we are contrived to consider that caring can mean isolation, and freedom of movement, a risk. Each part of the photobook inevitably provides us with an opportunity to take time to explore each frozen frame in its entirety and establish our own existence within the world.\nPhoto from the book \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\n~ I can\u2019t even remember who won [Vi\u0161e se ne sje\u0107am tko je pobijedio] is about a birthday celebration. It analyses the situational togetherness and camaraderie that can be interpreted as a kind of finished past tense; it\u2019s an album of habits that have since become an arena of questions on boundaries, risk, freedom.\n~ A place from previous tales [Mjesto o kojem sam ve\u0107 pri\u010dao] is a collection of photo-notes from various journeys. In these times we live in, the question arises: are these photo-notes of illusions, of some utopian time of freedom and movement, or a possible future?\nThis is my intimate journey I will continue to expand on, adding new segments to the open-ended structure of this collection. Each expansion should seamlessly connect to the rest, and strengthen the whole. \nSize comparison: An egg, \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\", A beer bottle (0,33l)\nAll four parts are made in the same format, with the same care: \nSIZE ~ 21x14.8 cm\nVOLUME ~ 36 pages\nPHOTOGRAPHS ~ From 21 to 25 in each volume\nINSIDE PAPER ~ Conqueror Connoisseur 100% cotton, Soft White, 110g\nCOVER PAPER ~ Keaykolour 100% Recycled, Particles Snow, 300g\nBINDING ~ Hand-bound with a simple white seam down the middle\nLANGUAGE ~ Croatian, with English translations on the last page of each volume.\nHand-bound with a simple seam down the middle\nDetail of the seam\nThe purpose of this campaign\nMy wish is to offer a unique experience where my journey intertwines with yours while you explore the photobook as it connects with your own story. The photograph is only part of the journey. How it is printed and bound together, is another key part. \nCurrently all volumes are printed digitally, but my plan is to have the final collection done in offset or digital offset, depending on the amount of people supporting the project. I have chosen what would most appropriately suit this intimate exposure and new relationship I form with you through this creation. My wish is to print 100 special editions of the four-part photobook.\nThe photobook collection in space\nAbout the photographer\nMy name is Karlo \u010cargonja. I was born in Rijeka in 1987 and I\u2019ve been doing photography since high school.\nIn 2013 I went to one of Sa\u0161a Kralj\u2019s photography workshops and have since educated myself in photography by way of reading and researching the industry, while attending other, relevant workshops. In 2014, Tod Papageorge, an esteemed professor at Yale University, USA, was chosen as the lead judge in the selection process for the Rovinj Photodays, which is why I\u2019ve decided to enter the contest and was later chosen as one of the finalists in the international competition. That same year I mentored, along with Sa\u0161a Kralj and Dalibor Talaji\u0107, the Multimedia workshop as part of the 6th edition of the International Photography Festival Organ Vida. I\u2019ve been a member of the Creative Cluster KOMBINAT since its inception and have launched Talks about Photography as part of one of its first big projects. They are now held monthly in the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rijeka.\nI would like to give a big thanks to my friends, without whom this campaign wouldn\u2019t be possible:\nCyrille Cartier, Goran Fer\u010dec, Tomica Grubi\u0161a, Sanda Hunjak, Sa\u0161a Kralj, Ivona Milo\u0161, Japanski Premijeri, Sara Salamon, Anja Su\u0161anj, Ivan Vranji\u0107.\nRewards:\n ~ Postcards ~ \nPostcards can function as a pair or separately\n ~ Photobooks ~ \n\"While waiting for this to pass\" photobook\nA spread from \"While waiting for this to pass\"\n\"The things we didn\u2019t use\" photobook\nA spread from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\"\n\"I can\u2019t even remember who won\" photobook\nA spread from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\n\"A place from previous tales\" photobook\nA spread from \"A place from previous tales\"\n ~ Poster set ~ \nA set of four posters\nIf you don't have room for all four, you can hang up just one\n ~ Fine Art print,13x20 cm ~ \nA photo from \"The place from previous tales\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"The place frome previous tales\"\nA photo from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\nA photo from \"While waiting for this to pass\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"While waiting for this to pass\"\nA photo from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 13X20cm)\nFramed 13x20cm print from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\"\n ~ Fine Art print, 20x30 cm ~ \nA photo from \"A place from previous tales\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"A place from previous tales\"\nA photo from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"I can\u2019t even remember who won\"\nA photo from \"While waiting for this to pass\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"While waiting for this to pass\"\nA photo from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\" (Limited Fine Art print, edition of 5 - size: 20X30cm)\nFramed 20x30cm print from \"The things we didn\u2019t use\"\n ~ Handmade wooden frames~ \nEvery frame is carefully measured...\n...painted...\n...put together...\n...and finished.\nFrame detail\nFrame detail", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is no risk in investing your resources into this project!

What if you could do everything for them, in less than 15 minutes a day?\n\nWe have recently opened discussions with a U.S. based television producer to develop a \"Superpower Your Kids\" broadcast special for PBS. It\u2019s a long way to go before it is a) green-lit, and b) runs, but it\u2019s the key first step and very exciting!\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve all got our kids at home during this crazy isolation time we\u2019re living through. As parents, we want to engage with our kids, inspire, teach and help them. But sometimes we run short on ideas, low on energy, and could use a little help.\n\n\nTeach your kids a single new thing each day through Lesson Games, taking as little as a minute and no more than 15. These mini lessons are designed like a flexible syllabus and presented with some professorial tricks to make them more fun and to better stick. This system uses a proven, scientific approach--including techniques used by Nobel Prize winners--to teach and empower young children. Take a big, complicated thing to learn and break it down into manageable, bite-sized pieces, scaled to whatever each child can handle...and enjoy. Because this is about playing first (in an educational way) and the learning is a powerful side effect!\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\nThis project is LIMITED EDITION. At the moment, there are no plans to publish this book for anyone beyond the backers on Kickstarter during this campaign. So this may be YOUR ONLY CHANCE to get Superpower Your Kids!\n\n\u201cA new approach to inspiring a love of learning in young children\u2026 Dr Charney borrows techniques used by Nobel Prize winners and his approach as a university professor and creates a system suitable for fun, engaging \u201clessonlets\u201d with kids\u201d -Christine C,, parenting and lifestyle columnist \n\u201cWhen I first discovered Prof Noah Charney's forthcoming book and app, Superpower Your Kids, I couldn't help but be excited. I mean, lockdown is definitely showing me flames and it made me realize that I do not have the capacity to sufficiently educate my kids, while doing a full day of work AND looking after our home, all at the same time. Prof Charney's book basically teaches you skills that enables you to school your kids in just 15 minutes per day. How rad?!\u201d -Luchae W., parenting blogger, My Spreadsheet Brain \n\u201cParents need and deserve this book.\u201d -Lea M., family therapist, mother of 4, author of Connect to Your Teenager \n\"What does a best-selling author do during quarantine? He writes the book he wasn\u2019t allowed to during normal time.\" -Thrive Global\nMy name is Noah Charney. I\u2019m a professor, presenter, columnist and best-selling author of more than a dozen books. Most importantly, I\u2019m a father, but in this case the professor, TV presenter and author parts come in handy.\nFor years, I\u2019ve been preparing a book based on a unique approach I have to teaching my young daughters. This time of self-isolation, when we are all at home with our kids and could use a little inspiration, led me to write it now and make it available to all, as quickly as possible.\nThe result is Superpower Your Kids: A Professor\u2019s Guide to Teaching Children Everything in Just 15 Minutes a Day.  It\u2019s a handbook for proactive parents, unlocking a new way to approach teaching at home: as a game. Each new game teaches your kids a new miniature lesson, a \"lessonlet.\" And each lesson, once learned, gives your kids a new superpower. These superpowers come through a combination of knowledge and empowerment which is the result of attention from you parents while you play games with your kids.\n\nNoah has written for, or been featured in, these fine publications.\n\nMy superpower is that I\u2019m a Dad who knows how to teach and to make the act of learning feel easy, painless, even fun. I practice with my kids every day. This book will help you do the same.\n\n\nCorona Time has pushed me to write Superpower Your Kids publish it quickly\u2014hence this being self-published, which I normally do not do, as my dozen-plus books have been published by major houses and have been international best-sellers. But traditional publishers simply could not turn around a book quickly enough for it to come out during this time of isolation, which is ideal for getting started with your kids. \nSuperpower Your Kids and make this isolation time count by starting a new, empowering learning tradition that you can carry forward throughout their childhood. Kick off a lifetime love of learning. Give your kids a gift a day\u2014knowledge that will empower them and bring you and your kids closer.\n\n\n\nSuperpower Your Kids on Instagram\nSuperpower Your Kids on Facebook\n\n\n\nSuperpower Menu: Over 365 Suggested Activities\nThe Rules of the Lesson Game\nThe Superpower Toolbox\nThe Preview \u2013 Engage \u2013 Review System\nThe Magic of 15 Minutes (or Far Less)\nThe Most Important Lesson in Your Child\u2019s Life Comes in Kindergarten: Cultures of Early Childhood Education\nSuperpowers for Parents\nTeaching Styles: American vs European and Getting the Best Out of Both\nTips for Multilingual Families or Learning New Languages\nHow to Travel with Your Children: Tips for Car Rides and Holidays\nHow to \u201cTravel\u201d with Your Children While Self-Isolating\nThe Power of Boredom: Why Letting Your Kids Get Bored Sometimes is Great for Them\nLeveling Up Your Superpowers\nMaking Memories: Integrating the Quantified Self\nTotally Legit \u201cCheats\u201d\n Bonus essays by Dr James Charney (the author\u2019s dad, a child psychiatrist) and Dr Diane Joy Charney (the author\u2019s mom, a professor at Yale University)\n Illustrations and design by Urska Charney (the author\u2019s super-wife)\nAnd much more! \n\n\n\nUrska Charney (the superwife/supermom) will design and illustrate the book, to increase its cuteness quotient.

So if you read about lesson game #247 (maybe learning to yoyo), and you try it with your kids, you can press a button on your eBook reader screen and your device will magically open the app and already know that you're doing lesson game #247 (fierce yoyo-ing), so you can just upload a photo of your kid \"walking the dog\" (level up #3) and you're good to go! At least, that's the plan.\nThe App will not contain any of the explanatory text that appears in the book, so you'll need the two together for your superpowers to fully unlock!\n\n\n\nMore About the Author\nDr Noah Charney is a professor of art history specializing in art crime and the internationally best-selling author of more than a dozen books. Born in New Haven, in the US, he has lived in Europe for the past two decades, and settled down in Slovenia, where he lives with his wife, two daughters and a hairless dog named Hubert van Eyck. Noah presents on television (with appearances on CBS, BBC and also here, Discovery, History, Nat Geo and more) and he writes regularly for numerous major publications, including The Guardian and The Washington Post.\nTo read more about him and his work, click here.\nTo read some of Noah's published articles, click here.\n\nNoah appears on TV as a host or guest expert, on these fine channels and others.\n\nSome of Noah's books, which have been published in more than a dozen languages and have been best-sellers in five countries.\n\nBut mostly he\u2019s a Dad trying to give his kids all he can, all his love and as much love for learning as possible. His kids totally have superpowers\u2026and yours do, too. He\u2019s here to help you help them to level up and expand their superpower repertoire!\n\nNoah in action at a TEDx event\n\n\nIf you want to see him speaking, here's a clip from CBS:\n\nAnd if you want to see him teaching, here's a talk he gave at the Dallas Museum of Art recently:\n\nThank you for your support and I hope that this will inspire a lifetime of learning through Lesson Games and superpowers!\n\n\nWait, are you really still reading? Awesome. So if you're interested, here is a short sample section from Superpower Your Kids, to give you a sense of the style and approach, as it includes an example of the Lesson Game in practice!\n\n...\nThese learning activities have no set rules per se, but more guidelines on how to keep the experience positive, enthusiastic, casual and un-forced. That goes both ways: don\u2019t force your kids and don\u2019t force yourself, as parents.\nI have a very mild obsessive streak in me that keeps me productive, but I can see how it could tip into compulsive behavior that would slow me down. For instance, I cannot check email without responding immediately to everything in my inbox. Not to do so, to put off responding, makes me nervous. This is why I check email only once or twice a week (I get a lot of emails commenting with enthusiastic curiosity about the line at the bottom of my email template apologizing for my slow replies because I only check email twice a week). I map out projects and work packages in my weekly planner notebook and have empty squares next to each. I cannot bring myself to turn the page to the next week unless the squares are checked off, meaning I\u2019ve done what I portioned myself to do that week (there\u2019s a chapter in this book about how these eccentricities have actually made me more productive, and you\u2019re welcome to borrow them).\nI mention these quirks because you need to know what works best for you, to make teaching your kids feel manageable and never like work. You\u2019ve already got enough work at, well, at your work. Home time should feel relaxing and fun whenever possible. So, knowing myself, I do not map out what I want to accomplish with my kids week to week, much less day to day. That would make me nervous and prompt me to push the kids to fulfill specific lessons, when in fact I want to allow them to guide what we learn about together. For this reason, I prefer to keep a long master-list\u2014the Superpower Menu\u2014in which I put all the ideas I get for mini lessons, our lessonlets, and then I usually don\u2019t even refer to it. I like to know that it\u2019s there, but I do not want to feel chained to its content, and least of all to a certain order. I only find myself referring to it when I can\u2019t think of anything off the top of my head, and I\u2019ll dip into the list for inspiration. I\u2019ll also use it to try to find cross-referencing lessons, one that would logically and inspirationally follow another, and string them together.\nFor example, I watched the classic film, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, with my girls. They loved it, especially the \u201csubstitutiary locomotion\u201d song and the great battle scene at the end when the friendly witch (played by a young Angela Lansbury) successfully animates a museum full of suits of armor which proceed to chase an invading Nazi squadron from a seaside English town. It\u2019s a magical moment (literally and figuratively) and the girls were totally into it. This led me to play the Lesson Game in a number of directions inspired by what they were interested in.\n\u00b7 We talked about how to say \u201csubstitutiary locomotion\u201d in a less fancy way (\u201creplacing movement\u201d), and why a \u201clocomotive\u201d is an older word for a train.\n\u00b7 The film features a variety of British accents including London Cockney, a polite \u201creceived pronunciation\u201d and a sort of gangster slang. We talked about various accents in English and which they find more difficult to understand and which they could imitate.\n\u00b7 We talked about the suits of armor from various time periods and then browsed through a book we have of arms and armor. We looked at horse armor, described what it felt like to wear armor, how it was put on.\n\u00b7 The \u201csubstitutiary locomotion\u201d spell can make inanimate objects move around on their own, as the good witch explains in the film. We talked about the difference between animate and inanimate objects. I listed things and asked my girls to tell me if they were animate or inanimate: a fish, a shoe, our dog, a hot dog, a suit of armor, a knight in armor, a photograph of a knight in armor. I was trying to be tricky, because once I saw that they grasped that animate objects were living and capable of movement, I pulled a fast one asking about a photograph of something that is animate (the photograph being inanimate). I also played with words to be tricky and playful (our dog is animate, a hot dog is inanimate).\n\u00b7 The film has some silly Nazi bad guys (not the scary kind) but we talked a bit about who they were, why they spoke German, and that there had been a war a long time ago\u2014Second World War history lite, to gently inform but not over-complicate or upset a 5-year-old.\n\u00b7 There\u2019s a great scene on Portobello Road in London, where the characters search for the second half of a torn book of magic. I lived in London and had been there many times, so I told them about the antiques market there, we watched a walk-through video of the market and I asked what they would be interested in looking for, if they were there.\n\u00b7 The film has a scene in which the children list their favorite foods, and the list sounds intriguing but confusing to non-British kids: bubble and squeak, sausage and mash, toad in the hole. So we looked up what these dishes were and cooked some for ourselves.\nThose are seven mini lessons (which we\u2019ll call \u201clessonlets\u201d because the word \u201clesson\u201d unfortunately has the connotation of work) that emerged from the fun of watching one film. Suddenly you\u2019ve got your whole week\u2019s-worth of Lesson Games laid out for you in one go. On the first night, you watch the movie together and talk about it afterward, reviewing what you saw and what stood out. Then each of the following six days, you pick one of the lessonlets above to play with together. There could be infinitely more of them, but this is to give an example of how a web of ideas can emerge from each activity.\nEach of these lessonlets gives your kids a new power. Some of these powers are as simple as learning a new word. But don\u2019t for a moment think that learning a new word is anything short of a powerful tool. Think how impressed your 7-year-old\u2019s teacher would be if she throws in the words \u201csubstitutiary\u201d and \u201clocomotion\u201d in conversation. Each new word opens up a window in your child\u2019s imagination palace, letting in light and allowing them to see out in a way they never could before they learned that word. The world around them becomes fractionally clearer. The next time they encounter the word they will not glaze over and ignore it but understand it. The various accents that they hear in different films will not just be funny ways people talk but will carry meaning and help identify where the speaker comes from.\nWhat\u2019s your newest superpower, you might ask your kids after each lessonlet: \u201cI cut vegetables with a knife. I can build a snow man. I can count to ten in Chinese. I can whistle. I can play foosball. I know what \u201clocomotion\u201d means. I know the capital of America. I know the world\u2019s fastest fish. I know why the sky is blue. I can bake cookies. I know the traditional iconographic schema employed by Flemmish \"primitives\" in 15th century proto-Realist paintings like Jan van Eyck's triptych, Adoration of the Mystic Lamb. You name it, anything is possible!\n\n\nOkay, that's really it for now. Thank you for your interest and support. May your kids have the superest of superpowers and may you all be healthy and happy...\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks whatsoever with this project. The book is 75% written, and so just needs finishing touches, an edit and design and layout. We\u2019re doing it all in-house (the author\u2019s wife is doing design, layout and illustrations, the author\u2019s mom is the editor) and the plan is to publish via Amazon KDP, which means that the printing and posting will be automated and should work smoothly and efficiently, even in Corona Time (which is why we\u2019re avoiding traditional printers, as most are closed). I suppose the only real risk is in a delay in getting the book to you because of Corona Time slowdowns. But there\u2019s a reason we have this very low Kickstarter target. We don\u2019t need an injection of capital to launch a new product. This is just a way for you to get a super-discounted price on pre-orders of this book. We\u2019re hoping the whole book will be finished by the end of the campaign and so we can upload it and have it sent out to you very soon after the campaign has ended.

Simple rules of movement and firing include all the most important features of the aircraft of the time: speed, agility and firepower. Battles are lead at five different altitudes, so there are differences between the planes in terms of climbing and descending speeds. Some specific characteristics were also taken into account, such as gyroscopic effect, which gives some aircraft exceptional maneuverability. Wind influences movement and the position of the sun affects firing accuracy, so these factors are also taken into account. A plane under attack can escape into the clouds and thus hide from the enemy. Most of the pilots are average, but there are also rookies and aces.\nThe game contains as many as 54 plane pieces belonging to three countries: France, Germany, and Great Britain. Each country has 6 types of aircraft (3 pieces each) from different war periods.\nIn the initial period of WW1, most planes were single-engine two-seaters whose primary purpose was to observe and photograph enemy positions and background, but they also dropped bombs and fired at enemy aircraft when meeting in the air. As early as 1915, specific aircraft with special tasks appeared: fighting, reconnaissance, and bombing. Accordingly, there are three basic types of warplanes in this game, and their characteristics can be described as follows:\nFIGHTERS are small, fast, and agile single-seaters. They can accelerate rapidly and they are armed with fixed machine guns that shoot straight forward in the axis of the aircraft. There are exceptions, however - two-seaters with additional dorsal machine guns (Bristol F.2 Fighter and Hanriot HD.3).\nSCOUTS are single-engine two-seaters, their primary task is to photograph enemy positions, which is why they have cameras. They also have fixed and dorsal machine guns, so they can fight as well, but they can't accelerate abruptly. They can also carry one bomb.\nBOMBERS have two engines and carry two or three bomb markers. They also have flexible nose and dorsal machine guns, which can only be used defensively.\nThe expansion includes aircraft from other countries participating in the war, a total of 27 types (54 pieces).\nWORTH OF CERTAIN AIRCRAFT TYPES\nOn all control panels, in the upper right corner, there is a number that indicates the worth of that type of aircraft. In the basic game, all fighters have similar values (from 6,5 to 7,5), with the exception of two extremes, Airco DH-2 (6) and Fokker D.VII (8). In the expansion, there are some older types from 1914-5 which are worth much less.\nTo calculate the value, we made a formula that takes into account all the characteristics of the aircraft (in this game). Speed is an important factor, but agility is twice as important. Other characteristics of the aircraft (armament, gyroscopic effect, climbing speed, ...) were taken into account in an appropriate way. The results are quite realistic: the highest value is Fokker D.VII (8), followed by SPAD S.XIII, Sopwith Camel and Fokker Dr.I (7.5), while the worst are the slow Russian Mosca-Bystritsky Mbbis and sluggish Turkish Fokker D.I (4,5). For scouts and bombers, there is a worth for the empty aircraft and for the total value when carrying bombs (numbers in brackets).\nThese values do not affect the basic game, and they are used if you have the expansion. In some scenarios, you can choose a smaller number of planes with a high value or a larger number of those that have bad features (lower value). We believe that gamers will be interested in playing a game in which, for example, 8 Russian fighters try to protect the bombers from the attacks of 6 Austro-Hungarian fighters.\nAn Excel spreadsheet which contains the mathematical formulas we used can be downloaded from the webpage with the rulebook.\nTo make the basic game even more interesting, we have put together a rich list of goals and hopefully, all of them (or at least the majority) will be reached.\n #1 - $ 5 000 - Wooden sliders \u2713\nCardboard markers will be replaced with wooden cubes (60x red and 30x green)\n #2 - $ 8 000 - new aircraft: Br\u00e9guet 14 \u2713\n #3 - $ 12 000 - new aircraft: Sablatnig N.I \u2713\n #4 - $ 16 000 - new aircraft: Airco DH.9A \u2713\n #5 - $ 20 000 - 6th altitude level \u2713\n 5 additional altitude stands\n #6 - $ 25 000 - new aircraft: Voisin V \u2713\n#7 - $ 30 000 - new aircraft: AGO C.I \u2713\n#8 - $ 35 000 - new aircraft: Airco DH.1 \u2713\n#9 - $ 40 000 -  Double-sided board \u2713\n+ 6 ship-shaped Task Zones (transparent plastic foil)\n#10 - $ 45 000 - new aircraft: Hanriot HD.2 \u2713\n#11 - $ 50 000 - new aircraft: Rumpler 6B \u2713\n#12 - $ 55 000 - new aircraft: Sopwith Baby \u2713\nlink to PDF\nThe rules in this game are very clear, simple, and logical. Our basic principle - 'MCMD' (Minimum Complexity, Maximum Diversity) is fully complied with, for which we have received confirmation from several relevant people:\n\"... it says 'minimum complexity, maximum diversity', and he's right on 100%.\" - Dan Pancaldi\nOur original Triangle system for positioning and movement of the pieces is applied. Each rule is well and clearly explained and supported by an illustrated example.\n\"The Triangle Movement System gives a very organic feel of to the aircraft maneuvers.\" - Richard Martin\nTowards the end of the rulebook, the basic game modes and several scenarios are explained. There are short paragraphs that connect certain rules with historical and technical facts, which helps the player immerse into the role of a pilot of a combat aircraft from WW1.\nOn the last page, the entire manual is presented in an abbreviated fashion, which only confirms how simple the rules are, and at the same time, how they provide huge opportunities for the battle to develop in a dynamic, interesting and realistic way. Experienced gamers will probably be able to play the first game only on the basis of that shortened version, but we recommend that you read the manual fully.\n\"Now I was already familiar with their air gaming system so it made the transition to play easier. But if I didn\u2019t know the system already, I would have found the rules easy to understand and well laid out.\" - Robert Smith\nRulebook in other languages\nWe will do our best to provide rulebook translations to several languages in cooperation with backers. You can read more about it in update #9. For now, a translation into French, Spanish and Portuguese has been done and Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Polish and German has been agreed.\nThe whole series of Age of Dogfights games is intended as a simulation of pure aerial battles with fighters in the main role. For diversity, the kit features also the scouts and the bombers, whose primary battle goals are reconnaisance and bombing, while fighting with enemy aircraft is secondary.\nDOGFIGHT\nThis mode features only fighter planes, and also scouts in the role of fighters. The goal of the game is simple - shoot down as many planes as possible. This mode includes a scenario \"Intercept the General\".\nRECONNAISSANCE\nScouts have the lead role in this mode. The task is to reach the reconnaissance zone (Task Zone A, B, or C), to take photographs, and then return and leave the Combat Zone (in order to get the photo negatives to the airport). This mode includes a scenario \"Flying High\" scenario.\nBOMBARDING\nThis mode has two variants: zone bombing and bomber breakthrough.\nThe zone bombing variant is very similar to the reconnaissance mode.\nIn the bomber breakthrough variant, they have task to go through the entire Combat Zone and exit the opposite side of the board (in order to carry out strategic bombing). Scenario: \"Attack at Dawn\".\nCOMBINED MODE\nPlayers may arrange for the game to be played in combined bombarding-reconnaissance mode. First, the bombers should bomb the target zones. Afterwards, the scouts will photograph the results of the bombing.\nIn our games so far, we have never explicitly featured a solo mode, although some of them had all the prerequisites for that. We have to be honest and say that we have never played any other board game, nor have we read any of the rules in full (that is the reason for the originality of our games). Therefore, we are not sure how the rules for such a variant of the game should be written.\nHowever, our friend and collaborator Richard Martin will make sure that this game gets the rules for solo mode too. He has already suggested a version of the rules for solo mode, which will soon be tested (you can find the latest version HERE). Rules for solo play will be included in the game set.\nJudging by some relevant comments, this game can be very interesting even for only one player according to the already existing rules. Airplanes have different characteristics and you can always start a battle, say 3 against 3, to determine which type of airplane is better. Various scenarios are also possible, and they can be very interesting even if one player plays on both sides.\nDuring the First World War, airships and tied observation balloons played an important role in air combat. Barrage balloons were also widely used. From the ground, machine guns and cannons fired at the targets in the air ...\nAll these elements are part of the Expansion, as well as 27 new types of aircraft from 6 countries. The brochure describes additional rules for the new pieces. Is it feasible to attack with fast Italian planes on targets in the Austro-Hungarian background that is sheltered by barrage balloons and defended with strong anti-aircraft fire? Do the large and slow Russian bombers have a chance against German fighters? The mixed French-Serbian squadron returns from a task with low ammunition and encounters a strong Bulgarian patrol ... There are a total of 10 scenarios in the brochure and we believe that you will be able to immerse into the role of a squadron leader on an important task ...\nAs in our previous campaigns we have a First day gift. It is a set of 12 pieces (6 x 2) of Turkish planes with corresponding control panels in a separate box. Everyone who pays for one of the options (except $1 and $10) in the first 36 hours of the campaign will receive this gift ( \"Forsage\" first day lasts 36 hours! :) )\nYou have enough time to decide and pay for this game, which will give you a valuable reward.\nAfter that, this set of pieces will be able to be ordered through the pledge manager BackerKit for the price of $ 10.\nAdd-ons can be selected in a subsequent preorder campaign on BackerKit (pledge manager).\nAdditional board ($8)\nEstimated weight: ~0,65kg\nAn additional set of 3 board bi-fold segments with 4 board extensions and 6 task zones.\nThe board is designed in such way that it can be continued to any of the four sides, just by placing another board next to it. That way, a very large battlespace is formed (126x70cm or 140x63cm).\n\"Additional Aircraft Types\" ($30)\nEstimated weight: ~0,5kg\n40 new aircraft types (80 pieces and 40 control panels)\nWhen choosing the aircraft that will represent the countries participating in the First World War, we tried to choose the most important types from different periods of the war. The main game includes planes from Germany, France and Great Britain.\nThe main Expansion includes planes from Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, USA, Bulgaria (German planes), and Serbia (French planes). These countries had a much smaller number of aircraft types in use, so we chose only 5, 4, or 2 aircraft types for some of them.\nIn total, this basic game (18 types) + first day gift (6 types) with Expansion (27) and possible stretch goals (1 to 15) will possibly have as many as 66 different types of planes! That is more than enough to enjoy the game, but there are many more planes, especially from Germany, France and Great Britain that had a significant role in the war. It might be interesting for some gamers to try some of them in air battles, so we decided to optionally offer another game add-on that would contain various airplanes. You can read more about it in the Update #7 and Update #13.\nOur preliminary proposal was to feature 30 types of aircraft (fifteen each for Central Power and the Entente, with two pieces and a control panel for each type), but it will be increased to 40 types. There may be fighters, scouts, bombers, various prototypes and experimental aircraft among them. The planes with the most backers' votes will be represented.\n\"Important Aircraft Supplement\" ($24)\nEstimated weight: ~0,45kg\nBased on some suggestions, we are introducing another add-on where only the most important types of aircraft would be repeated, but in a larger number of 3 pieces per type. In that way, some larger air battles could be simulated, where the most common aircraft participated. The final list of types of aircraft that should be represented will be specified in a special update.\nA current proposal for the content is that the three countries (Germany, Great Britain and France) have 6 types of airplanes with 3 pieces each (54 aircraft pieces, 18 control panels and 30 altitude stands).\nThe planes would be: Fokker E.III, Albatros D.III, Albatros D.V, Fokker Dr.I, Fokker D.VII and Albatros C.III   //   Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Pup, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5, Bristol Fighter F.2, Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2, Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8   //   SPAD S.VII, SPAD S.XI, Nieuport 17, Nieuport 24, Morane-Saulnier AI and Nieuport 12. So, in total, this add-on will have 54 airplane pieces. There will also be altitude stands in the set, 5 of each height (30 in total).\nOttoman Empire aircraft ($10)\nEstimated weight: ~0,3kg\nA set of 12 pieces (6 x 2) of Turkish planes with corresponding control panels.\n\nThe first concept for a board game by the author Predrag Lazovi\u0107 was about air combat. It was Saratoga (designed 1993, released \u201896). This is where our original Triangle system for positioning and moving pieces came to life. In later years, a dozen games were created, mostly featuring modern jets.\nIn the desire to make a game with the emphasis on air battles, \"Dogfight\" was created. This game simulates aerial warfare during WW2. Age of Dogfights WW1 is the direct successor of these games.\nWe decided to make a whole series of Age of Dogfights games that will cover the period from the very beginning of air battles until today.\nLogically, the first in the series is a game that features WW1. In addition to the expansion offered during this campaign, we plan to make an expansion with aircraft from the 1920s soon. The rules would be the same, and the planes themselves very similar (though much faster) to the planes from WW1.\nThe next game will be Age of Dogfights: WW2. The rules will be similar but more advanced and adapted to newer planes. For example, 3 dice will be used for shooting and damage resistance of the planes will also be a factor (it is not the same whether you shoot at fragile \"Zero\", \"Betty\", etc. or at Spitfires, Messerschmitts, etc. or at robust Il-2, P-47, B-17 ...).\nThe third in a row will be the game Age of Dogfights: Transonic Era. For me as a big fan of aviation, this is the most interesting period. This game will include all transonic aircraft and the first few supersonic ones: F-11, F-100, F-102, Super Myst\u00e8re, and MiG-19. The rules will differ from the previous ones to reflect the progress: higher speeds, engine afterburner, air-to-air missiles and Mighty Mouse rockets, ...\nThe final game, Age of Dogfights: Supersonic Era will feature all supersonic aircraft from F-101 and Mirage III to F-18 and MiG-31 ... There will be a major expansion in which all Stealth aircraft will be represented, both existing and those in development.\nAll in all, we, as authors, have set ourselves the difficult task of preparing all these games with expansions and various additions in the future. This work will be a pleasure for us because we believe that the originality of our concept will attract a large number of gamers who will enjoy this and the subsequent games.\nAfter 4 successful projects on Kickstarter, we can say without restraint that we have never played any other board game except our own! That is the reason why our games are original and fresh in the world market. Airplanes and history have been our preoccupation since childhood, we have a large number of professional books and magazines, we study very seriously the period to which our wargames refer. We are extremely pleased that our passion and hobby has turned into a serious business. The Japanese print magazine Banzai dedicated the cover and seven more pages to us as authors and to our games. In that interview, we explained our motives and inspiration for creating games, and you can read it HERE.\nShipping fees from Serbia to other countries are quite high, so we will subsidize the costs by about 30%. We have favorable agreements with DHL and UPS and we plan to ship most of the packages through them, which means they will reach the recipient within a couple of days. We have provided \"friendly\" shipment status for EU member states, the USA and Japan. If the number of backers in the UK, Canada, Australia, and China is large enough, we will provide the same status for those countries as well.\nThe shipping price of each pledge depends on the country to which it is shipped and the weight of the package. The shipping fee will not be charged during Kickstarter, but only in pledge manager (BackerKit). That way, the shipping fee will be calculated after you complete your order (you may add various items then) according to the total weight of the order. The table shows the shipping fees:\nFor example, a single copy of the game Age of Dogfights: WW1 weighs approximately 1.6 kg, and the Expansion weighs about 0,5 kg. So, AoD + Expansion falls into the ''up to 2,5 kg'' category.\nAdd-ons section show the rough weights so you can estimate what the shipping costs will be if you purchase add-ons in the pledge manager.\nThis project is very important to us for the further progress of our small company. During the campaign, we will regularly publish updates related to stretch goals, possible add-ons, and other important topics. We are open to various suggestions and accept the possibility that we have missed some characteristics of certain types of aircraft and we will gladly adopt remarks that have a foundation.\n\n                   We will try to answer all questions, either as a reply to the comment or in the FAQ section or within some updates.\n\n                   We hope to have backers from all parts of the world, so we expect comments at different times of the day (during all 24 hours). We will post answers to questions and comments as soon as possible, but keep in mind that sometimes there will be a delay of several hours.\nWe believe that communication with backers will make this project better and more complete to the satisfaction of both us authors and the public.\n-", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fifth project already. We have gained a huge amount of experience during the previous projects and we have also expanded significantly our own production facilities.\n\nAs always, we put a low target for our campaign, because in our workshop we can produce small and medium series of any game. In case several thousand games need to be produced, we will hire associates who helped us produce over 3500 Tank Chess copies along with expansions.\n\nThis game is very easy to produce. It contains many elements, but for almost all of the cardboard ones, we already have tools for cutting. Plastic parts (stands) are very easy to manufacture. For a series of a few hundred games, the 3D printers we already have are enough, and for larger series, a plastic injection tool will be made. That tool is extremely simple, because one side is completely flat, and the other has only two protrusions.\n\nWe have set the deadline for the delivery of games in January 2021. As far as production is concerned, we are sure that it will be fulfilled, and we even believe it will be much earlier.\n\nThe shipping of various goods has become quite complicated in recent months due to the Covid pandemic. We are following the situation and adapting to the current circumstances. We have contracts with DHL and UPS and we believe that there will be no problems during the shipping phase of this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe game will be produced of high quality materials.

Our associates: Lucky Graf (printing house) and Alfaplast (print finishing) are small companies with which we have been cooperating for years. They suddenly got one big well-paid job that needs to be done urgently. They asked us if they should accept it because we had already ordered and paid for sheets to be made for the \"1920s\" aircraft expansion. Due to the long-term cooperation during which they also made concessions to us many times, we agreed that they should finish the job first and then continue to work on our sheets. In these times of crisis, we have to show solidarity, and I hope that the backers will not resent us for the fact that deliveries will be delayed a bit. We should get those sheets in the next few days, and then in our workshop, we\u2019ll manage the assembly and shipping in parallel."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Shipping \u2013 import taxes", "update_content": "We have to give a comprehensive answer to the questions related to taxes and \"EU friendly\" status, so we are posting an update about it.\n\nPrior to our first Kickstarter project (2016), we requested information from customs related to taxes (in the EU and other countries). The answer was that Serbia, as a candidate for EU membership, has signed an agreement with the EU according to which no fees are charged if the goods are produced in Serbia. That is why we had wrote that the project has EU friendly status. At that time, we had only about 40 backers from the EU, but still we sent all the games in one shipment to a company in Germany, which then sent packages to individual backers. However, the German customs have charged the import tax then! To our question why, we received the answer that this agreement between Serbia and the EU is non-binding, and that some countries respect it while some not always.\n\nFor our next project (Tank Chess), we sent the packages directly from Serbia to the backers. We used regular Mail (for small packages up to 0.5 kg), DHL and Post Export service. Post Export uses an agreement between the State Posts of different countries, and we are told that for shipments sent that way no taxes are charged. At that time, we had over 1000 backers from the EU. We have information that only a small percentage of them paid a fee \u2013 if the package went by regular mail or via DHL.\n\nIn the announcement of this project, we wrote that the status of EU friendly has been secured. We had two options: to send packages through a fulfillment company from Slovenia, that respects the agreement between the EU and Serbia. The second option was, if there weren't enough backers from the EU to make fulfillment service profitable, to send packages via Post Export. There were enough backers, but we found out that the agreement between Serbia and the EU has not been applied since January (and some countries even earlier), and that taxes are always charged when goods are sent from one company to another! When a package is sent to an individual, each customs office decides for each package individually whether to collect customs tax or not. That is why we send all shipments to the EU via Post Export directly to backers. We still don't have complete information on the number of cases in which customs duties have been collected.\n\nThe corona epidemic is the reason why now almost all countries charge regular and some even additional taxes, because a way is being sought to fill the budgets. Our friends from Serbia, who had their successful campaigns recently, decided to produce the games in China. They knew immediately that the taxes would have to be paid when the goods entered the EU, so they collected all the taxes in advance. We did not charge anything in advance, because we believed that no one would pay the fees, because we produce games in our workshop (in Serbia). We even took it upon ourselves to subsidize shipping fees by about 30%. We did not count on the fact that the shipping prices will be increased by 5.5\u20138.7 USD from January 1. In addition, the packages are much heavier than the original estimate, which is why we pay a much higher price than expected. Fortunately, at least we did not have any large unplanned costs in production.\n\nThis situation is new for both us creators and the backers. We are sorry that fees are charged, but, according to the data we have collected so far, this rarely happens. For the next project, we will have to seriously consider how to solve this problem in advance. We will also try to find a way to somehow compensate the fees that our backers had to pay."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Shipping status and support to our friends", "update_content": "We inform the backers that we have continued to send packages. From this week, we believe that we will send 150 packages per week.\n\nWe have announced in advance that we charge shipping fees slightly less (by 4\u201310 USD) than the actual. However, as of January 1, both Post Express and DHL have increased their prices. Depending on the weight of the package and the destination, the price increase ranges from 5.5 to 8.7 USD.\n\nOur estimation for the weight of the basic game (with transport package) was around 1.7kg, but the actual weight is 1.97kg. The increased weight is from many achieved stretch goals and better (and heavier) materials compared to the prototype. Because of this, some packages have moved to a more expensive shipping category. Due to all of the above, our shipping costs have increased a lot, but that is part of the risk that each of the creators accepts when starting their project.\n\nOn the accompanying documents with each package, we write much lower prices for both games and shipping fee. The reason is a daily limit in values that we can send packages. With a lower value for each package, we can send more in one day."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Production status and shipping", "update_content": "There was a short interruption in shipping.

We noticed some mistakes in prepress back in November and they were corrected immediately.

Our co-worker who printed the sheets did not notice it in time, so the sheet was printed with an error. A similar error occurred on one sheet on which the main expansion control panels were printed. Here, the inscriptions on the control panels for observation balloons have also been converted into a different font.

However, we wanted to follow the order by starting the Age of Dogfights series from the beginning.\n\nSince it is certain that we will send all AoD1 games during January and February 2021, we want to announce a campaign for Age of Dogfights: WWII (AoD2) in this update and invite backers to follow our further activities on that project.\n\nThe rules of the game AoD2 will be very similar to the rules for AoD1, with changes related to the newer aircraft (higher speed, better weapons, etc.). Because of this, the new game rules will be somewhat more complex, but on the other hand some elements will be simpler. For example, WWII aircraft did not use rotary engines (gyroscopic effect), and dorsal machine guns weren't used offensively (there will be fewer positions for offensive firing).\n\nThe rules of movement are basically the same, with some key improvements. The number of steps that an aircraft moves is still determined by the sum of its basic and the rolled number on a die. A novelty is introduction of four different blue dice with different range of numbers. Those are , , and die. The green die remains - (limited usage). This gives much more flexibility for aircraft movement."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "First packages", "update_content": "We are informing you that we sent the first small number of packages on Tuesday, December 29.

This innovative fermenter is set out to provide you with the tools for traditional fermentation that you can easily master.   \nGlass weight with a pressing spring holds down the veggies to make sure all the air bubbles caught in the jar can flow up. \nYou can pump out the excess air in the jar. Oxygen-free environment helps the good bacteria to thrive.\nMark the date of starting fermentation with built-in fermentation clock and let live organisms do their magic.  \nVeggie Fermenter keeps your ferment safe with the one way valve technology. This enables air to come out but not into your ferment.  \nIt forces the gas out once the pressure builds up. No risk of bottle explosion, no burping the jars needed! \nIt catches bad smells that form during the fermentation and efficiently neutralises them with active carbon felt filter positioned on the top lid. \nWith stackable top lids you can save space in your pantry by stacking the jars one on top of the other. Who doesn\u2019t need more space?   \nSUSTAINABLE\nPreserve the vegetables when they are in season and you can\u2019t keep up with them. With fermentation you can store them in the fridge for months. Making small batches of ferment is convenient because you can actually put vegetables and fruits directly from the garden to the fermenting jar. This is an important step to self-sufficiency. You can actually make sure you are never without important nutrients, even when food is not in season or you don\u2019t have access to the stores, etc.\nVEGGIE FERMENTER SIZES \nINCLUDES \nCOLORS \nREWARDS\nYou will choose the colors of the lids in a post-campaign survey! \nSTRETCH GOAL: $55.000\nTongs & pounder hybrid\nKitchen tool for adding the vegetables and pressing them down in the jar. When we reach the $55k goal, every Kefirko Veggie Fermenter will include this item.\n\nTIMEPLAN\nWHY WE NEED YOU\nDo you want to eat healthy food rich in good bacteria? Even more, do you want to eat food that is grown locally or in your own garden? And do you want to eat them all year long? With Kefirko Veggie Fermenter you are a step closer to being self-sufficient and to eating nutritious fermented foods that are prepared in your own home. To make this happen, you can play an integral role in the development. With your support we will be able to produce the molds that are needed to manufacture the final product.

We are confident that it will please active people all over the world.\n\nSHOPPING BAG\n\nEach shopping bag is made from a sustainable material that is produced of 4 recycled plastic bottles. We completed a small trial order with our sourced fabrics in China and Sweden, where we tested all processes to get ready for mass production.\n\nRUNMASK\n\nTransparency is one of your core values, and we want to be clear about the benefits and shortcomings of our RunMask.\n \nIt\u2019s important to clarify that no mask provides 100% protection against COVID-19. Also, the effectiveness of this particular mask has yet to be tested.\n \nStill, we did base on scientific research for the choice of the materials. As demonstrated by researchers from the Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago (USA), the combination of cotton with other fabrics, including synthetics, can effectively (70-80%) filter aerosol particles that could transmit the COVID-19. The RunMask is made from multi-layered cotton and polyester which ensures proper protection via electrostatic-based filtration. \n\nFurthermore, the RunMask can be used as a cover placed over a medical-grade as it has a compartment that fits a KN95 filter inside. This enhances protection and prolongs the filter\u2019s usable life if used correctly (right fit to the face).\n \nLast but not least, the design of the RunMask is ergonomic, size-adjustable, and weather-resistant, which makes it perfect for outdoor activities.\n\n2) Delivery\n\nGetting products delivered on time is a priority for us. We have years of experience in manufacturing, quality control, and logistics, and have successfully produced and delivered similar products in the past. Also, this is our fifth Kickstarter campaign, and are we confident that our backers will love it as much as our previous products.\n\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that there will be no delays in delivery due to the COVID-19 situation.

Our focus is to prevent spreading bacterias all over the places and that is the reason, that we've inventend Safepoint.\nTHE BACK STORY\nIn the past few months the world has shifted in a ways no one could have predicted. Covid-19 came by suprise and turned our lives upside down and in response to that we have become even more germ conscience then ever. In this hard times our top priority is to keep ourselves, our families, friends and all of the society healthy  and safe by staying home and abiding the instructions we have been given. But sometimes we just have to go out, if nothineg else we have to buy groceries and that is the time when we are highly exposed to germs and viruses.\nDo not let history repeat itself and do something to make a world a better place by being responsible. Take care. Use Safepoint.\nOur campaign starts in April. Hopefully it will finish successfully funded in May. In that case we will start the production in June. As our suppliers are on standby we hope to start the first shipments beginning of July.\nWe can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make a world a safer place.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are more than capable of delivering \"Safepoint\" to the market.\nWe proved our competence with our Kickstarter projects \"MyPocketMaster\" reaching over 5,000$ in backing, \"JO- Titanium bottle opener\" reaching over 3800$ and \"Key master multi-tool\" reaching over 3700$ (feel free to check it out).\n\nAlthough we don't foresee any major problems, we understand that there is always a chance of small delays. We have lowered the risk of failure by making \"Safepoint\" production process as simple as possible. Our business partners are fully informed about the launch of \"Safepoint\" and are waiting for the first production orders.

The movie is about a fictional story of a pandemic, and the whole world is desperately searching for a cure against an aggressive virus. After that movie, I said: \u201cI hope that never happens in real life!\u201d Unfortunately, it did happen somehow.\nThat is why we decided to design a product that will help you to stay safe. Around us, there are many viruses and will always be. Our multifunctional carabiner will enable you to do everyday tasks in a safe and easy way.\nThe Stay Safe carabiner can be used as a door opener, stylus, key carabiner, quick fixer and a box opener.  Carabiner give us quick access to all the functions. It can be clipped on your pants or purse. Because of the germs transmission, we do not recommend carrying it in your pocket. \nPatent pending design\n\nFUNCTIONS\n1. CARABINER\nThe carabiner give us quick access to all the functions and to not carrying it in the pocket. Clip it on your pants, bags or purse. In these days nobody wants to touch the door handle with a hook or a hand and then put it in the pocket. And we recommend, that when you wash your hands, wash also the carabiner.\n2. DOOR HOOK\nThe door hook gap is 2inch (5cm), which will definitely work perfectly with all the standard door handles. \n3. STYLUS\nOn the carabiner there are 2 points that can be used as a stylus. Every key pad, elevator button, touch screen situation will show you which one to use. \n4. BOX OPENER\nIn these days, we are all trying to avoid going to the shops, so online shopping is working on full capacities. Because we know, we got many packages these days, we added the function of a box opener, which is very needed in these days. \n5. HEX DRIVER\nIf you will need any quick fix, hex driver is added on a carabiner. \nTHE BACK STORY\nIn our daily lives, we are constantly touching different public objects and surfaces, like door handles, elevator switches, keyboards, toilets, faucets, kettles, doors, soap dispensers, etc...\nWe know that all the cleaning stuff is working hard on cleaning all the public surfaces, however that is a never ending story. All of us have to consider, what we can do for our own protection.  \nThe whole world has fallen into a situation, where we are all more conscious about germs and public surfaces.  Did you ever find yourself in front of the door and trying to find a way to open without touching it? Well... we have and that is why we decided to make a tool for solving some of those problems. \n How it is made? \nStay Safe carabiner is made out of 99% COPPER, which is fully recyclable. COPPER is a natural antimicrobial material, therefore is a perfect material for our product. The carabiner spring is made out of stainless steel. \nThe carabiner is cut with a Water-jet machine. After we cut the basic shapes, we continue with manual work like sanding, sharping the edge for a box opener, assembling, packaging. \nAs one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.\n We are TRUSTED PRODUCERS\nWe have already sucessfully finished some of our Kickstarter projects in the past. You can check it here: Carabinsi, Hudwood, Xavier Wallet. Our website: www.hudwood.com \n and below are some of the comments:\nWe have been using our Carabinsi (Jimi and Billy tools) for a few weeks  now, we love them!  Mine goes with me to work every day and the box  opener part of the Billy is used all the time.  Excellent quality  product. :)\nI got it and it's really funtional.\nI just received mine today, it looks pretty awesome and gave it to my  brother-in-law and he likes it. Also, thank you for the free gift.\nThanks for your great solution. I am very happy with my wallet and the  quality is really great. I use it every day and get positiv feedback  from my environment all the time. It really is an eye-catcher. I  couldn't recommend it more.\nVery classy carabiner, excellent workmanship. Now I have a carabiner  that goes with suits that my high tech looking ones clash with.\nI received my Wallet and carabiner in Colorado, USA today and I love the craftsmanship.  they are both supurb!

Smoothies are great, but can be inconvenient, and wasteful. Orchard Smoothies changes all that.  \n How does Orchard Smoothies work? \nEasy peasy blend n' slurpy.\nStep 1: Order online. Subscriptions or one-offs. Free delivery in our service areas. \nStep 2: Kits delivered to your door in glass jars, packed in insulated, reusable bags. \nStep 3: Didn't we tell you already - just blend n' slurp!! \nStep 4: Put containers back out on the next delivery day. \nStep 5: Keep blendin', keep slurpin'.  \nOur recipes include nutritious, locally grown fresh fruits and veggies as well as boosts to keep you focused, energized and healthy. Delivered in zero-waste, reusable jars.\nWhy Orchard Smoothies are better?\nThis is not your who-cares-about-the-planet way to slurp. We are the greener and better alternative to services like Daily Harvest, smoothie bars or even making your own smoothies.  \nMainstream smoothie companies and even your everyday grocery store produce is sourced from around the world. The fruits and vegetables can sit in cold storage for up to 11 months - ending up losing nutritional value and taste. Ingredients in our kits are sourced from Texas (with some exceptions) and are never frozen so you are guaranteed freshness and high nutritional value.  \nWhat We Need\nWe need your help so we can optimize our service and spread our message of mindful consumption and modern sustainability.\nYour contribution would help us with working capital, building our team and expanding our delivery range. \nFlavors\nOur smoothies are created collaboratively by chefs, nutritionists, local produce experts and slurpers like you! What makes our smoothies even more special are the boosts made up of medicinal herbs from around the world, and vegan protein powders - designed to enhance flavor and nutritional value. \nOur single serve kits are $7.99 per 16oz smoothie. Daily Harvest single serve kits are $7.99 per 8oz smoothie. Their smoothies are DOUBLE the price. What you are paying for are the ice-packs, the wasteful packaging and the long distance travel. Save the money and buy yourself a trip to a cool place :) \nHere are two of our featured smoothie kit recipes:\nPurely Energizing: A burst of Texas grown apples are combined with other fresh ingredients to give you an energetic, nutrient filled start to the day. The aswagandha herb is known for fortifying adrenal functions and helping modulate stress levels.\nIngredients: Apples*, organic lemon juice*, organic celery, organic kale*, organic cucumber*, aswagandha herb and hemp protein.\n         *grown within the state of Texas\n\nRecommended liquid bases: Water, coconut water, milk, any nut milk\n\nBenefits: Energy, Burning Fat, Reducing Stress, Fortifying Adrenal Functions\nPurple Mint: When antioxidant laden blueberries mingle with power packed cashews, mint and arjuna herb, the result is a smoothie that is sure to satisfy while helping your heart\u2019s oxygenation and modulate your cholesterol levels. *Contains: Nuts\n\nIngredients: Blueberries*, organic oranges*, mint*, organic cashews, organic dates, arjuna herb\n         *grown within the state of Texas\n\nRecommended Liquid Bases: Water, coconut water, milk, any nut milk\n\nBenefits: Energy, Anti-Inflammatory, Better Skin, Modulate Cholesterol, Heart Health\nThe Blend N' Slurp Process\n\n\nSome of the farmers who make our smoothie kits possible:\nCrawford Orchard, Idalou, TX, G&S Groves, McAllen TX, Village Farms, Marfa, TX, Patty\u2019s Herbs, Pearsall, TX, Lightsey Farms, Mexia, TX, Makewood Plantation, Huntsville, TX, Joe's Microgreens, Austin, TX\nThings That Matter to Us \nWithout supporting rural communities and their farmers, city life would look very different. With more and more people moving to cities, the demand for food and other goods is skyrocketing. The farmers we source our fruits and veggies from are right here in Texas, we bring their harvest to you in a way that makes your life easier and their business possible. \nOur glass jars come in 32oz and 16oz portions and are consistently reused throughout our smoothie kit process. \nIn a world where single-use packaging is everywhere, we believe Orchard Smoothies has potential for real impact. There will be as much plastic waste in the oceans as there are fish, by 2050. Not what we want those fishies to be slurpin' on! \nTested, and Ready to Roll \nWe have already been testing the concept in partnership with Lettuce (a zero-waste meal kit delivery service). Here\u2019s some feedback we\u2019ve received:  \n\nWe put all this feedback and more into a blender, slurped it all down, and the result is this final Orchard Smoothies experience.\nWith your contributions we can make zero waste the new norm not only in Austin but communities all over. The environment needs all the help it can get, so the little things add up. We believe that small changes equals collective impact. One smoothie kit at a time. \nOperationally speaking, powered by our technology partner, Loconomy, we will use Lettuce's operational infrastructure and delivery network to create and deliver our kits to customers - further reducing wasteful use of resources and helping make our business model more robust.  \nAbout Me & Us\nAbout 8 months ago I packed up my life and drove down to Austin from Philadelphia and took a chance at a new life. This is my first time living alone and it astounded me how much trash accumulated in such a small amount of time. I\u2019m a big foodie, so being new to Austin I am constantly bombarded with food and drinks at every turn. I found myself eating out more than I should and neglecting my kitchen at home, for either convenience reasons or pure laziness. How could I cut down on my waste but maintain that Austin lifestyle I love so dearly? Orchard Smoothies became the solution I didn\u2019t know I needed. It combines the ease of delivery with healthy and waste free alternatives. The best part is I don\u2019t have to take out my trash as often.\nBut this project is not just me, myself and I. Orchard Smoothies is made up of knowledgable chefs who work with us to make sure our smoothies are nutritious and delicious. An operations team that works very hard to perfect your kits and get deliveries out on time. And a support team ready to answer your questions or address issues. \nThe appeal of smoothies for me is that there is a smoothie for everyone, and that reflects your experience here in Austin. You're consuming something that isn\u2019t a big brand, isn\u2019t a ploy for money or your data but something that aims to provide you with a food experience that won\u2019t leave you guessing. No matter who you are, we have a smoothie for you. And this is just the start! \nI am always looking for advice, feedback and support from people like you. So please feel free to reach out, critique my words or applaud my cause, I\u2019d love to hear from you.

Not only can they substitute synthetic materials, but in many ways they are far better than plastic. We are using 10 amazing plants: hemp, kenaf, linen, cork tree, wood, corn, jute, eucalyptus, rubber tree and New Zealand wool to craft our 97% ecological MIRET sneakers.  \n\n\nMIRET Woodies are premium VEGAN-friendly sneakers. With a silky smooth surface they look like premium leather sneakers, but this is not leather at all. They are made with a very fine layer of smoothly polished Oak wood. Yes, you are reading this correctly. A thin layer of wood which is flexible because it is cut with a laser into tiny squares. The surface resembles premium leather with it is silky smooth touch, but the sneakers are completely vegan. The feel and the look of the sneakers are special and you can actually see the natural rings of the wood in the texture.  \nWe are industry insiders who have inherited a factory from our father in our 20s. We have manufactured sneakers for some of the most famous high-end brands in the world. We realised that the footwear industry is apocalyptic to nature because the materials used in the shoe industry are downright horrible.     \nFootwear has a detrimental effect on the environment. Made out of plastic and leather, 20.000.000.000 pairs were manufactured just in 2019. Polyester and rubber are made from oil derivatives and are the source of micro-plastics that pollute our grounds, seas, air, water, and ultimately ending up on our plates. Most people think that leather is natural, but actually, it is filled with very toxic chemicals, most often heavy metals like chromium. When trends fade, we discard sneakers while putting an unbearable burden on Earth's ecosystems.   \nUsing our manufacturing expertise we redesigned sneakers from the bottom up, making them compatible with nature. We decided to change ourselves, our setting and most importantly - the industry.       \nWe have traveled the world searching for new materials. It was a five-year-long journey of research, tests and development filled with ups and downs, tears and joy. \nThe result of our quest are MIRET supernatural materials. Not only can they substitute synthetic materials but in many ways they are far better than plastic. We are using 10 amazing plants: hemp, kenaf, linen, cork tree, wood, corn, jute, eucalyptus, rubber tree and New Zealand wool to craft our 97% ecological MIRET sneakers. \nMIRET sneakers are super soft and cozy from the moment you put them on. They are flexible and will keep your feet happy during long walks. \nOur new outsole contains no oil-based synthetic rubber whatsoever. It is pure natural latex, harvested from rubber trees - this makes the outsole softer and more flexible than any other rubber out there.       \nPLAY\n\nMIRET ultra-light insoles are made from cork throughout and protected by a natural textile. They are ergonomically shaped and even food-grade certified, so your dog can chew on them safely. \ud83d\udc15  \nPLAY\n\nThe pure hemp lining allows the breeze to travel through the fabric to keep it fresh.    \nPLAY\n\nHemp lining is naturally odour-resistant, while cork is on a whole other level. About 45% of the mass of cork is a waxy compound known as suberin, and it makes cork naturally mold and mildew resistant, as well as resistant to termites and fire.\nThe outer fabric of our sneakers is protected by a special natural water repellent layer so you can be safe even when it rains. Standard water repellent treatments are petroleum-based and harmful for the environment, especially for aquatic life, but our water protection is 100% natural. The layer works by mimicking the self-cleaning effect of the lotus flower and degrades naturally with zero impact on the environment. This will also keep your sneakers clean for much longer.  \nMIRET water protection is 100% natural\nBecause it's hard and expensive. We\u2019ve spent five years making MIRET 97% super-ecological sneakers. That means they are almost entirely made out of natural materials, safe for the environment and your health. The remaining 3% is synthetic glue and polyester thread. We will tackle this  3% very soon. Our vision is to create a 100% ecological and home-compostable sneaker, and with each new generation MIRET sneakers we are getting closer to this goal.\nOur super 97% ecological sneakers are all identical in anatomy, but there are five different varieties of outer layer materials:\n Hempies: 100% pure hemp outer layer - vegan-friendly  \n Woolies: 100% pure wool outer layer - vegetarian-friendly  \n Fluffies: 100% pure fluffy wool outer layer - vegetarian-friendly  \n Veggies: biodegradable textile outer layer - vegan-friendly  \n Woodies: oak wood outer layer - vegan-friendly  \nMIRET Hempies are VEGAN-friendly. We have developed a pure hemp textile for MIRET Hempies. It is naturally breathable, strong but soft, anti-bacterial and with a low environmental impact. Grown on European farms and fully processed in Europe while maintaining every stage of the manufacturing process as healthy as possible to the individual and to the environment. Hemp gets softer the more you wear it and provides natural optimal temperature regulation. Our hemp is completely unbleached and undyed.\nMIRET Woolies and Fluffies are VEGETARIAN-friendly and their textile is 100% pure wool. Woolies textile is certified by the most rigorous ecological certifications in the world Cradle to Cradle\u2122 which guarantees the highest possible standards of safety the environment, while Fluffies textile is certified by Oeko-tex\u00ae and EU Ecolabel\u00ae. All of our sheep live happily in New Zealand.\nMIRET Veggies are VEGAN-friendly. Our Veggies are made from vegan biodegradable textile, developed specifically for MIRET. The Cradle to Cradle\u2122 certified material is strong and durable enough to replace the standard polyester textile, but can be fully compostable when the sneakers are discarded. The laboratory tests showed the plants grow better when our material is mixed into the soil.  \nMIRET Woodies are premium VEGAN-friendly sneakers. With a silky smooth surface they look like premium leather sneakers, but this is not leather at all. They are made with a very fine layer of smoothly polished Oak wood. Yes, you are reading this correctly. A thin layer of wood which is flexible because it is cut with a laser into tiny squares. The surface resembles premium leather with it is silky smooth touch, but the sneakers are completely vegan. The feel and the look of the sneakers are special and you can actually see the natural rings of the wood in the texture.  \n\nPLAY\n\nIn 2019 we have launched our first-generation MIRET sneakers and sold 800 pairs. We received a ton of feedback and this is one of the reasons why we pushed the envelope and developed a much improved second generation of ecological sneakers. Our new product features 97% bio-based ecological materials, innovative construction and much-improved comfort and durability.     \nOur manufacturing partners come from nine European Union countries and every single one of them is thinking green.   \nAll sizes matter. US: 3-14, EU: 34-49. We made sure you can fit your whole family with MIRET by making them in a wide range of sizes. When we decided we wanted to make a change in the shoe industry, we knew we needed everyone on board, no matter their shoe size.   \nOur new sneakers are ready for production and we are ready for the next logical step.

We promise to keep our backers updated and informed about any issues that may arise.\n\nWe are an experienced team with more than 10 years of experience in footwear development and manufacturing. This is the 2nd generation of MIRET sneakers and is ready for serial production. Our 1st generation was launched in 2019, and we got amazing feedback from our customers. We have organized and prepared everything in line to bring you the best quality product.\n\nWith the creation of any new product that includes manufacturing processes, there can be a number of unforeseen risks and obstacles. We will do everything we can to eliminate any possible interruption during production and delivery. If something unexpected happens, we will keep you up to date. However, from our side comes the fact that MIRET is already a finished and developed product. We need your final push to bring this product to its final production run.\n\nThe biggest challenge that we could probably face is the unexpected number of backers and therefore some products might not be ready for the scheduled delivery as planned. All materials are sourced from our stable suppliers, all of which are based in the EU. Our factory is local, well established and experienced in co-working and production. We will do our best to scale the production if needed so each of you can receive your MIRET sneakers in the shortest possible amount of time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWith over 10 years of experience in footwear development and production, we are experts in crafting quality sneakers. We have spent the last 5 years searching and developing sustainable and ecological materials for our sneakers. MIRET 97% ecological materials are strong, durable and natural at the same time. Developed with the latest technologies and ecological knowledge, our wool textile materials are Cradle to Cradle\u2122 SILVER certified. Our fluffy wool materials are Oeko-tex\u00ae and EU Ecolabel\u00ae certified, and our veggies textile is Cradle to Cradle\u2122 GOLD certified. All of our sneakers are protected with an innovative water repellent layer that protects the sneaker from water. It also protects the sneakers from dirt and stains which increases the lifespan of the sneaker as they do not need to be washed so often. The layer works by mimicking the self-cleaning effect of the lotus flower. Usually the water repellant treatments are far from being eco-friendly, but are very harmful for aquatic life. Our layer is completely natural and degrades naturally with zero impact on the environment. The inside of MIRET sneakers is made out of 100% natural, un-bleached and un-dyed hemp which is naturally anti-bacterial and odour resistant. MIRET ultra-light insoles are made from cork throughout and protected by a natural textile. Cork is amazing because about 45% of the mass of cork is a waxy compound known as suberin which makes cork naturally mold and mildew resistant, as well as resistant to termites and fire. In 2019 we have launched our first generation MIRET sneakers which was an amazing test for us. We have received a lot of feedback which we have used to design our new much-improved generation of sneakers \u2014 more durable, more comfortable, more eco-friendly. MIRET sneakers are made with 97% natural materials. The remaining 3% is synthetic glue and polyester thread. This 3 % is actually making our sneakers more sustainable because they are greatly improving the durability, and ultimately reducing waste. We will tackle this 3% very soon.\nReusability and recyclability\nUsing our manufacturing expertise we redesigned sneakers from the bottom up, making them compatible with nature. The design of our sneakers is defined by optimised material consumption. We have reduced the complexity of the aesthetics in order to reduce cutting waste. The waste generated during the manufacturing process will be collected, composted and turned to plant food.\nSustainable materials\nMIRET supernatural materials are not only a great substitute for synthetic materials, but in many ways, they are far better than synthetics. We are using 10 amazing plants to craft our sneakers: hemp, kenaf, linen, cork tree, wood, corn, jute, eucalyptus, rubber tree and New Zealand wool. Classical sneakers are made out of many different components which makes recycling virtually impossible. Over the course of our 5-year development, we have successfully replaced non-sustainable components with ecological alternatives, one by one. Our vision is to create a 100% ecological and home-compostable sneaker, and with each new generation MIRET sneakers we are getting closer to this goal. Our hemp materials are VEGAN-friendly, custom developed for MIRET, and with a super low environmental impact. Grown on European farms and fully processed in Europe while maintaining every stage of the manufacturing process as healthy as possible to the individual and to the environment. MIRET fluffy wool sneakers are VEGETARIAN-friendly. The fluffy wool textile is 100% pure wool and certified by Oeko-tex\u00ae and EU Ecolabel\u00ae, while Woolies textile is certified by the rigorous ecological certification Cradle to Cradle\u2122 SILVER certificate. MIRET veggies sneakers are VEGAN-friendly. They are made with a vegan biodegradable textile, developed specifically for MIRET. The Cradle to Cradle\u2122 GOLD certified material is strong and durable enough to replace the standard polyester textile but can be fully compostable.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nIn our five year-long search of sustainable materials we have found a lot of companies claiming their materials are sustainable. But in reality, only a handful of them are true to their cause. The carefully chosen dozen have become our manufacturing partners.

They are delicious and they look so great on your plate.\nMicrogreens are an early stage in a plant's growth - instead of waiting months for the plant to grow, we eat it in the 7-12 day period after the germination.\nAnd the best part - You can grow them in your apartment. With Evolve Garden, the process is so easy, a 3-year-olds can do it (we have tried) and the result is so delicious, they will want to eat them too.\n * USDA study that shows microgreens contain 4 to 40 times the nutrients of their mature counterparts - https://agnr.umd.edu/news/mighty-microgreens\nEvolve Garden is an extremely easy and fast way to grow your own greens and herbs in 7 days - just add water?\nEvery microgreens grower will tell you that growing your own greens is easy... but they will start talking about water pH, blackout times and different types of growing mediums in the same breath. That's just too complicated, there must be a better way, right?\nPLAY\n\n Evolve Garden makes growing microgreens easy for everyone. \nWe created an easy to use, \"all-inclusive\" kit that provides you with everything you need to start (and continue) growing your greens in no time, with no mess and no guessing if you are doing it right.\nPLAY\n\nNo soil = no mess\nWorking with soil may be fun sometimes. But planting seeds in soil indoors can be time consuming and messy. So, we ditched the soil and developed a growing system that uses special coconut fiber mats - no mess.\nCoconut growing mat holds water extremely well, for 10 days or more. That means you won't have to worry about watering your greens. And it's weaved together, so it doesn't make a mess. When you harvest your greens, just roll it up and throw it on your compost pile or organic waste bin - it's 100% natural and compostable. \nOnly water once\nI admit. I can't keep a cactus alive. That is why Evolve Garden is designed especially for growing microgreens and herbs. Growing mats are full of tiny spaces that hold the perfect amount of air and water to provide nutrients to your plants for over 10 days.\nThat means you don't have to worry about watering your greens, just add water in the beginning and forget about them until they are ready to harvest approximately 1 week later.\nWhen you are done, just throw it into composting bin\nEverything about Evolve Garden is natural. When you harvest your lush, yummy greens, you are left with an empty growing mat. You can simply throw it in the composting bin or on your compost pile. It is 100% biodegradable.\nYou can grow up to 300g of microgreens from just one Evolve seed pad. Every starter kit comes with 2 seed packs, so you can grow almost $100 worth of microgreens in your first month!\nSimply cut your greens with scissors or a sharp knife. You can cut them all at once and store in fridge for up to 2 weeks, or you can cut them as you go.\nMicrogreens are getting popular, but they are still hard to come by in some countries. If you can find them in farmer markets or supermarkets, they are not always fresh and they can cost a lot.\nWhy not grow them yourself?\nIt's fun watching these greens grow. You will be amazed at what a difference even a few hours make.\nYou will know your greens are as fresh as they can be.\nAnd you can save a lot of money.\nBeautifully crafted wooden frames.\nEvery Evolve Garden kit comes with a modern wooden frame. The frame is designed to provide support for the growing tray and expose your greens to as much light as possible.\nIt's also designed to fit into our vertical stand. If you are serious about growing microgreens, have a large family or even a restaurant, you can easily slide these frames into the Evolve strand and save a lot of space.\nEvolve Garden looks great on any countertop, shelf or window sill. It's like a piece of furniture and the contrast between wood and greens is really something to look at.\nEstimated shipping time - EU backers in February 2020, USA a few months later.\nWe are based in the EU. All of the Evolve Garden parts are produced in the EU and our seed are grown locally, under one of the strictest agriculture legislation in the world.\nWe have already made a small number of Evolve Gardens and we have figured out most of the mass production processes.\nWe are planning on sending out the first batch (Early bird) of Evolve Gardens to our European backers in late February 2020 with other rewards following shortly after.\nUnfortunately, we will need more time to sort out shipping of the live seeds to the USA so our American backers will start receiving their Evolve Gardens 2-3 months later.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I grow microgreens in my apartment, in my climate?\nShort answer: Yes. Microgreens can be grown in all climates, at all times of the year and take up so little space you can grow them even in a small apartment.\nThey don't relly much on external factors for their growth - just a little bit of light and some water is fine. They don't need to be fertilized, because all the nutrients they need for growth are present in the seed, so you know there are no nasty chemicals involved.\nVisit our website to see a full list of frequently asked questions.\nWhat varieties of microgreens can I grow with Evolve Garden? \nThere are 10 varieties of greens available from the start with more to come in the future.\nThere are dozens of microgreens and herbs that you can grow at home, some are very forgiving and some a bit harder to maintain. But, we had to start somewhere.\nWe handpicked 10 different greens to start with.\nAfter the initial period, we will start adding new, interesting and seasonal seed packs to our web store. The possibilities are endless. From the bright red Amaranth to almost black Dark Opal Basil and everything in between.\nSubscribe to our growing packs and save\nWith every Evolve Garden starter kit, you get 2 seed packs to get you started. You can order more seed packs from the start or buy them later from our web store.\nBut, you don't need to choose and go through the process of buying seed packs every few weeks - we are rolling out a subscription service.\nSimply subscribe, tell us what your favorite flavors are and every month you will receive new seed packs. You can save time and money by subscribing, plus, there will a small surprise included with every package you get.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupply chain\nWe developed the product to the phase where it is ready to be sent out to consumers. However, there are some challenges and risks involved. Evolve Garden is produced locally and some parts are hand finished. Out supply chain has not been \"stress-tested\" so there may be delays when it comes to mass production.\n\nSeed availability\nEvolve Garden contains live plant seeds. We have chosen varieties that are easy to grow and widely available. However, seed availability is not 100% guaranteed - there may be a shortage of certain variety due to natural phenomenons. We have prepared a list of over 20 microgreens varieties so we will be able to find a suitable exchange with similar properties if one variety of seeds becomes unavailable.\n\nSending to counties outside of EU\nWe are an EU based company and we are proud that every part of Evolve Garden is built in the EU. We are using local suppliers that are as close to our headquarters as possible. We are planning on sending Evolve Garden worldwide. Since it contains live plant seeds, there may be some issues with customs and regulations.

This ensures that the seeds have already sprouted before they\u2019re even in the ground and that they have a strong rooting system when they grow. Not only that, but after we plant them we follow up with our spraying drone to remove competition and provide nitrogen and other nutrients for the best chance of success. We continuously monitor our seedlings with the mapping drone to make sure they\u2019re healthy.\nHow do you plant the trees?\nWe plant our seed pods, using a heavy-lift drone that\u2019s been customized with a pneumatic firing device to insert the pods into the soil at the appropriate depth.\nTree planting companies use seedlings. Why would they use seed pods instead of seedlings if it takes longer to grow?\nPlanting pods has several advantages over seedlings.\n1) Drones allow us to plant pods 10X faster per drone than seedlings can be planted.\n2) Our seed pods contain 3 pre-germinated tree seeds, mycorrhiza, nutrients and other supportive species for the area.\n3) Pods are much less energy/ water intensive to produce and have a lower environmental impact.\n4) Pods can be created in mass within a month, whereas seedlings take 1 to 2 years of intensive care in a nursery before they can be planted. This allows us to plant rapidly and at 20% the cost of a seedling.\nAre you qualified?\nYes. Three of our core members have backgrounds in science and engineering. Additionally, we\u2019re working closely with scientists with PhD's in botany, seed genetics, and forestry specialists on every job. We are fully certified and licensed for UAV operation in Canada.\nWhat tree species do you plant?\nThis year we planted eight deciduous and coniferous species local to Southern Ontario. We can easily fill our pods with seeds of virtually any tree species (except for acorns and a few of the larger exceptions). If interested, we can also plant any flora that\u2019s appropriate for an ecosystem in it\u2019s successional period.    \n In your video you talk about planting for full eco-system recovery, how are you doing this?\nWe know that planting a single tree species will not restore an ecosystem to its natural state nor will it guarantee a healthy forest. That\u2019s why we develop pods that capture the relevant tree seeds, mycorrhiza, nutrients, and soil properties for the target area. Seeds from local sources are usually the best adapted to the target ecosystem but even that isn\u2019t always the case. Climate change has rapidly changed ecosystems and sometimes seeds from lower latitudes are actually more likely to survive in warming climates. We are building a team of experts in restoration ecology to ensure that science underpins all of our efforts and captures nature\u2019s nuances.\nDo you work with companies that are interested in planting only one or two types of trees?\nWhile our focus is on full-eco system recovery, we can work with others, including oil and timber companies, who prioritize a select few tree species. However, we will always push to ensure our seedlings have the best chance of success and will disclose what the ecosystem's needs are to ensure this.\nWhere do you operate?\nSo far we\u2019ve planted in southern Ontario.

The mainspring stores sufficient energy to power the watch and keep perfect time. However, when unworn, after about 48 hours the mainspring fully unwinds and the watch stops. \n This image shows how the mainspring powers the basic functions in a mechanical watch.\n   More sophisticated watches also display the month, year, leap-year, lunar phase ... Each additional feature uses up some spring power.  Such watches, when fully unwound, must be reset in so that they can be worn. Having to reset the time, date and a day can be annoying.\n KEY FEATURES\nGYROSCOPIC MOVEMENT - Excellent care for your watch mechanism \n    It makes that oil within the movement is dispersed to every corner, which is good for lifespan of your timepiece. To keep your watch running silently, every moving part has to be lubricated to lower the friction between moving parts.\nSILENT OPERATION - You won't hear it running \n    This picture shows the sound measurement in decibels (unit for sound).  oWinder runs silently so it will not disturb you while working or sleeping. We put a lot of work into making it silent!\n360\u00b0 DISPLAY - Admire your favorite watch \n    While winding, oWinder makes full cycles, so you can admire your timepiece in all of its beauty.\nMount - Safe & easy to use\n    The mount is designed in such a way so as to protect your watch when taking it on and off. It fits almost every watch( see the size table )\nHigh quality materials - in-house manufacturing for the highest quality \n    Every part is made from quality materials to best suit its needs. We did not compromise quality for the price. \nEvery oWinder has 1 year warranty.\nMotion  - Safety first \n    Don't worry about damaging the oWinder. If anyone or anything stops the oWinder while winding, it will stop and continue winding after releasing.\nWinding program - adjustable turns for your timepiece\n    You can manually select between different turns per day. You have a choice of clockwise, counter-clockwise or alternate rotation. We will provide you with all of the information you need to. If second stretch goal is achieved you will have an option to control winding with a mobile app.\nPower plug - compatible with any USB\n   You can power an oWinder with any micro USB cord. If the first stretch goal is achieved you will use the same plug for battery charging.\nCOLORS\n   You will have an option to select different color combinations after the campaign ends. The base stand is available in black, green, blue and white, while the gyroscopic mechanism is available in black and silver. \nOne more base stand color will be chosen by our backers and will be available only on Kickstarter. \n Base colors: black, green, blue, white\n Gyroscopic mechanism colors: black, silver\n STRETCH GOALS \nADD-ON\nHow does an ADD-ON work?\n   You add one or more following items on top of your current pledge:\n1 more oWinder - $280\nGlass cover - $60\nHow do i make it work?\nYour Reward price + Add-On price = Total pledge\nHere are the steps:\n1. You back the project by choosing a reward. In this way you become a backer.\n2. Once you decided what to add, you go to the campaign page and you find the Manage your Pledge button. It is the first thing you see under the kickstarter logo on top right of page\n3. You do a simple sum and you add the amount of your addons.\n SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION\nPLAY\n\n    This video shows how to select a winding program, how to power the watch winder and how hand protection mechanism works.\n    This picture shows how winding works on the oWinder.\nSize chart\n   The mount is universal and can fit almost every watch. If you have a watch which is outside of the mount\u2019s range, we will design a special mount for you free of charge.\nProduct dimension\n Prototype board\n This picture shows a direct driven stepper motor, driven by arduino.\nWinding specifications\n If more than 1 program is selected, the last one will prevail.\nSHIPPING\n   We will ship worldwide to your door. Shipping costs are included in the price. Please note that some duties, handling fees or taxes may appear in some countries.\n TIMELINE  \n    We cannot guarantee the exact delivery date but we will do our best to get your oWinder to you as soon as possible. Various factors that may have an effect on delivery schedule include production volume and the shipping partner\u2019s schedule.\n THANK YOU\n   We believe there is a better way to wind our watches. A more sophisticated and accurate way, where watches are maintained in a way that preserves their full quality for many generations after. \nWe're obsessively passionate about watch mechanisms. Our goal is to help people take care of their watch properly and preserve them for the next generations.\nWe have created oWinder as answer to expensive gyro winders which costs more than $1500+. We challenged them by creating silent and universal winder which will last for a lifetime. \nThe idea came from a 3D printing community where similar winders were made. The problem of the concept was not lasting design, cheap electronics and geared motors, which over time become noisy. And besides, a precious timepiece doesn't look good on a cheap plastic winder.\nWith your support, we hope we can bring our vision to the world.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease be aware that owinder is a product in the prototype stage.

Thanks to its aerodynamic shape, the air pad is quick and easy to inflate without pumps or other specialized equipment.\nPractical to use in different situations.\nTravelers know it can be tough to get sleep in airports; on airplanes, ferries, cars, or buses; at the office; or even outdoors. The LayOn air pad makes it easy to get some sleep in any situation. You\u2019ll be able to take the rest you need to make sure you\u2019ll be ready for your travel adventures.\nFrom airports to cars, from inside to the great outdoors. \nLayOn is a travel accessory for the best sleeping support in any position, whether sitting or lying down. LayOn is the first and only travel aid to offer an air pad and a travel pillow in one product\nThe air pad is located inside the pillow and is accessible by opening the zipper. Inflating the air pad is also quick and easy. Simply open the gap, blow, close the gap and push on the ''balloon'' to move the air forward into the pad. Inflating the pad takes about ten blows. Finally, simply fold the bend up to the line on the pad. If you are able to fold it past the line, your air pad needs more air. If you can\u2019t reach the line,  your air pad has too much air and you need to release some.\nThe pillow is inflated by blowing into the valve with just two breaths. The valve is hidden under the face-side cover gap and is easily accessible.\nAir pad and travel pillow in one product.\nChoose your own way of comfort.\nInflation is easy due to Patented Technology and an aerodynamic design. Just open the gap, blow inside, close it and push the ''balloon'' - the air is going to move into the pad. With a few repeats, it will be full.\nAir pad\nOpen > blow > close > push > repeat > fold up to the line\nPillow\nInflate the pillow with two breaths.\nAdjustable support\nBecause of the inner air pad, the pillow gives way better neck support than any other inflatable pillow. The added adjustable rope lock will keep the pillow in its place to provide excellent support and comfort wherever you may need it. \nThe only air pad that is airline friendly and does not require you paying an extra fee.\nBecause of its smart packaging and travel pillow shape, LayOn 2 in 1 travel pad is the first air pad you can take on the plane with you and your carry-on luggage. It doesn't need to be stored in the luggage.\nAbove, see the size of the 2 in 1 air pad compared to some everyday items. The air pad is nearly as small as a 0,5L bottle.\nThe soft feel of the pillow is provided by very light and natural Italian fabric viscose. The air pad hiding inside the pillow is made of waterproof and airtight high-quality 40D nylon. Finally, the comfort insert within the pillow consists of Polyvinyl.\nThe fabric has the certificate SGS.\nLayOn pillow is made of only 3 components, which makes it easy to clean.\nThe cover of the pillow is machine washable and the inflatable components can easily be wiped clean.\nLayOn is made of durable nylon that can also be used on rough outdoor surfaces, as long as the user makes sure there are no sharp objects under the air pad. The product serves its purpose in spring, summer, and autumn.\nLayOn is made of durable nylon that can also be used on rough outdoor surfaces, as long as the user makes sure there are no sharp objects under the air pad.

Our mission is to deliver travelers with the best sleeping support for their traveling.\nThe person that gave birth to LayOn is Ur\u0161a, a designer, a traveler, and an extremely active person - who does not last long in one place. Instead, Ur\u0161a enjoys vibrant work with plenty of opportunities to make new contacts and meet new people. Just five years ago, Ur\u0161a was a handball player and saw her future in sports: the most traveling she did was from gym to gym. However, a knee injury ended her sports career in an instant. She then re-discovered her passion for traveling and exploring foreign places: which had always been her greatest wish and she wanted to travel to as many destinations as possible. Now she works with a great team that mostly consists of family and friends. The reason behind LayOn is innovation and the belief that traveling is important for the spirit of the human being - but so is sleeping. The vision is to make the traveler's life a little easier and build a trusted brand.\nUr\u0161a remembers: \"My whole design career started by designing wrapping paper for flowers! I then took the challenge of sewing my own suitcases - and here we are today. I am incredibly proud for my team and me to finally present you with a completely fresh start-up product: LayOn travel pad that provides a solution to a frequent traveling problem - no place to lie down at airports and the limited amount of free passengers' luggage.\"\n\"I tackled some frequent traveling problems in my dissertation and from there, things evolved naturally. One day me and my friend brought the sewing machine and the material home and started to play around with ideas.\"\n\"It was so much fun! We stayed up late, started designing a suitcase and at some point, we knew this was it.\"\n\"Traveling has always been my inspiration. That's why I love LayOn travel pad so much - it is a part of my life.\"\n\"It all started with the desire to make a useful product that would solve our frequent traveling problems - but we soon found out it solves the problem of many other travelers.\"\nWe started developing our first product in 2017. The first prototype looked very different and came in the shape of a suitcase. We started playing around with the basic forms at first and only started thinking about the design later since we needed to learn about the materials and the technology available first. The second step was then to adjust the design to be functional and practical.\nStep one of developing the product was simply taking the materials and sticking them together with tape to imitate the welds. In step two, we used airtight fabric and bound it with iron. In step three, we already had the first samples and contacted a company that helped us realize some of our ideas by using a high-frequency machine. The final step - developing our product\u2019s aerodynamic shape  - followed soon after.\nProduct development\nFrom the very beginning, we wanted to make sure that LayOn 2 in 1 travel pad was going to be user-friendly. To ensure that, we studied other travel gadgets and spoke to future customers. Nonetheless, the early stages of developing the product involved quite a few technical challenges.\nDesign & prototype\nWe wanted to design a product that was practical and let that lead us in all stages. The tools we used evolved as the prototypes evolved - from the first tools like a sewing machine and iron that we found at home all the way to a high-frequency machine.\nMass production\nWe already accomplish the prototyping phase and start mass production. The mass production of the product is spread internationally: the Italian fabric sewed by the Slovenian company. The pattern of the pad is done by the Chinese manufacturer and the most important part will be made by our team. \nDelivery\nThe first 900 LayOn 2 in 1 travel pads will be shipped on March/April 2020 and the next round will be delivered in Jun 2020.\n--------------------------- Shipping ----------------------------\n*Shipping will be charged after the campaign.\n*Shipping fees DO NOT count toward customs fees.

The final air pads will be in navy blue. The size of prototypes is size Small 165 cm and the final products will be in size of 188 cm. \n_______________________________________________________________\nReturn Policy\nWe only used quality materials to ensure years of use.

Lombok is still unspoiled, abundant with unique culture and aromatic spicy food. Covered with thousands of coconut palm trees dancing in the wind and whispering incredible stories. And this all for us to experience, admire and treasure.\n In August 2018, strong earthquakes hit the Lombok Island. Many people where killed, thousands of them injured, more than half of the million citizens lost their households, workplaces, shelters. People started to restructure their lives focusing on what is the most important for the future of their families and the Island. \n Story of COCONESIA starts long before it happened.  Danica, Marta and Pak Raden were helping local community in various ways. And one day our paths crossed.\nWe spend time talking about Lombok and its post earthquakes future. We become fully aware that only coconut trees plantations stood up to the forces of nature. We realized how important the coconut palm trees can be for the community and the Island itself. We decided to join forces and started working on a project that combines the passion of creation and desire to give back and help local community. \n Our main goal is to restore a production of coconut products.\nIn 2016 Pak Raden gathered women from his village (Sokong, North Lombok) and they started a production of organic virgin coconut oil (vco). This product helped increase local economy in many ways. Their product received all the necessary certificates confirming its high quality and nutritional values. \n The 2018 earthquake that struck North Lombok enormously effected the local community by destroying their workshops, machines and tools. Therefore, it was impossible to conquer the local market and develop sales of virgin coconut oil and other coconut products.\nCOCONESIA project has only one goal \u2013 to fully restore and upgrade production of virgin coconut oil and additional coconut products. We want to achieve it by buying necessary machines and rebuilding community workshops where all the manufacturing can take place again. Pak Raden with his female co-workers started the production already but it doesn\u2019t have a chance to be fully operational without help from you.\n To make COCONESIA products we use North Lombok palm trees and their fruits. We want you to feel personally connected to our project. We give you a chance of owning your own Indonesian palm tree. By adopting it you will receive a personalised certificate and coconut products made directly from YOUR own tree.      \n By being a part of this process you are not only supporting our project but also saving our planet. Our production is based on zero waste philosophy and we are making our products using and recycling 100% of coconut palm tree and its fruits.\n All of the products are 100% handmade from the Sokong coconut plantation. They are handmade by local women who share their knowledge and recipes with younger generations. Coconesia\u2019s products are natural, eco friendly, organic and bio. Food products like oil, sugar, shredded coconut are made by using traditional methods and recipes. As we mentioned our project is based on zero waste principals. Brushes produced by us are made of coconut fiber, bowls from coconut shells and food products from its pulp. To make the cutlery, we use old coconut wood from the palm trees which does not grow fruits anymore. By doing all of that we reuse palm trees so you can fully enjoy natural, exotic and organic products.\nLook who is talking already about our project, recognizing true values in its products, mission and goals that we stand for. COCONESIA is a staple of better tomorrow for many inhabitants of the Island of Lombok and you can be a part of the movement", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRight now we need your help raising the funds to restore a production of coconut products. The funds raised by this campaign will be used to purchase technology, advanced tools and building a new community workshop, which was destroyed during 2018 earthquakes. \nAny additional funds will be used to build showroom and its interior. \nOne of the risks that we can\u2019t control is worldwide delivering services. All the products will have attached special phyto-sanitary certificate issued by Indonesian Post Office. The quarantine restrictions for goods are different in each country so we can\u2019t predict the process of approval and final delivery. \nOur greatest challenge now is to meet the production quantities, reflected by our Kickstarter campaign\u2019s goal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Coconesia.id\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nJoining forces from 3 countries on Lombok Island - for sharing passion to work and helping local community.

The balance bike looks like a real bicycle because kids want to look like their parents. Besides its great design, with the use of natural materials for its construction, the product improves environmental issues. The product is made for children from 1.5 to 4 years of age.\nDear Bixie supporters!\nThank you again for the support and for believing in our product.\nWe spent some time in the park having our product tested by our most important clients, children, who immediately fell in love with their new balance Bike.\nCheck out our short video and support our project!\nPLAY\n\n\n\nBeechwood\nThe beechwood is light and has excellent properties as construction wood for a bicycle. It is flexible, hard, but easy to process.\nBixie is made of European beechwood, and most of it comes from Slovenia. 60% of Slovenia is covered with forest, with beech as the most common tree. Wood is a renewable natural material, and that makes our balance bike eco-friendly, light and sustainable.\nNatural Design\nBixie has a unique wooden frame made of natural solid beech wood. During the manufacturing process, we used as little wood as possible and just a small amount of glue. Bixie has a minimalistic design, unloaded from any unnecessary parts. Just like with everything else on the bike, we thought of natural wood finish made of natural wax & oils, which is entirely safe for children to lick. This natural cover is so safe it can be even used for wooden cups or woodcut boards.\nAdjustable saddle height\nBixie has adjustable saddle height and has a unique seat clamp solution not seen anywhere else.\nOpen Seat Clamp\nLike Fixie but Bixie\nAs the fixie is the oldest and purest version of a bicycle, requiring less effort to ride it than any other bike, can you imagine a wooden and kids-version of the fixie?! Bixie is made to look like a grown-up\u2019s bike, yet it exhibits playfulness in its rounded design.\nIt is a smaller, simpler, and eco-version of the fixie bike that children will ride when they grow over Bixie.\nJust 20km (12miles) away from our company is location of the oldest wooden wheel found on Earth\nShort story\nAndrej Kregar got the idea of creating a wooden balance bike when his daughter celebrated her 1st birthday. As she was going to use a balance bike soon, Andrej realized he could make one rather than buy it. He listened to his daughter\u2019s wish to have a balance bike that looks like a real bike because children want to have copies of the things their parents have.\nTrained as an architect and an industrial designer, he decided to design and develop a sustainable, natural and plastic-free bicycle for his child to grow with it. The designing process of Bixie was bumpy but fulfilling, to make something enjoyed by children, liked by parents and harmless to the environment and society. 83% of Bixie is locally sourced and locally made.\nLastly, Andrej and his team insisted on using wood since it is an extremely durable material and a valuable part of our heritage. The oldest wooden wheel in the world, the Ljubljana Marshes Wheel, was found only a few kilometers away from their studio. It is over 5000 years old and this whole time was buried in mud. Maybe the same thing will happen with our product, and hopefully, even after 5000 years, it will still be used by children.\n\n Product development\n\nHealthy & eco-friendly product\nBixie is made by natural solid wood with the least amount of glue and wood. Glue does not have any harmful ingredients like the Formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is often present in plywood products, like in the plywood balance bikes. Unlike plywood balance bikes, our product is completely Formaldehyde free.\nChildren's Balance\nChildren who improve their balance at a young age have better coordination when they grow up. It is the foundation for a healthy life filled with movement. Learning to keep balance is a significant part of children\u2019s development, not just in sports, but also in other activities. Kids who use a balance bike are confident enough to move quickly and explore the environment by themselves.\n\nWith Bixie balance bike children learn to ride pedal bikes faster\nOur balance bike is the right choice for your children. Unlike tricycles and training wheels, it is light and easy to ride, kids can move quickly and safely over uneven surfaces, providing them with much fun and independent riding before the time comes for pedal bikes. After having experience with the Bixie balance bike, kids will learn to ride pedal bikes in no time.\n\nKeyring\nOriginal Bixie balance bike\n\nUnique Bixie with your child's name\n\n\n\nHelp us bring this project to life! Make Bixie available to every child and help them be healthy and become environmentally aware adults by contributing to our Kickstarter campaign!\nSure, Bixie will make a significant difference and improvement in the childhood of your toddlers, and we have the workforce to make it happen, but if anything comes along the way, be the first to know. Thank you for your support!\nBixie Team\nThroughout the development phase, Bixie's innovative baby carriage \"carried\" 6 people with the desire for a genuine childish smile and preservation of the environment for the next generations, which is our main concern and task. Our creative team of designers, marketing strategists, carpenters and economists is based in Ljubljana, Slovenia.\nEach of the stakeholders of the process is qualified theoretically and practically for its work, and each one of them and the founder contributes essential ideas to make Bixie the most attractive, durable and useful balance bicycle on the market. Our goal is to create something beautiful, long-lasting, environmentally friendly, and, most importantly, safe.\n\n\nI, (Andrej Kregar, founder) am thankful to all the people that helped me make Bixie a reality. Last year we worked on a prototype assembly, and now thanks to Peter and Murksli Custom Boards we made that prototype a reality. After that, the project began to grow like crazy, and the team that helped me was getting bigger and bigger. So, it is time to thank all of you for the support and even the smallest contribution to the project! I really appreciated it!

It might take us longer than we initially expect, but we are sure to bring this project to life. We already have 500 balance bike wheels in our storage, so production will start even if our campaign fails. You can count on us to build & deliver what we promised and to be transparent of our progress.\n\nDevelopment Process\nWe have produced and tested the prototypes; however, when we start with the serial production, we might find unexpected issues or other drawbacks. We promise to be open and transparent in our communications regarding timing and design changes. About any design change that might happen, you will be informed.\n\nMass Production\nManufacturing a product like Bixie is complex. We found local manufacturers who will make the parts and tools, so we think that the process should run smoothly. Fortunately, we make the pieces locally, so we do not expect more significant delays when manufacturing process starts. We already have considerable experience in product development and manufacturing process, so we don't expect any significant setbacks here. Nevertheless, we can't plan everything. If the funding of our campaign is successful, we are strongly determined to ensure that everything goes according to our plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nCorrectly designed and built wood structures are very durable. Our wooden balance bike Bixie is made from beech wood, which means that the products made of Beech can take a lot of pressure over time. The hard surfaces of beech wood products will resist gouging and chipping better than some other woods. Maximizing the life of our product Bixie will be assured by wax & oils cover for wood frame which protects the wood from weather and moisture impacts.\nReusability and recyclability\nProduct and its packaging are all-natural and they can be easily recycled or reused. Bixie is made of wood which is one of the most sustainable materials because it holds CO2. Usual artificial materials cause an increase of CO2 emissions, but wood can even decrease CO2 emissions. Wood can be reused in many ways. \nWe use a small amount of steel which can be recycled and just 2 grams of plastic. Plastic is used for only one inevitable part on the whole bike and that is valve caps and even those caps can be reused on other bikes or recycled.\nSustainable materials\nBixie is made from wood that is one of the most sustainable natural materials that reduces CO2 footprint. Wood is locally harvested and processed. The process is clean and does not make or use any hazardous materials or products. We covered grips and saddle with natural leather. We believe leather as a by-product of the meat industry is a sustainable product. Definitely locally made leather is more sustainable than using artificial leather or plastic.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nOur production process mostly consists of cutting wood where no harmful parts are made. Even glues that we use are not harmful to workers nor the environment. We are committed to use local factories and raw materials as much as possible to minimize transportation. We already have a committed partner in Kamnik, Slovenia to make this project a reality.

It combines the simplicity of Arduino along with native support for decentralized networks. With only a few lines of code you can build IoT that interfaces with Ethereum, IPFS, Whisper, and more! \nElk empowers developers to build what we call \u201cDecent IoT\u201d.\nElk includes a powerful processor to connect directly to decentralized networks with no intermediaries. It is plug-and-play just like an Arduino, includes an Arduino compatible SDK, and a mobile app that allows you to communicate with your hardware privately through decentralized technologies.\nWhen building IoT projects with Elk, you're speaking the language of the decentralized web. Here's a quick look at what our SDK offers:\nSAY HELLO TO \"DECENT IOT\" \ud83d\udc4b\nThe potential for blockchain and decentralization extends far beyond the hype. Decentralization allows us to build IoT that is far more private, far more secure, and far more capable. We call it \u201cDecent IoT\u201d, and that\u2019s what we are set out to introduce with Elk.\nI. CENTRALIZED IOT (CURRENT ARCHITECTURE)\nCurrent IoT architecture relies on centralized cloud providers for communication and data storage. This, by necessity, means that a cloud provider (and whomever hacks it):\nHas control of your device\nCan deny you access to your device\nCan breach your privacy and track your metadata\n\nII. DECENTRALIZED (\"DECENT\") IOT\nThe new decentralized web enables a completely new paradigm for IoT. Instead of communicating via a cloud provider, all communications are run privately through a decentralized network, and sensors' data can be logged on to IPFS instead of a central server.\nDecent IoT is a paradigm that:\nGives you complete privacy, including metadata\nPuts you, and only you, in control of your devices\nEnables entirely new use-cases: payments, oracles, selling data, and more!\n\nDECENT IOT PROJECTS YOU CAN BUILD WITH ELK\nI. IOT WITH TRUE CONTROL AND TRUE PRIVACY\nBuild IoT that is completely private and gives you, and only you, control of your devices. With just a few lines of code you can built IoT that relies entirely on decentralized networks for communication and for data storage using Ethereum\u2019s Whisper protocol, IPFS, and the Elk app.\nBuild a decentralized home automation system: a decentralized door lock, decentralized smart lights, or even a decentralized thermostat.\nA decentralized smart door lock that you can control remotely with no intermediary cloud provider\nII. IOT THAT ACCEPTS PAYMENTS\nDespite the hype, crypto-currencies are here to stay and they are the easiest to integrate with IoT. While currencies like Bitcoin are used as a store of value, other cryptocurrencies are stable and can be used in payments with low transaction fees, such as DAI.\nWith only a few lines of code, program devices that accept crypto-currencies like Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. Execute smart contracts, listen to events on the blockchain, and more!  \nBuild an electric outlet or a charging station that you can rent using crypto\nA coffee machine that brews coffee in exchange for cryptocurrency\nIII. IOT THAT MOTIVATES YOU\nBuild devices that motivate you to do your workouts, wake up early, or water your plants. The possibilities are truly endless.\nLock your money into a punching bag and only get it back when you finish your workout\nAn alarm clock that charges you if you don't wake up on time\nIV. AND MORE!\nBlockchain integration with hardware devices paves the way for new applications. Sensors can be used as an oracle to the blockchain to trigger a smart contract action, you can use programmable money to rent assets and govern your devices, or even sell your sensors' data in an open marketplace without a third party.  \nWith decentralized IOT you can sell your data, like your car's data, in an online marketplace\nTake the adrenaline in basketball to a whole new level with hoops you can bet against\nA CLOSER LOOK AT ELK\nI. \"HELLO WORLD\": CONTROLLING A LED WITH DECENTRALIZED TECHNOLOGIES\nWith just 15 lines of code, you can create your very first Decent IoT project! The following tutorial shows how you can get started using Elk and how to control the built-in LED on the board remotely using your phone and the magic of decentralized networks. \nFull sketch for remotely controlling the built-in LED using Whisper and the Elk app.\nII. LET'S TALK PAYMENTS: BUZZ WHEN YOU RECEIVE ETHER!\nIt's hard to talk about decentralization without talking about payments. Again, with a very simple circuit and a few lines of code, this tutorial will show you how to build a buzzer that buzzes whenever a payment is made from/to your account.\nA circuit that buzzes when an account sends/receives Ether\nThe full sketch for the above circuit\nWHY ELK?\nI. A 10X BETTER UX \nElk offers a plug-and-play experience, just like an Arduino. You won\u2019t need to deal with wallet and keys management, fuss over setting up nodes, tune their parameters to run well on an embedded device, handle crashes, etc. Elk \"just works\", so you can focus on building cool applications and not on the overheads when exploring decentralization.\nAdditionally, we extended Ethereum\u2019s Whisper protocol and built the Elk mobile app, an app that makes it trivial for you to interact with your hardware remotely and privately via Whisper through any mobile device.\nUsing the Elk app, you can communicate and send commands remotely to your boards using Ethereum's Whisper network\nThe Elk protocol is a thin-wrapper around Whisper. With one line of code you can generate a UI in the Elk app for controlling your devices. No mobile development required. Now isn't that \"decent\"? ;)\nII. BLOCKCHAIN AGNOSTIC\nWhile our SDK ships with support for a number of decentralized networks, Elk is designed from the ground up to be blockchain agnostic and support for more platforms will continually be added by us and the community (psst: Elk is 100% open-source).\nIII. TRUE DECENTRALIZATION \nBy default and when possible, Elk runs a light node and communicates directly with blockchain networks and not through a hosted service.

We used a NanoPi Duo as the microprocessor and an ESP8266 as the programmable microcontroller.\nII. JUNE 2018: MORE COMPACT\nA double sided PCB daughter board for PocketBeagle. We used an ESP32 module as the programmable microcontroller as well as a USB A port for WiFi connectivity.\nIII. OCTOBER 2018: OUR FIRST HOMEGROWN\nOur first homegrown hardware design with the breadboard-compatible form factor we envisioned. It consists of a single core 1-Ghz microprocessor from TI with 512MB of ram (OSD3358-SM SoM from Octavo Systems), a 120Mhz micro-controller from ST (STM32F205), a compact WiFi 2.4Ghz WiFi module, a microSD card connector, an RGB LED, a USB port and a couple of buttons and a user-controlled LED. We only used SMD components for this one in order to get to that compact and small design.\nIV. JUNE 2019: NEW DESIGN + HIGHER SPECS \nOur second homegrown high speed hardware using an 8-layer compact PCB. We completely redesigned the board from the ground up. We bumped up the specs to a 1Ghz Quad Core microprocessor (Allwinner H3) and utilized a smaller yet powerful 100Mhz micro-controller from ST (STM32F411). \n\nREWARDS\nFeel free to add any of the below items to your rewards and we will ship them with your original reward.\n\nTIMELINE \nTEAM \nOUR FRIENDS FROM THE DECENTRALIZED WORLD \n Consensys Academy: New to blockchain? No problem! We\u2019ve teamed up with ConsenSys Academy to include their blockchain training along with our Learner and Educator Kits!\n Streamr: Elk allows you to own your sensors\u2019 data and sell them through Streamr\u2019s open marketplace.\n Gitcoin: Elk is a great start to learn blockchain development and potentially earn money through Gitcoin\u2019s open source bounties.\n Metamask: MetaMask is the go-to account management platform for the Ethereum Blockchain on desktop and now on mobile. MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today.\nSTORY\nOur story begins in 2013 when we started 1Sheeld, a hardware board that turns your smartphone into 40+ Arduino shields. Since its inception, 1Sheeld has powered tens of thousands of makers in 120+ countries.\n1Sheeld's Kickstarter Campaign from 2013\nWe\u2019ve been following blockchain tech for years, and as we began exploring it in our spare time, we saw how decentralization allows us to build IoT that is far more private, far more secure, and far more capable.\nHaving said that, blockchain development is subpar, let alone blockchain development for embedded devices. While building prototypes of blockchain-connected devices, we had to acquire significant knowledge across multiple disciplines like networking, cryptography, security, OS administration and bare metal embedded development just to get started. This is a showstopper for newcomers, designers or prototypers who will develop the products of tomorrow.\nAt the ETHDenver Hackathon in 2018, we built a prototype of a development board that offers the simplicity of Arduino for building blockchain-connected devices. We ended up winning first place, and the Elk project was born. \nINVESTORS \nOur team is backed by venture capitals and angel investors: Tachyon - accelerator by Consensys ventures, Endure capital, 500 startups, Flat6labs, as well as angel investors like Karim Hussein, Con O'donnell, and Khaled Alashmouny.\nOur technical advisor Sherif Eid helps us with hardware and software designs.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe'd like to thank Amir Hedayah for producing and editing our video.

We have created this product to help you achieve perfect posture \u2013 all from the comfort of your seat.\nPoor posture is something that we fall into over time, often when we are still very young. As we become used to sitting in the wrong posture, the muscles that determine our posture weaken over time, leaving us without the means to correct ourselves naturally. This is why so many people have to go through physical therapy as adults.\nAgain, Infinity PAD is the solution. It's simple, it's smart, and it's effective.\nIf your job requires you to sit at a desk, you haveto put some thought into your posture. Eight hours doing the same thing is always going to shape you, and when it comes to your seated posture, you need to know that you are shaping yourself positively.\nInfinity PAD is a tool that you can use to give yourself a positive posture boost in the long term, encouraging and facilitating proper sitting habits. This product will train you to sit in a way that is conducive to good health!\nBy tilting your pelvis forward, Infinity PAD creates a healthy S-curve on your spine. Because the body's natural reaction to the balance point is to sit with your head up, your shoulders back, and your chest out, perfectly healthy posture that puts no unnecessary stress on your joints and muscles.\n\n\nWhatever you are doing, you can benefit from using Infinity PAD. Simply set it up on whatever chair you are using and take a seat while you:\nThe more you use Infinity PAD, the more you will get out of it. Coming ready-to-use right out of the box, this lightweight piece of equipment requires no assembly either, so you can get to work on your perfect posture immediately. Turn any seat into a healthy seat!\n\nRight now, we have come to you, Kickstarter, in order to raise the funds that we need to manufacture, market, and distribute Infinity PAD on a large scale. Our funding goal through this campaign is $2,500, and every dollar that we raise brings us a step closer to reaching that goal. To say thanks to all our contributors, we are offering significant discounts on Infinity PAD exclusively through this campaign.\nThere is already significant buzz surrounding Infinity PAD, and we could not be more excited to bring it to market. We know, however, that significant challenges will present themselves as we expand production and work to bring this product to a wider audience. Whatever challenges arise, we will figure out a solution, pushing forward to make this product into a reality. We will do anything it takes to get people sitting on Infinity PAD soon!\n\nBeyond making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for Infinity PAD by telling all your friends and family about it. Let everyone you know on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in on this posture-perfection invention.\nWe appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for your time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe already produce Infinity PADs.

Too much water? Too little? Boozy nights have them frazzled? \nJust like us humans, plants are living and sentient beings. It can be hard to understand exactly what they need and to decrypt all those silent messages they send us. The key to helping our plants survive and thrive without speaking the same language? It\u2019s all about finding smarter, deeper ways to connect. This is why we developed the FYTA Beam.\nThe FYTA Beam is a small sensor that connects your plants with your smartphone so you know when they need more water, fertilizer, or a different ambience. \n As seen in\nHow does the FYTA Beam work?\nThe FYTA Beam measures critical factors for a plant\u2019s wellbeing, including \nsoil moisture\nnutrition levels\nlight intensity and \ntemperature. \nJust insert it into the soil next to your plant and install the FYTA app \u2013 intelligent insights will be sent your way instantly via Bluetooth.\nThe FYTA Beam will seamlessly monitor the plant\u2019s living conditions to ensure that it stays within the correct limits for the type of plant that you have. And when it\u2019s time for action, you\u2019ll get a simple notification on you App. No more guess work, lots more \u201cit works!\u201d.\nIf you have several plants, you can connect several FYTA Beams via Bluetooth with each other to create a network of up to 100m transmission range.\nThe FYTA Beam: better than smart\nWe couldn\u2019t find a smart sensor that worked the way we wanted it to. Many existing sensors only measure one or two important parameters, have little design functionality, or are so badly designed that they look like they crash-landed from Planet Fugly.\n\n\nWe wanted to do a better job. This is what makes our FYTA Beam different from other plant sensors:\n Discrete: The FYTA Beam is small and has a reflective glass casing. It almost disappears in your planter.\n Eco-friendly: It\u2019s powered by a built-in solar cell that extends the life of the CR battery every day. All components are detachable so they can be recycled separately. \n Accurate: It measures voltage across the entire length of its stainless-steel probes. This way it collects more data and calculates highly reliable values.\n Adjustable: Have large plants? No problem. The probes are detachable and will be available in different lengths. \n Customizable: Fancy a different feel? There will be different casing colors and designs available soon. \n Good value: Did you know that many of our houseplants could easily outlast us if they received proper care? The FYTA Beam probably costs as little as your phone case  -  and is packed with really smart technology that will make your plants last longer.  \n\n\n\n In short, the FYTA Beam is customizable and designed from recyclable materials. It\u2019s intelligent. It\u2019s built to last.\n The FYTA App: more than a messenger \nThe FYTA App does more than just check on your plants and nudge you in the right direction \u2013 it digs up a whole host of smart insights to help your relationship flourish in new ways:\n Plant identification: Do you know what plants you actually have? No? Well, the app is here to help you identify them!\n The FYTA plant library: Our plant library  includes plant care instructions for all common houseplants. It keeps all plant information handy and in one place. Simple.\n Virtual Garden: Create personal profiles for your plants and organize them in a virtual garden. Perfect if you have many to look after!\n Customized notifications: Let your plants nudge you whenever they need something or simply choose how often you\u2019d like to hear from your plants. \n Tutorials: Enjoy fun tutorials that show you how to take better care of your plants. You\u2019ll even learn how to make plant babies. Yes, you read that right. \nAll of these features come together to help you do one spectacular thing: better understand your plants and eventually connect with them device-free. \nThe FYTA Base: check on your plants while you\u2019re away\nLeaving your beloved plants behind? Don\u2019t fret. With the FYTA Base, it\u2019s easy to check in on them while you\u2019re away and share care instructions with a friend or neighbor, for instance via email.\nThe FYTA Base is a WiFi hub that \nconnects all of your FYTA Beams to your home WiFi network, extending their range way further. \nhelps you manage multiple sensors with greater ease and security. \nconstantly monitors all FYTA Beams and uploads data to a secure cloud, allowing you to access critical insights whenever, wherever. \n provides better notification and sharing options  through the FYTA App. \n\n\nPrototyping\nWe\u2019ve been working for over 12 months on creating the FYTA eco-system: The FYTA Beam, The FYTA Base, the App and the cloud back-end. \nDeveloping the FYTA Beam was fun but challenging. A few things were straight-forward such as building  an NTC-Thermistor into the microcontroller to measure temperature. In order to measure light intensity, we chose to use the current generated by a solar cell instead a  photoiode ( which is commonly used). This  approach helps to to prolong battery life. The most challenging part was to develop a capacitive soil moisture sensor which also measures the salinity of the soil. Finally, we had to figure out how to have the sensors interact in a Bluetooth Mesh Network. \nOver time we built several generations of sensors to test different aspects of the electronics and the Bluetooth communication. The following picture shows several of our prototypes: \nEventually, over the course of months and three generations of prototypes, the FYTA Beam became what it is today. In this video, our engineer Jacob is demonstrating the basic functionality of the sensor within a Mesh network with the help of a third party Bluetooth application. \nPLAY\n\nAnother important part of the process was the parameter calibration which we did with the help of a solar simulator (for light intensity). To calibrate the soil parameter, we used an array of soil samples with fixed values for moisture and salinity to derive the interdependency of both parameters. Finally, we compared our results with measurements taken with highly sensitive, professional measurement devices. \nCurrent Status and Next Steps\nHardware development and programming is now complete. We have visited several manufactures in China and entered into an early stage cooperation with an experienced high-quality producer. \nWe have a demo version of the App and are now working on connecting the devices to the FYTA App and FYTA server (about 50% done).  Here is a sneak peek of our App:\nPLAY\n\nClick here to open an interactive demo reel of the FYTA App\n\nWe are aiming at completing this stage by July to have sufficient time for further testing and calibrations before we order the first batch of products.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe have sufficient funds to complete the development process of the FYTA Beam. With your help we will\n\u00b7 finance the tools required for mass production with our manufacturing partner \n\u00b7 run a test production of the alpha units \n\u00b7 improve the FYTA Beam eco-system with the help of your feedback.\n\u00b7 connect people to plants all over the world!\nStretch Goals\nWe\u2019d love to offer casings and probes to customize or personalize the Beam. However, we will only be able to produce probes in different lengths or casings in different designs if we collect sufficient funds to pre-finance the production of a larger lot. Those are our stretch goals:\n\nFuture plans include the development of different App versions (e.g. for children and offices) as well as the integration with Smart Home Systems. \n\nRewards\nOur reward tiers include the following products:\nThe FYTA Beam System\nThe FYTA Beam System consists of the FYTA Beam, the FYTA App and the optional FYTA Base. Our rewards include single Beams, as well as three different bundles (Plant Lover, Plant Addict, and Plant Nerd) to meet different needs.\nSoil pH Test Kit\nPlants need to sit in the right potting mix to to grow and thrive. If your plants sits in wrong or poor quality soil, even the most accurate measurements and best care schedule won't prevent your plant from stunting. This pH test kit will help you to determine whether your plant needs different soil. The FYTA App will lead you through the process and advise you.\nThe STATEMENT TOTE \nProfess your plant love to the world and make new friends with this awesome screen-printed statement tote bag (100% cotton). Trust us, plant people are the best! \n\nOur Team\nBerlin-based, but with an otherworldly vision. We are FYTA, and we develop inventive, intuitive and cool products for a new generation of indoor gardeners.\nFYTA was founded in 2018 by Claudia Nassif and Sylvie Basler. We are two passionate plant lovers who failed to find the products and insights we needed to create our own urban jungles at home. So we decided to develop them ourselves, for us and others who may struggle to keep these wondrous green creatures alive and happy.\n\nBefore embarking on this journey, Claudia and Sylvie held executive positions in large international companies. Together, they combine over forty years of experience in finance, management, product development, branding and design. Their work today is supported by an international team of plant scientists, developers, designers and creatives. \nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe FYTA Beam will be built by our experienced manufacturing partner. With production facilities in Shenzhen, China, they understand every step from design to direct fullfilment and is the partner of several IoT companies.\n\nThroughout the development process, we have been in very close contact with our engineers and programmers. All along, we have been supported by Dr. Oliver Lang of SONNENREPUBLIK - a true Design-For-Manufacture veteran - who has been working with us for over a year.\n\nOur next step is to build the tools by mid-2019, get the final assembly line going, install testing equipment and do two more builds for stress testing before beginning production. We are very confident that the hardware will satisfy our high-quality standards. \n\nWhat most certainly will require several rounds of adjustment is the user experience with the FYTA App. We will have user groups with different needs who are probably best served with different App versions \u2013 offices for instance, or kids. However, we would need more resources and time to contextualize and meet all of these needs. \n\nWe are confident that we can manage the above mentioned risks and that we can deliver. We have the right talent and resources in place to meet our deadlines and get the FYTA Beam to you in time. With the help of your feedback, we will adjust and iterate the FYTA App to make sure that it will serve your needs.\n\nOf course, we will be keeping our supporters in the loop and inform you of the progress.

Several parts, such as the soil probes and the casings, can be detached and replaced.\nReusability and recyclability\nMany parts such as the glass casing and the steel probes can be detached and recycelt separately. We intent to minimize the use of plastic for packaging and are planning to maximize the use biodegradable materials.\nSustainable materials\nWe have consciously minimized the use of plastic in the product design of the FYTA Beam and used durable materials such as borosilicate glass and stainless steel.

These varieties were once common in the NYC region and important to its history as an agricultural center but have completely disappeared due to climate change, the industrialization of agriculture and rise of monocultures (growing just a single crop or plant species, increasing the risk it could be completely wiped out by disease).\nThe Open Orchard brings these native varieties back to life as living trees and shares them with the public, giving everyone a chance to see and taste fruits that haven\u2019t existed for hundreds of years, and preserving them for future generations.\nA visible fixture in one of NYC\u2019s most beloved public spaces, The Open Orchard will be a lasting, living portrait of our agricultural past and an urgent reminder of what has been lost. With your help, we can grow an orchard, an artwork and a community \u2014 and literally bring this project to life. \nSam has created trees containing up to 40 different types of fruit in sites across the country. This would be his first orchard, with 50 hybrid trees containing hundreds of different varieties.\nWhy is this important? \nThe Open Orchard goes far beyond being a beautiful (and delicious) resource for NYC. It\u2019s also a gene bank and living archive that works to safeguard biodiversity by preserving hundreds of unique fruit varieties that have otherwise vanished. And this is of critical importance to securing the future of our food supplies and shared environment.\nA century ago, the U.S. had over 3,000 distinct varieties of peaches; now that number is under 100. With this staggering loss of biodiversity, we risk losing entire categories of crops and plants, since monocultures are more susceptible to being wiped out by disease. The Open Orchard will keep disease-free, heirloom varieties alive and in the public realm, so they could one day be reintroduced on a larger scale.\nStarting this summer, you will be able to engage with the project and these pressing issues through a series of public programs, including tree-grafting workshops, fruit tastings, botanical drawing lessons and blossom tours on Governors Island.\nIn these ways, The Open Orchard will serve as a model for how to make our agricultural practices more resilient, sustainable and democratic \u2014 indeed, more open \u2014 a model that could be applied in other places and communities around the globe.\nThe grafted trees will have multiple fruits growing on their branches, preserving hundreds of varieties in just 50 trees.\nHow will the orchard work?\nTo create the orchard, Sam will use an ancient process called \u201cgrafting\u201d to combine branches from different tree species onto a single rootstock. Since the seed of a fruit tree is a genetic variant (not an exact copy), grafting is the only way to preserve a specific species for the future.\nApproximately 200 of these hybrid trees are currently growing in a nursery on Governors Island; with your help, 50 of those trees can be planted as a permanent orchard on the Island. The remaining 150 trees will be given away to community gardens and organizations in all five boroughs, allowing even more communities to engage in the project as it puts down roots across the city. \nArtist's diagram showing the multiple grafts on a single tree\nBaby trees growing in a nursery\nAbout the artist\nSam Van Aken combines new technologies with traditional modes of art-making to create projects that cross boundaries and engage public spaces. His work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, receiving numerous honors including a Joan Mitchell Award, an International Association of Art Critics Award and a Creative Capital Grant. He is currently the Graduate Program Coordinator for the School of Art at Syracuse University. In 2019, his work will be featured in the Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial.\nSam Van Aken\nAbout Governors Island  \nGovernors Island is a 172-acre island in the heart of New York Harbor nestled between Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn waterfront. A former military installation closed to the public for nearly two centuries, the Island has been transformed over the last decade into popular seasonal destination open to the public May 1\u2013October 31. An award-winning new park engineered for climate resilience is complemented by dozens of unique historic buildings, educational and cultural facilities, a rich arts and culture program and a 22-acre National Monument managed by the National Park Service. \nSince opening to the public in 2005, Governors Island has played a unique role in New York City\u2019s cultural landscape, providing a one-of-a-kind platform for artists, cultural organizations and educators to create groundbreaking and experiential programming free and open to the public. Public art commissions have strengthened the Island\u2019s capacity to connect groundbreaking contemporary artworks in an accessible, natural environment to an ever-growing audience. \nGovernors Island at sunset\nWhat will your contribution support? \nYour contributions will go directly toward growing the trees in the nursery and planting them on the Island to create The Open Orchard, as well as their ongoing care. In addition, funds from the campaign and elsewhere will be used to support free, public programming, including grafting workshops, fruit tastings and culinary events.\nEvery spring, the trees will blossom in multiple colors corresponding to their multiple fruit varieties\nWhy Kickstarter? \nTo create an orchard that belongs to everyone, we need to rally together. This is a project that will thrive on the energy of a large and diverse community of invested participants, and we see Kickstarter as a key way to build this community from the ground up. We hope you will join us in helping it grow.\nA plum harvest\nRewards\nCollection of historical recipes ($25)\nReceive a digital collection of historical recipes featuring fruits from The Open Orchard, compiled by the artist and sent straight to your inbox, plus updates on the project as it grows.\nSample historical recipe from the artist's research for The Open Orchard\nHeirloom peach seeds ($50)\nGrow your own peach tree with this packet of heirloom Lovell Peach seeds.

LEDs have become a popular source of light, but making great photographs differs from other usages in 3 key aspects: \nyou want to freeze the movement,\nyou still need huge amount of light in that short time,\nyou want a light with high CRI (color rendering index).\nXenon Flash renders colors with the same accuracy as the sun. LED lights generally render colors with less accuracy, and even the best ones are not good enough for perfect skin tones on your photographs.\nLuminous energy (total amount of light) out of popular LED light vs. LIT Flash if you take a photograph at 1/100s exposure time.\nIn real-life, this means:    \n1500 lumen LED (Lume Cube) vs. LIT Flash, both at full power. iPhone 8 Plus (Wide camera) at 1/100s, ISO 100.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTLDR: ***We are confident. There can always be unexpected challenges when building products and things occasionally happen. The team at LIT has dealt with them in the past and is well-equipped to navigate them if they arise. Should any problems arise that might affect the delivery date, we will communicate quickly and be transparent with you.***\n\n- Technology -\nFor truly innovative products, there is always the question of A: \u201cIs this technically really possible?\u201d and B: \u201cCan this particular team do it?\u201d\n\nA: YES, IT IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE!\nWe decided the best way to address risk A for you but also for ourselves was to put in a lot of work before we ask for your support. Stacked on top of more than 6 months of intensive research is a multitude of experiences from some of the brightest technology minds in electrical and optical design. We made sure that despite our team\u2019s extensive experience in the field of both consumer electronics and optical devices, we left no assumption unchallenged and no alternative unaddressed. By doing that we already overcame some of the major technological hurdles on our roadmap and found optimizations we didn\u2019t foresee at the very conception of LIT Flash. Our investment in in-depth research and testing is paying off. While there is still plenty of work to be done (see roadmap section), that work has a very high level of predictability. \n\nB: YES, WE HAVE WHAT IT TAKES!\nTo address the risk B, we made sure our product team has a track record of successfully shipped and loved KS projects (Lumu light meter 2013, Lumu Power light and color meter 2015). We are committed to under-promising and over-delivering to each-other and to everyone around us. Our R&D and manufacturign partners have already experienced that. And we can\u2019t wait to prove ourselves to you as well. \n \n- USER CENTRIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT -\nAlan Kay once said: \u201cPeople who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\u201d \nAnd we absolutely agree. The essence of a great hardware product is the software that makes it absolutely amazing. We are firm believers in user-centric design and that inevitably means that we are spending numerous hours grooming the software code for the end user\u2019s pleasure. In order to be able to do that, though we first focused on achieving the most important milestones: correct sync and triggering of our flash from the mobile device. Now that we have mostly mitigated that risk, what remains is far more manageable in scope as well as in time.\n \n- MANUFACTURED IN EUROPE -\nOur experiences with past hardware projects have thought us a valuable lesson. That is to appreciate design for mass manufacturing at scale from day one. When you\u2019re developing your innovation it is always tempting to take shortcuts to achieve milestones on hacked-together proofs of concept as soon as humanly possible, but there is a real hidden cost in that when you take your prototype to production. \nManufacturing at scale has its challenges and to mitigate that risk, we decided to design for commercial scale in partnership with potential future manufacturers. We have lined up our supply chain partners from a selection of trusted industry suppliers and because we know how vulnerable the product is in its early manufacturing runs, we decided to keep initial production and assembly in Europe.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "LIT\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nWe are friends, photographers, engineers, researchers, designers, explorers.

The first business-first messaging app is perfect for any business or group leader, from small-scale or colossal, to reach their public in an entirely new, cleaner, less-cluttered way. \ninform8r allows you to set up closed groups of any size to send out messages without using social media, without giving up your personal information or requesting personal info from recipients. \nSimple, clean messaging that doesn\u2019t rob you of your time or your personal information.\nInform8r can help any business or group manager, like\u2026\na small business that wants to inform your customers of a sale\na teacher sending a note to your students (and you don\u2019t want to use social media and aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019ll actually check their email)\nan event organizer keeping your audience up to date\na coach letting his team know about training\na business owner or manager letting staff know about a meeting\na fitness or yoga instructor letting their students know about the next class\na musician telling fans about a forthcoming gig\na food truck announcing 50% off chili dogs from 4-6pm that day\nor, on a bigger scale, a local shopping mall announcing a holiday sale to thousands of customers, or a software company taking preorders for a new video game\nWhy is inform8r the ideal messaging app for businesses?\nminimum data needed to create an account (inform8r doesn\u2019t need your personal data)\nextremely easy to use with multilingual support (10 languages and counting)\nrespect for the anonymity of members\ndiscretion among members guaranteed\nextremely easy to subscribe and share using QR codes  \nno fiddly confirmations whatsoever to subscribe to a group\n100% assurance that everyone receives the messages sent out\nmessage scheduling supported \ntime-sensitive messaging logic (members only see what is relevant to them RIGHT NOW)\nself-cleaning groups, which means no archiving\nonly active/relevant data is shown to your members (if a message was relevant only until yesterday, we don\u2019t show it today)\nno replies to the whole group, only to the sender, which means no clutter\nget instant feedback from your members\nyour group member\u2019s count shows your REAL members only\nGDPR compliant\nno personal data stored\n\nThe Problem for Businesses Messaging\nSocial media scrambles for users\u2019 attention and is dizzying in the amount of info and ads and notices it throws at us. Messages get lost. Email can be good, but most of us get so many emails, that we race through them, and often lose track of the important\u2014or we don\u2019t check our email in time. With inform8r, there\u2019s finally a messaging app that complies with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), because it never asks for personal information. This means that you, and your audience, can feel entirely comfortable using it.\nThe Business Messaging Solution\nYou need to inform your audience. You want to be sure they\u2019ll see the message and give it their full attention. Social media isn\u2019t the answer, nor are emails. inform8r is the better way forward.\n\nThe Problem for Users\n We spend an average of anywhere from 2-9 hours a day on social media. That can mean over 100 days per year! While it can be fun, it can also feel like it's taking over our lives. And yet being a part of it can be necessary.\n  What if there was a way to reach all the people who are important to you? This is crucial for any organizer of events, leaders of groups, business managers and many others--anyone who needs to reach a specific group of people. What if you could do this in a non-invasive way, sending and receiving only the information you absolutely need, without getting caught up in the web of social media? What if you could spend less time staring into your phone and more time embracing life, while still resting assured that you are connected to all the messages that are important to you? Now you can. The answer is inform8r. \n  The Users\u2019 Solution\ninform8r is an entirely new type of messaging app, one that is aimed at organizers, managers, and anyone who has to reach out to a specific group of people to provide them with information. This app never asks for or retains your personal information. It is a pure way to communicate with exactly the people you want to communicate with, with none of the clutter. Clean communication, clean messaging, that's what inform8r is all about.\n    \nA cleaner, more streamlined alternative to messaging apps like Viber, WhatsApp and Messenger\n   With inform8r, there are no group replies and no comments. It is just a clean messaging system. It is more powerful and useful for organizers and managers than other apps, like Viber and WhatsApp. It is quick and easy to make groups of any size, with all members \u201cBCCed,\u201d for privacy and functionality. It is a one-way messaging system in which the manager can send out necessary messages in a clean manner.  This sounds cool, but ...\n  How does it work? Find out here \n The App lets you write and edit your message in a few simple steps, create and segment your audience according to your needs, sort your audience into groups for a more targeted distribution, create one message and distribute it repeatedly, get feedback on your message instantly\u2026\n\n   A group organizer invites members via their emails or MMS by scanning a QR code. The organizer can then send out messages to all group members. Only the organizer (and other group members he can allow to send out messages) can see who is in the group. This guarantees privacy.\n   Group members receive these messages instantly but can only respond directly to the group organizer(like replying to an event). This eliminates the often annoying frequency of messages pinging into your phone when a group of thirty friends keep messaging and everyone in the group receives every message, even if the content is not intended for all. That\u2019s the crucial difference between inform8r and existing messaging apps, which are perfectly good (like Viber, Whatsapp and Messenger) but different and not quite as good at what inform8r can do.\n  A group organizer invites members via their emails or MMS by scanning a QR code. You can share a group\u2019s QR code or group\u2019s content to social media or simply make the group public, so it can be found inside the app.\n Features \nWhat makes inform8r unique?\n \nA word from the inventor \nHi, my name is Kristjan Marin, and I am the founder and inventor of inform8r. A few years ago, I realized that I was spending far too much time on social media. While I still enjoy using it, I felt like it was taking over my life and I was growing too reliant on it, looking at my phone more than I was living life. I wanted to come up with some sort of solution that would provide the benefits of being in touch with the people I need to be in touch with, but that felt less invasive into my engagement with the real world. That's when I came up with inform8r.\nMan has invented languages and media channels to share thoughts and communicate ideas. The world today, however, is cluttered with messages and to find relevant information and be heard is not an easy task. No matter what you do for a living, whether you are an entrepreneur, an artist or a teacher, there is always some relevant audience out there with which you would like to communicate. If you need to say something to one person or are in the same physical location as your audience (at an office, for instance), then there is no problem. But if you are trying to reach hundreds or thousands of people who would like to hear from you, well, that is a completely different story.\n\nEvery significant discovery in human history has been made with a solution to a certain problem in mind. I have many interests and I've used many Social Media platforms \u2014 it\u2019s always frustrating to have to browse through numerous selfies and food pictures when you would just like to see if your favorite brand has something new for you. If I\u2019m a fan of a certain product or service, I want to be spoken to directly and without being forced to jump through hoops for them. And if I have something important to share with my clients, I wouldn\u2019t like to send them messages one by one and waste time that could be spent improving solutions I\u2019m working on with them. And that\u2019s exactly what we are trying to achieve with the inform8r.\n  Why we need your help \nIt\u2019s important to me that inform8r be free of charge. I didn\u2019t design it to make money, but with a genuine desire to help free people from their smartphones, while letting them still feel connected with what\u2019s important. I\u2019ve invested my last four years in this project, with thousands of hours of time and energy, not to mention a whole lot of my own money. I\u2019d like to keep inform8r free, but I need some help to do so. That\u2019s why I\u2019m turning to you, to ask for your support.\n\n Ways inform8r can be used \nImagine that your children's field trip at school will result in pickup delayed by two hours. With a touch of a button, the teacher can let all the parents know and be 100% certain that the messages will be received. Imagine a business manager who needs to communicate with all the people in his department, quickly and with certainty. How about a soccer team\u2019s coach who needs to cancel practice and wants to get the message out to all 25 team members? Or on a bigger scale, imagine a marketing department manager for a multinational company who wants to send a promotional message or coupon to several thousand interested clients, but wants to do so in a discreet way that will not get lost in the tidal wave of information that overwhelms us in social media apps? \n\ninform8r is perfect for sending out instant messages to groups that you are organizing. It\u2019s great for\n small businesses who wish to inform their customers\n  teachers who wish to inform parents of their students\n  coaches who wish to inform their team members\n  event organizers who wish to inform their audiences\n  marketing directors or publicists who wish to inform the media or customers\nbusiness centers who wish to inform their clients or tenants\nfitness instructors who wish to inform their participants\nbusiness owners and CEOS who wish to inform their staff\nchefs who wish to place orders on produce and ingredients\nfood trucks which wish to inform fans of a 2-for-1 deal on hot dogs\nand so much more! \n inform8r can do all this and more, more cleanly, efficiently, privately and easily than existing messaging apps.\n   Wait, this is so cool, why is it free? It\u2019s important to the inventor, Kristjan, that inform8r is free to all. But in order to make it free and keep it free, we need a little help from you.\n  See how all began in 2014 ...\nTech Specs \ninform8r is already available in a beta version on AppStore & Google Play and has been thoroughly tested for both Android and Apple smartphones. A desktop version, geared towards mass messaging for businesses and marketing, is a future goal. The app works beautifully, so we\u2019re about 90% there, nearly ready for prime-time!\n  We Need Your Help\nWe\u2019re 90% there, but we need a little help to make inform8r a reality that\u2026and this is the most important part\u2026will be free for everyone. At the moment, we put so much time and personal finance into developing the app, that we would need to charge for it in order to climb out of the red and to get our credit cards out of hock.\n\n   We need a bit of capital to get back into the black and that will allow us to make inform8r free for all. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking for your help.\n \nWhat Do You Get \nIn exchange for backing a worthy project, you get to be the first in the world with this amazing app. You will also get additional benefits that will never be available after the Kickstarter campaign.\n \nPlanned timeline \nCase study\nIn order to test how inform8r works in practice, we prepared a case study in Maribor, the second-largest city in Slovenia (population around 100,000). Inform8r is at its best when a concentration of people and businesses put this new, free group messaging app to work. \n    The case study included a large percentage of Maribor\u2019s population, including:\n FC Maribor (football club with 20,000 fans)\n BMW Selmar (with 10,000 customers)\n The Pohorje Region Tourist board, which welcomes more than 180,000 tourists per year\n Cultural centre Narodni dom Maribor (over 2220 events & 380.000 visitors per year)\nTwo major political groups have showen interest(with more then 30,000 members)\n  In addition to this large constituency, other groups included:\n Gurmanski hram (a catering company which feeds students from 5 high schools, with minimum of 1500 meals per day)\n Jack & Joe Steak House (with hundreds of customers)\n INSA - A local real estate agency \n TopPower STUDIO - a local fitness studio (with hundreds of members)\nAfter using inform8r regularly for more than a month, the verdict was in: it is a better way forward, a cleaner way to send messages out and a preferable way of receiving them. The recipients focused more attention on each message, whether it was from the local football team announcing a rally or discount on tickets, or a yoga teacher letting her group know that the session would begin a half hour later that day), since it is not coming in the midst of a tidal wave of other things, as messages and ads do on social media).\n\nThe users were pleased that the app does not require or use any personal information, so there were no privacy concerns (which can be a big problem with social media). It\u2019s ideal in this world of GDPR and when one\u2019s goal is to spend less time looking at a screen, but to feel secure that you\u2019re not missing anything important.\n\nInform8r really works and has already won over a city of over 100,000 people. It\u2019s a cleaner, better way to send and receive messages, without personal information, and without social media. How can it change your world for the better?\nOur team  \n \nIn Conclusion \nYou want to receive only the information you want to receive. Sounds so obvious as to not be worth mentioning, right? Well, just about every means of communication, from social media to mailing lists, wants to harvest as much information about you, personal information, as they can. They want to sell this information so other people can reach you, people or companies you didn\u2019t actually sign up to hear from, or to send you whatever they want to send you, most of which you don\u2019t want to receive. Digital life can feel cluttered, clogging up your thoughts, bombarding your senses. inform8r lets you take back control.\n  Get the information you want without giving away your personal data, and with zero risk of receiving data or ads or messages you didn\u2019t sign up for. Clean communication, just the way you want it.\n\nThank you so much for your time, attention and support. As we say in Slovenia: Hvala (aka \u201cThank you!\u201d)\nMore info : https://www.inform8r.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/inform8r\n \nSneak peak: inform8r PRO \n We know what you\u2019re thinking. inform8r sounds great, but I\u2019ve got a portfolio with hundreds of clients, or multiple groups to manage (like several sports teams or a dozen classes at an elementary school) and doing it all on a phone sounds tricky. Not to worry, we\u2019ve got plans to keep you covered. inform8r PRO will be the next step for power users who either plan to use inform8r for business, such as marketing promotions, or for larger-scale messaging, for example a football league manager who needs to contact referees and teams, or headmaster of a school, who needs to contact many classes.\n\ninform8r PRO, available in a desktop version, will facilitate larger-scale messaging in many ways.\n manage multiple groups easily and smoothly -post a single message to multiple groups at once with our \u201cwrite-once post-to-many\u201d technology\nspread out your working area on your desktop, to drag and drop and import data files with contacts easily\nunlimited number of groups created (the phone version supports 5 at a time)\npurchase internal app advertising targeting specific group types\nuse GPS location technology to advertise content within the app\nequip your groups with \u201cBeacon\u201d technology for in-house or external use (special group only in PRO)\nsupport multilingual messaging, so you write a message in one language and it will be sent to your group members in their preferred language \n  All this and more in inform8r PRO.

An ergonomic armrest that combines the best of ergonomics with world-class engineering and beautiful design.\nMouzen is designed to optimize the position of your arm and reduce wrist and shoulder tension while working with your mouse and keyboard.  \nPLAY\n\nWith its ErgoFlow\u2122  mechanism, it allows you to move freely and comfortably in all directions, supporting your arm in a natural state and forcing you to maintain an upright posture.\nMouzen's features create a healthier, stress- and tension-free working and gaming environment. Come out of your workflow cool, calm and collected.\nWe spend most of our days working on computers. And while the technology has gone a long way since the early days, the mechanics of how we use the mouse and keyboard hasn\u2019t changed that much. Only now are we learning how long-term usage and continuous repetitions can be associated with various computer-related disorders and injuries later in life.\nMouzen is on a mission to combine the best of ergonomic products that help you be more healthy and productive at work. More than 1000+ development hours and seven prototypes later, we\u2019re finally ready to launch our revolutionary ergonomic armrest.\nWhile most armrests require a 10-page manual to install and use, Mouzen is a simple and intuitive product that\u2019s super easy to install. With an innovative single-mechanism lock clamp, Mouzen is ready to use in just 6 seconds. \nPLAY\n\nIt works great on almost all surfaces and is suitable for desks of thickness 0.2\u2033 (0.5 cm) \u2013 2.1\u2033 (5.5 cm). Every Mouzen comes with a hex key that will allow you to lock it securely on your desk.\nThanks to the innovative ErgoFlow\u2122 mechanism, Mouzen can hold up to 50 lbs (21 kg) of load, without losing any movement properties. The mechanism has multiple shock absorbers and silencers built in, making it the most smooth and silent ergonomic armrest on the market. \nPLAY\n\n\nBig thanks to SoldierKnowsBest for taking the time and reviewing our Mouzen armrest in action!\n\nWe're on track!  \nMouzen was founded by Gasper Kumprej, a serial entrepreneur and innovator, who first-handedly experienced the problem of using a mouse all day long. Gasper started working with his father Roberth and engineering professor Jure Krof to find the best theoretic solution to the problem. Matej Lorenci joined the team as the materials and injection molding specialist, also providing production capacities with his company Plastika LVP.\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since the first idea of the product. And we\u2019ve made some great progress, working with some of the brightest people in this field.\nEvolution of Mouzen\nFirst wooden version\nBenjamin Koren's final design\nWith a functional prototype, we want to bring Mouzen to mass production, being capable of producing many units, with the same level of quality. This requires important investment, to create molds, prepare assembly and secure materials which usually have large MOQ (Minimum Order Quantities).\nBut more than that, helping us get Kickstarter funding is sharing our vision and aligning with our mission. We want to raise awareness about computer-related injuries and how to effectively prevent them. The armrest is just the first chapter of a much bigger story in the making.\nThank you for your support!\nGasper and the team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're on a mission to eliminate the risk of computer-related injuries. Other than that, there's little risk involved with this project.\n\nThe Mouzen idea and product have been in the making for the last 3 years, with 100+ beta testers and numerous supporters from the local community. The team behind Mouzen has significant industry track record, ranging from ergonomics to in-house plastics production (Plastika LVP), and also includes complete production capabilities for all future Mouzen units.\n\nAs the company is being successfully bootstrapped by the founders from day one, most of the Kickstarter budget will go into a new industrial solution for plastic injection that will lower the production cost and allow us to produce more than one unit per hour.\n\nProduction time will be our biggest challenge, but our first backers will probably get them even before October, maybe even as early as August.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "You're awesome!", "descp": "A HUGE THANK YOU for helping us on our mission in combining the best of ergonomics with beautiful design!

Freedom from limited data plans.\nThis is Cubbit: the next evolution of data storage.\nCubbit is the distributed cloud.\nLike Dropbox, iCloud and other conventional cloud storage services, Cubbit lets you access and share your data from anywhere in the world, with a finely-crafted user experience and the features you\u2019re familiar with. \nBut unlike \u201cthe cloud\u201d, Cubbit is not based on any centralized data center. This allows for an unprecedented set of advantages for the user, such as:\nno monthly fee: it\u2019s free for a lifetime \nit is expandable up to 4TB just by plugging in any USB hard drive for free \nit is zero-knowledge and end-to-end encrypted so that no one can access your data\nit is 10x greener than conventional clouds based on data centers\nCubbit is not a NAS either. Unlike any NAS / personal cloud device:\nyou get smooth and blazing-fast remote access from anywhere in the world, regardless of your home connection \nyour data are always available and safe, whatever happens to your device \nit is truly user-friendly \nCubbit is already up and running in beta in more than 10 countries and now ready to launch worldwide - together.\nCubbit is a breakthrough: the privacy of personal storage and the comfort of the cloud, all wrapped into a smooth user experience.\nThis is made possible by its revolutionary distributed architecture, that connects the users to each other to form a collaborative network where the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Like bees in a swarm.\n The node of this network is the Cubbit Cell.\nCubbit grants a unique set of features that go beyond the cloud, the hard drive, the NAS and anything in between.  \nThe Cell is a plug-and-cloud device. Connect the Cubbit Cell to your router and immediately get 1TB of cloud space. \nNeed more cloud space? Just plug in any USB hard drive and turn it into cloud. For every 2GB of physical storage you provide, you get 1GB on your account, up to 4 TB of cloud space. And, guess what, this is also for free.\nNeed even more? You can connect more than one Cubbit Cell to the same account: the sky is the limit.\nIt is not about trust, it\u2019s about math.\nThanks to Cubbit\u2019s cryptographic architecture, it is mathematically impossible for us and anyone else to look into your stuff.\nYour data is protected by AES-256 encryption, a military-grade protocol used by the US government to protect top secret files. The encryption key is generated client-side and never known to us or anyone else. All transfers are performed through end-to-end encrypted channels. \nPLAY\n\nWe are crafting Cubbit to make your experience magical and personal. Everything is carefully chosen. Every interaction is natural and clear. \nFrom Cell shape to the user interface, we have handpicked each and any feature to build a vision of beauty and simplicity. \nAs smooth as it should be.\nRemember those times when you tried to share a folder, but your mum/wife/husband/friend was running out of cloud space? Even a few gigabytes could get in the way.\nBut not anymore. With the Cell you get up to 4 independent cloud accounts, each with its own files and folders for you and your loved ones. \nAssign each one of them how much cloud space you want, and keep everything easily under control, all in one place.\nThe Cubbit Cell is not waterproof: your data is. \nHow many times have you lost months - years? - of work and memories because you relied on short-lived physical disks? \nThis is simply impossible with the Cubbit Cell.\nWhatever happens to your Cell - a disconnection, a blackout - your data are always perfectly safe, accessible anywhere.\nYour data are not inside your Cell: they are everywhere, spread over the swarm of Cubbit Cells.  \nDistribution matters: you always download from Cubbit at ludicrous speed, thanks to multiple, parallel, peer-to-peer connections. Unlike with a \u201cpersonal cloud device\u201d or a NAS, you are not limited by your domestic upload bandwidth when you are away from home. \nWhat\u2019s more, the location of the user\u2019s data can be optimized to be in his or her geographical proximity, which ensures the maximum transfer speed. Data centers cannot be close to everyone, Cubbit can.\nThis is what it feels like to have a swarm by your side.\nUploading large files to the cloud has always meant long, boring waits for the transfer to complete.\nNow, those days are over. \nIf you are connected to the same local network of a Cell - yours or someone else's - the upload is near-instantaneous, since the Cell itself will take care of syncing the files to the cloud. \nStop waiting for the transfer to complete: you are pure lightning. \n\nYou know that old HDD lying there in your closet that you haven't used in a while? Back Cubbit and recycle it into cloud space. \nSo you would like a Dropbox-like service but you don\u2019t want to pay every single month for the rest of your life? Back Cubbit and get the all-you-can cloud, for $0 a month. \nCubbit is the only place online where to store all your photos and videos in high resolution for free. Back Cubbit, get the quality you deserve.\nHave you ever lost or broken your hard disk? Would you trust your memories to such an unreliable support? Back Cubbit and never lose your data again.\nAre you a professional who deals with sensitive data, such as a doctor, a lawyer, a consultant and thus can\u2019t save them on the cloud? Keep calm: on Cubbit, you can.\nToday, the internet runs on server farms - giant, polluting, centralized square miles of always-on computers, guarding (and milking) everyone\u2019s data.\nThis has profound consequences: increasing data breaches, damage to the environment, unscalability of the infrastructure, and privacy on its last legs.\nWe have designed Cubbit to tackle these issues. \nThat\u2019s why Cubbit is distributed. Distribution makes the impossible possible. By joining our forces we can fix the cloud, and by fixing the cloud we can fix the internet.\nThis is how.\nOn the top of the distributed network runs an Artificial Intelligence, i.e., a suite of machine learning algorithms that, like an orchestra conductor, optimizes the network making it increasingly faster and more efficient with time. \nThe intelligence of the coordinator combined with the power of distribution is what makes Cubbit one of a kind: the first that provides top performances at extremely low operating costs, allowing for the first cloud service that is free of charge for the final user.\nWhen you upload a file to your Cubbit Cell, it gets encrypted with AES-256, split into dozens of chunks, each one distributed in multiple copies across the network of Cubbit Cells via end-to-end encrypted channels.\nWhen you remote-access your file on Cubbit, what you are actually doing is asking the AI coordinator where your chunks are. As soon as you receive this information, you connect to the corresponding Cells through peer-to-peer end-to-end encrypted channels. Then you download the chunks, reassemble the file and decrypt it with the key that is retrievable to you and you alone.\nThe beauty is that the AI coordinator is cryptographically blind: during the whole process, the coordinator never gets to know neither the content of the file nor the encryption key. This is our zero-knowledge cryptographic architecture. \nThe files you save on Cubbit are not simply spread over the network in encrypted form. If that were the case, your data would be lost as soon as one of the Cubbit Cells storing your chunks goes offline! \nCubbit makes this impossible to happen by implementing a redundancy procedure based on Reed Solomon error-correcting codes: each encrypted file is split into 24 pieces, and then processed into 36 redundancy shards. Out of the 36 shards, only 24 of them are necessary to retrieve the original encrypted file. \nOk, but\u2026 which shards? Here comes the magic: any 24 of the 36 redundant shards. This is the marvel of the Cubbit\u2019s redundancy protocol. \nIn typical operating conditions, this procedure alone ensures a statistical persistency of ~ 99.9999%. In other words, the probability of data loss is smaller than one in a million. \nMoreover, the AI monitors the uptime status of each Cell and triggers a recovery procedure when the total number of online shards reaches a threshold of 30/36, virtually achieving 100% persistency. \nBottom line: data saved on Cubbit cannot be lost.\nCan you imagine what would happen if every minor edit on Wikipedia needed a referendum to be approved? \nIn a sense, that\u2019s how blockchain works: a constant referendum where everyone has a say. In theory, it is awesome; in practice, for complex applications such as cloud storage, it does not work.\nA cloud worth its name must be able to work under tight time constraints, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t entrust authorizations and metadata to a decentralized system but rather to the AI coordinator, so that these lightweight operations are performed efficiently in milliseconds in order to ensure the smoothest user experience and the highest security and privacy at the same time.  \nThe cloud of today is an environmental disaster. \nThe whole Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) ecosystem (i.e., the internet infrastructure) accounts for 10% of the world energy consumption, about 1500 Terawatt hour per year. Just to give you a range of comparison, this is equal to the total energy demand of Germany and Japan combined. \nData centers contribute substantially to the internet\u2019s carbon footprint, producing alone more than 110 million tons of CO2 every year.\nCubbit tackles this issue by addressing the two main root causes of the cloud\u2019s environmental impact:\n Storage consumption: keeping the data remotely accessible on the cloud needs a constantly-operating and cooled-down infrastructure of storage racks.\n Transfer consumption: similarly, transferring data over long distances heavily increases the data traffic on the internet relay nodes, requiring additional energy to operate the routing infrastructure.\nCubbit makes these problems obsolete.\nFirst, with Cubbit there is no data center to be cooled down. Actually, there is no data center at all. Cooling energy already accounts for 50% of the storage energy consumption in data centers.\nSecond, the Cubbit Cell features a low-consumption ARM processor, characterized by an extremely high energy efficiency. Because of their efficiency, ARM processors are, in fact, standard in mobile devices. \nThird, the coordinator can optimize the distribution of a file\u2019s chunk to be in the proximity of its owner. Data centers cannot be close to every user, but Cubbit can: by optimizing the location of the users\u2019 data for geographical proximity, it reduces the energy consumption of data transfers while, at the same time, maximizing the transfer speed. \nThe implications are tangible already on a small scale.\nFor each 10 TB saved on Cubbit, 1 ton of CO2 is saved every year. Now consider that, in the US alone, there are about 350 million TB of data held in data centers. \nThe Cubbit of today is the first step towards the Cubbit of tomorrow. \nOur distributed cloud storage is just the beginning. We have many major steps in our future roadmap, such as:\nDistributed Web Hosting\nDistributed Virtual Private Network\nDistributed Content Delivery Network\nDistributed Cloud/Edge Computing\nToday, the internet is inefficient: it is not able to scale in proportion to the staggering rise in demand. Every service we were used to accessing locally - music, photos, movies - is now on the internet. At the current state of the art, this is not sustainable. If we keep going down the path of the centralized infrastructure, we will damage the environment irreparably. What\u2019s more, this infrastructure is not compatible with privacy and security at scale, since it relies on single point of failures. These limits seem insurmountable today, but are not set in stone. Here's where Cubbit steps in. Our vision is to overcome the limits of the centralized infrastructure of the internet.\nThis is Cubbit. \nTogether, we can change the cloud, and by doing so, shape the new internet.\nCubbit R&D has a long story. Check out our timeline - and let's get further together. \n\n\nThis project is supported by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\nSafety is in numbers. Save anything, fear nothing. Join the Swarm!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCubbit\u2019s software is already up and running in beta in more than 10 countries around the world. Hundreds of beta testers already use our web application daily to store and share their files in perfect safety.\n\nEverything is already in place to launch the production of Cubbit Cells. Our California-based industrial partner has a long history of hardware manufacturing and the joint prototyping started several months ago, in July 2018. The main issues, such as logistics and packaging, have already been solved. \n\nCubbit has been presented in several scientific and technological conferences gathering enthusiasm and approval from the scientific community. In 2018, Cubbit partnered with the CERN and other 11 industrial/academic partners for an EU-wide project aimed at renovating the cloud infrastructure for science.\n\nOur team is rock-solid and laser-focused. We are in the final process of the development but we\u2019d love to hear your suggestions as regards new features to make Cubbit even better, provided they do not dramatically affect our roadmap.\n\nCubbit is supported by Techstars, the third most important startup accelerator in the world, and other global-class partners.

It presents the culinary tradition of a nation and the legacy of my family. This book will be packed with treasured recipes that have been in my family for generations. \nInside, you\u2019ll find more than 100 recipes and tips for cooking traditional Slovenian food, and much more.\nFood has always played an important role in my family and I\u2019m continuing that legacy. I learned how to cook the old-fashioned way, by watching my mom and grandma in the kitchen and helping my dad and granddad to prepare, cure, grill and roast meats. They passed on to me the passion and enthusiasm for food and Slovenian cuisine.\nMy story started four years ago, when I launched Cook Eat Slovenia.\nMy dream was to present traditional Slovenian food to travelers through my cooking classes in Ljubljana, serving them up an experience they would treasure for a lifetime. They cook with me, a local girl who teaches them how to prepare food we eat at home, for everyday or festive occasions. Over the years, I\u2019ve hosted hundreds of happy foodies from around the world who have attended my cooking classes.\nNow my dream is to bring traditional Slovenian recipes to the world and to help the world discover Slovenian food. With my first cookbook, everyone will be able to bring Slovenian recipes home.\nCook Eat Slovenia, the cookbook, is divided into recipes based on the four seasons. Each recipe tells a story and illuminates our cooking philosophy, our fresh and local ingredients and the family stories behind the dishes. \nI believe that food connects people and sharing these culinary traditions with you is my dream. I\u2019ve been passionate about food and cooking since I was little. I want to pass on the legacy of my family, traditional Slovenian recipes that have been in my family for generations. \nMost of the recipes have never been written down, just kept in the head, till now. I want to bring back the romance of old traditions with some almost-forgotten recipes and most recognized Slovenian dishes. Amazing, diverse and simple traditional Slovenian recipes that I know you\u2019ll love.\nThe recipes are just one part of it. It\u2019s really about a love for food, for cooking, for eating, which is at the heart (and the stomach) of family life. \nThis cookbook will present my beautiful country\u2019s unique culinary heritage, as shown through a collection of delicious recipes, the food I\u2019ve eaten since I was a little girl. \nI would love to bring traditional Slovenian cuisine to your table, so you can cook and eat with your family and friends and discover Slovenian culture through food.\nSlovenian food is easy to like\u2014love at first bite! Now\u2019s your chance to cook it at home.\nWHY SELF-PUBLISHING\nThe dream of making a cookbook grew in me since I started my cooking workshops. But I want to make sure that the cookbook is just what I want it to be. This is why I prefer to publish it myself, rather than go with a traditional publisher. But that is why I\u2019m here\u2014I need your help to make it happen!\nThere are a lot of components to a great, professional-level book, and since I want to \u201ccook up\u201d this cookbook myself, I\u2019ll have to organize it all. I\u2019m happy to give my time and knowledge with big support of my family. With professional food photographer I\u2019ve taken what I hope you\u2019ll agree beautiful photos of the dishes, styled by me and my mother, Branka. I enjoyed in all the preparation of the cookbook and collecting the traditional pots to show you also this part of Slovenian tradition.\nWHY I NEED YOUR HELP\nAfter one year of cooking and taking photos of the dishes the biggest cost for me present printing. So naturally, we\u2019ve gone the Kickstarter route to raise the funds necessary and put together some very cool rewards for early supporters. Your support will cover the cost of printing for 500 cookbooks, all the other costs (production, photography, ingredients, translation, editing, design and layout) I cover by myself.\nABOUT SLOVENIA\nYou\u2019ve heard of Slovenia, which has been called the most beautiful country on the planet. \nSlovenia is nestled between Italy, Austria, Croatia and Hungary. It is the only country in Europe that combines the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pannonian Plain and the Karst limestone plains. Within a tiny square mileage truly lies a hidden gem for foodies, with 24 culinary regions in which, over the centuries, culinary influences have merged with local tastes to form a unique, diverse and distinct Slovenian cuisine.\nThis will be more than just a cookbook that brings traditional Slovenian dishes and stories to your kitchens. It will be also your travel guide to an amazing culinary destination, my beautiful little country of Slovenia.\n\nKITCHEN APRON\nSHOPPING BAG\nYOUR SUPPORT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME\nWith your support, this cookbook will come to life.

From your favorite movie characters to bots that bolster STEAM skills, we\u2019ve delivered... to critical and commercial success. \nOur latest robot is no exception.\n RVR is our all-terrain, high torque robot \u2013 it\u2019s drivable and programmable right out of the box, packed with a diverse suite of sensors and built upon our tried and true Sphero Edu app. \n Precise and accurate driving \u2013 Goes where you want it to go \nClimb higher, drive faster\nDrive RVR just about anywhere\nRVR is more than just a fun, programmable robot \u2013 it\u2019s also highly customizable. We\u2019ve added some incredible features that open up a world of possibilities for hackers, educators, students, technical hobbyists and anyone else ready to take it to the next level. With our universal expansion port and onboard power, you can attach and run third-party hardware like a Raspberry Pi, BBC micro:bit, or Arduino. \nThink of RVR as the ultimate mobile canvas for your creativity. \nA platform for hackers, educators, and mad scientists alike \nFor students, researchers, and engineers of all skill levels\nA lot. The only limit is your imagination (and physics). RVR combines the Sphero Edu app, an onboard sensor suite, and our highly sophisticated control system with a truly hackable platform. From beginners to elite hackers and everyone in between, you\u2019ll have the ability to do things you never thought possible. \nWant RVR to be your home security sentry? A roving environmental sensor you can control over the internet? How about a souped-up battle bot? An autonomous metal detector or perhaps a personalized mobile voice assistant? Chances are, if you can hack it, RVR can do it.\nRVR's control system sets it above and beyond your everyday, off-the-shelf build-a-bot or DIY tank. This is a professional-level control system at an entry-level price, because navigating with accuracy is crucial if you plan to do advanced programming or problem solving in robotics. \nMeet RVR\u2019s Vector-based Control System. Unique to RVR is our highly tuned, vector-based, closed-loop control system. RVR uses high-resolution encoders and an onboard 9-axis IMU with proprietary algorithms to drive, correct, and navigate based on heading and relative position. Driving straight sounds simple enough, but it takes some serious science and complex tech to drive perfectly straight, arc, and stop with scalpel-like accuracy. \nMost other programmable vehicles and build-a-bot platforms have no control system at all. That means the wheels rotate based on how much raw power you send the motors, so driving to a predetermined, specific location is out of the question. \nRVR\u2019s control system, on the other hand, is expertly engineered so that obstacles, disruptions, and uneven surfaces won\u2019t affect your driving experience. \nSimply put, we made the RVR control system the best on the market so you can focus on the fun stuff.\nPLAY\n\n We hosted a hackathon at the Sphero office on Pi day (March 14th) and flew out 6 lucky backers to get first hand experience with RVR.  They had a lot of great things to say after spending a day with RVR.\nBecause you have lots of great ideas and we're good listeners. Here are just a few of the feature requests we've received over the years:\nAmong other things, you wanted a robot that conquers all kinds of surfaces, recognizes faces, has an onboard camera, responds to voice commands, maps the environment, streams music, plays laser tag, carries groceries, and flings potatoes into the stratosphere, so we delivered ... in a way.\nWe built a robot that YOU could program, hack, and customize, as opposed to one that\u2019s already tricked out for you. \nPlus, RVR furthers our mission to engage more students and teachers through hands-on, fun technology that leverages the power of play.\nEvery millimeter of RVR has been carefully considered and perfectly tuned \u2013 every spec of every component, the control system, the weight, the center of gravity, the clearance, wheel size, gear ratio, power delivery, industrial design, the color, the lights, the treads. Why? Because we're perfectionists and we thought everyone else was doing it wrong.\nIf you were to buy each component separately, it would cost significantly more to build a robot like RVR \u2013 not to mention the time it would take to assemble everything and write all the software, firmware and algorithms. With RVR, we\u2019ve done all the hard work so you can hit the ground running and build something great. \nAlthough RVR comes fully assembled, we thought you might want to see all the parts that make up RVR.\nOne of our primary goals with RVR was to make it accessible to kids and adults of all ages and skill levels. So if you\u2019re an RC enthusiast, an amateur hacker, or just coding-curious, RVR is designed for you, too.\nUse the in-app joystick to drive RVR around just like any other Sphero robot. You can also adjust the speed or customize RVR\u2019s LEDs with a couple taps. \nWhen you\u2019re ready to start coding, the Sphero Edu app makes it easy and fun: start out with Draw and Drive, move up to block programming, and when you\u2019re ready for the next level start coding in Javascript. We like to call the progression Draw > Blocks > Text.\nCustomize and program with our Sphero Edu app\nThe Sphero Edu app is simple and intuitive. Our block canvas, based on Scratch, is a great introduction to coding for both kids and adults. For more advanced users, the JavaScript that powers the blocks can be coded directly. \nStill want to go deeper? Sphero will provide SDKs, code samples and other resources for popular platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and BBC micro:bit at launch with more to follow! \nSphero Edu is available now on Amazon Appstore, Google Play, Chrome Web Store, Mac App Store and Microsoft Store. Take a look for yourself and see all the cool things the community is already sharing.\nSphero Edu is a community of educators, programmers, hackers, students, technical hobbyists, engineers and DIYers. With RVR, you'll have the opportunity to join this thriving community and take on new challenges, solve problems, show off your creativity, and connect with like-minded people. \nThe Sphero Edu app and Sphero robots are already being used all over the world, in and out of classrooms, in ways we never imagined. Robots and programming combine to teach skills like teamwork, communication and problem solving, as well as disciplines like art, math, physics, history, and storytelling. We believe RVR will continue this trend and open up even more possibilities for people to learn, create, and explore.\nOn March 14, 2019 (Pi Day) we flew 6 lucky backers out to our office in Boulder, CO in the middle of a blizzard, and live-streamed the entire event.  These backers were some of the first people to get their hands on RVR before the campaign ended.  Check out the videos below to see what they had to say about RVR. \nRVR is packed with sensors and technology that make it easy to use out of the box, but it's also highly expandable and sophisticated for the most advanced users. The sensors send data to our Sphero Edu app and allow for things like color recognition, robot-to-robot communication, light intensity detection, and relative location.\nThe RVR expansion port allows you to connect additional hardware like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and BBC micro:bit, and send and receive data over UART and USB. And everything is built on our top of the line control system. \nWhat does all this mean? It means you\u2019re the artist and RVR is your big, beautiful, blank, programmable canvas.\nDesign\nSleek, compact design\nInterchangeable tops\nTransparent chassis\nApproachable form factor\nNeutral design adaptable to a multitude of use cases\nSensors\nAmbient light sensor\nRGB sensor w/ normalizing LED and focus lens\nFull 9-axis IMU - accelerometer, gyro, magnetometer\n10 individually addressable RGB LEDs\nIR sensors\nHigh-resolution 20-pole magnetic encoders\nDurability\nHypergrip all-terrain treads\nHigh 20mm clearance\nWide stance for stability on steep angles and rough surfaces\nBalanced center of gravity for razor sharp agility\nHigh gear ratio w/ incredible speed to accuracy ratio\nHigh-precision involute gears with vibration and noise dampening\nRugged, steel-reinforced axles\nHigh-power, compact motors with enough torque to climb a wall\nCapable of carrying 2 lbs and potentially a lot more!

Just connect the Universal Expansion Port to the UART pins on the Raspberry Pi, pull down the SDK from Github, add a few lines of code to your project and you\u2019ll be keeping tabs on your tabby in no time.\nAre SDKs, Linux and maker hardware too mainstream for you? Do you want to get your souped-up potato communicating with the RVR hardware? A published low-level communication API will also be provided, allowing anyone to implement communication to the robot over UART or Bluetooth LE on any platform.\nSo, what exactly is a 'universal expansion port'? RVR includes a 4-pin UART connection that you can use to attach third-party hardware and customize RVR in whatever way you see fit. We also threw in an onboard 5V 2.1A USB (data and power) so you can power all your projects. With our SDK, you\u2019ll be talking all kinds of API talk to our internal processors.\nJust imagine the kinds of projects you could build on top of RVR: \nDrive a WiFi camera over the web\nBuild a mobile bubble-blower bot\nInteract with the environment using a Swift robotic arm\nControl RVR from anywhere in the world over Iridium satComm satellites using websockets\nLaunch and retrieve foam darts\nCollect volcanic rock samples\nGather wind measurements and stream the data to your mobile device\nUse openCV to autonomously identify and spray invasive plant species\nAttach a bluetooth speaker and have RVR follow you while playing the soothing sounds of polka \nDeliver a cake to your favorite cat\nOr just about anything else you can dream up!  \nWe\u2019ve learned a LOT about color sensing since acquiring Specdrums last year, and we\u2019re transferring this knowledge and refinement to RVR. Thanks to a downward-facing color sensor, RVR can recognize and react to color values. This means you can write code that reacts to the color the robot is driving over. For example, you could create a wide color border and program your own edge-detection; you could program custom movements or change LED colors based on detected color values; or plaster the floor with colored construction paper and then program RVR to trigger different sounds in the app as it drives over them\u2026 do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do!! \nIn short, there are a ton of fun, creative possibilities with color sensing and robotics. We can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll do with it! \nAdding an IR sensor to RVR opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Onboard infrared sensors provide 360-degree sensing and allow for bot-to-bot communication, robot follow and robot evade. Imagine a troop of BOLTs chasing a RVR through an obstacle course, a covert ops capture the flag game, robot laser tag, or swarm programming with choreography and lights. \nRVR is fast! Prototypes have been clocking in around 2 meters per second. And with enough torque to climb the steepest hills, you'll swear RVR is more mountain goat than robot. \nLike a house cat, we can't resist shiny lights. That\u2019s why we added LEDs to all four sides of RVR. LEDs are a great way to communicate and add personality to your robot. Shine the front and rear LEDs while exploring a haunted house or program your RVR to flash red when an intruder enters your fort. Those are just two ideas, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll come up with more.\nThe LEDs also serve as battery level indicators, so they\u2019re not just fun and shiny \u2013 they\u2019re useful, too. Brilliant!\nRVR\u2019s ambient light sensor provides awareness of light intensity, measured in lux. You can use this to write conditions in the Sphero Edu app where RVR behaves differently based on light. For example, you could program RVR to rock out when the lights turn off; or program RVR to scatter like a cockroach when the lights turn on.\nRVR includes a rechargeable, removable, high-capacity battery with dual functionality: it powers the motors with a 7.4V output while providing the universal expansion port with a 5V 2.1A USB-A output to help power cameras, robotic arms, air horns or anything else that needs juice.  \nPlaytime will obviously vary depending on how power thirsty your third-party project is. But on its own, RVR should last up to 2 hours per charge. \nHate suffering through an excruciatingly long setup process? Not everyone wants a project to build. That\u2019s why we designed RVR so you can drive it, customize it, and program it right out of the box. This way, you can get to the fun stuff right away!\n1 RVR\n1 Cover plate\n1 Roll Cage Shell\n1 Mounting plate for third-party development\n1 USB-A to USB-C Cable\nQuick Start Guide\nColor Cards \nAs an extra thank you to all our backers, we wanted to throw in some bonus items along with your RVR as we hit certain milestones. These are included in addition to the standard parts that come with the RVR.\nTo keep things simple, we are offering RVR at $199 during the KickStarter campaign, a discount of $50 off the MSRP (Limit 5000).

More recently, we\u2019ve been focusing on the lasting impact that Sphero products have on our users. After releasing SPRK+ in 2016, it gave way to Sphero Edu, where our efforts in education have continued to grow. We firmly believe that play is a powerful teacher, and as long as we're sparking imaginations around the world, we\u2019ll keep fueling that fire. \nRVR units should ship to customers in October 2019. As the date gets closer, we will keep backers updated with more exact ship dates. If your tier includes additional Sphero product(s), those products will ship in April (US customers only). If you are an international customer, all items in your tier will ship together in October.\nShipping Costs:\nUnited States - FREE (all tiers)\nInternational - Flat fee (varies based on tier)\nTaxes and Duties\nThe shipping fee paid in the checkout process is for the transportation of your purchase from our warehouse to your destination address. \nEU: EU customers will not be responsible for import duties and/or taxes.\nRest of World: If your country charges import duties, taxes, or VAT, you will be responsible for these upon delivery.

Once the \"Free MINI\" came, as part of my backing (thank you!), I downloaded the SpheroEDU app for my MBP & created a whole Universe program for my son to hear and see happen. He loved it, we play it similar to \"Simon Says\". I had mentioned that the RVR would not arrive until October. I started a new job two months ago and the coding fell off for the most part. I have not coded or mentioned the RVR this whole time. I started using Xcode 11.0 (once the download completed just now) and my son sees what I am doing. He was playing with his colored Alphabet letters & sees my computer screen and asks: \"Dadda when does our white rover come in the mail...?\"! Along with all of the good you are doing in the world via Sphero in the school systems & the Sphero EDUapp - you can add that a 3.5 year old knows by sight that Xcode is a 'language' that we can use to talk to our white rover with. This might sound silly to others but I am blown away. Amazing! Your RVR has yet to arrive and I am over the Moon! haha.

Check your posture right now.\n\nDo you feel relaxed? How is your back? And your neck? Do you know how to seat correctly? Probably yes for the moment. But during long hours you start to feel the tension in neck and back. We have that covered. Infinity PAD is an ideal solution to sit in perfect posture effortlessly, easing back pain.\nWe tend to develop poor posture at an early age. These sitting habits stick with us and we fail to realize how much it affects us everyday.\nThe Infinity PAD presents a simple and effective solution to all our sitting problems:\n\nThe Infinity PAD is a seat enhancement that upgrades your existing chair into a posture corrector by introducing dynamic and ergonomic sitting positions. \nIt was created as a one-stop solution for all of the problems associated with sitting.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany professions require more than 8 hours of sitting per day. That means sitting for more than 100,000 hours in one lifetime. \nImagine how this can affect your body, especially if you\u2019re sitting incorrectly... \nIt is impossible for many of us to avoid sitting, which is why the Infinity PAD is the perfect solution.\nThe Infinity PAD also has long-term benefits. It introduces and instills proper sitting habits. When maintained over a sustained period, it will train your sitting muscles to work even when you aren't using the Infinity PAD.\n\n\nSimply placing the Infinity PAD on your existing chair introduces a balance point to your seat. This balance point naturally pulls your body into a position of proper posture. How? The body's natural reaction to the balance point is to sit with your head up, shoulders back, and chest out. \n\nIt tilts the pelvis forward, creating a healthy S-curve in your spine. \nIt also engages and trains key sitting muscles in your body, including your back, legs, and core.\nThe Infinity PAD is designed for use in a variety of everyday activities. \nYou can use it while you work, study, eat, read, watch TV, or meditate\u2014virtually anything that you usually do sitting down. You can even use the Infinity PAD on the floor for yoga or strength and balance exercises. \nThe Infinity PAD is designed for consistent and convenient use. The product can be paired with one designated chair, or it can be easily transferred between multiple areas in your home or workplace.\nIt really is as simple as placing the Infinity PAD on your existing seat and sitting on it. This makes it a versatile product for any office or household. However you choose, sustained use of the Infinity PAD will lead to improved sitting habits.\nThe InfinityPAD comes in one ready-to-use piece. There is no assembly required. \n\nThe InfinityPAD is a lightweight and resilient product that is designed to last. It is made to withstand the same weight as standard chairs. \nSince its height is not adjustable, it pairs best with chairs and/or desks with adjustable heights. It can also be adapted for use with floors and other surfaces.\nHi! My name is Alojz and I am the creator of the Infinity PAD. As a school teacher and adult educator, I've seen every possible variation of poor posture. Observing my students, I noticed that the more fatigue, stress, and pain they felt, the more likely they were to slouch or lean into worse postures.\nI've seen this cycle in my students and I even experienced this myself. \nI tried many other posture-correcting products on the market but what I found was either expensive or involved wearing tedious devices. \nI knew there was a simple and effective solution waiting to be discovered. After researching the market and a careful planning stage, I finally developed the Infinity PAD\u2014a posture-correcting product that was affordable, convenient, and comfortable.\nAfter 2 years of researching and consulting with professionals, I developed the Infinity PAD. \nIt is produced in a boutique workshop in Slovenia and crafted with locally sourced materials. \n\nNow I need your help to scale the production, and help others. \n\n\nWith your backing, I will be able to produce the Infinity PAD with a variety of textiles. This will allow customization of the fabric and color, adding a personal touch. You can choose whether your Infinity PAD blends in seamlessly or stands out and makes a statement.  \n\nThe Infinity PAD is made of just a few key materials.\nThese durable yet lightweight materials have been carefully selected with longevity in mind. Without any overly complicated parts, the chance of any component failure is minimized and, in the event of failure, easily repaired with our help.\n\n\n\nWith the help of your generous backing, I plan to roll out the Infinity PAD following the below schedule. This timeline will allow me to ensure that each InfinityPAD is perfect before we send it to you, our very first backers.\n\nhttp://www.humanics-es.com/ergonomics_movement.htm#ergonomicpostures\nhttp://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2009&issue=03150&article=00021&type=abstract\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2010.544765\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687099000307\nhttp://www.gaitposture.com/article/S0966-6362(99)00026-0/abstract\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10755663", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the capital raised from this campaign, I plan to assemble the production line that will allow me to produce Infinity PADs per the outlined schedule and bring awareness of the new product to the market. \n\nChallenge will be making designer Infinity PADs which we are looking forward to and be the best as possible to please your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Alojz Blazic\n2 created \u00b7 15 backed\nWorking on projects makes the horizon bigger.

It connects movement point allowance system with easy calculation of the outcome of a shot which together provide almost a computer game feeling to it.\nNo pesky infantry, just metal on metal, mano a mano! If you ever wondered what would happen if you just stormed a town Kelly\u2019s heroes\u2019 style, this is definitely a game for you!\nThis is a first game in the series of Panzer Strike games which is centered around a theme of tank battles on the Western Front. This is not a depiction of any particular battle, but a simulation of possible tactical conflicts between the Allied and German forces during the 1944-45 period, in an urban environment. During the war, tanks almost always acted together with other military branches and types of units - infantry, artillery, aviation, etc. In this game, alongside tanks, there is self-propelled artillery, while the infantry is present in the form of armored half-trackers and has specific tasks depending on the scenario: to take control of a city square, demine a building, release prisoners etc. However, the main role is reserved for tanks and tank destroyers, and players act as commanders of an armoured formation. Commanding a tank company of about 15 tanks, you are going head to head against your opponent through the narrow or wide streets of a town. But watch your back! Even a mighty Tiger is vulnerable from that side.\nDice are a part of this game but strategy and positioning can always mitigate unlucky rolls. Still, even the most heavily armoured tank on the battlefield can be incapacitated by a lucky shot, but you should never rely on it. The outcome of each encounter depends predominantly on the tactical decisions taken.\nThe game features two sides, so it is perfectly suited for two players. However, on each side there could be 2 or 3 players playing co-op against the other side (so in total the number of player goes up to 6). In that case, the tanks on each side are divided into several formations that will be controlled by different players from the same sides.\nThe rules are very simple, and at the same time very realistic so they perfectly emulate a real battle. The game features two different sets of rules: Simplified and Core.\nSimplified rules date from 12 years ago and they were the first set of rules implemented in the game (link to history). The movement of the piece consists of a series of individual steps (forward movements to the adjacent square or a rotation in place by 45\u00b0) which resembles the movement of tracked vehicles in real life. In the Simplified rules, the destruction upon the action of shooting depends on the Firepower of the shooting tank (determined by red dice rolls), Armour value of the target vehicle (different values for each side of every tank type) and the Distance between the tanks (determined by a special ruler): the tank is destroyed if the Firepower is greater than the sum of the Armour and Distance values. These rules are an excellent representatives of our MCMD principle (minimum complexity, maximum diversity). Because of this, the Pocket version of this game has already had some great reviews on BGG:\n\"The simplicity cannot be overstated - I read the rules and was playing in around 10 minutes! However, simple does not mean less tactical - I think with the right players this game could be as tactical as chess!\" -  Review by Graham 13 \n\"... the designers vision seemed to me to force you to move, the old shoot, move and communicate Boom-Boom concept.\" - Review by Robert Smith\nIn the Core Rules, the movement of the pieces is identical, but the difference is that in addition to Firepower, Armour, and Distance factors, there is a fourth one: Accuracy. Its introduction, along with some other elements, makes the game even more dynamic and realistic.\nApart from the two sets of rules, there are also optional rules that allow players to adapt the game to their own affinities, depending on the age, level of tactical and strategic knowledge, time at their disposal, etc.\nYou can read the rules in the Update #9 and #15:\nSimplified rules - Table 1\nIn order to make the game even more interesting, there will be a dozen of scenarios in a brochure. Some of them will have fixed initial positions and tasks, and some will be more flexible. There will be symmetrical scenarios (similar tasks for both players) and asymmetrical ones.\nRead more in Update #13\nClick for more information\nThe game is offered in three versions: Light, Standard, and Premium, as we want to offer diversity to the gamers with different budgets.\n- The Light version comes with 60 molded plastic pieces, and the other elements are adapted to the lower price (board of a thinner cardboard, no 3D buildings, and a simple transport box).\n- The Standard variant is made according to the higher production standards. Along with 92 molded pieces, it includes 3D cardboard buildings that the players assemble themselves, while the board is made of thicker cardboard. The box is big enough to store the once assembled buildings alongside all other elements.\n- The Premium version differs from the Standard version in the fact that it includes 60 realistic miniature tanks in 1/300 scale (3D printed in SLS technology) with rotating turrets instead of the molded pieces.\nEvery version includes an impressive board of the same size: 66x79 cm (26x31 in).\nSee more details about buildings in the Update #11\nMore information about assembling the buildings in Update #11\nA three-dimensional board implies that it contains objects which prevent movement or shooting through squares they\u2019re on. In general, refer to all these objects as obstacles. Buildings and monuments belong to High obstacles that cannot be demolished or removed during the games (the buildings can be replaced by completely or partially demolished buildings depending on the agreement between players or a particular scenario in play). It\u2019s not possible to fire through High obstacles. It is possible to shoot over them, however, but this can only be done by Howitzers (explained in detail in the Rulebook).\nMore information in Update #6\n- For our previous Kickstarter project (Tank Chess), we made a molding tool for high-quality tank pieces that includes all armored vehicle types from the WW2 period: Light, Medium,  and Heavy tanks, Tank destroyers, Self-propelled howitzers, Armoured cars, Half-tracks, etc.\nThe following vehicles will be in the Light and Standard versions:\n- On top of that, we already have prepared the realistic models for almost all types of miniatures involved. These minis are made on high-end 3D printers using SLS technology. All miniatures will be painted, and the players will be able to decorate them further if they want to give them a look even more similar to the real vehicles. The production of these minis will take place at the company Voxellab, which has been an excellent collaborator.\nMore information about pieces and miniatures in Update #5.\nWe\u2019ve also prepared a long list of add-ons that can enrich the experience in different ways. The add-ons will be available after the campaign through the Backer Kit pledge manager. These will be some of them:\n- Set of 3D buildings - $ 12\n- Set of 3D destroyed buildings - $ 8\n- Set of 2D destroyed buildings  - $ 2\n- Additional tank pieces pack (60 pcs) - $ 12\n- Additional miniatures pack (60 pcs) - $ 70\n- Print and Play files - $ 5\n- STL files of miniatures - $ 20\nMore information about add-ons in the Update #8.\nThis game is already very rich in content, but we\u2019ve prepared a set of stretch goals that will enhance it even more. We are open to any backers\u2019 suggestion and we\u2019ll consider every proposal that could lead to an even better gaming experience.\n #1 - $ 15 000: Barricades  \u2714\n(cardboard markers for Light version, plastic pieces for Standard and Premium)\n #2 - $ 25 000: Trees and Trams\n(cardboard markers for Light version, plastic pieces for Standard and Premium)\nMore information about stretch goals in the Update #7.\nEveryone who pledges for a physical copy ($28 or more) will be able to get one of the following gifts:\n- A First day gift - Everyone who pledges during the first day will get an additional 50 stylized tank pieces or 8 realistic miniatures (depending on the pledge level);\n- A Loyalty gift - All backers that helped us in our previous project will get a dice tower;\n- A Happy Place gift - In the previous project, we had backers from over 60 countries in which Kickstarter is very popular. This time we want to reach the gamers from places where Kikstarter is not so well known and to expand the community to regions where we haven\u2019t had many backers from. We have selected various countries, states or regions according to the geographical principle. The gift is the game Panzer Strike - France 44 Pocket. Backers from the following countries/regions will get this game:\nFrom our region - Macedonia; from Europe - Poland; from Asia - India; from Africa - all countries of North Africa; North America \u2013 the state of Texas; Central America \u2013 Mexico; South America \u2013 Paraguay; Australia/Oceania \u2013 The state of New South Wales.\n- A Media Contributor gift - As in the previous project, we will reward all those who contribute to a successful project (before and) during the campaign through activity on social networks, BGG, posting in various magazines, blogs, etc.\nBased on all kinds of experiences we\u2019ve had with shipping during our previous projects, we made a different strategy for this one. By using services of fulfillment companies, we\u2019ve provided EU friendly and US friendly shipping, and if we have at least 50 backers from Canada and Australia, we\u2019ll provide friendly shipping for these regions also.\nShipping costs are the following:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have gained a lot of experience working on the realization of previous projects. We\u2019ll repeat everything that has proven to be a positive point, and we\u2019ve made additional effort to introduce improvements to this project. Thanks to your previous support, we\u2019ve acquired new machines (5 3D printers, a packing machine, a cutting machine, a punch machine, etc.) and made two expensive tools for molded pieces. With all that, our workshop is perfectly suited for small and medium series of any version, so we\u2019ve again put a small campaign goal: only $ 2,000. We believe that this campaign will also be very successful and we will certainly do our best to ship all the awards in time or even before the announced deadline. We emphasize that the molded tools are already done, as well as almost all 3D models of realistic minis, so the production of the pieces will start even before the pledge manager ends.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you!", "descp": "- A high resolution wallpaper with the game art\nYou will be able to increase your reward level in the pledge manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Print and Play", "descp": "- Full set of PDF files: board, 3d buildings, pieces, rulers, etc.\n- STL files of stylized tank pieces", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Miniatures STL pack", "descp": "- STL files of all the miniatures (designed for 1/300, adapted for high-res 3D printing)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "LIGHT", "descp": "One physical copy of\nPanzer Strike: Western Front (Light edition)\nContent: Board (thin cardboard), 60 pieces, 18 dice, 4 rulers, 2 protractors, 100 markers, Two rulebooks, 6 table charts and Brochure with scenarios in a transport box (35 x 41 cm / 14 x 16,5 in).\n+ Some of the stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 68 or more", "title": "STANDARD", "descp": "One physical copy of\nPanzer Strike: Western Front (standard)\nContent: Box (34 x 40 cm / 13,5 x 16 in), Board (thick cardboard), 92 pieces, A set of 3D cardboard buildings (for assembly), Assembly manual, 18 dice, 4 rulers, 5 protractors, 100 markers, Turn counter, Two rulebooks, 6 table charts and Brochure with scenarios.\nTransport box (35 x 41 cm / 14 x 16,5 in).\n+ All stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["32 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 118 or more", "title": "PREMIUM", "descp": "One physical copy of\nPanzer Strike: Western Front (Premium)\nContent: Box (34 x 40 cm / 13,5 x 16 in), Board (thick cardboard), 60 painted tank miniatures, A set of 3D cardboard buildings (for assembly), Assembly manual, 12 plastic wall segments, 18 dice, 4 rulers, 5 protractors, 100 markers, Turn counter, Two rulebooks, 6 table charts and Brochure with scenarios.\nTransport box (35 x 41 cm / 14 x 16,5 in).\n+ All stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["94 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Retail pledge", "descp": "For retailers only.

A failure caused by it would lead to a financial collapse and the fulfilment of all projects (both old and new) would be uncertain.\n\nIt is not easy to estimate when some intellectual and creative work will be completed. We received great praise for the first game in the Age of Dogfights series, so now backers' expectations from the new game are justifiably very high. This is an additional pressure for our small team, so sometimes we dedicate too much time to some details. Due to that, the preparations have been extended, but we are now in the final phase (the video is being recorded). We are sure that we are on a good path to create another very good game and that the campaign will be very successful. This will also have a positive effect on the Panzer Strike project.

Simplified rules, as the name says, are very simple, easy to learn, dynamic with playing turns exchanging quickly. In a single operation, the rule for firing takes into account the strength of the gun, the armor thickness of the target and the distance. These rules were written back in 2006, when we created the first prototype of a game with tank combat in an urban environment theme (). In the following years, we made new prototypes, the rules were constantly upgraded, we added new categories of tanks and armored vehicles, howitzers with parabolic firing were introduced...

But what would happen to you, if the art of handwriting died?\n   Take a look at our short video to get a basic understanding of why handwriting is so important:\n  PLAY\n\n \n   According to a Forbes article, psychology expert and researcher Dr. J. P. says, \u201cIt appears possible that writing, which is a formalized form of thinking, helps people derive information from their experiences that help them guide their perceptions, actions, thoughts, and emotions in the present.\u201d\n   Perhaps this is why so many people handwrite in their journals and diaries, or write out their goals and aspirations.\n   \u00bb... handwriting increases neural activity in certain sections of the brain\u2026\u00ab\n   \n   According to a study performed at the Indiana University, the mere action of writing by hand unleashes creativity not easily accessed in any other way.\n   And high-tech magnetic resonance imaging has indeed shown that low-tech writing by hand increases neural activity in certain sections of the brain \u2026.\n   \"\u2026 handwriting activates a unique neural circuit \u2026\"\n   \n   \u201cWhen we write, a unique neural circuit is automatically activated,\u201d said Dr. Stanislas Dehaene, a cognitive psychologist at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris. \u201cThere is a core recognition of the gesture in the written word, a sort of recognition by mental simulation in your brain.\n  A study led by Karin James, a psychologist at Indiana University, lent support to that view.\n \n    Writing by hand \u2014 and even going beyond that \u2014 sketching, drawing, doodling, is a necessary mode of human connection.\n   It's rare to see someone focus on their art for many, many hours in a row these days. Some people are addicted to their devices like \"cyber zombies.\" I see them every day.\n   It's like they're not real human beings anymore. More like robots, glued to their screens. Not present. And half-alive to life.\n   OUR STORYTELLER STORY\n   Our Storyteller story began with the development of our 3D printed fountain pens.\n   \n   The people at Shapeways must really love us since they gave us the opportunity to test out over 170 different print designs, play around with the thickness and colors of the pens and 6 months later we finally had our fully functioning prototypes (huraaaaaaaaaayyy), that completely wowed the whole Storyteller team.\n   Because we were so pleased with what we created, we wanted to make sure we could create the same effect with an even more durable and unbreakable material.\n   After some hard word and some sleepless nights we were able to develop what we believe is the next step in our journey - the brand new METAL Storyteller fountain pen.\n   \n   Start writing your story with our Storyteller fountain pens. It seems such a small change but it will have a big impact on your creativity and help you get more in touch with your thoughts & goals.\n  LIMITED OFFER: Our 3D printed Storyteller fountain pens will be available exclusively during our Kickstarter and will not be available for sale after the end of our campaign. \nPLAY\n\n The city of blossoming tulips, artistic souls, and relaxed\n  and tolerant people.\n\n  Amsterdam is a symbol for traditional architecture, windmills,\n  enticing river canals, and idyllic picturesque houses where\n  you\u2019ll find the most open-minded people in the world.\n\n  The Amsterdam fountain pen has been carefully\n  and accurately crafted for all lovers of superb architecture\n  and design, and especially for modern, easy-going,\n  and accepting people, who know how to capture\n  a moment of pleasure, appreciate freedom, uniqueness,\n  and enjoy modern or retro designs.\nSpecifications:\n  Weight with cap 9g\n  Weight without cap 7g\n  Lenght with cap 135mm\n  Lenght without cap 123 mm\nBock Triple System - Nib Type 076 Stainless Steel Nib: Fine, Medium, Broad\n\n \u2665 THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE STORYTELLER PROJECT \u2665\n  PLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know that there can always be some unexpected delays during production but we have planned for this and extended our production schedule accordingly.\n\nAnother common challenge is fulfilling a project that exceeds its project funding goal significantly.

It will also allow for submissions and appearances for a proper film festival run, which will be crucial for getting Spoons in front of audiences and distributors. \nWe are passionate about surfing and about stories of dedication, and we\u2019ve pooled our money and resources to this point because we believe this film should exist for the next generation to build on. \n\n\n\u00a9 Yater Collection\n\u00a9 Glen Clark\n\u00a9 Don Balch\n\u00a9 Don Balch\n\u00a9 Greg Huglin\n\u00a9 Greg Huglin\n\u00a9 Charlie Coffee\nSimon Murdoch's Black Beauty - Image from the film\n1965 Greenough Spoon - Limited Edition Print\nWin this board for $40 - Brand New & Hand Shaped by Trimcraft\n1964-5 Yater Spoon - Limited Edition Print\nSea Jive clothing raffle - win a full kit valued at $90\nWho We Are\nThis film started as a solo project and grew to a large team of passionate surfers, friends,  supporters of the story and supporters of us as filmmakers. There are too many to list here, but we are the two keeping it together.  \nWyatt Daily - Director & Producer\nWyatt cut his teeth in surf documentaries by working alongside Chris Malloy on \"The Fisherman's Son\" (2015), and as Assistant Editor for Keith Malloy on his bodysurfing classic \"Come Hell or High Water\" (2011). With an observational approach defined by exploring the relationships between mentors, students, and innovators, he seeks to present the shared experiences of humanity. \n\u201cI\u2019m making Spoons because it's a vital story to surfing's history that hasn't been told from Santa Barbara's perspective. The younger generation should know their history but also how craft, heritage, and place are relevant to communities beyond surfing.\u201d - Wyatt Daily\nJustin Misch - Producer\nWhile working alongside Producer/Director Takuji Masuda as Production Coordinator on the documentary \u201cBUNKER77\u201d (2016), Justin developed a keen ability to creatively navigate the fickle world of surf documentary production.  With his passion for environmentalism and storytelling, Justin\u2019s short film \u201cPICK UP TRASH\u201d won the \u201cBest Environmental Story\u201d award at the 2017 Patagonia Film Festival.  \n\u201cI\u2019m stoked to share this inspiring origin story with our surf community. To me, Spoons is a special opportunity to preserve the archives of some of the greatest original surf filmmakers, which might otherwise get lost in the ethos.\u201d - Justin Misch \nWhy $ 46,520?\nThis is the bare minimum we need to pay for the music and archival licensing. Here are the areas that we need to put money towards:\nMusic\nWe have three iconic songs that tell the story of the eras we traverse. These are the bulk of the music licensing. For the rest of our 22 pieces of music, we are working closely with Nashville based Hi-Low Sonics to record and score our unique soundtrack.\nImage & 3rd Party Video Licensing\nMuch of the footage compiled has never been seen before, but some of it is from some of the most iconic names in surf filmmaking. \nFestival Submissions\nIn order to get the attention that Spoons: A Santa Barbara Story deserves, we will submit this film to film festivals all around the world.

Pigzbe Green Unlocked!\nPigzbe is a (very) smart device that teaches kids 6+ the value of money in a digital world. It's one of the first ever family products built using the blockchain.\nWe call it a piggy-wallet\u2122. \nToday\u2019s kids live in a fast changing financial world. Digital money, contactless payments, in-app purchases and cryptocurrency are all things they need help to understand.\nIt's hard to get to grips with money if you can\u2019t touch the notes or feel the coins!\nWe wanted to find a way to make digital money physical, so children can touch, play and experiment with it. The same way we did with the coins in our piggy-banks. \nPigzbe teaches kids about money in a language they understand. It is made up of four connected elements:\n 1. Pigzbe Device \nPigzbe is a friendly and interactive financial assistant that\u2019s packed with personality. Take Pigzbe on adventures, play games and learn together as you grow up. \n2. Pigzbe App\nThe Pigzbe App connects the whole family to a child\u2019s financial education. Parents can send allowances, set tasks & reward milestones. Kids learn through play.\n3. Wollo, a family-friendly cryptocurrency \nUsing Wollo kids learn how to save, budget and manage digital money. Every new Pigzbe comes with 200 Wollo inside, enough to start having fun right away!\n4. Family Payment Card\nSpend Wollo easily anywhere that takes Visa using our Family Payment Card. Or spend Wollo using a Wirex Visa card (both cards available in selected locations, additional fees apply). \nIn the Parents App, Mum and Dad moderate. They can set allowances, create tasks to earn money, reward milestones, and invite others to join the family network. \nThe Kids App is an interactive game. It allows children to feed their money tree, watch it grow, and learn new financial concepts as they play. \nLots of parents struggle to talk to their children about finances, and worry about passing on bad habits. Pigzbe helps create a more positive family dynamic around money.  Kids learn: \nWollo is our family-friendly cryptocurrency, designed specifically to send money globally, quickly and cost-effectively (it costs $0.000001 to send as little as $0.005).   \n Where do I get Wollo?  \nEvery Pigzbe device comes with 200 Wollo inside, enough for parents to get started setting tasks and giving rewards. You can buy more Wollo online like any other currency. \nHow does Wollo work?\nWollo works like any other currency \u2013 it has an exchange rate and you can buy it with dollars, pounds or other cryptocurrencies. Like any other currency it can go up and down in price.\nFluctuation is an important financial concept to learn (the dollar does it, the pound does it) so introducing children to this idea with very small amounts of money, is a useful lesson.\nHow can I spend Wollo?\nYou can spend Wollo by exchanging it online for other digital or everyday currencies or using a Pigzbe Family Payment Card or Wirex Visa card (selected locations, fees apply). \nPigzbe comes with all the necessary parts to start playing right out of the box: A. Pigzbe Piggy-Wallet, B. Pigzbe App (Parents App + Kids App), C. USBC Charging chord \nLights! Sound! Touch! D. 128 LED lights, combined with a E. speaker, a F. vibration motor, and G. 2x buttons, to provide a tangible window into you digital money.  \nWe're a team of engineers, technologists, artists and storytellers from 15 countries. We've worked on incredible projects for companies like Apple, Google and NASA. We know what it means to deliver exceptional experiences to millions of people. \nPigzbe is our next big adventure.  \nWe worked with the amazing team at Pentagram, the world's largest independent design consultancy, to build a truly unique product.  \nPigzbe runs on a Dual core XTENSA\u00ae 32-bit LX6 with AES/RSA/ECC/SHA hardware encryption. It has a 24 x 8 LED matrix display, 6-axis motion sensing and works with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. \nEverything is ready to go. We just need your support. Pigzbe will be in stores in Q2 2019. Back us on Kickstarter and be among the first in the world to get one!   \nWe\u2019re a team of Mums (and Moms) and Dads who have built some of the world\u2019s best-loved educational toys, things like  Cubetto, the Kano, SAM, Hack-a-Ball, and Suzy Snooze. We know from experience how kids learn.\nCollectively, we\u2019ve produced and delivered robots, computers and connected devices across multiple Kickstarter campaigns since 2013. Meet the team here.\nSome might say we\u2019re Kickstarter veterans. \nThere\u2019s no secret about the challenges involved in delivering bits and atoms, but we know what we are doing. \nWe give you our word and guarantee that every backer will receive a quality product made with skill, dedication and passion.\nWe're so sure about Pigzbe that we are offering a 100% Delivery Guarantee.

It\u2019s a disorder. It\u2019s a disease. It\u2019s not something you choose, it\u2019s something you get. Something that can destroy you just as any other disease. It can kill you.\nPeople with anorexia are dying literally every day. If you want to defeat anorexia, you have to understand it, just like all the other \u201cdemons\u201d. How to better understand it than to listen to someone who has faced it?\nThe book is about my life. So who am I? My name is \u0160pela Kranjec and I\u2019ve decided to turn my worst experience into something good. I\u2019m 26 years old and I\u2019ve lived through experiences that can inspire and maybe even save lives.\nToday, people see me as a strong and capable woman, who can take on any challenge. A woman who knows how to stand up for herself and lives a life the way she likes it. And that\u2019s how I really am, to be completely honest. \nBut anyone that knows me knows that in the past I was a fragile and defenseless little girl, who was suffering from anorexia for 9 years. This little girl is part of my personality, a part that I laid bare for the world to see. With all my experience, I learned how to control this part so that it never takes over again, but it will always stay within me. Just like the memory of all the years when it controlled me.\nAnorexia and other eating disorders are mental illnesses that can have deadly consequences. People who have no experience in this area often have trouble recognizing the signs that indicate the potential development of an eating disorder, as well as understanding a person that suffers from a form of this disorder.\nThe key thing in overcoming eating disorders is knowledge and understanding. With my story, I hope to help you understand what is going on in the mind of someone with anorexia, their desires, their fears, and, of course, what helped me personally get back on my feet.\nI wish I could give others the opportunity to walk the world as free as a bird. Without that voice inside that keeps telling them they aren\u2019t beautiful or worth anything. I want to give them the opportunity to fall in love and share their heart with someone that will make their world even more beautiful. I want them to enjoy the company of their friends and not close themselves off, while shedding tears and torturing themselves hidden away from the world.\nThe more I succeed, the fewer families around the world going through hell behind closed doors. That\u2019s why I must achieve this! Help me achieve this.\nThis book pulls you into the story and, hopefully, makes you feel what I felt. With this book, I shared my feelings, my thoughts and experiences. I also included comments from my family members and my best friend, who suffered just as I did, which gives the book a really special added value.\nIt is a simple book, written with strong emotions and the will to improve yourself \u2013 a book about a difficult experience. But a happy ending. An ending anyone can achieve. Happiness. With this book I tried to convince everyone that it is possible to beat an eating disorder. If I could do it \u2013 a simple, average girl, from a regular family, who became happy, full of life, and thirsty for new experiences, fun, and laughter \u2013 anyone can do it!\nThis book is meant for everybody searching for another chance \u2013 and WANTING another chance. Because I know that everybody deserves at least one more. And because I believe that you can learn plenty from a girl who battled anorexia for 9 years, I decided to write a book and try to help others to start living a better life.\nI have a story that inspires and changes lives. A story intended for all who are battling an eating disorder and those who just want to understand how anorexia actually feels like.\nAs one of the readers said: \u201cI know that someone in a similar situation, alone or with a family, would \u2018devour\u2019 your book, not just read it, if I can make a comical statement\u2026 And if there is a book that can help someone, it is definitely yours.\u201d\nFirst chapter of NOTICE ME: My 9-year struggle against anorexia\nIf you are a parent of a child who is battling an eating disorder, this book will help you. \nIf you are battling an eating disorder yourself, and you know you want to get rid of it.\nIf you deny the problem, or if you don\u2019t even know what your problem should be called.\nIf you are a friend of someone or know of someone who is battling an eating disorder. \nFor doctors and others that are teaching about or treating eating disorders. \nDid I forget anyone? \nIf you didn\u2019t find yourself in the descriptions listed above \u2013 this book is also meant for you! Maybe you want to read it just in case, maybe you just want to learn more about eating disorders, or maybe you just enjoy reading.\nMy book was first published in Slovenia in 2016. I initially wrote this book to clear my head, share my experiences, and express my emotions. However, readers convinced me that I\u2019ve written an amazing book that can help people understand anorexia, which is the first step towards a better future. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ll try to share it with as many as possible. Here is some of the feedback I received from my readers:\nA project like this has a lot of different expenses, which I can\u2019t afford at this time. Because I would really like to share my story with the world, I started to look for options that would help me finish my project. \nMy brother convinced me to start a Kickstarter campaign, which will hopefully help me bring my book to as many homes as possible. I see Kickstarter as wonderful opportunity to test my idea and to see if I can build a community of people that share my vision. I believe that Kickstarter is a wonderful platform, with an amazing community of people, willing to help different project all over the world that are starting from a scratch. I believe that with your help everything is possible and that\u2019s why I decided to give it a shot. ;)\nThe next step after publishing my book in Slovenia is to raise money on Kickstarter to translate the book into English and to share it with the world. But that\u2019s not the end. \nOur friend who helped us record a video for our Kickstarter campaign suggested we make a short movie on this topic, and I think that this is a great idea! \nI\u2019m also thinking of writing another book, in which I would described my life after anorexia. I love to write and there is so much more to be said. But let\u2019s start by translating this book first! ;)\n talkhealth Partnership:  www.talkhealthpartnership.com \nIt\u2019s a real pleasure working with so many amazing people that are helping me on my journey.

Despite this potential, Bitcoin is undergoing severe price volatility and the community is facing a bitter internal \u2018civil war\u2019. Moreover, much of the media coverage is often misinformed or misleading and the general public is still confused about the technology and its larger implications. \nCan this technology, designed to operate independent of trust and within a decentralized network, really provide a robust alternative? Can it and the people behind it be trusted to secure elections, prevent financial meltdowns and keep our private information safe? Or are cryptocurrencies just as unfairly distributed, easily manipulated and dangerous as our current systems? Join award-winning filmmaker Torsten Hoffmann four years after his first Bitcoin documentary on his journey to find the answers to these important questions that may redefine the future of the Internet (web3.0). \nCONTEXT\nWith the proliferation of the Internet, the power of Governments and large tech corporations has reached unprecedented levels. In fact, in the past few years...\nOur privacy has been jeopardized, \nOur social media weaponized,  \nAnd our democracies compromised\n... leaving some to wonder whether technology itself lies at the core of the problem. \nNow, the big brains (and big egos) who brought us Bitcoin claim that they are building a cyber utopia, where we can take back control of our privacy, run unhackable elections, and break free from the shackles of existing institutions. Can blockchains live up to this bold promise and ... or has the movement lost steam amidst scaling problems, consumer confusion, price crashes and internal debates within the community? \nAnd why does this all somehow sound familiar? \nAlso: How come, these guys really don't like Bitcoin?\nOUR FIRST FILM \nThe production of \u201cBitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It\u201d started in January of 2014 in Miami, New York, London, Cambridge, Melbourne, and Toronto. We successfully raised A$17,362 via a small Kickstarter campaign in July 2014 and otherwise self-funded the project. We released the film in July 2015 (BTC @ $280) and it quickly became one of the most pirated documentaries of the year. @TheEndOfMoney went viral: 2,300 Facebook fans, 104,000 Tweet impressions, and 1,500 upvotes on Reddit. \nTorsten was even on Randi Zuckerberg\u2019s show (and many other radio shows and crypto podcasts) to talk about the film. This generated approximately 500,000 downloads via BitTorrent, Vimeo On Demand, Amazon Prime, and iTunes. Our fans created more than 20 \u2018unauthorized\u2019 subtitle versions. Our IMDb rating has been consistently at 7.1 with 750 votes and 81 critics - not bad for an independent first-time filmmaker! In 2015 and 2016 we also won four awards at international film festivals. We supported public screenings in 12 countries at meetups, educational events at startup hubs, incubators, technology conferences, accountant associations, university lectures, etc. \nGLOBAL REACH\nWe are most proud about our reach via traditional media because we promised to make a film for everybody. These are some of the broadcasters, TV channels and media platforms that have licensed the documentary. \nOn these platforms we have reached audiences in developing countries like Kenya, Lebanon, and the Philippines as well as in crypto-hotspots like South Korea, Sweden, or China, ... 40 countries in total. Here's the alphabetical list:\nAnd that\u2019s not all. We also went airborne: These Asian and Middle Eastern airlines showed @TheEndOfMoney in their in-flight entertainment systems.\nBut here\u2019s what should get you excited: Our first film was released more than 3 years ago. Since then, the price of Bitcoin has increased by a factor of 30. And the interest in the topic as well as the size of our audience has grown by a factor of 10 - at least. Imagine if we could reach 10 times more people than 3 years ago. Let\u2019s go mainstream, baby! \nPRODUCTION PLAN AND TIMING\nFirst, let us be clear: Our new documentary CRYPTOPIA will be very different from \"Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It\" where we focused on the history of money, economics, central banking and Bitcoin. This time, we work with a higher production budget, better creative ideas and with a much bigger scope. We'll get to know the experts in depth, cover actual applications of the blockchain and discuss the decentralization of the Internet. Luckily, we\u2019re already in the finishing stages of production after filming on three continents and have sources of funding. Please do help us bring the project over the line at the best possible quality level!\nDepending on budgets, we're still planning shoots in Germany, Switzerland, China and Australia (and will let you know once we have confirmed). Here are some behind-the-scenes impressions from our productions in March, April, and August. \nOUR EXPERTS\nMany of the leading figures of the crypto community know us from 2014 and have been generous with their time again. The most influential speakers, developers and experts of the industry are part of our film. The most controversial companies and spokespersons have agreed to interviews and the list is growing still. We also spent a lot of time with the journalist & podcaster-extraordinaire Laura Shin who is helping us and our audience to make sense of this fascinating technology and the people behind it. Oh, did we mention that we even interviewed one of the fathers of the Internet (TCP/IP) who shared his words of wisdom on camera with us?\n\nCheck out some of our favorite quotes from more than 20 interviews: \nOf course, we have a great archive of \"historical\" interviews from 2014 incl. \nVitalik Buterin, Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Michael Terpin, Jeffrey Tucker, Trace Mayer, Roger Ver, Joseph Vaughn Perling, Diego Gutierrez, Paul Vigna, Michael Casey, Bruce Fenton, Bernard von NotHaus, Nicolas Cary, Naomi Brockwell, David A. Johnston, Matt Miller, Max Wright, Elizabeth Ploshay, Ryan Zhou, Stephan Livera, Ben Dyson, Nicholas Gruen, Mark Bainbridge, Domenic Carosa, Nikki Scevac, Sam Lee, Juan Llanos, James Canning, Eric Benz, Dr. Monica Barrat, Rui Rodrigues, Eric Spano, and many more. \nIn the past few months we have interviewed: Laura Shin, Andreas Antonopolous, Samson Mow, Charlie Lee, Roger Ver, Vinny Lingham, Preethi Kasireddy, cryptograffiti, Wences Casares, Da Hongfei, Jimmy Nguyen, Dr. Robert Kahn, Lucas Cullen, Jamie Skella, Marc Weber, Jerry Chan, and many more. \nOUR TEAM\nTorsten Hoffmann (German). In many ways, Torsten has been working on this story for 9 years: In 2010, during his MBA studies at Oxford University (ChristChurch College) with a specialization on Finance and Entrepreneurship, he published a paper about alternative (paper) currencies (download). Unfortunately he missed Bitcoin then and only discovered it in 2013. He wrote, produced, and co-directed \"Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It\", his debut film, in 2014/2015. Torsten is a technology geek, has founded several media start-ups and is a consultant, advisor and board-member of several technology companies. His additional producer and executive producer credits include Ancient Angkor (Discovery Canada), Denali4k (NHK Japan), Kalahari Meerkats (Germany), Baboon Diaries (CCTV China), Khumbu Valley (Korea Telecom) and several Virtual Reality projects. Torsten is active on LinkedIn and Twitter. \nMichael Watchulonis (American). 18 year veteran of the factual television and entertainment industry as an award-winning writer, director and producer with two national Emmy nominations. From the jungles of Papua New Guinea to nuclear submarines, Michael\u2019s storytelling experience crosses a broad range of subjects and his documentaries have been featured on TBS, History Channel, CNN, National Geographic, ... in more than 50 countries. As a co-director on this project, Michael directs field shoots and supervises all post-production aspects of CRYPTOPIA. Michael and Torsten have worked on several other documentaries since 2012 including @TheEndOfMoney.\nBrinda D. Paul (Australian). Executive Producer, Production Manager and Researcher for the documentary. She has a Masters in Law (Cardiff University) and her interest is in the legal and regulatory aspects of cryptoassets. Brinda has been working in the distribution of factual content for past 6 years representing many award-winning filmmakers, globally. Her media clients include Netflix, Deutsche Telekom, Hulu, DirecTV, SONY, NBC Universal and many more. She attends film festivals and TV and digital content markets regularly. As Executive Producer her role is to secure funding grants and to negotiate with co-producers. Brinda also really likes bears!\nIlsa Harun (Malaysian). With a background in content creation and a masters in marketing communications (University of Melbourne), Ilsa is our expert in all things media. She is responsible for all publicity and community related work in the film-making process, runs our Facebook, Twitter as well as most of our other social media accounts. Ilsa manages our outreach campaigns and you can get her attention by using the hashtag #CryptopiaFilm. \nWHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE KICKSTARTER MONEY\nWe have already produced most of the documentary with our own capital and some other funding sources. Now, we are raising $22,400 (AUD) = 16,000 USD = 14,000 EUR = 2.4 BTC here on Kickstarter in order to finish the film to the highest standards. On Kickstarter it\u2019s all or nothing, so please do support us (tips are appreciated, too!).  \nEducational materials \nWe have an opportunity to tie parts of our film into the school curriculum in Australia and get teachers and librarians to access our film in schools and universities. Pretty cool, huh? Creating the necessary \u2018study guides\u2019 and DVDs cost about $4,500 (AUD).  \nAnimation and Graphics \nMany of our experts explain technical concepts like blockchains, hard forks, and cryptography very well but let\u2019s be honest: We need animators to make it come to life on the screen. We want to spend at least $9,600 (AUD) on this. The more money we can raise, the better we can finally explain blockchain to mainstream audiences. \nDrones \nYes, you heard right. We already have stunning footage from helicopters and drones to show the beautiful cities we visited (see below). We still need more of these cinematic sequences which will cost about $3,350 AUD.\nSee a sample of our aerial footage and some great EDM. \nPLAY\n\nMusic and Design \nArt isn't free. Artists need to be paid for their work! We plan to spend around $4,950 AUD on graphic designers, composers, musicians, graffiti artists which will make our documentary look and sound 21 million times slicker. We'll tell you more about our collaborators later. \nPLEASE FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n                Website    -    Twitter    -    Facebook    -    Insta\nREWARDS\nThe rewards are calculated based on Australian dollars - that's where we are based, so the exchange rate may result in odd numbers for you.

As mentioned, we already have produced most of the material and have access to other funding sources. So in that sense there is no risk of not delivering the film. \n\nHowever, to finish the documentary at the best possible quality level we would like to spend your contributions on the items explained above. \n\nThere is a risk of not releasing the film on schedule. I am sure you understand that sometimes the creative process takes longer than expected. Also, film festivals like to get 'premiere' rights (we managed to get our first film into several festivals) and this may slow down our publishing timeline.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 11 or more", "title": "Zero-Knowledge Proof Reward", "descp": "You just want to give us a tip and stay under the radar?

Here are some of the criteria that we thought it needed to fulfil:  \nNeeds to run smoothly, [ CHECK ] \nMakes shake free exposures possible [ CHECK ]\nShort exposures are a must [ CHECK ]\nMakes a clicking sound for fidgeting sake [ DOUBLE CHECK ] \nMakes filter use possible [ FINALLY ] \nThere is a lot of exotic film floating around the globe as well as the need from some photographers to expose 135 film over the sprocket holes ( Yes Please ). For this, we had no choice but to integrate a red window shutter on the backplate of the 120 film cameras. It features the same shutter system as the actual camera shutter, which is lightproof. This makes it possible to use 135 film with the use of an adapter in our medium format cameras. We have also enlarged the red window so it's easier to see the frame number in direct sunlight. \nAll those sprocket holes just waiting to be exposed!\nThe use of filters has never been so easy.\nMany of you said you wanted to use filters. Well, we got you covered. With the use of hidden magnets this works like a charm. Filters are an important aspect in pinhole photography that enable us to get even more creative with our images. This includes ND filters, IR film and color filters for black and white photography.   \nThe actual filter is not supplied with the camera.\nFor the regular camera series we opted for the circular threaded filter type while with the RISE series it's only possible to use it with the COKIN A series type of filters. Both methods snap on to the camera body without any screws. Please note that the actual filters are not available via ONDU and must be purchased separately.\nThe most important parts of the camera are CNC machined.\nIn order to tick all the boxes of usability for this series, we needed to resort slightly more to CNC machining in this camera series. Although, the majority of the camera is still made out of wood. The parts where most wear and tear happen are made either of CNC milled aluminium or steel. We try to keep these components to a minimum, while ensuring the cameras basic visual characteristics and end user satisfaction are met in equal.   \nThe ONDU Rise Series is really something else.\nAll these improvements led us to think bigger and the ONDU Rise was created. It is only available in walnut wood that features multiple holes located in the center and film plane thirds. This enables us to compose images with the rule of thirds in mind without distorting the perspective in our image as was traditionally done. It is our most advanced camera so far, the flagship of the ONDU range.  \nSo many capabilities have never been seen in a pinhole camera until now. The possibility to choose between three holes, snap on filter capability as well as well as the option to use 135 film without modifications thanks to the red window shutter makes the ONDU Rise series the most versatile pinhole camera ever created!  \nA camera like this needs a nice tripod, the future ONDU Statik ( more about the tripod below ).\nA beautiful camera like this needs to be seen by the world!\nOur previous cameras were beautiful but the MK 3 is something else. This is why we have decided to incorporate carrying loops and a strap so your ONDU doesn't spend most of it's time in a camera bag. Hang an ONDU from your shoulders and let the conversations start!   \nEngraving lines are a must with composing pinhole shots.\nIf it ain't broke don't fix it. We kept our much loved engraving lines as well as the levelling bulb. Once you get a hang of it, it's pretty easy to frame an exposure with the ONDU, so we're keeping that as it is.   \nImpeccable design, sturdy construction, high quality parts and attention to details like you have never seen before.   \nThere's an ONDU in our range suited for every type of photographer.\nWe have really put all of our woodworking and manufacturing skills in the new ONDU series. Years of refining and honing our craft have definitely brought us to the point where we can say that the ONDU is the best out there. The new range of ONDU's encompasses, including all color variations, a whooping 19 different cameras to choose from. The classical single hole cameras are available in bright (Ash) and dark (Walnut) while the advanced RISE is only available in Walnut( dark) wood.   \nWe couldn't decide bright or dark so we kept both. ( Bright colour not available in RISE series )\nWHICH CAMERA IS RIGHT FOR ME? \nIf you are a beginner we would actually recommend any camera that is not in the RISE range or the 4x5\". All others depending on your preference of final image are suitable for beginners. \nThe classic single pinhole ONDU's are available in 2 colors, when pledging you don't need to decide which colour you prefer yet. This will be done at the end of the campaign.  Films in the product images are just for scale and are not sold with the camera. \nTo purchase this item with your camera, just add on 12$ to your pledge, we'll take care of the rest once the campaign is finished. ( Can not be purchased as a stand alone item )\nThe adapter kit consists of 2 pairs of adapters and a reusable take-up spool. Alternatively, if you have a 3D printer you can print your own via Thingiverse.\n At the moment the tripod is just in prototype stage and we have used it regularly on our pinhole adventures. We felt a wooden camera needs a wooden tripod so we made one. It works for us but still needs some refinement and in field testing before we can call it done. However if you have some skills in basic woodworking we will, once the final design is perfected, make available a 3D printer version for free.\nWe might consider bringing the ONDU STATIK into production if our backers express enough interest.\nAs seen in: \nWell, you helped bring ONDU to it's current shape and form. Way, way back in 2013 when we launched our first Kickstarter we were just finishing university and not really aware of the exciting things that await us. Little did we know that our passion for pinhole photography was met with equal enthusiasm with like minded people all over the world. The support was overwhelming and we did it, together. Followed by another campaign with our second version of the ONDU cameras. Now that a bunch of time has passed, the sun still rises in the east and thousands of rolls of films later we feel it's right to introduce our most advanced and versatile camera series to date. The ONDU Pinhole cameras series MK 3 was guided by the feedback of each pinhole photographer that managed to get their hands on one of our previous cameras. We listened, we improved and we made you a tool. A camera that will stand the test of time and deliver unmatched quality with every exposure.\nSince we want our cameras to be of the best possible quality we make  every wooden part of the camera in our workshop. It's specialised for camera production and has many dedicated tools and setups made especially for the task at hand. We believe that craft making still has a place in today's world and that products made by hand bring an extra level of pride to their owners. We strive to make products that will hopefully last for many generations. There are many stages of production needed to create such a fine tool that is the ONDU MK III and we are really excited for the day that our machines and hands start shaping the finest quality wood into your future pinhole companion.  \nSpecial thanks to all of those who made this campaign possible:  \nNiko Klan\u0161ek | Business advisor  \nHeather Corcoran |  Keeping our spirits high and campaign help\nMatej Vrani\u010d | Video\nDJ Borka | Again with the amazing soundtrack for the video\nAnd most definitely once again to the whole pinhole community to name a few that have contributed images for the campaign: Lance Roth, Charles Strebor, Christopher Clements, Ken", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter so far, the majority of our tools except some specialised ones are already set up. We will need to make some minor modifications to the layout of the workshop but that's generally it. We have successfully completed more than 6 thousand cameras in the past few years which means that we have become pretty up to date with making them in large quantities. \n\nAlthough there is always a possibility for delays due to unforeseen circumstances, for instance malfunction of certain machines, even with regular maintenance. We are confident that the ONDU MK III will be a good challenge and one that will guide our backers on a journey of bringing this product to life. There are a bit more people on the team who will take care of communications with the people that make our work possible, a common thing that gets overlooked in most campaigns, when things get busy.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 89 or more", "title": "ONDU 135 Pocket", "descp": "35% off est. retail price\nThe smallest ONDU in our range.

It came in the middle of March and our friendly neighbour luckily came to assistance with his forklift and delivered it straight to our workshop door.

In most cases, it\u2019s recurring pain that is felt each and every day. Neck and shoulder problems are also very common, as approximately 50% of us suffer from neck and shoulder pain. Even more alarming is that even younger people are starting to show symptoms of back, neck and shoulder problems.\nPoor flexibility and tight muscles are largely to blame for these types of pains and postural problems. Increasing mobility and releasing tight muscles through dynamic stretching can provide relief for common problems like knee pain, shin splints and tight hip flexors and glutes.  \nThe HighRoller team knows that living an active lifestyle and staying healthy is important to you. So, we\u2019re here to help you avoid these problems from manifesting in the first place. HighTrainer allows you to enjoy life by relieving tension in the muscles and trigger points. You need your body ready for anything: whether it\u2019s a long day at work, a long workout, or a long game playing your favorite sport. A few 5-minute sessions a week with HighTrainer is enough to keep you going and help you recover faster.\nSanteri loved the physicality and competition that rugby brought into his life. His passion for the sport led him to achieving the highest honor in Finland when he was selected to represent his native country on the Finish National Rugby Team. Unfortunately, a sixth concussion ruined him from moving forward with his dream of competing internationally and benched Santeri\u2019s rugby career for good in 2013. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an awful feeling. \u2026 You have done it so many years and I felt like I was losing everything in my life,\u201d Santeri recalled.\nAlthough, Santeri\u2019s rugby career was behind him, some of the body pain he struggled with was not. As Santeri remained active through power lifting, he found that his upper back was plagued with pain. Determined to not let another injury sideline an active passion, he decided to invent his own solution in the HighTrainer. \nLike rugby, victory didn\u2019t come easy and he learned quickly that it would require a team to successfully accomplish his invention. Santeri\u2019s experience as an owner/engineer in successfully launching products like the HighRoller and HighBaller were a great asset to him. From the HighBaller, which is designed to massage the neck and back, he learned how effective the balls could be in hitting muscle trigger points. He put holes through the balls in order to attach an exercise band that brought the HighTrainer to life.\nSanteri\u2019s first initiative was to develop the HighTrainer so the exercise band can be put around a chair so it could reach muscle trigger points in the back while sitting at a computer or driving a car. A lock system allows this to be possible as the function enables people to multi-task while loosening tight muscles and fascia. \nWhile the HighTrainer can serves a healer, it can also be used as a training tool as well. Resistance exercises and dynamic stretching for the arms, back, chest and legs are products of the HighTrainer\u2019s multi-functional use. The portability of the HighTrainer allows it to easily fit inside a computer bag, backpack or training bag. \nIf you are looking for a solution to upper back pain or an exercise tool that can save time and money, the HighTrainer is the answer you are looking for. \nHow can you help?\nTooling and design work require a lot of resources for a young company like ours. With your help, we can produce HighTrainer quicker and more efficiently.\nWe are certain you are going to love HighTrainer and want to tell others about it.\nIn the Summer of 2018, we launched our second successful crowdfunding campaign with the third product of the HighRoller line: HighHealer. It's the world's first portable 5-in-1 foot care device which allows you to exercise areas of the foot, ankle and calf not only in less time, but more effectively. \nThe HighHealer campaign was a big success and we raised over $125k.  The campaign ended in September 2018 and our manufacturer has just started to produce the units. We will be able to start shipping earlier than we promised in the campaign, thanks to the support of our many backers!\nIn July of 2017, we launched our first Kickstarter campaign with our second product HighBaller. It's the world's first rotating massage balls on width adjustable stand. HighBaller helps to loosen up stiff, tight muscles. The product is mainly used for trigger points and for that reason it includes Trigger Point Map. The map shows you 30 common trigger points and their referred pain areas. \nThe HighBaller campaign was a big success and we raised over $100 000. It took us only 3 months after the campaign ended to ship units for the backers. For us, it is very important to keep our backers satisfied and to help people to live pain-free.\nIn 2015 we launched our first product called HighRoller. It is an innovative foam roller that spins around an axle on a height adjustable stand. The stand lets you foam roll in ergonomic and more effective positions by allowing you to relax while rolling and by focusing all the pressure on the muscle. \nHighRoller quickly gained popularity in Finland, receiving the award for best sports product of the year in 2015. \nHighRoller\u00ae Finland Ltd. was established in 2015 and is owned by six entrepreneurs who all come from a sports background. The company manufactures products for personal muscle care in Finland.  \nManufacturing plan\nWe have been working with our manufacturer for over 2 years now, Manufacturer has a long and successful track record of producing high-quality plastic products.

Transferring your checklists from paper to phone have never been easier! \n Organicer app works on both - iOS and Android platform.\nWhile putting pen to paper will always be appealing, digital calenders are becoming more and more handy. Organicer found the way that serves as a bridge between paper and digital notes. \nHandwritten notes from the paper planner are transferred to mobile APP with the help of QR codes: \n Organicer app works on both - iOS and Android platform.\nA weekly 6.00 AM to 9.30 PM table is here for you to organise your appointments and daily action plan into hourly sections. With a little help of your phone you can take a snap and transfer your appointments into Organicer app. \nOrganicer app will automatically recognize filled spaces and set reminders in your phone. You can always choose how much time before each appointment a reminder should be made. \nEach daily layout comes with a checklist to get a more transparent overview of what are your daily must-dos. Either you can use it for shopping, tasks that needs to be tackled, steps in a project etc. You can name the tags yourself.\nYou can create unlimited tags in Organicer app. There are 3 icons under a checklist in a planner\u2019s daily layout. Set tag names for these 3 icons \u2013 for example Shopping, Tasks, Projects. If you write down shopping items you need to buy, draw an X across the icon you set for shopping. You can easily edit your lists in Organicer app \u2013 either change them, share them with a friend or mark them as done. \nThere is a blank blacklined space positioned under the date in everyday layout. That is a place for your brainstorming and writing down your thoughts. Taking a snap with your phone will transfer your thoughts into the Organicer app. \nStoring your notes in the app have many advantages. They are easy to edit, manageable and light to carry since they are in your phone. You can always add more of them directly in your phone. \nThe best part about Organicer checklists and notes is that they can be instantly shared amongs your friends and family. When a task on a shared list is marked as completed it will immediately notify and update everyone else with the list.\nOur commitment to make a difference in the world we live in and those coming behind us is manifested in our active participation in causes that protect the environment and empower people around the globe. Considering Ines's background in social work, Sasha's involvement in eco and fair-trade products and their passion for travelling in was inevitable that there had to be a greater value added to the planner. \nThey were amazed by the impact Barefoot College projects have on different layers of everyday life in rural communities in developing countries. In June 2018, Ines and Sasha travelled to Tanzania, East Africa as part of the Organicer research task. They have visited the Barefoot College's educational centre and a village where their project Solar Mama's is active. They also met Mr. Xavier Juncadella, a head coordinator of Barefoot College for East Africa. \n\"When a dream comes with tennacity, hard work, planning, clear objective and is mixed up with good sould you get Organicer,\" Xavier Juncadella (East African Coordinator - Barefoot College International)\nWe believe that the liberating power of education can help people take control of their lives and live purposefully and this is the main reason why we support the Barefoot College.  \nWe are a team of 4 friends from Slovenia. Our paths crossed already in teenage years yet our professional lifes merged with the birth of Organicer, in 2017. Ines is a social worker with an artistic soul and David owns a small print shop, is a web developer and designer. David enthraled Ines for graphic design and they started collaborating on various projects. Sasha with his outstanding communication skills, tons of experience in fair-trade projects and a kind soul, fits perfectly to the pair. And then there is  unreplaceable Nika who takes care for organisational means regarding time management and controlling. \nLeft to right: Ines Mulec, David Sovec (Founders), Nika Starovasnik, Sasha Segula (Team Members)\nInes was a full-time student and being a student nowadays demands having a planner. She tried to find the perfect one but soon realised it does not exist. David's working table was always covered in self ad notes and piles of unorganised papers. He as an IT guy, had a total chaos in his office, but had his meetings well organised in his mobile app. They both looked at their needs and realised developing a smart planner would make their lives considerably easier and more productive. With that realisation, Ines's growing designing skills and David's IT knowledge \u2013 the idea of Organicer was born. Firstly, creating a functional planner with a good look - secondly, fulfilling the regular planner with an awesome app to keep your data handy in your pocket - and last but not least, contributing to improve the access to education in developing countries. Voila \u2013 Organicer has it all!  \nAs a young team committed to making a difference, we have big ideas that require ample funds to make them a reality. We do not have these funds yet.\nSince our production depends solely on the support of everyone including YOU, we would kindly ask you to back us up by investing in the KickStarter packages we have created for you as we target the $15,000 mark for a successful campaign.

Everyone just wants to go home, and will make sure they are the first to do so!\nOvertime is a humorous interactive card game for 3-6 players, where players try to finish up their assignments in any way they can, so they are the first to leave work behind. Working hard can do the trick, but having your dear colleagues \u201chelp\u201d out by giving them your share of the work... sometimes the easier way out is the best way! And all this under the watchful eye of the Boss.\nWill you be the hard and honest worker, or will you play foul and dirty to get the job done, the choice is on you!\nLooking at a card game you expect a lot of cards, right? Well, you are right! So check it out:\nIf the cards seem a little shiny, it's because they are sleeved. We like to protect our prototypes!\nShown above is everything you get with the base game!\nIncluded in the base game are:\n120 main deck cards (the white backed cards)\n30 Assignment cards (the black backed cards)\n6 starting Employee cards (The Average Joe/Joanna)\n6 reference cards\n1 time counter card and 8-sided die\n1 6-sided Work die\n40 Snooze tokens\nIn addition, all games pledged now will include \"The Kickstarter\" promo card, just for you during this campaign!\nSo that's quite a few cards, but what do they do, you ask? Well, have a look!\nPlus more! Well maybe, who know... It all depends on this next bit, and we'll just have to wait and see!\nThe workload is pilling up... how much can we do?\nPlay action cards, draw new cards and discard any extra! This is in short a description of a players turn. It's that simple! Of course, you'll also want to react to the cards your opponents play, lest they beat you to the finish line.\nHere's a quick overview of how the game is played!\nIf you want to know in more detail, check out the WIP prototype rules. We'll update the rule book along the way, as the design and campaign goes along!\nOr give it a look on board game geek on the link below:\nYou can also create your own copy and try it out yourself, using the freePrototype Print n Play files! Just have fun!\nCheck out some thoughts and comments on Overtime!\nSomething to read:\nThoughts and comments by our local board gaming news crew!\nAnd something to see:\nFrom Life of a Board Gamer (preview):\nFrom Logan Chops Reviews (quickie  full preview ):\nFrom The Kwarenteen (preview):\nFrom The Cardboard Stacker (preview):\nMore reviews coming soon!\n Let's have a look at what's in store:\nThe $1 pledge is for those that just want to support! The $1 goes a long way in the run to the final goal, and all of the support is very well appreciated!\nThis also gives access to the pledge manager at the end of the campaign, if you change your mind! \nThe P'n'P pledge is great for those that like to make the games themselves! You save yourself some waiting time for the game to arrive, and save on the shipping cost!\nThe base game pledge has everything you need to play the game, plus the exclusive \"the Kickstarter\" card! You can even grab it at a 20% discount in the first 48h!\nThe group pledge is perfect for those that want to save some on shipping! 5 games for the price of 4! Come together with your friends on this bulk order!\nThe \"Employee of the Month\" pledge offers a chance to appear in the game! In addition to everything the base game pledge has to offer and the special credits, we will make a stylized illustration of you that fits the games style! In addition, there is no extra shipping cost to your pledge, and it goes to any part of the world!\nThe \"Employee of the Year\" pledge is the very top! That special, exclusive \"the Kickstarter\" card we keep mentioning? With this pledge, that can be you! Make your way to the table off all the other backers, and in addition to getting all the same goodies as the \"Employee of the Month\", you also get a special something from the Boss!\n Of course, we want to give retailers the option of receiving all the same goodies for their store as everyone else for their store! If you are a retailer, and are interested in getting some copies at a discounted price, send us a message at retail@dazboggames.com.\nShipping is obviously a major player in any Kickstarter campaign. We have decided to complete all of our shipping through fulfillment centers, and have chosen reliable and experienced partners.\nOvertime will ship world-wide! Right now we are able to offer VAT-friendly shipping to the following areas:\nFor the rest of the world, we want to offer as fair prices as we can.

We are well aware of this, and are not taking this Kickstarter lightly. We want to make our first product an example for any that follow, and strive to make the best possible product we can muster!\n\nAs with any project, delays and chances for mistake can happen, but we are confident we can tackle them, and here's why:\n\nThe game itself is well tested and complete. While the game design is 100% complete, illustrations and artwork are at around 65% ready at the start of the campaign, and we expect them to be finished within a month after the campaign is over, if not during the course of the campaign itself. Our team is set on delivering the best product we can, and everyone is devoted to the project goal.\n\nWe already have a quote ready with a manufacturer. While this may be our first Kickstarter project, it is definitely not theirs, and we are satisfied with the quality of their previous products. We have had back and forth communication for a couple of months now to ensure the best possible and most accurate quote, so production can start without any delay. In addition, given their experience in previous Kickstarter campaigns, we are confident that they know what they are doing.\n\nWe plan on using fulfillment centers to deliver all your pledges, and have chosen experienced partners in this area, with port to door services to ensure the packages are delivered safe and in due time.\n\nAnd in the end, we are working with a team of experts in crowdfunding, who have helped many previous campaigns succeed and pull through. Any holes we may have, you can be sure they will patch up!\n\nOf course, unexpected problems can still arise. We will take on these problems as best as we can, and with full transparency, keeping you up to date along the way.

They\u2019ve changed and shaped the life of a modern man like nothing else. \nEverybody has one and daily activities without this tiny black \u201cbrick\u201d are unthinkable for most of us.\nDespite their presence little does an average person know what\u2019s inside this magical device.\nWith MAKERphone we\u2019re trying to show people that every machine you see was designed by a human being not different nor smarter than themselves.\nMAKERphone is actually an educational device disguised in the shape of a mobile phone.\nOur main goal is turning consumers into creators.\nMAKERphone steps up the game\nWe\u2019ve learned A LOT from manufacturing and shipping over 6000 MAKERbuino kits in the past year and here\u2019s a short list of most notable changes and improvements that we\u2019ve implemented in MAKERphone:\n A color screen\n Better microcontroller with our custom software\n Python programming language compatibility\n Scratch programming language compatibility\n Dedicated DAC and electronic volume controller for sound regulation and mp3 playback \n 8 individually programmable RGB LEDs for a lightshow in your palms\n Better PCB architecture for easier soldering\n New prettier box with a black touchy cut-out sponge (IMPORTANT!)\n The thing can now make calls, has a SIM card, and built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth\n RTC (real time clock) - MAKERphone now keeps time and wakes you up!\n  4G or not to 4G?\nEvery MAKERphone reward perk comes in two versions:\nStandard - which comes with a 2G GSM chipset (SIM800 chip)\n4G variant with a 4G chipset (SIM7600 chip)\nWhy would you want a 4G version of MAKERphone? \nThere are mainly two reasons you might want a MAKERphone 4G:\n1) Your carrier doesn\u2019t support 2G, or might phase out 2G in the near future or your carrier doesn\u2019t support 2G at all.\n2G will remain available in most countries at least by early 2021 (and by 2025 in Europe).\n 2G was already shut down in Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore.\n2) You want the phone to use cellular data connectivity (so, WiFi is not enough)\nIf you plan just on assembling the MAKERphone, using it for phone calls, text messages, playing music and connecting it to WiFi - you can probably just stick with the standard MAKERphone.\nIf not - you can just go ahead and adjust your perk! \nHow is MAKERphone 4G different? \nMAKERphone 4G is a version of MAKERphone wih a 4G chipset (SIM7600) instead of a 2G GSM chipset (SIM800) that\u2019s included on the standard MAKERphone. \nLTE chipsets are still more expensive than regular chipsets. \nThe other aspects of MAKERphone will work similarly on both models.\nMAKERphone teaches you about wires and chips (a.k.a. \u201chardware\u201d)\nMAKERphone is hardware.\n MAKERphone is wires.\n MAKERphone is chips.\n MAKERphone is education.\n MAKERphone runs on electricity and has the same components like your smartphone.\nIt comes in a kit form (not assembled) - you get a box with all the electronic components necessary for building your own fully working mobile phone.\nYou\u2019ll need two things to build your MAKERphone:\n1) some basic tools\n2) passion and interest in technology\nMAKERphone is FUN\nWe\u2019re living in the 21st century when kids are not only playing Fortnite. They are building their own electronic devices in their garages #badass #supersmart \nThere\u2019s internet, open-source code and wires you can buy on the internet. All knowledge is a few clicks away and you just need the willpower to start learning and doing something new!\nTry building your own mobile phone, you'll see how much fun it is!\nMAKERphone needs tools\nMAKERphone teaches you REAL electronics, it\u2019s not like those wanna-be Lego-like electronics kits.\nThus, you'll need some REAL tools and equipment for assembling your MAKERphone:\nA regular soldering iron (nothing super expensive)\nSome solder\nDiagonal cutter pliers\nA regular screwdriver\nA piece of insulating tape\nIf you're a maker, you probably already have these tools.\nIf you're a maker-to-be and still don't have these tools, don't worry as we've got you covered.\nWe've prepped a special version of the MAKERphone kit that already comes with the required tools.\nCheck out the rewards section (at the bottom of the listing) for more info about the available kit versions.\nWho is this kit for?\nBased on our experience, an 11-year-old kid should be able to assemble their own MAKERphone with a tiny bit of help from an adult. \nTherefore, the estimated age group is 11+. \nEstimated hardware build time: 7 hours. \nBuild time varies and depends on the skills of the person and if the person has ever soldered before.\nEstimated play time: unlimited\nEstimated software development and learning time: unlimited\nBuilding the MAKERphone is just the beginning. After that you'll spend numerous hours creating your own games, apps, learning about software, and experimenting with hardware.\nWhat's in the kit?\n1) MAKERphone circuit board - the main board that connects all the components in a uniform device that can work as a mobile phone\n2) MAKERphone casing - multiple sheets of acrylic cut with the power of lasers. They protect the innards and give MAKERphone this sleek look\n3) 128*160 full color TFT LCD - for playing games, displaying phone numbers and everything in between\n4) GSM module - a tiny module responsible for everything related to calling and texting other people\n5) Main microcomputer module - a dual core processor with built-in Wi-Fi, BLE, and a charging circuit\n6) Sound module - a board with a DAC (digital to analog converter) chip and a headphone jack for music playback (responsible for ringtones, alarms, game sound effects)\n7) Amplifier module - makes loud buzzes, bleeps and bloops\n8) Stick-on antenna - for superb phone signal (a.k.a. send text messages while in the bathroom)\n9) A bag with other tiny electronic components such as pushbuttons and colored button caps with a 128MB SD card preloaded with games and apps included\nWhat\u2019s in the tools pack?\nIf you choose a perk with a tools pack included, you\u2019ll get this neat wooden box filled with all the essential tools needed for  MAKERphone assembly:\n1) USB soldering iron (lightweight and portable, solder on the go!)\n2) Metal soldering iron stand\n3) USB cable for the soldering iron\n4) Screwdriver  \n5) USB power brick for powering your soldering iron\n6) Some solder\n7) Needle nose pliers\n8) Diagonal cutter pliers\nMAKERphone teaches you Python\nPython Is Everywhere\nPython is and has been for a while one of the world's most popular programming languages.\nEvery day, without realizing it, you probably use software that is written in Python and big companies use it to write all sorts of useful applications.\nPython is easy to learn, intuitive, pleasing to the eye and comes with a plethora of libraries.\nIn fact, Python\u2019s creator Guido van Rossum said that he wants to make computer programming accessible to everybody.\nThe best thing - you can code your own apps and games for MAKERphone using Python!\nMAKERphone runs a special version of python called MicroPython - which has all the basic functions with some specific ones that we\u2019ve defined in order to help you control your MAKERphone\u2019s hardware.\nPython is a type of programming language that\u2019s not compiled but instead interpreted by the device in real time.\nDespite that, we\u2019ve designed special code snippets that will \u201cfreeze\u201d your Python code and generate an executable file that can be placed on your MAEKRphone\u2019s SD card!\nMAKERphone teaches you Scratch\nScratch is a revolutionary program that makes it easy for kids as young as 5 to learn how to code with a simple drag-and-drop system of programming.\nIt already is one of the most popular programming tools for schools.\nAn awesome project called Whitecat IDE made it possible to control MAKERphone\u2019s hardware with ease! It\u2019s an open-source online tool that allows you to create code in a Scratch-like environment.\nIf you\u2019ve never coded before, this is the way to go. \nScratch\u2019s intuitive design will let you code your first MAKERphone app in mere minutes!\nMAKERphone loves Arduino\nYES, we love Arduino!\nOh, Arduino, you\u2019ve taught us to code and we\u2019ve delved into the word of electronics thanks to your board. \nThis product and our company was made possible thanks to Arduino\u2019s open-sourcefulness and community.\nAlbert: \u201cIf Arduino was a lady, I\u2019d take her to a fine dinner\u2026 with my GF\u2019s permission, of course!\u201d\nTherefore, MAKERphone is based on Arduino-compatible ESP32 microcontroller and can be programmed in Arduino IDE (based on C/C++) - the most popular programming environment for makers and hardware enthusiasts.\nMAKERphone is compatible with numerous Arduino related examples of manipulating various hardware and software components. \nIn fact, it's compatible with most Arduino software libraries available online and will work with many Arduino shields and modules with minimal or no library code modifications.\nMAKERphone takes you from Padawan to Jedi Master\nYou\u2019ve never coded before? \nYou also don\u2019t know a thing about hardware? \nAbsolutely no problemo as MAKERphone will take you from learning how to wield a soldering iron through assembling your very own fully functional mobile phone all the way to coding your very own app or game for your very own DIY mobile phone.\nWe\u2019ve segmented the learning process into levels (like in a video game):\nMAKERphone does games and apps\nMAKERphone comes with a 128MB SD card preinstalled with dozens of useful applications, tools and games.\nIt comes with all the basic mobile phone-ish apps such as contacts, SMS, phone dialer, music player, as well as a collection of neat GameBoy-inspired games. \nMAKERphone is MAKERbuino-compatible\nMAKERbuino games can be played on MAKERphone and they\u2019re in full color this time!\nMAKE your own apps and games!\nYES! \nMAKERphone is DIY in its every aspect. \nAssemble the bits and pieces together in order to create a fully functional phone and get down to coding your own games and apps.\nOur comprehensive tutorials will lead you through every step of your creative process.\nThere are three main ways to create a game/app for your MAKERphone:\n Scratch! \nA.k.a. colorful blocks that you drag and drop together in order to make your first app.\n Python! \nUse one of the most popular programming languages used in almost every educational institution or school that teaches people coding. \nArduino (C/C++)\nThe most popular programming platform for makers and DIY-ers is MAKERphone-compatible and we like it a lot.\nAfter coding your app, you can compile it to an \u201cexecutable\u201d binary file and put it on your MAKERphone\u2019s SD card.\nApps located on the SD card are accessed through MAKERphone\u2019s main menu via the \u201cApps\u201d icon.\nWe\u2019ve coded a programming library with sets of commands that let you easily:\ndevelop in-app menus and other GUI-related content\nplay and develop sound FX and background music\ndraw, display and animate bitmaps\ncontrol MAKERphone\u2019s hardware (i.e. make calls, read files from SD card, flash LEDs)\nCircuitMess world\nCircuitMess world is a place for MAKERphone users to share their creations, exchange knowledge, and download programs made by others as well as a collection of tutorials, guides and MAKERphone-related documentation.\nEvery game or app in CircuitMess world is open-source and available with a downloadable source code along with a compiled binary file that you can load directly on your device\u2019s SD card.\nTo put it simply, you can take a look at the code of every MAKERphone compatible game or app, learn something new, change the code and implement parts of the code in your own project.\nOur tutorials collection consists of two main parts:\n1) Official tutorials and guides written by the MAKERphone team\n2) User-created tutorials that everyone can write and share a bit of knowledge with other creators\nCustomize your MAKERphone's UI \nMAKERphone is customizable.\nExpress yourself by customizing your phone's UI.\nThis can be done through MAKERphone's settings or editing a setup file on MAKERphone's SD card. \nMAKERphone does multimedia\nMAKERphone plays music, shows photos and runs videos.\nMAKERphone does multimedia!\nIt supports mp3 files and you can set your favorite song as a ringtone by simply dragging and dropping it on MAKERphone\u2019s SD card and selecting it in the menu.\nMAKERphone GLOWS!\n8 individually controllable RGB LEDs with 60FPS refresh rate make your MAKERphone glow (it\u2019s literally glowing).\nControl LEDs for neat in-game or in-app effects.\nMake your MAKERphone turn red when you\u2019re low on health or shooting projectiles in your mobile game.\nUse RGB LEDs as a giant flashlight or just as a giant notification light. \nMAKERphone has (wicked) specs\nOh, so you\u2019re that smarty pants that talks about teraflops and other imaginary words?\nWell, here you go.

Then a smart watering reminder is perfect for you.\nPlantRay - smart plant watering reminder\nNature, vegetation, clean and fresh air are just some of the benefits brought to us by the company of plants. Nature is a part of us and it is right that we have a part of nature also in our homes and at our workplace. Plants liven up our surroundings. Numerous studies show that plants lessen the stress and improve our concentration, productivity and wellbeing. Beside that, they also purify and humidify the air. \nWe hear too often that if a plant dies, we should just buy a new one. But, is this really the way we want to act? No, we do not! We want plants to last for years, not just months or weeks.\nWith PlantRay there will be no wilted plants anymore\nTo water or not to water the plants?  Sometimes we simply forget to water the indoor plants. Or we water them too much and they drown. PlantRay is perfectly suitable for home or office use.\nWith PlantRay everyone in the office will know the right time to water the plants\nIt's simple to use. PlanRay will remind you when the time to water the plant is perfect.\n\"When was the last time I watered that flower in the corner?\" \nPlantRay helps us grow plants. It will remind you to water the plants - so simple and useful.\nEverybody knows that the most important part of growing plants is correct watering. The majority of plants cannot grow well precisely because of too much or too little water. Often, when caring for plants, the most common issue is that we simply forget to water the indoor plants, or we water them too often. PlantRay is a device that measures the humidity of soil. When the soil is dry enough, the device warns us that the plant needs to be watered. In this way the plants do not get under stress and they grow beautifully. Whoever notices that the PlantRay beside the plant is pulsating red, he or she should simply water the plant.\nWater the plant when the PlantRay blinks red! PlantRay will turn back to blue when the plant gets enough water.\nPlantray is a very nice gift.\nHow to use PlantRay?\nPlantRay has 4 programmes for different types of plants: for plants that prefer dry climate, need regular watering and swampy soil and for special program for orchids.\nYou can change the programme by pressing the button.\nInsert the battery and choose the programme. Put the PlantRay into the soil up to the mark. The device has to stand firmly in the soil. Water the plant so that the device sets up correctly. From then on, PlantRay constantly measures the humidity of the soil and when needed its red LED light will remind you to water the plant.\nHow does PlantRay work?\nPlantRay \u2013 the smart moisture reminder measures humidity by means of an advanced capacitive humidity sensor, which knows how to measure the effect of the minerals in the soil. The collected data is saved in the memory and processed so that it can get adjusted simultaneously. Every time the plant is watered, the device adjusts to the new conditions. This is why PlantRay will always remind you at the right time when the plant needs to be watered. \nPlantrRay graph shows how much water is in the soil (weight), data from the sensor, and colour of blinking\nMeaning of the lightning (the lightning turns off during the night)\nWhen PlnatRay blinks red, it is time to water your plant.\nWhat is inside?\n Why is PlantRay a technically advanced product?\nThe sensor operates at high frequencies to eliminate the influence of minerals to the measurement, therefore the measurement is very accurate\nThe sensor contains an algorithm that determines the point of saturation of soil with water, and continuously calculates the limit levels for \u201cwatered\u201d (blue LED), \u201cnormal\u201d (green LED) and \u201cdry\u201d soil (red LED)\nPlantRay\u2019s sound signal warns us of the critical dryness of the soil\nThe light sensor deactivates visual and sound signals at night\nThe brightness of the LED flashing is adjusted to the light of the surroundings.\nThe sensor is able to adapt to some changes in the soil (soil gets denser)\nSoftware-optimized operation allows the battery to function even 2 years and more\nHow far are we with the development?\nWe have been developing PlantRay for over a year and a half. We invested in the engineering of the equipment for injecting plastic parts. We also made some test devices for promotional intent. We developed the version 1.2, which is now being offered on the Kickstarter platform. The new version has an entirely new electronic circuit system, which is more precise, resisting to temperature and insensitive to conductivity of soil.\nPlantRay development, prototypes, and evaluation of sensor moisture sensor\nWhy do we need funds?\nWe have developed the device with our own resources and produced and tested it in limited quantities. Now we need you \u2013 backers \u2013 to help us with the very last step \u2013 raising funds. Raised funds would give our project additional impetus to bring the device in your homes. With raised funds we would finance the production on a larger scale, so that we could achieve an affordable price. We would also buy additional equipment for manufacturing our products. \nRewards for supporters:\n  PlantRay will come in bunch of different colours. You will select the colour in the survey after the campaign ends.\nDelivery time rewards\n  We will deliver first 3000 units in December 2018.\nAbout the team\nAndrej Nastran \u2013 Mastermind of the PlantRay project. \"In my free time I like to develop different kinds of electronic gadgets, most of them are in connection with different plants.

This book is for music, which is so important to me. But it is a book for the new generation, a shout out to everybody involved in music.

We need to help the scene stay alive. \u201cCloud Arrangers\u201d is the work of my lifetime.\nIt is also my first sole publication after \u201cJazzy-ga!\u201d, a catalogue which accompanied my first international exhibition at the 1996 Saalfelden Jazz Festival in Austria, one of the most important festivals in Europe.\nNow that 22 years have passed since I last published a book of music photography \u2013 the most recent eight of them spent on planning \u201cCloud Arrangers\u201d \u2013 it is finally time to release my work into the open.

I didn't want to include any picture in which the people depicted would not have liked themselves. The book presents the work closest to me, my best pictures, mostly shot in black-and-white with a few exceptions in color. Some of the earliest photos are right from the beginning of my path \u2013 like the 1986 Miles Davis concert in Belgrade.

This is the magic I love so much, and which is presented in the book. I hope this will become apparent to you, too. My intentions with the book? To chronicle the happenings in the world of music during a stretch of time (namely, that of my lifetime), and to make sure these concerts will not be forgotten so easily. I hope this book will show the world how important musicians are, and how boundless their creativity.\n\nI feel privileged for having had the chance of meeting so many wonderful people, of hearing so much good music, and of having seen a bit of the world.

I have watched him when he has been the festival photographer at a festival in Santa Teresa Di Galura, Sardinia, and when he has been crawling in front of a lot of different stages, trying to get the best photos. And every time his pictures are so beautiful. We have been on the same concerts, taking photos, but afterwards, when we look at the pictures, it looks like he has been to another, and much better concert than me!

He shows a keen interest in photography applying it in his professional work and as a leisure activity. This has resulted in multiple exhibitions in art galleries across Poland.\nLately, due to his life-long passion for music he has been mostly focusing on designing posters for various musical events and festivals, and music CDs/LPs cover layouts. Cooperation with NotTwo Records, Polnisches Institut Wien / Polish Institute in Vienna / Austria, and Warsaw music venue Pardon, To Tu resulted in last 11 years in more than 80 CDs/LPs cover layouts and nearly 200 posters for jazz and improvised music events of musicians such as Ken Vandermark, Peter Br\u00f6tzmann, Charles Gayle, Joe McPhee, Evan Parker, Alexander von Schlippenbach, William Parker, Hamid Drake, Mats Gustafsson, Dave Rempis, Peter Evans, Marc Ribot, Paal Nilssen-Love, Ingebrigt H\u00e5ker-Flaten, Miko\u0142aj Trzaska, Michael Gira, Thurston Moore, KONONO No 2, Ebo Taylor, and many, many others.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks and challenges when publishing a photo book include the possibility of delay, however my collaborators are very experienced at dealing with the production and printing challenges involved in making exceptional photography books.

Not only for themselves, but also for their families, their workplace and for our society. \nMotherhood is an emotional roller-coaster that can leave you feeling battered and bruised.  \nEver wish you had a little helper, cheering you on from the side-lines? Helping you navigate those turbulent waves, lifting you out of the dark waters? Helping you find a little more balance, a little more calm, a little more joy in each and every day? \nOur new mobile app will be just that \u2013 your pocket rocket of nourishment and connection \u2013 supporting, motivating and inspiring you to not only survive, but thrive in your motherhood journey.\nDesigned by mums for mums\nThe Nourish App is the brainchild of Sara Campin, an Oxford University graduate, strategy consultant and a personal development coach. After struggling with her emotional wellbeing after the birth of both her kids and in juggling the pressures of a stressful job and modern mothering, Sara spotted a huge gap in the market for a simple, accessible, \u2018go-to\u2019 resource to support mothers in their emotional wellbeing.\nSara has brought together a team of leading well-being experts, who all have first-hand experience of how turbulent the motherhood ride can be, plus the knowledge tools and expertise to make a significant difference to other mothers and their families.\nWe\u2019re revolutionising motherhood\nWe're on a mission to make good mental health and positive wellbeing easy and accessible to ALL mothers. \nWe believe maternal mental health matters  \nPerinatal maternal mental health is an under diagnosed and under-treated public health issue. Many woman suffer on alone, without support, often because of the stigma associated with mental health, and the fear of being labelled a \u2018failure\u2019 or a \u2018bad mother\u2019.\nDespite the figures there is still limited emphasis on preparing woman for the birth of a mother \u2013 the most significant physical and psychological transition a woman will ever experience. Plus, only limited support or \u2018go-to\u2019 resources exist to help mothers in their emotional wellbeing throughout their journey.\nWe\u2019re on a mission to create a brighter future for mothers and their families.\nImagine a world where no mother is ever alone on her motherhood journey. \nInstead every mother has a personal support team in her pocket, helping her love and nourish herself, and ride those turbulent waves of motherhood. \nWhere all mothers have access to their best selves. Not only for themselves, but also for their families, their communities, their workplaces and for our society as a whole. \nWe believe self-care is healthcare. \nWe believe self-care isn\u2019t selfish. We believe it's the best thing a mother can do for herself and for her kids. We believe self-care is healthcare for our physical, emotional, energetic and mental health.\nIn prioritising self-care and mental wellbeing we can protect the mind and body from the impact of life\u2019s stresses and traumatic events, and enable the adoption of healthy lifestyles.\nMental wellbeing is associated with better interpersonal relationships and socially healthier societies.   \nIt helps people achieve their potential, realise their ambitions, cope with adversity, work productively and contribute effectively to their communities and to society.\nWe believe that with access to the right tools & support, all mothers can find greater joy in their path. We want to make this a reality for all mothers. \nBecause every mother deserves the right to enjoy motherhood! \nThe Nourish app will be\u2026..  \nYour personal champion  \nOur app will send you inspiring, uplifting and supportive messages to encourage you to be kind to yourself and nourish your mind.\nYour support team  \nOur design and content will have an interactive feel and interactive features, to give you a personal and human touch. All our content will be created by a team of passionate mums, who also happen to include some of the leading UK experts in maternal wellbeing. \n All our content will be linked to its contributor, so that you get the sense of the real people behind it and so that you can find more of the things that you love, should you wish.   \nYour daily dose of nourishment  \nOur design and user experience will be both calming and uplifting \u2013 a dose of nourishment in itself. We want you to come away feeling nurtured, nourished, motivated or uplifted, depending on your needs and preferences in that moment.  \nUniquely designed to support the needs of mothers  \nOur content will be tailored to mothers and the specific emotions and challenges they face at different stages in the motherhood journey.\nVersion 1, our Minimal Viable Product (MVP), will include some initial content that will benefit all mums at every stage, some specific content tailored for new mums and some specific content for working mums.\nAs we grow, our hope is to create and share content to support the typical emotions and challenges across ALL stages of the motherhood journey and maybe one day for dads too.\nA broad range of tools depending on your needs and preferences in that moment  \nEveryone\u2019s self-care needs, interests, preferences and goals are different. So what one person finds nourishing differs from another and even our own needs will change over time. \nOur app will include a range of evidence-based tools and strategies for you to explore, depending on your preferences and needs in that moment. We are not just a mama meditation app. You will be able to access practical, bite-sized content across a broad range of disciplines from yoga, to mindfulness, to breathing, to CBT techniques and nutrition, grouped under Mind, Body and Breath.   \nContent will also be available in a range of different formats from text, to audio, to video. \nTips and tools to not only survive, but thrive  \nThe most effective kind of self-care is a proactive approach. By regularly topping up your energy bank balance you will be more resilient in the face of life\u2019s inevitable challenges. \nThe Nourish app will also contain a library of inspiration on self-care for use in any moment, based on Suzy Reading\u2019s Vitality Framework.\nAn app to support, motivate and inspire EVERY mother  \nOur app will be for ALL mums. For new mums, for pregnant mums, for working mums, for stay at home mums, for mentally well mums, for mentally ill mums, for single mums, for married mums. For every single mother.   \nWe\u2019re all about social impact  \nWe\u2019re a group of mums with the life experience and the expertise to make a real difference to mother and their families. This is our shared passion. This is what matters to us \u2013 spreading love, kindness and the tools and benefits of self-care.  \nOur focus is social impact and not financial return. In an ideal world we would make our app free so that we can help everyone. However, we will need to charge a small subscription fee to make the Nourish App sustainable and ensure that we are able to deliver enhanced content and functionality overtime. But, we really want to keep the costs to the user as low as possible, and definitely less than the price of a single coffee a month (!), so that we can make it accessible to as many people as possible. \nWe also want to avoid advertising as we believe it creates additional unwanted stimuli that is detrimental to our mental wellbeing and doesn\u2019t fit with our brand ethos.\nWe\u2019re taking a holistic approach to maternal mental health  \nWe are all about prioritising mental wellbeing to protect our mental health. But we also know that every one of us has the capacity to suffer from a mental health problem. We\u2019re therefore taking a holistic approach and the majority of any profits we make will be donated to mental health charities.\nWe need your help!  \nBecause our focus is social impact and because we\u2019re a social enterprise, we\u2019re less attractive to typical commercial investors, and even impact investors, who all want to know where their big bucks are going to come from.  \nAlmost everyone involved in the project so far has donated their time, expertise and passion for free. However, to build the technology and create high quality content, we need a bit of hard cash.  \nWe\u2019ve got an important mission, bags of passion, a fantastic team and a great design. But we need your money to help build the technology and launch our Minimal Viable Product so that we can start spreading the love and helping mums.\nWe will use the money we raise on Kickstarter to finalise the detailed tech design and build our Minimal Viable Product (MVP) in iOS. The subsequent development of the app on the Android platform and the recording and editing of content will be self-funded. We hope to use this MVP to not only start helping mothers immediately but also to attract further financing to expand our reach through marketing, PR & strategic partnerships.\nCheck out our fabulous rewards!  \nWe\u2019ve created an info-graphic so you can see what\u2019s on offer in return for your support. We realise there's lots to choose from so sorry about that. Hopefully though something for everyone!\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nThe Nourish Team  \nSara Campin, Founder of Nourish is an Oxford University graduate, strategy consultant and a personal development coach. Sara has spent the last 15 years managing and delivering complex, multi-disciplinary projects and programmes in the life-sciences and charitable sectors. She began her career at Accenture, where she led the design and development of a number of custom development products.  \nOur founding team of experts cover a wide range of specialist areas including psychology, mindfulness, yoga, hypnobirthing, Pilates and personal training. However, our ambition is to continue to grow the team and expertise involved, so we can deliver an even broader range of evidence-based tips and tools, including tips on nutrition, to help mothers thrive.  \nSuzy Reading author of The Selfcare Revolution, psychologist & yoga teacher  \nDr Rebecca Moore perinatal psychiatrist, birth trauma expert  \nEmma Svanberg (The Mumologist) perinatal\u202f\u202fpsychologist,\u202fMake Birth Better\u202fcampaigner  \nAnya Hayes (Mother\u2019s Wellness Toolkit) author of The Super Mum Myth, wellness & Pilates expert  \nOlivia Horne happiness coach, meditation mentor & Relax Kids coach\nElizabeth Davies (The Mummy Coach) pre/postnatal personal trainer & postnatal doula  \nJo Kaye (The Breathe Academy) accredited mindfulness coach, trained at London Meditation  \nDr Catherine Marshall - General Practitioner with special interest in woman\u2019s health  \nOur team includes robust clinical expertise, to ensure we have appropriate oversight and signposting within the app.  \nWe\u2019ve partnered with Kamino, an experienced and reputable mobile app development agency. Kamino\u2019s core focus is in building high quality mobile applications that offer users a seamless experience that just works. Their portfolio covers a wide range of sectors including health. They have a wealth of experience within the team to deliver a robust and comprehensive solution.\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you!  \nThis is a woman-founded start-up and a social-enterprise and we are extremely grateful for the support and enthusiasm we've met with thus far. If you have any questions about this campaign, suggestions, or ideas for collaborations, please get in touch.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduct evolution: we\u2019re unique \u2013 one of a kind that has not been done before. We\u2019re really excited about bringing it to market, but until we\u2019ve launched our first version (our MVP) we won't be able to validate exactly what resonates with users and what doesn\u2019t. To help mitigate this risk we will be running an alpha trial process through the MVP development phase and will also run beta testing with an expanded group. We will use the feedback received to course correct as and when necessary.\n\nSocial impact focus: as we\u2019ve said, our focus is impact and not financial return which does make us less attractive to investors. But we believe by charging a small fee for the app, we can make it not only affordable for all mothers, but also support a sustainable business model. \n\nOnly the start: the money we\u2019re raising will help us build our Minimal Viable Product. We\u2019ll need more cash to build all the enhanced features we\u2019d love to build, including a community dimension to the app. We\u2019ll also need more cash to create and publish even more relevant content across all stages of the motherhood journey. Finally, we\u2019ll need more cash to expand our reach and get our app in front of more mums. However, our MVP will be a central pillar for future funding conversations and a successful crowd funding campaign will help us demonstrate the purpose and need. \n\nMulti-platform: because we want to make our app accessible to each and every mother. We need to develop it on both iOS and Android platforms. This makes it more complex and costly to build and manage both the initial product and future enhancements. We considered using a cross platform development framework, but our view is that the higher quality of user experience achievable using native development justifies the increased cost of this approach.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Loving Kindness", "descp": "Thank you SO much for helping us spread love, kindness and joy!

Our quest was to think outside the box, pushing boundaries away from both traditional board game packaging and traditional book design. We aim to create a highly unique collection of board games for an international audience using high-quality design and production standards.\nGamebook is not like most books\u2014it\u2019s interactive. People have been playing games for all of recorded history, and there is evidence to indicate we played them before recorded history, too. We believe that games have always been an important tool for human social interaction, and Gamebook is designed to encourage this. Each game included in the Gamebook has multiple variations requiring different strategies and approaches, making each game yours to play and explore in your own unique way.\nGamebook is a collection of ancient abstract strategy board games: Surakarta, Tablut, Pachisi, Alquerque, Mu Torere, Senet, Nine Men\u2019s Morris and Stern-halma.\nWe have searched the rich history of board games for untold stories. Gamebook contains eight abstract strategy board games, carefully selected from the rich world gaming heritage. Gamebook encompasses history, theory and practice of selected board games.\nAssemble four boards of the Gamebook to create a new board game specially designed and developed for this edition!\nWho is Gamebook for?\nGamebook contains board games ranging from two to six players. The board games were chosen based on their difficulty, from basic board games to ones requiring more complex strategies. Gamebook is appropriate for many different ages, so don't worry about who you invite to game night! :)\nOn the left side Hana and on the right side Ema Jesih are playing board game Alquerque.\nAesthetics and Design\nAll selected games are re-designed to a unified graphic language, built of basic geometrical forms by a limited range of colours. Each game has been refined to include only the essential elements necessary for gameplay, and each game board is treated as abstract art based on the textures of different drawing materials.\nMagic Binding\nGamebook features two innovative designs - the box for game pieces is also the book's backbone that holds the pages together with simple and very effective magnetic binding. Every page is simply plucked out when you want to play, and put back in; you can arrange the book as you like.\nFigures, sticks and a dice\nGamebook includes everything you need to start playing any of the board games. The backbone of the book contains a concealed department for all small figures, six two-sided sticks and a dice. Before the invention of dice, most board games were played with sticks, stones or cowrie shells. The flat side of the stick is the \u201cheads up\u201d side. Different combinations give different scores, giving a totally different dynamic to certain games.\nBooklet of History and Rules\nWhere did board games come from? How did our ancestors play board games? Which abstract strategy board games concepts have spread around the world? The answers to these questions can be found in the booklet of History & Rules. The booklet is included on the back page of the book. You can pluck it out and read it separately so it won\u2019t disturb the game flow of the game you're playing.\nRewards\nStretch goals\nGamebook trilogy\nResearch about board games has revealed a whole new world. The history of board games is full of mysteries, myths and secrets. We have created a collection of forgotten board game classics. These games are the foundation of so many modern board games. We have chosen eight board games for the first edition of Gamebook, but we would love to continue our investigation and search for lost board games around the world. There are so many more games to find, explore, study and publish. We want to make a Gamebook collection \u2014 possibly a Gamebook trilogy.\nHibird Books\nOur goal is to establish our own publish company called Hibird Books. Our vision is to publish extraordinary books and to connect unseen combinations of media and materials. Hibird Books main interests are special editions, interactive books, book-objects and artist\u2019s books. Help us bring our Gamebook project to life and many more unusual books will follow. Only time will tell where the path will end. Join us! Back us up. :)\nBook Specification\nBook dimensions: 32 x 28 x 2,2 cm (12.6\"x11\"x0.86\") \nGame boards dimensions: 28 x 28 cm (11\"x11\") \nWeight: 1,2 kg (2.64 Ibs)\nMaking Gamebook prototypes\nPLAY\n\nGamebook is mostly handcrafted. We have made several prototypes to find the best materials and a suitable shape for the book. Almost the entire book is made using recycled materials. The core of the pages and box are cardboard, and we used recycled paper for the pages and for the History & Rules booklet. The figures and dice are made of wood. The rest is a secret! If you are interested in the story of Gamebook\u2019s creation, especially the making of Gamebook prototypes you can follow us (Hibird Books) on Instagram or Facebook.\nPeople behind the project \n Founders:\nHana Jesih (founder of Gamebook) is a book designer & illustrator who loves to make mind-maps, travel and is taller than Peter. You can see her other book design projects on her website or you can take a look at her gallery space on her Instagram page.\nPeter Plantan (cofounder of Gamebook) is an architect who hates and loves everything at the same time and is a fan of Anthony Bourdain. You can get to know his world view on his Instagram page.\nVideo Credits:\nNejc Gazvoda is a film director and writer. He was in charge of the script and directing the video. He wanted to use slider in the video, we made his wish come true.\nMarko Pirc takes credit for photography and shooting the presentation video. His favourite sandwich is chips with sausage and chips on the top.\nVoice over: Michael Manske\nSong: \"Jadranje\", from the original soundtrack for the film \"Pot v raj\" composed by Andi Koglot and Laren Polic Zdravi\u010d.\nSpecial thanks to NEJC GAZVODA, friend no.1. Big thanks to STA\u0160 STANKOVI\u010c and MARKO PIRC from LUMULABS for all advices. They also let us work on the presentation in their office and lent us their equipment and gadgets. MARU\u0160A HREN for all her tips and help with bookbinding, MILENA JAKOVLJEVI\u010c from MEDIODROM for tips in mediamarketing, JURE TURK for IT support, NIKO KLAN\u0160EK for business support, GREGA PLANTAN for legal advice, SAMO KRALJ for producing wooden playing sticks, IVO VESELI\u010c for his own versions of texts and our FAMILY for moral support and food. Thanks also to all other friends who helped us in any kind of way. ;)\nTimetable\nWe have spent the last year researching board game history and designing and testing our Gamebook. All aspects of our designs have been thoroughly considered at each stage of the product creation process, from concept design, materials and technical aspects to numerous prototypes. It\u2019s been a wonderful journey, and now we\u2019re almost ready for the manufacturing stage. Only with the help of Kickstarter and, most importantly, our backers will we finally be able to bring our Gamebook project to life. If you know any friends, family, colleagues or random strangers who may be interested in our project, please help us spread the word! You can expect to receive your order by November 2018.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDuring the process of making the Gamebook prototypes, we collaborated with different print shops and book manufacturers. On a technical level, the pages and binding, even though they are innovative, shouldn't present any major manufacturing difficulties. The final look and materials may change a little bit in the production process, but only to improve the durability and sustainability of the product. The main task will be to manufacture a box for figures and dice that satisfies the level of craftsmanship we stand for. Considering all the facts, we believe that everything is possible if you stand by your goals and believe in your product. We believe in ours. We will try to keep the process as simple as possible.

We'd love to invite every creative computer user to STEP ON IT. \nThe usage of ActiveFootrest could not be easier - just move your feet to reach the four foot switches for the tasks you use the most often, like scrolling a page up and down. It is that easy.\nWhy you need one\nSitting too long in front of a computer? We know, everyone is tempted to slouch, or to cross their legs while sitting. Doing this day in day out is not healthy.\nHowever, it would all be different if we could use our legs to interact with a computer.\nTwo years ago, we decided to make the best ergonomic, comfortable and useful footrest we possibly can. With a Bluetooth connection to a computer to make it future proof and to avoid having more cables under the desk.\nA surprisingly new way to use your feet while working\nNow here it is. An innovative computer footrest that will assist you to sit comfortably in a neutral position, and will encourage you to use your leg muscles while you sit. So how about hands-free scrolling a page up and down while reading the news and enjoying a cup of coffee?\nYou can remap the foot-keys to whatever you like. Imagine having shortcuts like Undo, Print, Copy, Paste, Run, alt/TAB, etc. at your feet. If you keep reading, we believe that you will soon find plenty of creative ideas to use this awesome device. We have interviewed writers, designers, analysts, gamers, architects, engineers, musicians, programmers .. and they we all very enthusiastic and quite eager to get their feet on it.\nKeep moving! Use your legs to boost your productivity and improve blood circulation. Our ActiveFootrest can be a better alternative to a standing desk.\nActiveFootrest will instantly improve your sitting posture, while the movement of your legs will improve blood circulation. By elevating the feet, it takes stress off the upper legs during extended operating periods.\nIt takes a few minutes - not days - to get used to it! \"I'm not giving it back!\" was the usual response from our early test users.\nHands-free reading? No problem.\nGive some credit to your legs and veins. By moving your feet just a bit, which is exactly what you should be doing often while sitting, you can easily reach the four foot-switches for the tasks that you use often. \nWhy not use our legs to interact with a computer?\nInvest in your health and boost your productivity. With ActiveFootrest, you will feel better and be more efficient at the same time. You won\u2019t need to worry about your sitting posture, and your legs will stay active while sitting.  Using it is so easy and a great fun, too.\nCustomise it and be creative\nThe default operation works great. It is the UP and DOWN navigation with the outer switches, and HOME and END keys with the inner ones. This relaxes your wrists considerably and saves you a lot of time. Just think about how fast you can select from the list of possible values in those Completion mode drop down lists as you program. Another reason for choosing the common navigation commands for default behaviour is clear - there's no harm if you just fidget and stomp on the switches unintentionally. \nBut hey, you can be creative, the ActiveFootrest is fully adjustable. Use it for any shortcut keystroke combination you use often, like UNDO, COPY, PASTE etc. Modifier keys are supported for advanced settings.\nDefine any shortcut you need. Simple or advanced key remapping is supported.\nActiveFootrest comes in three leg colors\nModern office footrest reinvented\nTake a break\nWe propose a great leg exercise for taking breaks during a workday. Play our daily one-minute-challenge game to relax, get your blood circulation going and train your feet reflexes. You will be able set the daily reminder to alert you when it is time for a break. \nDesign and Build Quality\nWe have succeeded in solving the problem of ergonomic feet positioning. This led to a design that is a joy to use. We decided to use only the best quiet mechanical foots switches, solid wood and best materials throughout the design. \nNatural solid beechwood and thick natural American walnut veneer were selected and pressed together for best comfort and exquisite looks. We are proud to share with you this unique blend of design with modern craftsmanship.\nThe upper wood surface is CNC milled to give it a unique 3D pattern. It is then hand sanded and varnished. Wait until you get your reward to appreciate just how good it feels to rest your feet on this thing. \nNatural beechwood and American walnut for best comfort. Robust foot switches are borrowed from guitar effects-pedals.\nSmaller buttons won our functional testing. They allow for minimum foot movements to reach the switches. This ensures fast response and no unnecessary strain on your knees.\nDetailed Specifications\nW: 500 mm (19.7 inch)   D: 280 mm (11.0 inch)   H: 50 mm (1.97 inch)   Weight: 3.2 kg (7.05 pounds)\n4 mechanical quiet momentary foot switches\nBluetooth 4.0 technology\nBattery: 2 x AA (LR6)\nSupported computers and operating systems: Windows and macOS. Computer with a Bluetooth receiver or USB Bluetooth adapter.\nDefault key mapping (no drivers needed): outer foot switches - arrow up, arrow down / inner switches - Home, End\nKey remapping software: included for Windows; supports free third-party key remapping apps for macOS\nFoot support and housing for electronics: American walnut veneer pressed to both sides of a 18mm thick plate of solid beech wood. Hand oiling and varnishing combination to preserve the wood's organic characteristics\nMetal legs: Cut by a computer guided plasma cutter. Powder painted. Rubber grips to protect flooring\nShipping Plan\nWe have been working on the ActiveFootrest project for two years now. The production prototypes work great and the manufacturers are standing by for production of all necessary parts. Hand finishing, testing and assembly will be done by us.\nSa\u0161o and Andrej in the lab.
