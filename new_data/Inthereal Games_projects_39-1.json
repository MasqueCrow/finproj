Mix your favourite themes from Pirates, Robots, Jungle, Vampires and now Ninja and Gangsters. Build attractions and upgrade them to match blueprints, stack up towering rides, or simply make the most cash.\nWatch out though - your competitors may pay off the safety inspectors to close your rides or hire hooligans to vandalise your park! How will you get revenge? \nWhatever happens, it's bound to be... \n                Unfair funded on day 1, with 4 core theme packs, and raced through stretch goals that added more content and better components. \nUnfair is now stretched to perfection. The game is as good as it can possibly be right now. See details below. \nContent in detail\nThe core boost to Unfair is the 2 new theme packs backers added:\nNinja theme pack, 56 extra cards enabling a 5-player game that we now include in the box. \nGangster theme pack, 56 cards for even more replayability and Unfair money-making fun. \n6 theme packs in total powers up Unfair with 112 extra cards, that's 50% extra content from where we started, for FREE! Now every version of Unfair will contain these extra theme packs.\nKickstarter backers also get these 12 fully-playable sneak peek cards from future expansions. These won't be released in the core retail edition of Unfair - those guys will need to wait ages till they come out in expansions.\nThere are many more card and component upgrades to Unfair. See the Whats in the Box? and Stretch Goals sections below for more details. If you need more information or videos about Unfair game play, components, reviews, shipping or more about Unfair, scroll on :)\nAnd thank you all sincerely for an unbelievably fun, positive and successful campaign. \nKim Brebach\nDirector\nGood Games Publishing\nPlay events, build cards to your theme park tableau from the market or your hand, and draw cards in quick single-action turns. \n\nEvery player has a rival, every strategy has a counter, and every action matters in this accessible yet deep and replayable game.\nUnfair now comes with 6 packs based on popular funfair themes. Combine one theme pack per player to create a shared pool of cards. Each combination of themes gives a different play experience.\nJungle for more space to fit guests in,\nPirates for taller rides,\nRobots for efficient attraction building,\nVampires for the finest quality attractions and staff.\nNinja for more errr 'interaction' and tricks\nGangsters for brutally refined money making strategies\nThen shuffle up the Park, Event, Blueprint and City Event cards into decks, deal out players' starting cards and coins, and you're ready to go.\n  Build thrill rides, leisure rides, theatres, sideshows, food outlets and nature areas from the market or your hand. Upgrade them with features, guest services, themes and more.\n\nLook for special powers and combos to build as efficiently as you can. Attractions with lots of stars bring in more guests and money, but you'll need to defend them from your competitors or risk losing their income for a round.\nScore big points at game end for building tall attractions.\n  Once you reach 5-star guest appeal, build one of your 2 powerful Super Attractions to pull in the crowds and give you a unique strategic focus. Master yours for a winning edge!\n  Hire staff with unique abilities to get ahead of the game. But don't expect to keep them forever - everyone wants the best staff!\n  With each event card, you choose whether to boost your park OR mess with your competitors. You can stockpile a few events to defend yourself, or bluff while you hold out for powerful event combos.\n  You've gotta have your secret plans, right?

Our crazy powerful Gen Con promo card into the Kickstarter version only. This won't be in the retail box but it will be available from the Board Game Geek store. This is only for special occasions - use with caution!\nThat's where we got to in 30 thrilling days of our Unfair kickstarter campaign. You backers have been wonderful. Thank you all. We owe you the best game we can make for you now.\n  We pre-pack Unfair in a robust mailer box at the factory, and use quality fulfillment companies in each region to keep shipping costs as low as possible so you can back more games! USD$15 for shipping is included in the core pledge tier, and backers in some regions will need to pay additional fees as follows:\n  Unfair is the beautiful & lovingly cynical brainchild of talented new designer Joel Finch. It's literally a 5 year labour of love, designed so that he could finally play a game he truly loves with his wife Kate. The result? An accessible, inclusive, flexible, deep, re-playable and fun game we are excited to release as our second game.\nPacked with beautiful art by Mr Cuddington and Phillipe Poirier, Unfair will take you back to theme park days under bright blue skies where everything was awesome. But dig a little deeper and you'll discover that running a competitive theme park requires some tough choices. Every layer of the game is detailed, thematic and constantly surprising, from the name of cards, to their incredible art, card abilities and even flavour text.\nUnfair is a rich gaming experience, as fun or ruthless as you make it. We think you will keep finding more in it, play after play. And with your help, there is more to come.\nView the high quality PnP files & Rules.\nWe have the rules, the design, the art for the four initial themes already done - so why do we need Kickstarter?\nFirst, we want many gamer eyeballs on Unfair, before it's released, while we can still fix any problems. Retail distribution is very one-way, whereas with Kickstarter we can hear from players while your feedback can make a difference.\nSecond, while four themes is enough to play the game exactly as intended, additional themes would add variety. We have two more theme packs tested and ready to reveal as stretch goals. We want to include them in the main game but we need your support to do that.\nWe also use Kickstarter to recoup the cost of deluxe art and component quality for the games we make. So it gives you a richer game experience for your money, helps us gauge interest in our games, provides global marketing for them, and helps them sell better in retail eventually.\n\nIn short, with your help through Kickstarter, we can make games more awesome.\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe limit risks by offering a limited number of stretch goals we would otherwise include in later expansions in Unfair. This way we can complete production by October, have games to you in Nov / Dec, and be in stores by Christmas.\n\nWe have run a kickstarter campaign for Monstrous before. People loved the production quality but we delivered later than promised and learned some lessons. This time we will be better. \n\nAs with Monstrous, we printed a 50 copy pre-production print run to check the manufacturing quality of the game. People who played at Gen Con 2016 were delighted with our component quality. However, we have decided to upgrade the reference boards and playing card stock. And to insist on sharpened blades for card cutting.\n\nOur artists have proven very reliable and we have confirmed they can complete the listed stretch goal card illustrations by the end of this campaign, and we won't be pushing them beyond that.\n\nRules are complete and ready to print now. \n\nBackers' games will be pre-boxed in shipping boxes at the point of manufacture for faster and more consistent shipping. They will feature internal corner protectors to reduce risk of corner damage caused by dropped boxes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "A token gesture", "descp": "Roll up, roll up!

Risk and Challenges, it would seem, are not concepts you consider intimidating. It is only fair, therefore, that we attempt to match your perseverance, and admit our own shortcomings and limitations. After all, should you choose to cast aside your own safety for the sake of The Orphans, the least we can do is tell you how we, personally, may well screw this up for you and for them.\n\nBeing skillful and unapologetic pessimists, we have assumed few to none would be foolish enough to back this doomed venture. As such, a base funding goal of $4,097 was set, a minuscule pittance for some, but a seemingly insurmountable goal for The Orphans. \n\nShipping, of course, would be entrusted to the good people at USPS, UPS, or, depending on the final funding amount, a fulfillment company.\n\nEndangered Orphans will use EU friendly shipping. Alternatively, the value of the game will be listed at a reduced sales cost, matching the reward level you may have chosen, allowing the minimum threshold for Import duty and VAT to be charged in many countries. Of course, we can't assure an unpleasant plague, insidious virus, or fluid-sapping arachnids won't also hitch a ride with the packages, as they all want to do. But, again, you aren't one to concern yourself with petty risks.\n\nEndangered Orphans of Condyle Cove has been painstakenly, even painfully, playtested by groups ranging in age from far too old to care to far too young to understand. Though not all were completely enthralled by the activities, not one person broke out in any form or rash, expired from mysterious causes, or found fit to physically assault or belittle us, and thus we feel comfortable saying that, at the very least, that it plays as promised and is unlikely to cause you death, though far be it from us to jinx anything. \n\nFurthermore, all of the artwork, accessories, and pre-press deliverables have been completed and the final game is ready to be manufactured at the very moment the campaign concludes, a rare show of optimism on our part. In keeping with that uncharacteristic idealism, we feel that the full, fast, incident free delivery of all pre-stretch goal deliverables is within reach. \n\nIn the event of a legitimate miracle that allows us to reach any of our preposterous stretch goals, we will unquestionably provide constant and detailed updates on not only our steps to assure full and pleasant delivery of the promised rewards, but also of our utter and complete shock and humble outpouring of gratitude and indebtedness. Also, perhaps, our in-depth investigation into who may be behind such a cruel hoax. \n\nIn summation, we feel that there is nothing we have promised that we can not deliver, if in fact we find that others, like you, so choose to put your own happiness on hold for the sake of imaginary, illustrated Orphans. \n \nBless you all, and good luck.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE \u201cLEAST WE CAN DO\u201d LEVEL", "descp": "For those asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the LEAST I can do to help The Orphans?\u201d, here is your answer.

Now, Weird City Games is back on Kickstarter with Minions of the Meadow, our first major expansion to March of the Ants.\nMarch of the Ants sets up in five minutes, and plays in a little over an hour, but provides a rich world building and 4X experience in the vein of games like Eclipse and Twilight Imperium. Minions of the Meadow deepens this experience while preserving the things that made March of the Ants a success.\nIn March of the Ants, each player works to create a thriving ant colony, growing their nest economy and sending their ants forth into the meadow. Will your colony seek a path of symbiosis and peaceful coexistence, dedicate your colony's resources to evolving your species, or pursue aggressive expansion, challenging other ants for territory? March of the Ants is a quick-playing, dynamic, open ended game that offers complex decision-making and multiple paths to victory.\nGame in Progress\nIn Minions of the Meadow colonies gain powerful new tools to aid in their expansion and conquest. Major Workers enhance your abilities to explore and battle while Aphid Farms grant majestic rewards. Parasitic Evolutions thwart your opponents' best laid plans while Tactics create a deeper level of plotting and scheming during combat. Beware fearsome new Predators as they are drawn to the most successful colonies in the meadow.\nMajor Workers - Each Colony can breed Major Workers, larger ants who evolve with your colony. Use their powers to scout the best territory or lead your armies to war.\nAphids - Send your ants to find aphids and form a symbiotic relationship. Herd them to new hexes where they will have more space to grow and provide greater harvests.\nTactics - Play Tactics like Feint, Ferocious Expansion and Savage Cannibals to catch your opponent by surprise and turn the tide of battle.\nParasitic Evolutions - Infect your opponent's ants and override their most powerful evolutions.\nPredators - Summon the Centipede Broodmother and the Trapdoor Spider, terrible beasts who stalk the meadow.\nInto The Lair - Venture forth to hunt for the Centipede Broodmother in the new solo and co-op game.\n(Minions of the Meadow is an expansion and a copy of the base game is required to play.)\n\n Play March of the Ants now, on Tabletopia!\nThe amazing folks at Tabletopia have created a digital version of the base game of March of the Ants for us. Tabletopia is an great online tabletop simulator. Weird City Games used Tabletopia extensively to playtest Minions of the Meadow with our design team members in Los Angeles, Portland and even Borneo! To try it out, follow this link: March of the Ants Tabletopia\n Minions of the Meadow is already a great addition to the base game; we are confident it can become even better if you help us spread the word, rally the board gaming community, and exceed our basic funding goal.\n The social goals are achieved, but you can still help spread the colony:\nLike our Facebook Page!\nFollow us on Twitter!\nThumbs up the Image!\nAdd-ons\nThese are available with any pledge that includes the Expansion. To add, simply add the additional amount to your original pledge.\n*What do we mean by Kickstarter Exclusive? We mean that it will not be available in the Retail Version of the game, but will be included in the Kickstarter version. Weird City Games reserves the right to use these exclusives as promotional materials or distribute them separately.\n                      Aphids\nAnts herd, protect and milk aphids for honeydew. In Minions of the Meadow players discover aphids by exploring new aphid starting hexes or by playing cards.\nHerding: Ants immediately start herding any unattended aphids if they are in the same collection site. When ants move, they will bring along any aphids they are herding.\nFarming: During Harvest, players that are herding aphids in a hex collect bonus resources based on the total number of aphids in that hex.\nBreeding: At the beginning of slumber, if one or more aphids is in a hex, they  breed, adding one additional aphid to that hex. Split your herd up early to grow your population or keep them together to gain bonuses. (Aphids can reproduce parthogenically, all by themselves!)\nDevouring: Sometimes an ant can\u2019t wait, sometimes they are hungry. Use two steps during a March action to devour an aphid and draw a card.\nMajor Workers\nEach colony has access to two special ants, known as Major Workers. These oversized ants start with just one power, the ability to Rally other ants directly from the larvae chamber to aid them in battle, but as you evolve your ant species they become more powerful!\nPush: Your Major Workers may push smaller ants off of collection sites and into adjacent tunnels when they March.\nScout: Your Major Workers can Scout when they are included in exploring parties, revealing one additional hex.\nPopulate: When you Forage, you may immediately place one larva from your larvae chamber into each hex where you have a Major Worker.\nParasitic Cards\nPlay parasitic cards on your opponents, to block bonuses they get from other Evolutions and Colony Goals. Not only will the Host (your opponent) suffer a negative effect, you will benefit from their hard work!\nTactics\nTactics are a new sub-type of card. Tactics are played face down during battle as the player\u2019s Ferocity card, but instead of just adding Ferocity, they also have an immediate special effect.\nThere are Tactics of each card type: Event, Evolution and Colony Goal. If you win the battle, Evolution and Colony Goal Tactics you get to play the card immediately.  Event Tactics grant a one-time bonus, sometimes even if you lose!\nNew Solo and Co-op Rules: Into the Lair\nIn the March of the Ants solo/co-op game, the ants repelled an invasion of the centipedes. In \"Into the Lair,\" the ants scout the centipede\u2019s territory in an effort to destroy the Centipede Broodmother before a new threat emerges. \nAs the ants venture to the frontier of the centipede\u2019s lands they encounter centipede young which obstruct collection sites, rapidly grow into adults, and motivate the centipedes to battle ever more fiercely. When the Nest of Centipedes is finally discovered, an epic battle must be waged against the Broodmother.\nPledge at the $24 level or higher and you will receive the expansion game before it is available at retail and at $6 below expected MSRP. Or pledge for both and get them at $20 less than expected MSRP.\nWe offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you are not completely satisfied with the game return it to us with 30 days of receiving it and we will give you a complete refund.\nYour Support is Essential: We have done all of the work designing and creating original art for this game and need your help to make it a reality.\nAwesome Stretch Goals: By pledging now at any level that includes the Minions of the Meadow expansion, you are eligible for any and all Kickstarter stretch goals. (No stretch goals included in Original Ant base game only pledges.)\nRetailers\nWeird City Games is a huge fan of game stores and any establishment that helps spread the hobby. We would love to include you in our Kickstarter, and we offer wholesale pricing to verified stores and other gaming establishments. Email us at info@weirdcitygames.com or contact us through Kickstarter so we can work with you to tailor a pledge specifically suited to your needs.\nMarch of the Ants and Minions of the Meadow will be manufactured in China and freight shipped from there to various distribution points around the globe. Our fulfillment partners will then ship the game from those locations directly to backers. We have worked hard to create the most cost effective shipping method to save all of you wonderful backers money on shipping costs and taxes. Rewards will ship from fulfillment centers inside the USA, EU and Canada, and directly from China to all other countries.\nAll pledge levels will ship to backers in the USA at no additional shipping cost. Shipping for backers in all other countries has been discounted proportionately. We realize that shipping can be a great barrier for those living outside the USA and we have done what we can to reduce that cost. Backers at any level can order one additional pledge at that level with no extra shipping by adding the cost of the additional pledge.\nWe have an estimated delivery date of March 2017, though we will be working diligently to get the game to all backers as quickly as possible and hope the game will arrive early in 2017.\nThis project would not be possible without all of you, our wonderful backers. We seek to honor your vital contribution with our solemn promise that backer copies of March of the Ants:Minions of the Meadow will be shipped out before March of the Ants: Minions of the Meadow is available for purchase from retailers or at conventions. You know what they say: the first ant to the picnic gets the game...or something like that.\nOne of our favorite things about Kickstarter is that it really creates a community. We pledge to involve all of our backers in the creation of this project in as many and as meaningful ways as possible. This may include helping design a new Predator, giving input on new evolution cards, suggesting new components, variants, rules editing, thematic advice, etc. We love your input and will do our best to incorporate as many of your ideas as we can.\nFurther, we pledge to keep you informed at every step along the way as our Kickstarter campaign unfolds. This is a community-funded project and as such it is your right to be fully informed of the progress we make on the journey from funding to delivery. We value each and every one of you and will insure that you are fully satisfied with this project. Please feel free to contact us with any concerns, questions or ideas. Let's build this colony together!\nThe original Kickstarter for March of the Ants was our first serious foray into game design and game publication. It was a wild and exhilarating ride and was successful due to support from so many wonderful backers. Having our game published and sharing it with thousands of people has been a very gratifying and humbling experience. It is an honor to have our game played, discussed and loved by so many people. Thank you for supporting our dream of making games and for giving us a reason to make them.\nCreative Commons licensing information:\nMantis in the Meadow Stretch goal: \"Praying Mantis desert silhouette\" by Neil Parker, used under CC BY / on background by Ryan Swisher", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne year ago we concluded shipping of March of the Ants to all of our backers. Our backers were enthusiastic about our communication, customer service and the quality of the final product. Through the process of manufacturing, freight shipping and fulfillment we learned a great deal and were able to deliver a fantastic product in a timely manner. Each project faces unique challenges but we are confident we can work through anything that arises and we are dedicated to delivering an amazing game. \n\nManufacturing\nFor the second printing and expansion of March of the Ants we have found a new manufacturing partner. Although we were happy with the final quality of the first print of the base game, we had several issues regarding our previous manufacturer's communication and willingness to work with us to make the game exactly what we wanted it to be. \n\nOur new manufacturer comes very highly recommended and we have spoken with them extensively to ensure that they will be able to replicate the quality and feel of the base game components. We are excited that they can help us offer a better final product, with a quicker production time, allowing us to get the game to backers as quickly as possible. \n\nShipping\nProviding a good product is not only about making a great game; it is delivering it to our backers in the best, most cost-effective manner possible. We have been researching new shipping options since our last campaign finished. We are working with established shipping and distribution companies to insure that March of the Ants and Minions of the Meadow will reach all customers as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nPlaytesting\nWe have been testing and tweaking March of the Ants: Minions of the Meadow for over a year. It has gone through a great many revisions and we are very confident in and happy with the final product. We have created a great expansion that builds on the original game, adding depth without distracting from the elegant gameplay. Many thanks to playtesters at local game stores and conventions and to our Weird Citizens who have blind playtested the game and have responded with enthusiastic praise!\n\nArt\nWe brought on a new artist, Jason Reynolds, to work with us on this game. Jason is adding his fantastic linework and Ryan uses digital collage to bring the images to life with vibrant color. They have designed all of the art for the game, it is 95% done and will be complete by the end of our Kickstarter campaign. We are passionate about the art and the way it enhances the design and immersive theme of the game.\n\nWe have wanted to make this expansion since the original March of the Ants Kickstarter ended.

In this challenging, story-driven game for 1-6 players, you will play as group of civilians trapped in a city torn by a military conflict.\nTo survive, you will need to make tough moral choices, delivered in a role-playing style. You will also scavenge, manage, fight, trade and upgrade your shelter. This tabletop adaptation is based on one of the biggest indie games of recent years. TWOM: TBG offers you an experience that is hard to come by in any other tabletop game. Combined with the highest quality components created by experienced companies, this title will fully engage you with its meaningful story. It is high time for board games to address important topics.\nThis War Of Mine is an award-winning (over 100 awards) digital game, built around a far-reaching message:\nIN WAR, NOT EVERYONE IS A SOLDIER.\nImagine you wake up one day and the streets you used to walk are now in ruins. Rules and laws no longer apply. Your very existence is at stake now \u2013 the city is cut-off and if you want to survive, you must find food, medicine and weapons. Will you prey on the weak, or will you try to keep your morality?\n                          We really believe that with this board game we\u2019ve created a tabletop experience different from what you have seen so far. \nTo confirm it, we have sent out 50 prototypes to various reviewers across the globe, and during the Kickstarter campaign we will post the feedback, for you to see.\nRahdo runs final thoughts\nThanks to the design, colorful journal and the very nature of the components of this game, you can start playing immediately after setting up all the elements on the board - you learn more as you go. Sometimes you will need to trust your instincts and make gut calls, this adds a layer of immersion to the game, since at war you can never be sure if the decision you made was correct. \nThe Book of Scripts added to the game, will consist of over a 1 000 unique adventures that were written to evoke a range of emotions. Some of them will have direct influence on the gameplay, some not - but all of them will raise your level of immersion, so that you can feel what a group of civilians would feel being trapped in a in a war-torn city. \nA system of events that were designed never to repeat in the same sequence. Every playthrough will be a unique and and exciting experience. The game will adjust the events you face depending on your current situation, place and time. Every game will be personal. \n At night you will go out and scavenge, searching for food, parts, meds and weapons. During the day you will try to make the best of your resources. Deadly combat, trading, shelter management, tinkering, building and side events - it is all here and you need to learn fast to reach your ultimate goal. Survival. \nIn life, every choice we make has consequences. We translated this into the aftereffect mechanics, where the game remembers the decisions you make and will force you to face their consequences when you least expect it. \nAs an addition to the board game, it will be fully optional and will have no direct impact on the gameplay. It will provide additional stories and more immersion helpers! Thanks to the possibilities offered by smartphones and tablets, you will be able to discover illustrations, music, audio dramas and video recordings. \nThe game is a full co-op, where all players are responsible for all the characters. They need to discuss and try to agree on the best course of action. At any moment of the game, the player holding the Journal will make the final decision and, after his or her phase, the Journal will be passed on to the next player. \nWe are working with some of the best companies on the market that have over 15 years of experience in creating board games. All components (excluding miniatures) will be produced in Europe (Poland) where we will have direct access to the whole production process and oversee it from it's beginning to the end. \nThe game's length can be easily modified, but for those of you who want to plunge into a full campaign mode we have created the save game mechanism. It will enable you to save your progress at any time. So you will be able to pick up right where you left off! \n(To see extended gameplay, click here) \n\"Trying to help them through a horrific situation is an emotional experience, not just because you feel responsible for their pain, but because you share some joy in the small ways you make their lives better.\" -  A.V.

Without your support this game will be not see daylight. But if we will meet our target easily, we will be adding special content and components to every copy of the game. \nTo keep things simple - your Kickstarter edition will be far richer then the one that will be available in retail.

Each scenario presents different quests that must be fulfilled in order to be victorious, and various monsters the heroes will need to defeat on their way. The monsters react to the heroes' actions, so no one is stuck playing the role of game master.\nThe Heroes of Arcadia!\nAs the heroes defeat their enemies and accomplish quests, their guilds rake in the coins, which will then allow them to acquire all sorts of powerful loot! From legendary weapons and armor, to new abilities and magic items. The combination of each hero's unique ability with all the different upgrades they earn through the campaign allows players to create amazing and unexpected combos!\nThe Monsters of Inferno!\nInferno is a standalone box, but also fully compatible with previous Arcadia Quest boxes. It contains a full campaign with 12 scenarios for players to explore. As players progress through the circles of Inferno, deeper and deeper into the Underworld, the campaign branches into two distinct paths. The path not taken results in quests the players will not fulfill, and therefore consequences that will come back to haunt them towards the end of the campaign.\nThe Angels. Will they help or hinder you?\nOne such key choice are the Angels. These secret protectors of Arcadia have been imprisoned by the Underlord, who is trying to corrupt them. If players rescue these Angels, they become powerful additions to their Guilds. But beware, the Angels that are abandoned to their fate will be consumed and come back as monsters to seek revenge on the heroes!\nProduction plastic miniatures of the Inferno monsters, angels, and heroes.\nGoing down into the infernal depths presents the heroes of Arcadia with a new set of challenges and opportunities, in the form of Damnation! This dark power permeates everything in Inferno, and daring heroes may want to use it to their advantage (and face the consequences). Weapons and equipment found in Inferno may become more powerful if a hero takes Damnation, monsters may offer the choice of taking Damnation instead of wounds (or flat out dealing Damnation to their target). However, accumulating Damnation may come at a high price. Some Upgrades are more effective against heroes with Damnation, some monsters more powerful against them, and specially Brimstone cards scattered through the scenarios may activate monsters to attack heroes who dabble too much in the dark powers!\nMany of the Upgrade cards use Damnation to punish or reward heroes.\nArcadia Quest: Inferno comes with:\n36 highly detailed figures, including:\n  12 Hero figures\n  5 Angel figures\n  19 Monster figures (6x Demoness, 6x Harpy, 2x Demon Pitcher, 2x Cerberus, Belly'aal, The Judge, The Underlord)\n12 color plastic bases\n8 Attack dice \n6 Defense dice \n9 double-sided game tiles \n4 guild dashboards \n276 cards\n300+ tokens\nCampaign Sheet pad\nRulebook\nCampaign Book\nExplore a brand new campaign, and add Pets to any Arcadia Quest experience with the Optional Buy Arcadia Quest: Pets expansion!\nFind out everything about the Pets Optional Buy box HERE.\nIf you wish to extend your campaign beyond the 6th scenario, don't miss out on the ultimate showdown with the Frost Dragon expansion box!\nFind out everything about the Frost Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nThe mad fight against the Chaos Dragon also takes place after the 6th scenario and brings a whole new epic experience to Arcadia Quest!\n Find out everything about the Chaos Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nNo epic campaign can end without a showdown against the majestic Fire Dragon!\nFind out everything about the Fire Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nHell of a Pledge - $100\nThe Hell of a Pledge gives you an Arcadia Quest: Inferno core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero King David III, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nKing David III is a natural born leader. Well, at least he was born into leadership as the rightful ruler of Arcadia, but now most of his power has shifted to the Guilds. He's still able to rally his comrades in a fight, though, allowing his guild to activate another Hero if he ends his movement in the same space.\nProduction plastic miniature of King David III.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON crew gathered their guilds and went down into the depths of Inferno in order to produce a gameplay video for you.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. \n  $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones. We are in the final stages of delivery for Blood Rage.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: B-Sieged and Zombicide: Black Plague, which are in the final stages of production, and The Others, which is starting production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Arcadia Quest: Inferno.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will treat it as abandoned and will refund or ship on a case by case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.

And one of us happens to be pretty handy with a crayon too ;)\nSerious Poulp\nWe founded Serious Poulp in 2010 so we could persue our dreams of publishing the games we designed.\nWe started with Steam Torpedo, a tactical Submarine combat game for 2 players with quite a significant metagame potential and combo mechanic.\nNext up was 8 Masters' Revenge, a martial arts game for 1 to 4 players that revamps the standard combat game genre.\nNow, it's time for The 7th Continent, our third game, the one we've been working full-time on for the past 2 years.\nLudovic Roudy & Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends since childhood, we love all kinds of games!\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp which we founded in 2010 when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludo was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives whether they be from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent: Ludovic also creates all the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpSlayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the community manager for The 7th Continent.\nA passionate gamer and journalist and far too English for his own good. He currently works for the French-based board gaming site Tric Trac. He is an aficionado of any tabletop game featuring toy soldiers. You may have already heard of him from his work on the incredibly successful CONAN board game by Monolith.\nThe chat with Mr Jamie\nAs passionate gamers, we imagined a game that didn\u2019t exist, as far as we were aware, and that we would love to play.\nThis game is The 7th Continent: an exploration and adventure game offering many hours of solo or cooperative fun with friends.\nHowever, we wouldn\u2019t have started working on The 7th Continent without the prospect of launching it on Kickstarter.\nWhy?\nBECAUSE of the investment that this game implies. Be it in terms of time spent on its conception, design or illustrations. It can\u2019t be supported by a small company like Serious Poulp without a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nBECAUSE after 2 years of work on this project we cannot, unlike with our other games, continue without ensuring a certain degree of success through Kickstarter first.\nBECAUSE our goal is to not publish a standard run-of-the-mill board game. We want The 7th Continent to be an adventure of epic proportions with the largest game board ever created! We can do this with your support and all the stretch goals that we hope to unlock during the campaign.\nWe\u2019ve invested over 2 years of our lives and a significant part of our savings into this project, the first \"choose-your-own-path\" exploration board game. Now we need to know if all this work is going to bear fruit. If this campaign is not successful then The 7th Continent game will never see the light of day. Any possible commercial release will also depend on the level of the campaign\u2019s success.\nWe\u2019ve done all we can to make this dream come true, now the rest is up to you!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in October 2016.\nNo extra customs charges for EU, USA and Canada.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends, which will be managed through the Pledge Manager.\nHere is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (between 2 and 3 kg). Please acknowledge that these are just estimates and that we\u2019ll do our best to get you the best shipping deal possible.\nArea 1 - Mainland USA, Western Europe (France, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal): Between \u20ac10 and \u20ac15\nArea 2 - Canada, Australia, Rest of EU countries: Between \u20ac15 and \u20ac23 [update]\nArea 3 - Russia, Israel, Norway, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, North Africa, Maghreb, New Zealand, Vietnam, India: Between \u20ac28 and \u20ac33\nArea 4 - Rest of the world: Between \u20ac33 and \u20ac38\nMORE PLEDGES ?\nIf you want more than one pledge (including All Applicable Stretch Goals), the shipping cost for each additional reward - from the 2nd and up to the 7th and last - will be divided by 2!\nGame mechanics : 99%\nGame conception (terrain, events, characters) : 85%\nNarration (flavor and event texts, descriptions, etc) : 50%\nArtwork* : 45%\nProof reading and translation : 5%\nIf the project is funded, we will start production in summer 2016. Once all of these tasks are complete. We are aiming to deliver the game in October to coincide with the Essen game convention.\nWe will regularly let you know how the project is going and what remains to be done.\n*There are hundreds of original artworks, and Ludovic will be working full-time on this task over the coming months.\nTo our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent.\nTo our proofreaders and translators who, if everything goes well, are going to be very busy, very soon.\nTo Olivier Nkweti for the great miniatures he created for the campaign.\nTo all the players who took part in a demo, for their advice and enthusiasm.\nTo the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work.\nAnd finally, to you, the backers, who are helping us make this dream a reality.\nThank you all! We wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHIS IS OUR FIRST CAMPAIGN BUT NOT OUR FIRST BOARD GAME.\n\nWe have been in the gaming industry for several years now and have already published games that are available in many countries and languages (USA, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Russia, etc.).\n\nSMALL TEAM, HIGH MOTIVATION.\n\nWe are the authors, illustrator and publishers of all our games. We have been dedicated to The 7th Continent for over 2 years now. We will be concentrating on what we know and outsourcing other skills with industry professionals.\n\nZERO RISK DOESN\u2019T EXIST. BUT IT\u2019S STILL A LOT SIMPLER WITH CARDS.\n\nCards being the main component of The 7th Continent means that this project has a lower level of risk than others, particularly those with lots of miniatures.\n\nThat being said, outside of making sure that the game is properly prepared and choosing our partners wisely (printers, logistics, etc.), it is not impossible that we face delays from uncontrollable sources (curses, rafting accidents, attacks from giant bears, killer bees, etc). This may cause some delay in the delivery date but rest assured that, if this were to happen, we will keep you informed about the situation.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is asked more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded of them at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

You must explore the harsh wilderness and engage in deep tactical combat, where the decisions you make have an impact not only on your own character, but also the world around you.\nGloomhaven is cooperative game of card-driven combat set in a persistent fantasy campaign which will change and grow as you play the game.\nThere is always more to unlock and explore in the world of Gloomhaven.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards from their hand of ability cards which determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can play the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up.\nPlayers gain the experience needed to level up by performing certain actions in their ability card deck. Through leveling up, players will also get access to more powerful, higher level ability cards which they can use to customize their deck.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase powerful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nOne way to unlock items is to increase the prosperity of the town, which players can do by completing scenarios and making decisions during events between scenarios. Players will also have to manage their reputation during these events, as reputation will influence the outcome of some events and also affect shop prices.\nAs players interact with the town and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing career goals. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like more information about any aspect of the game, you can find a wealth of information on the Gloomhaven website and also the BoardGameGeek page which features a number of illustrated lessons on how to play the game.\nIn addition, here is a PDF of a preliminary draft of the rules.\nIf you learn through action or just want to get a better feel for the game, there are a couple easy ways to sit down and play the game on your computer.\nThe introductory scenario of Gloomhaven is available through Tabletop Zen (free) and Tabletop Simulator (this requires the purchase of software).\nYou can get the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop mod here. From there you can play around with it on your own, or sign up to be taught the game through this Google Doc. When you become familiar with the game, you can also sign up for pick-up games, or even be a teacher yourself.\nTabletop Zen now has an open lobby where you can go play around with the game on your own, or you can sign up for pick-up games or teaching games through the Google Doc. All that's required is a valid email address to sign up.\nKeep in mind that the game is not automated. Players will have to move the pieces around according to the rules, and communication between players is highly advised. Tabletop Simulator has accompanying voice software, but Google Hangouts is needed to play on Tabletop Zen.\nFor those interested, a PDF Print-and-Play of the first scenario is also available, along with the accompanying pages from the scenario book.\nThe scenario available online is just the beginning, though. A scratch on the surface of the world.\nGloomhaven is deep and expansive. It is a game of exploration and discovery; of branching story paths and decisions with real consequences. You always have a choice of which scenario to undertake next and which plot thread to unravel.\nMore than that, though, there is plenty of content to support multiple game groups. If you want to play the game with someone new, you shouldn't reset the game, but instead just pursue a different story line. Each party of adventurers will develop their own campaign, but everyone will interact with and expand upon the same world.\nGloomhaven provides a persistent world of permanent choices without the restriction of only being able to play with the same people time and again. It does this by focusing on the stories of individual characters instead of an over-arching linear plot.\nAnd a few comments from play testers:\nNew classes will become available to play when players meet certain conditions in the game. If you want spoil yourself on the surprise, or you just really want to check out more amazing artwork, click here to see what else you'll be getting, or if you want to get a detailed look at the miniatures, you can check out all the original sculpts by clicking here (also full of spoilers).\n(Note that all depictions of miniatures are digitally modified pictures of the original physical sculpts.)\nI love Kickstarter. This platform brings together creators and their audiences in such a wonderful way. I absolutely would not be able to get this game made without your financial support, but what really makes Kickstarter exciting to me is the opportunity to involve the community in the creation of the project.\nThis project doesn't just give you a great game that will show up on your doorstep in May. It gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. There is also a scenario design competition to allow the backer community to make a significant mark on the creation of the game.\nMy amazing play testers have helped me get this far, but now with your help, we can not only get the game made, but also continue working to make it as great as possible.\nAlso remember that if you purchase the game through Kickstarter, you'll get the game before it comes out in retail and it's a significant discount off the MSRP (estimated at $100-120), especially after considering the added cost for shipping.\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.\nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nPledging at the MINIATURES level will get you all of the minis for the included 13 character classes (12 base plus 1 stretch goal). Any additional stretch goals that unlock extra classes beyond that will also unlock extra minis for you. If you'd like a better idea of all the minis you're getting, head on over to the spoilers page.\nPledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH STANDEES level will get you everything that you would get at the $79 level, except that you will get cardboard standees of the character classes instead of the plastic minis. You will also receive all unlocked stretch goals, with the exception of additional minis (receiving standees of additional unlocked character classes instead).\nOr you can get the whole package - all the content, all the stretch goals all the minis. Pledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH MINIS level gets you this.\nNote that this level does not come with standees for the character classes. If you really want both standees and minis (this is redundant and in no way adds content to the game), you can pledge at the $64 level and do a $20 add-on. That will get you absolutely everything.\n$15 for shipping is included in the base game price. All additional shipping fees are added automatically when you pledge.\nThe game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAll three main rewards levels are also available as add-ons. You can add $20 to your pledge to get an additional box of minis. You can add $64 to get a copy of Gloomhaven without the minis. And you can add $79 to get a copy of Gloomhaven with minis.\nUp to 4 $64 and $79 add-ons can be added to your order this way, PLUS you can add up to 5 $20 add-ons as well. You will not have to pay any additional shipping fees on your order.\nIn the proud tradition of slaying helpless rats, I have decided that to reward backers of the Gloomhaven project, I will graduate to a slightly more formidable - but equally prolific - foe: the animated skeleton.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar or more to the campaign, I will foray into a host of fantasy-themed games and slay a necromantic abomination in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, last April. Isaac also designed and developed the game. He writes a weekly blog about board game publishing, design and whatever else he is thinking about at www.cephalofair.com.\nIsaac graduated last December with a physics PhD, but, with the success of Forge War, he is now designing and publishing games full time. It's turned out pretty well for him so far.\nJosh McDowell started playing board games after his wife encouraged him to find an inexpensive hobby. The joke is on her, as that encouragement turned into an expansive collection and regular schedule of playing games with his friends. He turned to his graphic design prowess to offset the costs and is now completely engrossed in all things board games. He lives in Indiana with his wife and three young children, gamers in the making. You can find his portfolio at www.behance.net/mcscowl.\nAlexandr lives in Ukraine, Odessa and works as a freelancer and specializes in several styles: sci-fi, cyberpunk and fantasy. He's looking for hard-core projects in the styles that he likes. Most of all he is proud of his artwork for cards in board games.

My previous project, Forge War, was rather massive as well, and I managed to deliver the game to backers just 1 month past the projection.\n\nI have learned so much about Kickstarter fulfillment from that project, though, and I fully expect this project will deliver on time without problem.\n\nThere is still artwork and graphic design to be done, but we should be able to finish that up by December. I know problems with miniatures plague a lot of projects, but James is very nearly done with the sculpting and he is a seasoned veteran in the field, so I don't expect there will be any significant manufacturer issues with the miniatures.

You will also get new skill cards as your mental diseases progress. With OCD you will pace rapidly and it might seem to you that you're waltzing among monsters. Late stages of schizophrenia will make you believe in exploding spider-bombs or owl-people coming to aid you. Anxiety Neurosis deck has all the defensive abilities and it works better the less you trust others and the government. Finally, agression has all the sweet kung-fu moves that you think you are performing while flailing (magikarping) in a straitjacket.\n\nOur company has been sculpting, designing and personally casting miniatures for almost ten years. We have shipped them to the most exotic places and seen them steal the show on some major miniature gaming tournaments. You can browse our fantasy and science-fiction collection on titan-forge.com. We guarantee that miniatures in Lobotomy will keep the highest standards.\n\nThe Lobotomy gameboard has attachable modules. Changing set-ups every game forces players to adapt and makes every game different visually. Additionaly, our artist promises that each tile is a gothic, murky work of art.\n\nEvery scenario has a desiganted model inspired by the horror culture or our own nightmares. Usually its a quest or a mini-boss, some scenarios have even more than one miniature. Scenarios are like a chapter of a book leading to the encounter with the Chief Hospital Administrator, who is rumoured to be the root of all evil.\n\nAlthough the human mind is the most creative force in this world sometimes it becomes lazy. Especially when sick, it replaces the lack of data from the dysfunctional cognitive processes with scraps of reality found in books, TV and games. That is why our characters unknowingly develop those alternative and somewhat recognizable personalities and archetypes.\n\nA familiar scent, meditation or reading your own diary can help regain memories. When characters in Lobotomy embrace their past they gain access to personalized skills, weapons and gadgets. However, evolving the character may require re-living devastating tragedies from their past - both real and imaginary.\n\nThe waterworks under the Melville CIty Psychiatric Hospital are as acient as the swarm of Lovecraft's Deep Ones sleeping inside. Expansion has around 30 additional miniatures inspired by the Cthulu mythos; 2 decks of cards introducing new playstyles and mechanics; additional cards with monsters, loot, weapons and drugs.\nTo reveal more about the Lobotomy's gameplay we have prepared an animated video with explanation of key mechanics.\n Rulebook\nThis section is for our copywriter to show off. We will reveal the different backstories of the Lobotomy characters recovered from their medical histories. Check later for the rest of them as well as the tales of monsters, dark attics, candle altars and losing sanity. Finally, you will learn what lobotomy is, how its introductor won a Nobel Prize and why it is now banned and considered torture.\nPatient\nHelena Swann\nDoctor's log\nHelena has been under my care for 2 years now. At first her treatment was similar to my other patients' but after a while we had to take a different course. We meet five times a week now and soon I might have to admit defeat, I have lost all hope for her recovery. Helena Swann is completely convinced that she was born in XVIII century France and that she is a vampire. She manifests all the typical symptoms of \"vampirism\" like photophobia and craving for blood. The main difference, apart from the trail of bloody murders she was connected to before being admitted, between her and other \"vampires\" I have treated is her authenticity. In some horrible way she developed second degree burns and tried to convince hospital personel that they have been caused by the sun, which would be more believable if anyone ever saw her go outside willingly. What's more, she can talk for hours about her two-hundred-year-old life with worrying details and hard-to-explain consistency. She also looks and acts weak, like an old woman trapped in a young body. This is of course until she gets her teeth on something alive, like a pigeon or Slawomir, the new maintenance guy that will never again sleep on the job. She suddenly becomes impossibly strong, fighting off two or three biggest guards at once. What I really want to do is give her blood in a controlled environment, like my lab. Chief Administrator has allowed much worse things in here. There might even be a way to do all this without anyone's permission. I can just invite her for a little degustation..\nHelena's culture\nTV: The Originals, Vampire Diaries, The Walking Dead,\nOthers: Interview with the Vampire, works of Jane Austen, World of Darkness RPG\nPatient\nMarcus Dieter\nCulture TV: Breaking Bad, House MD, The Knick, Rush Other: Catch 22, Human Centipede, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Silence of the Lambs\nRecovered patient's notes\nI could explain it for a day then take questions for another then sum it all up with charts and guest speakers and they still would not get it... What a pitiful lack of vision!\nSeriously, screw them! Great minds have always been repressed by simpletons. Instead of embracing a genius, they fear him. They can not even get over a simple concept of sacrifice. I am not too shallow to disagree that the plan might not have been perfect. But I had to operate in a short time frame. When my clinic got closed I had 20 patients in the middle of a trial and all the work would go to waste. It was only logical to speed the proccess up, before the families demand their relatives back. Those worms! Humanity is a jar of worms. Thus I felt nothing when I examined their bodies, I am a scientist. They had no useful skills anyways, they have made a perfect sacrifice. The progress will be thankful, me personally not so much.\nSome government dogs confiscated most of the samples and compromised the rest. They have taken a scalpel out of my hand in the middle of a damned procedure! Have not they heard about \"do no harm\"? Who cares if the patient was already dead -- at least do not harm my research! The ultimate transplant method for millions of people and millions of dollars. And all I am asking in return are a few sacrifices from people that are not even living their lifes properly, watching advertisments, voting for politicians who steal from them, mindlessly following celebrities, a.k.a rich assholes, who would laugh into your face if they realised that they are being worshipped.. I forced twenty sacrifices on my own but we still need more. We ruin lifes of others everyday through bullying or turning our heads the other way but when it comes to literally taking a life and doing it for the good then suddenly I am called crazy, I am restrained, medicated, looked down on.. What a pitiful lack of vision!\n...\nI am going back to my research as soon as the therapists here see the reason and logic behind my motives. They seem to agree with me on some important points and promise to let me leave if I agree on this one experimental procedure. Who knows, perpahs it will even help me.\n...\nI wrote a joke today. A doctor, a genius and a martyr walk into a bar. \"What can I get you, mister Dieter?\", the bartender asks.\nMarcus' culture\nTV: Breaking Bad, House MD, The Knick, Rush\nOther: Catch 22, Human Centipede, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Silence of the Lambs\nThe New Middleman\n\"Where the hell are they?\". Marciniak sat in a car and rubbed the steering wheel nervously with his leather gloves. \"Those freaking vampires, haha\" - he liked the nickname he came up with to describe those three pale creatures. He tried to laugh mockingly but the only sound that came out of his tensed throat was a silent squeak. Marciniak did not believe in vampires, but he believed in greed. And if those businessbitches had no remorse about stealing blood from a mental facility, then they were capable of anything. Not that he cared. Psychosis is not supposed to be contagious, is it? Even if his clients did not test the product for it. Yeah, he believed in greed. However, he had a good reason to sit in his car on the edge of cardiac arrest. He thought about their white faces, cyanosed lips, motionless gazes and matching outfits. He imagined the transfusions accompanied by screams of patients and buzz of centrifuges. If you work in a place like that you have to be nuts yourself, or soon will be. All of this still does not explain how those creeps finish each others' sentences so naturally, or their soundless mov..\nKnock on the glass. How the heck?! Trying to put himself together, he rolled downed the window. Three pairs of bony palms started to hand the minifridges. He checked one to make sure that they are full of bloodbags as always. Than opened the trunk so they could pick up the containers from the last week. A hand in the leather glove slid through the window, holding a brown envelope. \"The rest?\" \"Who said that?\" - he thought in panic. He was sure that the women standing next to him did not open her mouth, damn, he did not even see her opening the envelope. \"This is the rest\" - he said out loud. - \"There won't be more. It's all gettin' too dangerous.\" He was not an amateur, he tried to use some leverage, intimidate them. \"Does principal Eldrige know about your little transfusions?\" The punishment for insubordination was immediate and unexpected. A paralyzing pain radiated from his right arm, caused by an iron grip of a women in the backseat. Another one put hands around his neck and started to slide in through an open window. \"But the door was locked\" was his last thought before total darkness.\nThe comeback of consciousness was caused by a bright light coming through the open door. He tried to stand up, run, but his arms were wrapped firmly around his waist. A straitjacket? Three women came inside, one holding a needle of a size of an arm. \"Mister Marciniak\" - he did not see them speak, just heard three voices combined into one in his head. - \"You are going to feel a pinch now. The new middleman is growing impatient.\"\nHelena Swann - early files\nCase study for schizophrenia and OCD\nPatient was transported from police detention. Earlier found on an homicide crime scene covered in victim's AB negative. Officers that arrived on the scene reported trouble with pulling her away from the body. Due to lack of any communication and absent mindness she was considered a primary suspect at first. Medical examination confirmed victim's (Mario Gonzales) blood in her stomach but none of her DNA in the wounds inflicted to the body. The attending and a police psychiatrist came together with a theory of Helena being a friend or relative of the deceased and her trying to resuscitate and later choking on the lung fluid mixed with blood. However all efforts of getting any confirmation from her were futile. Lack of speech, hissing and photophobia were attributed to post traumatic stress disorder.\nIn the meantime police investigation narrowed down the suspects in the murder case to the members of a local narcotics distribution gang, as police always does, but this time it turned out to be correct. Still no one had any idea about Helena's role in the incident. No relatives were looking for her, nobody from the victim's social circle, work or enemies recognized her. However, due to her mental status it was not possible to release her. Thus, she was moved to the psychiatric facility by a court order.\nAfter admitting Helena was treated with antipsychotics for PTSD, but responded only to active substances. That lead to a schizophrenia diagnosis. In her rare lucid moments she reminisces about wandering the streets at night and having a lair in the basement of the building Mario Gonzales lived in. She belived that she was sentenced to a life in darkness as a creature of the night by her ex-husband that left her because of her illness. She believed that he turned her into a vampire and than abandoned her because she disappointed him. Her life was miserable and living conditions devastating but she managed to survive due to this 'vampire' role-play inside her head created by schizophrenic voices and previous fascination by fantasy. She managed to feed on animals and in some of her stories some deeply repressed memories of attacking humans were discovered. Despite the mental ilness her physical attributes have actually improved. Excellent night vision, soundless movement with peerless speed. She is also the only patient that managed to escape the solitary without the investigating team finding the explanation for it (probable help from other patient).\nRandom facts encountered during therapy: Helena spends most of her time on the floor hanging from a gaspipe connected to a radiator. Helena's maiden name is Carter.\nWe will be charging shipping via our pledge manager after the Kickstarter concludes.\nESTIMATED SHIPPING RATES AT THIS POINT ARE:\nEurope on average 19$\nUSA/Canada 29$\nAustralia/Asia 43$\nSouth America - 44$ \nAfrica - 52$\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe want to assure you that once the project is funded and the campaign ends you will surely receive your copy of the game with all the kickstarter exclusives.

It is a game about survival and community.\nThere are many creatures, humans included, that are bigger, stronger, meaner, or more numerous than rabbits. The seasons and the elements do not care that rabbits are only little things. Rabbits cannot hope to meet these threats head on. Only through speed, wits, and keeping a cool head can rabbits bypass the dangers of the outside world.\nThe Warren is designed for 3-5 players and can be played in a single 2-hour session or over multiple sessions. Campaign play follows the passing seasons and focuses on changing generations of new rabbits each with their own stories.\nThis game takes inspiration from classic rabbit tales such as Watership Down, Fifteen Rabbits, and Peter Rabbit. It uses a heavily-modified version of the game mechanics from Vincent Baker\u2019s Apocalypse World. \nOne of the major mechanical differences is the use of a shared pool of character moves, making character creation quick and easy. This reinforces the generational aspect of play, as rabbits are born and later lost or retired from play.\nThe system is tightly-focused on a set of core moves that reflect the realities of rabbit life \u2013rabbits don't fight, but they are fast and clever. The rules allow for player-created custom moves, letting them find new, inventive solutions to problems.\nThis game has been in development for more than two years, and has been heavily playtested. All of the core artwork is finished and the book is being laid out now. \nWe\u2019re down to the finishing touches, and so our focus for this campaign is working with you to make it even better by incorporating your ideas, corrections, and experiences with the game, as well as adding stretch goals for new settings and more excellent artwork!\nWhen completed, the game will be available as a full-color, 6x9 perfect-bound book and a variety of digital formats, with roughly 144 pages of rules, examples, and excellent artwork.\nBRAVE NEW WORLDS!\nThe settings for The Warren are called Worlds, and the game includes rules for quickly setting one up at the start of play. In addition, the book will include two fully-fleshed out World settings, full of evocative hooks and interesting characters.\nAbingdon Meadow was once planted with barley, but it has long since gone to seed. Between the hedgerows, men come to hunt for rabbits and the same predators worry the warren that did a generation ago.\nBayou Dupre is based on Louisiana swamp country, where everybody is hungry for a nice piece of rabbit. This setting is full of scheming possums, terrifying bobcats, and angry swamp rabbits who can swim.\nEARLY ACCESS!\nEvery backer will have access to the pre-release draft of the game, so you can dig in right away and find out why we're so excited to play a bunch of rabbits! The game is well-tested and the rules are complete, but we hope that you'll try it out and we welcome your feedback as we put the final touches together.\nPREDATOR CARDS!\nAs with our previous campaigns, we'll be producing a deck of high quality  cards as a supplement for the game. Each deck includes 20 cards with predators, threats, and other characters for the GM to use during the game. These cards will include illustrations by Claudia Cangini, the artist who created our excellent Night Witches portraits.\nIn addition, the Predator cards will include more than 30 cards featuring the character moves, so that when players choose them during the game, they can have the descriptions easily in hand.\nThe deck will be a set of premium, full-color cards with rounded corners and a glossy finish, and will look great on the table during the game.\nHARDBACK EDITION!\nThe Warren will also be available in a limited-edition hardcover version. These covers will have a matte finish and will look gorgeous with Brennen Reece's cover design.\nThe Warren was designed and written by Marshall Miller. He has previously written a number of supplements for Dungeon World as well as other small games. You can read more about him at his Fine Mess Games website.\nJason Morningstar and Steve Segedy have been huge fans of The Warren for the last two years, and as a result have been playtesting and developing the game in collaboration with Marshall to help him bring it to the world.\nJason and Steve run Bully Pulpit Games, and we've been creating and publishing games such as the Night Witches, Durance, and Fiasco since 2006.\nRachel Kahn created the excellent interior illustrations for The Warren. She is known for her work in the Hillfolk RPG, the Worlds Without Master magazine, and in her own By Crom! comic. See more of her work at  portablecity.net.\nClaudia Cangini will be providing additional illustrations for The Warren's  Predator cards. Claudia previously worked with Bully Pulpit on Night Witches, creating the outstanding airwoman portraits. She also does freelance illustration for clients like Evil Hat Productions. You can see her portfolio work at claudiacangini.deviantart.com.\nBrennen Reece created the layout and visual design for The Warren. Brennen has worked with BPG many times in the past- most recently for Night Witches. He's also worked with us before on layout for Carolina Death Crawl and illustrations for the games Durance and The Climb. His layout tips and photography can be found at brennenreece.com.\nJohn W. Sheldon developed the video, which included voice acting by Tim Rodriguez, as well as Creative Commons music and images to supplement Rachel's artwork.\nKaren Twelves will be doing the final editing work for the book. Her editing work can also be seen in the upcoming Evil Hat RPG, War of Ashes.\n\u201cNo horror RPG has ever instilled in me quite as much terror as The Warren did with the mere possibility of a cat.\u201d \u2013Tom McGrenery\n\"The most ingenious, yet familiar, implementation of the Powered by the Apocalypse system I've seen\". \u2013Mikael Andersson\n\"The Warren provided the perfect mix of bucolic frolicking and tragic horror that I love in games.\" \u2013Jason Pitre\n\"Play was frantic, intense, and surprising. I played a Seer bunny who went from ridiculed outcast to charismatic cult leader - I've never been so proud to create a brutal lapine theocracy!\" \u2013Alex Roberts\n\"Streamlined and brilliantly evocative of its fictional inspirations... I rate it a thousand out of a thousand!\" \u2013Jennifer Leeds\n\"My PC gave birth to 12 kits during a tense rat-rabbit standoff. It was awesome.\" \u2013Melissa Spangenberg\n\"The Warren ...was easy to learn whilst also being fun, engaging, and deeply poignant.\" \u2013Dana Kubilus\n'...playing The Warren was like nothing I've ever encountered. I don't know if I should high five you, slap you, or kiss the back of your hand in reverence and shame.\" \u2013Gray Pawn\n\"Kind of like the Walking Dead. But with rabbits. And no zombies.\" \u2013Stras Acimovic\n\"The Warren is the harshest, darkest interpretation of Apocalypse World I have ever seen.\" \u2013Jason Morningstar\nThank you for reading this far and for considering joining us on this adventure!

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nAll rewards for this project will be shipped from the USA.\nDelivering Your Reward Responsibly\nOur number one goal and responsibility is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for. Gamelyn Games brings years of experience to this project and has overseen all of our planning and arrangements to ensure Darkrock Ventures will be delivered to all backers in a timely manner just like all of their previous projects.\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, just as much every pledge makes a difference, regardless of amount. Unfortunately shipping costs are something we all have to face, but that does not mean we cannot be transparent about this challenge and tackle it responsibly. The learning experiences Gamelyn Games has overcome with shipping have come to this campaign in full, and we aim to manage our (and your) risk in a responsible and professional manner.\nShipping costs are a very real factor. They can be volatile and are never trivial. Further, I do not feel that claiming to offer \"Free Shipping\" only to hide that very real & significant cost somewhere else is the best way of doing things and our backers deserve better. We have decided to offer affordable FLAT-RATE shipping to various regions, but at the same time offer CUSTOMS-FRIENDLY shipping available to ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD through our friends at Ship Naked to offer the best overall value we can for your pledge.\nWe will always endeavor to keep shipping charges as low as possible by offering discounts on pledges for more than one copy at a time through campaign rewards and add-ons made available through Pledge Manager. The best way to get the game for the lowest cost possible is to split a multi-pack with some friends or family members, everyone can share the cost benefit and more copies ordered means Darkrock Ventures itself will become a better game.\nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partner, Ship Naked, offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. While we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in Ship Naked's ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. Historically, Gamelyn Games has had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. Pledge with Confidence!\nInternational Backers Please Keep in Mind: While the shipping costs outside the USA are greater, every base copy of the game will be sold $11 below MSRP through this campaign, with discounts even greater when multiple copies are ordered. Plus, you are guaranteed to get the game before general retailers AND with all bonus content which may never be available at retail at all. Making you pledge in this campaign your BEST VALUE for the complete Darkrock Ventures experience! Get some friends together to split a multi-pack to maximize the value for your pledge!\nClick the image to see an interview with the Designer of Darkrock Ventures!\n                                                                                                                                                                  Michael Eskue is the designer of Darkrock Ventures, as well as many other awesome games such as the TableTop-featured Council of Verona from Crash Games.

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe at Magic Meeple Games are new to publishing, but not to the industry; and with Gamelyn games are our publishing partner, we're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic design over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated. All we need now is your pledges to make it happen!\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer Gamelyn Games has used to create all of their previous projects. Gamelyn Games and Magic Meeple Games both have a great relationship with their team, we are very familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together, we have created some great games and products and we hope that Darkrock Ventures will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They have been responsible for the fulfillment of previous Gamelyn Games titles. All of which were delivered on schedule reliably and professionally. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers and they have extended the same level of service and expertise to Magic Meeple Games' publications as well. \n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project is immune to the possible mishap, they can happen to anyone but we want to show that this road is familiar to all parties involved and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. Thank you for your confidence and support!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible. \n\nWe will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! We couldn't do it without you! Let's bring Darkrock Ventures to the gaming world!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTiny Epic Kingdoms: Heroes Call just finished its campaign, but with Magic Meeple Games on the case, TEK:HC will cause no delays or have any negative impact whatsoever on the production and fulfillment of Darkrock Ventures. We plan for backers of BOTH campaigns to receive their shipments on schedule.\n\nAll Gamelyn Games projects have completed fulfillment successfully. Some backers even received their games and figures early! Backers have since written in with elation about the games, the figures and the management of the projects.\n\nOur backers make these games possible!

Some kind of virus or poison is turning ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. You must lead citizens and emerging heroes to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, attempt to coordinate the discovery of a cure, and preserve as much of the area and as many of its inhabitants as possible. There's no time to lose\u2026\nDawn of the Zeds: Third Edition, by Victory Point Games, is a cooperative States of Siege\u2122 board game for 1-4 players that plays in 90+ minutes. Your heroes must defend Farmingdale and its five outlying villages from the encroaching horrors. These heroes are supported by civilians (some armed, some heroic) and what little outside help is forthcoming. You must prevent the Zeds incursion from reaching the town center or causing so much chaos around Farmingdale that the government abandons it (and you)!\nThere's a whole world to experience for players new to the apocalyptic city of Farmingdale. For players who have experienced Dawn of the Zeds in previous editions, there are plenty of new things to discover as well.\n1-4 player co-op & solitaire game play \nSix expanding levels of game play\nHeroes with unique abilities \nTruly cinematic game play experience \nYou can check out an example of how Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition plays in our Peek & Play video below!\nYou can take a look at The Basic Game Rulebook here! and the Level Up!

There are several types of cards, each with a unique function. \nEach Hero card lists that Hero's unique gameplay abilities and backstory. The mix of Heroes dictates your strategy for defeating the oncoming Zed horde!\nEvent cards narrate and illustrate the game\u2019s story, manage some of the game\u2019s AI (artificial intelligence), and create those wonderful/dreadful moments that can only happen during a zombie apocalypse.\nFate cards add even more variations to the game's story (sometimes for good, sometimes... not). Fate cards also trigger unique plot twists, which must be dealt with before resuming the struggle to save Farmingdale.\nHeroic Civilians are Civilians with special abilities; Research cards allow the possibility of discovering the cure to Z.E.D. and the innovative Super Weapon; Reference cards provide quick information about several types of units.\nEach stretch goal that is unlocked beyond our initial funding goal will be included with all pledges that include a copy of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition as well as the retail version.\n The poll for choosing the new Hero's abilities is NOW CLOSED!

For International backers, add an additional $5 for shipping costs.\nThe previous versions of Dawn of the Zeds have been a favorite of our fans. We really wanted to enhance the game with co-op play while introducing it to more people that we know would love Zeds. This also means that we would have to build Dawn of the Zeds non-stop at our in-house factory in Costa Mesa. While we do pride ourselves on our ability to physically produce our own games, we can't realistically tackle this behemoth of a Zed all on our own.\nBy pledging to this game, you are helping The Little Game Company fund its first out-of-house print run. This is a big step for us. To say we're anxious and excited is an understatement!\nReviews \nHere are some reviews of Dawn of the Zeds: Second Edition:\n\"Clear the table for Dawn of the Zeds, a zombie game you won\u2019t want to miss.\" - Tom Chick, Quarter to Three\n\u201cThis is a great, great game from Victory Point Games...The whole siege defense action of gameplay is fun to me, and it makes for an entertaining solitaire game.\u201d \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cIt has that extra flavor there, and identifiable characters that have very unique and different abilities and different traits... Definitely pick this up!\u201d \u2013 Drive Thru Review\n\"One hell of a nail biting, action packed, zombie fueled spectacular! Anyone who enjoys the zombie genre... owes it to themselves to have DotZ in their collection!\" - Jeff McAleer, The Gaming Gang\nWe are using Ship Naked, which is \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide.\" That means it is EU-Friendly! Here's what Ship Naked has to say on their site: \nEU-Friendly means that your packages will ship via a method that will minimize the expenses of customs, brokerage fees, and other expenses for the recipient in the European Union... as well as Canada-Friendly, USA-Friendly, Australia-Friendly, really just downright Friendly!\nWe are working with Ship Naked to get the best possible shipping rates for everyone. Essentially, this is done through shipping zones. The shipping zone that you live in determines how much shipping you will pay. This is much cheaper for you than if we were to ship everything from our office in Costa Mesa, CA, and allows us to provide discounts that we wouldn\u2019t be able to provide otherwise.\nWe are also doing what we can at VPG to absorb some of the shipping cost. As you can see below, we are providing a discount so that shipping is free in the US. We then take that discount and apply it to all of the shipping zones. For example, if it were to cost $10 to ship something in the States, we give $10 off to all other shipping zones.\nHere are the shipping rates for one copy of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition, which is the highest per-game shipping rate:\nUS: Free!\nCanada: $7 \nFrance/Germany/UK: $10 \nEU: $20 \nRest of World: $25 \nYou may notice in the add-on section that the shipping costs are cheaper than what is stated above. This is due to shipping weights. Basically, the more games you order, the cheaper it is to ship per unit.\nAll sales are final. Because Victory Point Games is not handling shipping, please direct all claims for damaged packages/goods to Ship Naked.\nBulk Orders\nAnyone who would like to place a bulk order, such as retailers or distributors, should contact us directly at distribution[at]victorypointgames.com or through Kickstarter and we\u2019ll be happy to work with you to get you set up with whatever you need.\nSpecial Thanks!\nAll of us at Victory Point Games want to take the time to thank the following people. Zeds Third Edition would not be the game it is today if it weren't for you. THANK YOU! \nLines Hutter, Wes Erni, David Spangler, David Kennedy, Delphine Echassoux, all the folks on BGG that had comments and corrections for edition 2, all the other playtesters and Zed heads that helped us along the way, and Doron Dill (Accent Media Labs) and Monson Douglas for the great video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we stated under \"Why Kickstarter,\" this will be the first game that VPG has produced out-of-house.

If you do not already have the original meeples, the $48 pledge level would give you 1-of-each of all 32 factions from the original game and the Heroes' Call expansion.\nYou could then use the standard meeples that come with the game, just as you normally would, and then use our lovely Character Meeples (which match the art for each faction) to represent your 32 heroes.\nOption B (The Complete Upgrade):\nYou may already be playing your copy of Tiny Epic Kingdoms with our fabulous 112-piece Character Set. Your love of everything Tiny Epic is unparalleled! You are ready to complete your set with another 112-piece set of Character Meeples for the 16 new factions of Heroes' Call! The complete sets of Character Meeples are 7-piece sets of each faction, with two pledge levels to pick from, depending on whether or not you already have the original 112-piece set or not.\nBy choosing this option, you are completely replacing the stock meeples with Meeple Source Character Meeples. This expansion incorporates heroes though, which are currently being represented by a larger solid color meeple. We wanted to come up with a way to distinguish your hero as such, without compromising the Character Meeple art that perfectly matches the game itself. Understanding the importance of being able to identify a hero as such at just a glance, we have decided to include 32 gold-colored wooden pedestals (for free) with your complete set of meeples, for your heroes to stand on. In testing this concept, we simply used a single drop of super glue under each foot of the meeple, which did the trick. Another option that some of you may choose would be to hand paint the base color (the sides/edge of the meeple) another color, such as gold or silver, to differentiate your hero from the others. In any case, we will not be painting or gluing your hero meeples for you, but allowing you to choose how to give your distinguished heroes the recognition they deserve!\nAs of July 14th, we do currently have a limited number of the 16-piece sets of original TEK Character Meeples and the 112-piece complete sets of original TEK Character Meeples, available for immediate shipping (separate from your Kickstarter pledge) at MeepleSource.com.\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally.\nCynthia Landon and Chris Landon are the sibling duo that started MeepleSource shortly after discovering euro gaming.

Although we are happy with all of the Character Meeples we have made to date, the colors and level of detail achieved do vary. \n\nPrinting delays are still always possible, though we feel confident that we will not encounter any trouble in this area. We learned all about this in our first Kickstarter project, since there were 150 different Character Meeples all being manufactured, quality-controlled, and shipped at the same time. Although we have recently been able to speed up our meeple creation process a bit, all while achieving the highest possible quality, the risk of production delay is present in all manufacturing.\n\nFinally, we personally perform all of the necessary quality control, package and ship all orders, and manage customer service inquiries. If we do encounter any delays (or other problems), we will certainly let you know. We are very proud of our customer service reputation, to which our past backers and website customers can attest!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Tiny Epic Western Meeples & Over 30 Other Game Upgrade Kits!

To do this, I have adjust my shipping discounts from previous projects. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 and/or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.   \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes. \nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a cooperative Tower Defense game Tiny Epic Defenders and a intergalactic dice driven/engine building game Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began January of 2013 on Kickstarter with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has sold a collective total of over 20,000 copies.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Kingdoms\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Defenders\nTiny Epic Galaxies, the third installment in the series. \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Galaxies Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nGamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future!

It is prone to many opportunities for mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects from Kickstarter.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer we have used to create Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures, the GIANT Meeples, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders, and Tiny Epic Galaxies. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition will be our next!\n\n3. Professional fulfillment is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders and, the soon to be shipped, Tiny Epic Galaxies. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process, as to involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nI will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!
