[{"backer": "Zombie Orpheus", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Be Seen As The Hero Of Your Story!\nNeverEnding is developing a new toolbox for D&D players, DMs, other TTRPG gamers, and storytellers of all kinds. Featuring a built in Character Builder, with beautiful hand-drawn options so you can create your heroes, villains, and NPCs how you see them. \nWhether you play Dungeons & Dragons 5E, Pathfinder 2E, Call of Cthulhu, Savage Worlds, Cyberpunk, or another game, we have something for you!\nIntroducing TWO New body options plus FOURTEEN additional armor options!\nWith this Kickstarter we\u2019re expanding our body options, and giving you more fantasy clothing options, plus so many amazing new weapons to choose from.\nThere's even MORE New weapons an shields we're adding! More than 50 new options in total!\nTell us what other options you'd like us to add in the comments!\n The Beta is Live at https://www.beneverending.app/ and already has loads of options.\n\nYou can also capture your character\u2019s backstory and personality by adding a bio.\n Tokens. \nExpected release May 2021\nWant to use your character in a virtual tabletop like Roll20 or Fantasy Grounds? We're making it easy! You'll be able to choose from loads of unique and interesting token frames with just a click.\nPoses.\nExpected release July 2021\nOur programmers are hard at work making it so you can change your character's pose with a single click! With this addition we'll be one big step forward in helping you turn your adventures into webcomics and animated videos.\nWebcomics and Animated Videos.\nExpected BETA July 2021 and October 2021\nWe're focusing on the Character Builder today, but eventually you'll be able to import your characters into our Scene Creator and Story Animator tools to create and publish party portraits, webcomics, and even animated videos of your adventures and story ideas.\n Late Addition Stretch Goal!\n(April 9 update) We're really excited to have unlocked Wolfborn and Kitsune options, but someone reminded us we forgot my favorite of them all. MOUSEFOLK!\nIf you can help us get to $7,000 by April 10 at 11:59 pm (EDT), we'll include Mousefolk options, even though they weren't part of the original plan. \n(How could we not have included them? Help us fix this oversight!)\nSo, if the Character Builder App is already live in Beta... why back it now?\nDon't wait. Support us because you want more options faster. \nDon't pay for expansions. Unlock stretch goals to include those features for YOU for free!\n\n1. We want to introduce these two new body types, 14 armor options, 50+ new weapon and shield options, PLUS even more if you back us and unlock stretch goals. Even though we've drawn these new bodies, there's a lot of work still to render the different armor and other options, so they can be included in the builder. If you back us, it'll give us the boost we need to secure additional time from our artists make these and more character options available to you.\n\n2. Other than the new body choices, most of the options we're including in this Kickstarter will be available only as specific purchases, achievements, or as \"Hero Tier\" member items. Hero Tier members are those who purchase a full year membership - OR Back Us On Kickstarter (that's you). By backing us today - you get access to premium features for 18 months (that's *counts fingers and toes* way more than 12)! And you never loose your saved characters, even if you don't renew.\n\n***We can't say this enough: you ALWAYS have access to all your created characters, plus free tools even if you don't renew your membership.***\n\n3. Finally, supporting us by backing the Kickstarter tells us that there are people who want to use the character builder and that we should continue investing in expanding and improving both features and options.\n\nHow We'll Use The Funds\nNow that we've successfully launched a robust Beta of our Character Builder, and are approaching 2,000 members - it's time to give you MORE! We're raising funds to add new bigger heroic body types to our character builder, more armor, and more weapons.\n\nFunds will be used to pay for additional time from our team of amazing artists, so they can create all of these hand drawn options for you and make them work in our Character Builder.\nGo to https://beneverending.com/about-us/ to see our full team. \nWe're all counting on your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there's always a risk of something catastrophic or unexpected, we're well positioned to deliver. This is our second Kickstarter. And we've been delivering on those rewards (like the Character Builder). The Beta is live and the bodies drawn. It's not that much more work - we just need some help from you to get us across the finish line.\n\nWe have learned a LOT! While we're still building out the full story animation platform, the Character Builder was a key component. That is live in Beta already. We're approaching 2,000 people using the Character Builder to create their D&D characters, social media avatars, Roll20 tokens and more. \n\nWe add new character options every week and have done a good job streamlining the art pipeline process.\n\nWe have the new character models created. It's just a matter of adjusting all of the components to fit the new models, and some of that work has already been done. We need the funds to pay for additional art and programming time from our artists and developers, without slowing down the development of the rest of the platform.\n\nOur big lift was the posing of the characters. We've solved that technical challenge and are working to implement it.

But if the red legacy journal is all that you want, You can go to the website and purchase it there for full price with shipping and most likely lose your opportunity to get your hands on an IMA journal.

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art. This version will be released shortly after we have sent our files to the printer and you'll have access to it before the physical copies have been delivered.\n Warrior: $50 (plus shipping)All of the benefits of both the Whisperer and the Tinkerer plus you'll get one full color hard cover edition and access to all Stretch Goals.

You pay for the shipping for your copy and we'll pay for the shipping to the reservation copy.\n Scout: $150 (plus shipping) For Friendly Local Games Stores Only. With this pledge you'll receive 6 copies of Coyote and Crow (1 case). You'll receive these at the same time as other Kickstarter backers, in advance of the general release.\n Seeker: $400 (plus shipping) (ALL GONE) For those that really want to support Coyote and Crow! All of the benefits of the Whisperer, Tinkerer, Warrior and Healer pledges, but your book will be signed and numbered by Connor Alexander. You'll also receive three high quality art prints of art used in the book (which ones, to be determined). This level is limited to 50 backers.\nIt still hungers. Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

Today we hit another tremendous milestone. Thank you all so much for your continued generosity and support. Our whole crew is elated over the response to their work and we're all so excited to finish what we've started.\nI also have  a slightly embarrassing situation to address. A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

Thinking it's because she's running on too little sleep, she pulls into a roadside motel for the night.

It's got something to do with a mysterious object in a blue case, a dead gun-runner, Aleister Crowley, a cursed weapon imbued with the trauma of a million murders, and one super cool Panther Pink 1971 Demon powered by Chrysler's infamous \"Slant 6\" engine, a motor renown for its durability.\nPure grindhouse pulp-horror, Hellbound Slant 6 combines a few of my favorite things; cool cars, heavy metal, the devil, and bad-ass women.

They teamed up with a likeminded DoP and put all their worldly money towards a fantasy feature film [pictured below], made with goodwill and steep learning curves... this formed the first steps into their world of Myrlan. Following their first taste of filmmaking, the team formed Pale Raven Pictures and dove into writing the 126-page draft for the sequel - for some time, that's as far as this world got.\nA few short films and award-winning music videos later, the fantasy world of Myrlan calls again - this time with 4 years of training and experience in writing and directing, not to mention a rich research into medieval combat techniques. Now, with our incredible cast and devoted team all working for the love of the project, we can bring life to Myrlan like never before. How much of the world we can show... is up to you.\nFrom \"Blessed\" - Pale Raven Pictures, 2016\n This is a standalone short film.\nThere are no hidden secrets or references to past manifestations, this is the standalone first chapter of Myrlan's story. We have chewed over many imaginings of the land and its narratives: our world-building has spanned the 6 years since our first film, resulting in two feature screenplays, five short screenplays and a short story - these build a deep reference for the vivid world we present now, in Myrlan.\nWhere we go next is untold... a feature film? Series? We have plans that will lead us to those conversations, with this film as our credentials. You can be sure you're playing a hand in the birth of a grand story.\n\"Myrlan\" development - background to the story and inspiration references for people and costume.\n All funds for this project go straight into production and distribution.\nAny funds we receive will be visible in the film: a costume, an axe, a shield, a tankard... Or be used for the film's visibility, by entry into film festivals - a commitment we make to promote all artists involved in Myrlan.\nOur pitch is simple: everyone working on this project is a volunteer in their professional role. Many will be balancing this against day jobs and other professional work in acting or filmmaking and we are overwhelmed with the devotion and support we've already received from our team. We do not expect artists to work for exposure on feature productions, however, short films don't make money, they cost money. They are an investment in the careers of the artists involved. As the production company we have the responsibility to deliver our actors, stunt performers, camera persons, composer, make-up artists, costume designers and art department a career milestone that is worthy of their dedication and time.\nThe duty of Pale Raven Pictures is to \"springboard artists into the arts industry\". We are working with keen and incredibly talented artists breaking into one of the world's toughest industries (especially after the events of 2020!) - backing this project is investing in the careers of over 40 independent artists.\nFrom \"Alone\" - Pale Raven Pictures, 2018 [click to view]\nAbout the Director and Co-writer, Cieran.\nPart of the co-writing duo behind all Pale Raven's fantasy projects, Cieran writes non-stop. As an independent writer, he has a feature screenplay and 10 shorts under his belt - one recently selected as Semi-Finalist in a screenwriting award.\nHe's fascinated with world-building and loves actors to be able to work in a day-dream where the film world becomes their reality... From his own training in acting, he has an eye for performance and a good hunch for casting, which proved useful when considering over 300 applications for parts in Myrlan..!\nCieran [right] on the set of a Viking combat showcase, 2019 [click to view]\nAbout the Producer and Co-writer, Dale.\nDale has written, directed and performed in independent theatre productions, as well as producing and co-writing a number of films for Pale Raven Pictures. He trained for 4 years in acting, honing transformative character performances. He has worked professionally as an actor for scare attractions, adverts, educational videos and even hosts a pub quiz or two.\nDale's passion is historical combat. He trained for 5 years in HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) and 1 year with the Viking Society, choreographing numerous fight scenes. Dale's goal in Myrlan is to make the combat scenes as realistic and as adrenaline-fuelled as possible.\nDale on the set of our award-winning music video \"Big Noise\" which he produced and co-directed [click to view]\nWe have already started shooting.\nProduction has commenced on test shoots and some preliminary scenes. We aim to shoot the majority of the film in MARCH 2021 and have a finished film by AUGUST 2021.\nAs 2020 has taught us, things have been hard to set in stone. Cieran has trained extensively in Covid-compliance filmmaking, and is a qualified Covid Co-ordinator with First Option Ltd. He has already shot a short film during national lockdown, following health & safety guidelines to the letter and imagining creative solutions for transmission-prevention beyond just using PPE.\nBeer tent, on the set of \"Myrlan\", 2020\nHave a look at how backing can build our story...\nWe have the tenacity to go ahead with production no matter what funds we have. Whether we exceed our goal or fall short, we'll still deliver you a great film - but you can bring it to life. With each goal achieved, we will curate the content of every frame to fit our budget and fully immerse you in Myrlan.\n Current goal: \u00a32750 | Unlocks Special Previously Unreleased Fantasy Origin Story...\n*To make budgets more fun, special content is unlocked in each level. Reaching the current goal of \u00a32750 unlocks a special, unreleased origin story that we shot back in 2018... We never found the right time to share this story, so step with us into the glades of Serpent's Head and a young lord's past...This will include thanks to all our new backers at the time of reaching that goal.\nIf you wish to back us anonymously and you're using a Kickstarter account, you can do this by changing your name in your profile settings. If we reach our goal and you backed using a guest account, we will contact you via the email you provide to request the name you wish to use.\nIt can be hard to imagine the effects of budgets, so we've expanded on it below:\nWith Cuts - \u00a3 Goal Not Reached At this level we would cut larger scenes from the film and re-write around these sections with less demanding sequences. We would lose a major fight scene and re-shoot a dialogue section to condense two scenes into one.\nPerformance Focused - \u00a3450 At this level we would focus intimately on the performances of our great cast. The film would be shot closer in, to avoid focus on set dressing, costume and location, and would have smaller fight scenes. It may play closer to a drama and explore inter-character relationships further.\nCharacter Focused - \u00a3800 Here we would have the liberty to explore the characters in Myrlan in more depth, creating unique costume items and props for them as well as additional supporting cast.\nStory Focused - \u00a31500 At the heart of Myrlan is its story. With this kind of support we would be able to access and dress bigger, bolder locations - showcasing Yorkshire's finest heritage sites. These will include long art department days, building the best environments for our actors to immerse themselves in Myrlan.\nWorld Focused - \u00a32750 Welcome to Myrlan. This backing will create the world of Myrlan as fully formed as it is in our script. If battle-ready swords and castles weren't enough, we'd also have the capacity to expand some scenes - including grander fights and an introduction to our capital city, Heim.\nExpanding Horizons - \u00a32750+ This support puts Myrlan into a whole different conversation. What we've set out to achieve with modest budgets can be imagined on a grander scale and make an unforgettable impression. We can go down paths we thought inaccessible, exploring visual effects, specialist equipment and admissions to prestigious film festivals. \nThe heart of our efforts is to support all artists involved in Myrlan and put them in the spotlight for their incredible work.\n\"Myrlan\" budget breakdown - we will update regularly on how we are distributing your support.\nThanks for taking the time to read.\nWe appreciate any support you may be able to give, from backing us to simply watching the film we create. By sharing this project online, by word of mouth or sending a raven to anyone you think might be interested, you are already supporting us, and we will raise a mug of mead in your honour when wrap night (\"wrap-narok\") comes!\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Myrlan in 2021\nDale in a camera test for \"Myrlan\", 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will go ahead with production no matter what funds we have. Whether we exceed our goal or fall short, we'll still deliver you a great film - but you can bring it to life. With each goal achieved, we will curate the content of every frame to fit our budget and fully immerse you in Myrlan.\nOur timeline will have to fit around government restrictions involving filming during the Covid-19 pandemic, however we believe with proper preparation, this shouldn't restrict us.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady? Let\u2019s Go!\nClick for a PDF of this graph!\nWondering what\u2019s involved in all those delicious bullet-points on that reward tier you\u2019ve been flirting with? Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Just a Taste", "descp": "All backers at $10 and up get immediate access to the fully playable prototype PDF.

Dream Foundry was hosting its first online convention, and Coral spent the day working on running the convention spaces, hosting the meetings, and moderating channels. Eliana kept screaming internally about how happy she was to be able to attend an online SFF convention. After a long day of great panels and a lot of coffee for Coral, the two happened to be in one of the voice chats and they began to talk. \nA few weeks later, an anonymous person sponsored Eliana for SFWA's Nebulas. The two met again in one of the breakout rooms where the Nebula winners were celebrating. The conversation steered towards the topic of SFF and Spanish, and how there were very few online spaces where people who wrote in Spanish could publish short fiction (and get paid for it!)  \nCoral contacted Eliana the following week and asked her what she thought about doing an online bilingual magazine, one that would publish stories in both English and Spanish. Eliana had already toyed with the idea before, so she immediately said yes. \nThe kindness of strangers, a little luck, and the amazing people who brought up the topic led to the creation of Constelaci\u00f3n Magazine, a bilingual speculative fiction magazine. \nEra una noche fr\u00eda de oto\u00f1o en Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, y una tarde gris de primavera en el estado de Washington. Dream Foundry llevaba acabo su primera convenci\u00f3n online, y Coral se pas\u00f3 el d\u00eda trabajando. Eliana no paraba de gritar internamente por lo feliz que estaba de participar en una convenci\u00f3n de SFF online. Tras un largo d\u00eda de paneles geniales, y mucho caf\u00e9 para Coral, las dos se encontraron en uno de los canales de voz y empezaron a charlar. \nUnas semanas despu\u00e9s, una persona an\u00f3nima sponsoreo a Eliana para que asista a los Nebulas, organizado por SFWA. Las dos volvieron a encontrarse en una de las salas de Zoom donde los ganadores del premio estaban celebrando. La conversaci\u00f3n gir\u00f3 en torno al tema de SFF en espa\u00f1ol, y c\u00f3mo hab\u00eda pocos lugares online donde la gente que escribe en el idioma pudiera publicar cuentos (\u00a1y recibir remuneraci\u00f3n por ello!). \nCoral le escribi\u00f3 a Eliana la siguiente semana, y le pregunt\u00f3 qu\u00e9 pensaba de la idea de hacer una revista online biling\u00fce que publicara historias en ingl\u00e9s y espa\u00f1ol. Eliana ya hab\u00eda tenido una idea similar, as\u00ed que inmediatamente dijo que s\u00ed. \nUn buen gesto an\u00f3nimo, un poco de suerte, y las personas geniales que hablaron del tema llevaron a que nazca Constelaci\u00f3n Magazine, una revista de ficci\u00f3n especulativa biling\u00fce. \nConstelaci\u00f3n Magazine will be published quarterly, and all its stories will be in English and Spanish.

After finishing school and never finishing college, I decided I would be a writer when I won my first short story contest in 2011. I didn't even consider writing my stories in English because I didn't feel anyone would want to read the stories I wanted to write. \nAfter reading about #DignidadLiteraria, I realized that much like I approach my own writing, if I wanted a place like this to exist, I'd have to create it myself. I want Constelaci\u00f3n to be the place I yearned for back then, a place that actively says: bring me your stories with names that I don't know, open the windows for me to get to know where you come from and your dreams and your struggles, and even better if it's from a small country I don't know much of. So maybe, another little girl from Paraguay, Zambia, the Philippines, Nicaragua, Guyana, Qatar, or Malaysia, or anywhere in the world, will grow up knowing that her stories are valid regardless of the language they're written in. That they matter and that there's an enormous world out there waiting to read them. \nEn sus palabras, Eliana Gonz\u00e1lez Ugarte\nEncontrar libros de ficci\u00f3n especulativa en Paraguay era dif\u00edcil antes de la era del internet, as\u00ed que crec\u00ed leyendo lo que hab\u00eda disponible en la biblioteca de mi colegio. Tras graduarme y nunca terminar la universidad, decid\u00ed que ser\u00eda una escritora despu\u00e9s de ganar mi primer concurso de cuentos cortos en 2011. Ni siquiera consider\u00e9 escribir mis cuentos en Ingl\u00e9s porque no pens\u00e9 que alguien querr\u00eda leer las historias que yo quer\u00eda escribir.\nDespu\u00e9s de leer sobre #DignidadLiteraria, me di cuenta que as\u00ed como encaro mi escritura, si quer\u00eda que exista un lugar como este, tendr\u00eda que crearlo yo. Quiero que Constelaci\u00f3n sea el lugar que yo anhelaba en aquel entonces, un lugar que dice: tr\u00e1iganme sus historias con nombres que no conozco, abran las ventanas para que pueda aprender de d\u00f3nde ven\u00eds, tus sue\u00f1os y tus luchas, y mejor todav\u00eda si es de un lugar que no conozco mucho. Entonces, quiz\u00e1, otra ni\u00f1a de Paraguay, Zambia, Filipinas, Nicaragua, Guyana, Qatar o Malasia, o cualquier lugar del mundo, crecer\u00e1 sabiendo que sus historias son importantes, y que hay un mundo enorme all\u00e1 afuera que quiere leerlas. \n In her words, Coral Alejandra Moore\nAfter the Nebula Awards in 2020, I happened to be sitting in a Zoom room with a handful of people. The conversation wound back and forth, as they usually do, and I some point Mary Robinette Kowal asked a perfectly innocent question. \"I wonder if there's a market for Spanish speculative fiction in this country?\" \"Absolutely!\" was out of my mouth so quickly it could never be taken back, and just like that, my brain was already moving pieces around to figure out if I knew how to make that happen. So my answer to the question of \"Why now?\" is quite simple: Because it's about time.\nEn sus palabras, Coral Alejandra Moore\nDespu\u00e9s de los premios Nebulas de este a\u00f1o, ocurri\u00f3 que estaba sentada en una sala de Zoom con un grupo de gente. La conversaci\u00f3n iba de tema en tema, como suele ocurrir, y en un momento Mary Robinette Kowal hizo una pregunta inocente. \"\u00bfMe pregunto si en este pa\u00eds hay mercado para historias de ficci\u00f3n especulativa en espa\u00f1ol?\" \"\u00a1Absolutamente!\" sali\u00f3 de mi boca tan r\u00e1pido que nunca podr\u00eda retractarme, y as\u00ed, mi cerebro ya empez\u00f3 a mover las piezas para ver si podr\u00eda hacerlo. Entonces mi respuesta a \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no? es bastante simple: porque ya era hora. \n\n\n\nAround the world, in various cultures, constellations have often been linked to the practice of astrology.

I'm a tabletop game designer you may know from games and books like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Betrayal at House on the Hill, The Maze of Games, Apocrypha, and Lords of Vegas. Once the latter game was off to the printer, I went part time at Lone Shark for a few months to try to do something positive in the last months of this election cycle. \nSo I wrote, edited, and designed a massive new edition of my essay book Game Theory in the Age of Chaos, alongside my mathematician co-author Rich Malena-Webber. It's a strategy guide on how to fight fascism. My team and I are raising funds to print the book here on Kickstarter. We're doing this because game theory suggests this is our last chance to save America.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos is a 532-page book of 65 essays about game theory and politics. Every day since Donald Trump got elected, I've fought the urge to scream at the internet. Instead, I channeled that howling into a series of essays showing how game theory explains and justifies the behavior of all the actors in the system: Trump, the Democrats, the Republicans, the Supreme Court, and most of all, people like us. By taking a deep breath, remaining level-headed, and letting my grasp of game science do its work, I've connected with my readers on Medium, and had my essays shared all over the world. Alongside my Basket of Adorables colleague Gaby Weidling, we made a small edition of some of those essays a couple years ago, supported by scholarly essays by Rich, who teaches game theory to raise funds for Democrats. We also sent copies to every Democratic Senator and Congressperson, with your help.\nNow, as we count down the last weeks of this election, I've compiled a massive new omnibus edition, with forty new essays by me and supporting pieces from Rich, plus an all-new foreword from game enthusiast and Washington senator Steve Hobbs. It's quite the book, I think.\nAs with our last campaign like this, we're also giving U.S. backers the option to send a copy to every Democratic member of the incoming Congress. If you're feeling particularly generous, you can get the book sent to ten Congresspeople. Based on the letters we got from them, some of them actually read it and applied its tactics to help beat back the autocrats and restore democracy in America. If you select that option, we'll cover the shipping to a Congress member. Because we don't actually know who these members will be, we're going to do this in one batch, rather than have individual backers select Congresspeople. We'll also send them a note which has your name on it (if you want).\nFor readers in the United States, we have another option for you. This Kickstarter is about raising funds for the book; it is NOT a political fundraiser. \nBut we also care deeply about winning this election. So, you can go to our site at SHARK.VOTE and back the book there instead, and we'll give you the book for free if you do some critical election integrity tasks like volunteering. You'll be treated as if you had backed the campaign when we send the information to our pledge manager after this campaign ends. Again, you don't have to back here if you select this option. If you do want to back here as well, we'll send you a book for each campaign you back.\nThis is just for Americans, since soliciting foreign interference in campaigns is still illegal last time we checked. If you're from outside the U.S., please back the book here!\nThe book is done. We sent it to the printer last week. They're putting the finishing touches on it now. In fact, you can read all of it right now, because it's right here. Go ahead, flip through it. If you like it, get yourself a copy.\nIf you order a physical book for $25, you'll not only get it in softcover, but also as a PDF. You can add it in ebook form (.epub and .mobi) for an additional $5. Or you can just get all three digital versions for $15.\nContents pages\nEssay pages\nHere are some of the essays in the book.\nGame Theory and the Two Magic Words that will Impeach Trump\nCo-op Mode: Why Trump Sees \u201cMany Sides\u201d to Nazi Murder\nAbortion Rights and the Game Theory of Armor\nGood Guys, Bad Guys, and the End of an Armed Society\nThe Kap Trap: Why No Team will Call in Kaepernick\nThe GOP Is Living in a Fantasy World on Taxes\u2014Specifically, Star Wars\n#MPRraccoon and the Puzzle of Hope\nSeizing Children Is Good Policy (If You\u2019re a Complete Monster)\nMike Pence is the Werewolf\nGame-Changer: How the Democrats Won the Kavanaugh War by Losing the Battle\nPlaying Diplomacy with Nancy Pelosi is a Dangerous Game\nBarr Sinister: How to Beat a Corrupt Referee\nI Don\u2019t Think She Knows About Second Brexit, Pip: How Theresa May\u2019s War of Attrition Killed Everyone\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Want to Save the Planet. You Just Have To.\nThe Butt Fumble: Rudy Giuliani and the Incompetence Gambit\nThe Progressive Voltron: How to Buy an Election\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Take Responsibility at All\u201d: Trump Fails the Trolley Problem\nWhen the Social Contract Dies, It\u2019s Time to Riot\nSouthern Discomfort: Lose the Confederacy or Lose Billions\n2020 Vision: What to Do When Everything Is Life-or-Death\nA Wargame Designer Defines Our Four Possible Civil Wars\nHere's the size of the book itself. It's solid.\nPLAY\n\nSome of these essays are pretty heavy, it's true. For me, it helps to crank up the volume on my favorite thematically appropriate tunes. So, I've assembled some of these songs, with the artists' kind permission. Because they want to fight fascism too. Each book comes with a digital copy of the album Music to Doomscroll By.\nThe songs include:\n Austin Wintory\u2019s \u201cThe Storm\u201d\n The Doubleclicks\u2019 \u201cPanic\u201d\n Jim Boggia\u2019s \u201cNothing\u2019s Changed\u201d\n Jonathan Coulton\u2019s \u201cSolid State\u201d\n Jonathan Mann\u2019s \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Dissent\u201d\n Kid Beyond\u2019s \u201cCEASEFIRE\u201d\n Kirby Krackle\u2019s \u201cQuaransheen\u201d\n Marian Call and the Guttersnipes\u2019 \u201cConsequence\u201d\n Mega Ran\u2019s \u201cDo Better\u201d\n Molly Lewis\u2019s \u201cPantsuit Sasquatch\u201d\n Quelle Chris and Chris Keys\u2019 \u201cSudden Death\u201d\n Sidecar Astronauts\u2019 \u201cNazi Puncher\u201d\nAnd maybe more when we get done with it. It's music for your brain and your tapping toes. The music comes with the PDF of every copy of the book. Free.\nHere's a slice from Meg, whose music you can also hear in our Kickstarter video above.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos isn't my first political project. My best known bit of outreach is The Ghastlytrump Tinies, a parody of Edward Gorey's The Gashlycrumb Tinies that Gaby and I did with approval of the Edward Gorey House. The initial run of the book raised about $10,000 for Democrats and the Southern Poverty Law Center. You can add on a copy of The Ghastlytrump Tinies to your pledge by adding $10 to your pledge. You'll get the booklet plus a PDF of The Annotated Ghastlytrump Tinies, which contains 26 more longform poems by me.\nThe Ghastlytrump Tinies is an alphabet primer of all the things we stood to lose in a Trump administration. From \"A is for Arctic, drilled by wells so tall\" to \"Z is for Zeitgeist, cuz it's the apocalypse,\" we got our favorite artists and cartoonists\u2014John Kovalic, David Malki!, Satine Phoenix, Heather Hudson, Kris Straub, Lar deSousa, Nate Taylor, and so many others\u2014to illustrate one of the impending disasters as seen by a child. Over the last four years, it's become a tragic checklist, as the Trump administration has found a way to ruin just about everything good.\nIt's a poignant, funny, troubling work. I encourage you to watch the Doubleclicks' audiobook below.\nLone Shark's games are played by people of every political and social background, and we're thankful for that. But we're people too, and we all agree that trampling human rights and undermining democracy are bad things. We've never been shy of saying to people \"This is what we think\" as loudly as possible. Through our charity and social work, we've championed the rights of marginalized people since we started this company 18 years ago. In 2016, when we wanted to do more overtly political work, Gaby and I made a side group called Basket of Adorables. As Lone Shark's personnel decided they wanted to be a part of those efforts, we decided to fold that into our company. Everybody knows our opinions. If they're gonna hate on us for expressing them, we don't want them as customers anyway.\nWe're all game and puzzle creators, but trust us, you don't have to tell us to \"stick to game design.\" Honestly, we'd much rather be sticking to game design. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and so we're devoting our free time to helping restore the rule of democracy in America. Most of us contribute our time, writing, and illustration out of the hope that we'll have a positive effect on the national dialogue.\nI'm thrilled to be joined, as usual, by Richard Malena-Webber an academic, puzzle and game designer, and presenter. He's designed puzzles for everything from the launch of the Tomb Raider movie to live interactive crime-solving mysteries. Rich created and hosts Atomic Game Theory, a video series devoted to game analysis, and he created the Puzzle Keyring, an educational decryption tool for codes and ciphers. His recent project was a D&D summer camp for kids that was wildly successful.\nAs usual, I'm helped here by editors Gaby Weidling and F. Wesley Schneider, cover designer Liz Spain and Skylar Woodies, artists John Kovalic and Pat Race, and store and website manager Shane Steed. Plus everyone at Lone Shark. I appreciate their help, and of course yours as well. Thanks for helping restore democracy in America.

If the community is as excited as we are and this Kickstarter exceeds our goals, we\u2019ll be able to release features and the full platform sooner.

Expect additional art, feature upgrades, and feature additions- Regularly!\n What are some of those upgrades you can expect in the future:\nIn addition to more art, more poses, and more animations. we have a lot in store.\nA curated Community Storefront where other artists can make art available to you that's been reviewed for quality.\nMore robust custom (shareable) profile pages that you control and where your friends and fans can easily see and enjoy the amazing stories you create.\nEasy-to-browse channels of comic strips and videos created on the NeverEnding Platform.\nViewable/exportable character sheets with your custom character art as well as links to any comic strips or videos you've linked to your character.\nExportable item cards with Customizable flavor text and descriptions that you can print or share.\n\nYou've scrolled a really long way....

The brainchild of Kate Madison, known for her phenomenally popular Lord of the Rings fan film Born of Hope, and award winning actor Christopher Dane, the first season was released on YouTube in 2016.\nNow, Ren is back to fund new episodes and continue the story, with the help of a global audience of fans and supporters.\n\nWith 8 million YouTube views, 14 international awards and over 60 nominations, Ren: The Girl with the Mark is one of the most successful genre web series in the world. Season One is available to watch on YouTube, Starbaby TV, Amazon Prime (US, UK and Germany), The Fantasy Network and Seed & Spark.\nWe plan to continue from where we left off, following Ren as she\u2019s pursued by the Kah\u2019Nath while also dealing with being wrenched from everything familiar. Ren was torn away from her friends and family at the end of last season and thrown together with the outlaw Hunter. Ren desperately wants to find Karn and her brother, she needs answers and cannot abandon Baynon like she feels her parents did to her. Hunter joins her on her quest, he wants to help her, or is there more to it than that? Does he have his own agenda? \nThe pair don't have much time to figure out a plan before the pursuing Kah'Nath catch up to them. Ren's new bond with the Mahri spirit starts to grant her memories from those Nuh'Mahri who came before but will she be able to figure out the powers that now start to develop without a guide to show her the way? \nMany of the main characters in Season One play an important role in Ren\u2019s journey so although we will be focusing on Ren we will also learn the fates of others as we move forward. We even have some new characters to introduce as the story continues, some may be fleeting but others may become significant players in Ren\u2019s story.\nAs Ren begins to come to terms with the circumstances she finds herself in, she will start to explore not only the physical world around her but the very fabric of society and the truths she has always been taught.\nRen is fan supported, creator distributed. There is no network behind it, no Hollywood studio. It lives or dies based on YOUR support. Season One could never have been made if it wasn't for the hundreds of people who backed it financially or volunteered their time to work on it.\nYes, Season One has been staggeringly successful on YouTube, but YouTube isn't a paid platform, so revenue is limited, and there's no public funding for web series in the UK. So we rely on our fans to help support the show, as Patrons and through crowdfunding campaigns like this. This way we can keep our creative vision and remain independent, and you get to keep watching the series you love with no risk of a big studio cancelling it.\nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so. You can pledge as little as \u00a31, or the equivalent in you local currency (Kickstarter automatically converts it). Backers will get updates along the way, they can grab some awesome rewards, and they'll be the first to know when the episodes are ready to watch.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Tell people how much you love the show and how you want to see more. If your loved ones don\u2019t know what Ren is, sit down and binge the first season with them. Share the love! #RenewRen #MakeYourMark \nCHEERLEAD: Crowdfunding can be exhausting for everyone. Helping us keep a positive and friendly community around this shared goal is essential. Everyone is here to have a great time collectively, bringing a story that we love to life for new episodes.\nWe want to make all five of our Season Two episodes for you, so as soon as we hit our initial target we'll start working on our stretch goals to fund new episodes. Watch this space for details.\n We\u2019re excited to offer you a selection of unique perks as a thank you for supporting us. Have a browse and remember you can change your reward pledge at any time, so if we add a new item you can always upgrade later.  \nWe\u2019ve worked hard to include rewards tailored to all members of our community, whether you\u2019re a filmmaker, gamer, collector or fantasy fan, and as the campaign runs we will be on the hunt for new items to add as well.  \nThe Fantasy Network, our campaign partner, is a community-owned network that funds and streams independent fantasy and science fiction from around the world. When our second season premieres, you\u2019ll get access to watch not just the new Ren episodes, but to discover other incredible shows from our global producers too. TFN is available on the web, iOS, Android, and Roku.\nThe Boar\nThere are five main coins in the currency of Ren's country, Alathia.  Ren was born during the 'Time of Dragons' and each coin has the dragon on its reverse, representing the current era, which changes every one hundred years. On the other side of the coin there is an image representing an admired human quality.  This quality is written in runes above the image with the name below.\nAs this trailer for the Season One videos shows,  the vlogs are a great way to learn about filmmaking as well as sharing in the fun of being on set.\nExample round\nDohl'Leg is a two-player fantasy betting game designed for the series by co-creator Christopher Dane. A roll of the letter die determines the live column for each round, and players place one bet each in the live column and one elsewhere on the board. The number die is then rolled, and the player with bets in the corresponding square scoop all the chips in that column. As the game goes on and the board fills up with chips, strategise where to hedge your bets and where to double down. Roll the Eye for a double payout, or roll the Mouth for an automatic win. Be the first to bag all of your opponent's chips, and don't forget to cheat when their back is turned!\nSeason One photo book\nRen\u2019s director of photography Neil Oseman has 20 years\u2019 experience of shooting independent films. In this course, he shares his knowledge across 4x hour-long modules that will take your cinematography to the next level. Each module sees Neil block, light and shoot a scene inspired by Ren, with real actors, on real locations, while explaining every creative and practical decision he makes. This course is aimed at students, budding gaffers, camera operators looking to step up to DP, content DPs looking to move into drama, and filmmakers looking to increase their production values through cinematic lighting. The course will be released in May 2020. \nOriginal clay sculpt for the Hunter miniature, by Hans Goosen\nNOTE: VAT/sales tax and shipping costs are not included in your pledge.  Actual VAT and shipping costs will be calculated and charged in  BackerKit after the campaign, based on your location. See the Shipping and VAT section for more information. \n\nWill Sophie Skelton return for Season Two?\nDue to her commitments on Outlander and other projects, Sophie is unable to return to the role of Ren. We're sad to see her go, but we're so grateful to her for bringing our title character to life, and we wish her all the very best. We're also super-excited to have discovered a gifted young actor who can take the character forward into her future adventures! \nWhat is Kickstarter?\nKickstarter lets the community decide if a project deserves to succeed. Pledges are ONLY collected if we reach our minimum funding goal. If we don\u2019t reach our goal, no money is collected and the project fails. This helps reduce your risk, knowing that you will only be charged if we raise enough funds to make the project properly.\nRather than relying on the whims of network or studio executives, we empower you the community to renew the shows that you love.\nWhile pledge rewards on Kickstarter are exciting \u2014 and a great way for us to say thank you! \u2014 the most important reward is that together we get to continue the story of Ren: The Girl with the Mark. Thank you for making a pledge that helps us put as much of our fundraise as possible straight into the production and what you see on screen.\nAs such, our policy for funds pledged in excess of pledge levels is that they are considered bonus funds for production. Please do not add any additional money during the Kickstarter for BackerKit shipping, VAT, or extras \u2014 it will not carry over to BackerKit. It will turn into costumes, set decoration, hiring cast and crew, and making Ren: The Girl with the Mark the best possible thank you for the support that you\u2019ve given us.\nWhat is BackerKit?\nWhen the campaign ends, we will use BackerKit to send surveys, calculate and charge accurate shipping and VAT, and allow you to make address changes. You\u2019ll receive a link to the survey when it's ready, which you can use at any time to check on the status of your order.\nTo avoid unforeseen issues, not over or undercharge you, and to better let you manage your pledges, we have decided to not include shipping in the reward costs but to calculate it properly after the campaign in our BackerKit pledge manager.\nAs well as removing items you don't want from your reward to save on shipping, you will also be able to add extra items from the BackerKit store once the campaign on Kickstarter has ended, allowing you to tailor your reward to exactly what you want.\nFor similar reasons we have not included any sales TAX or VAT costs to the rewards. This will also be added, if needed, later in BackerKit.\nAs a company based in the UK, we recognize that changing political situations may affect our ability to ship \u201cin-zone\u201d for the EU. We will work with our fulfilment partners to make sure that VAT (or other duties) are handled properly up front so that packages within the EU will ship domestically, and to your door, whenever possible, from warehouses in Germany and/or the UK. Similarly, our fulfilment partners in North America will ship directly from a warehouse in the USA.\nFulfilment Partners\nThe Fantasy Network and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, both experienced crowdfunding companies, are helping us source and manage rewards fulfilment. Rewards in North America will ship via Funagain from their Indianapolis warehouse. Rewards in the EU will ship from UK and German warehouses. Digital downloads will be served via Vimeo, Gumroad, and BackerKit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. We are always prepared to adapt and adjust with circumstances outside our control. We will have production insurance, contingency plans, and an experienced production team to guide the production through any rough water.\n\nWe have learnt a lot from our previous campaigns. We are working with Ben Dobyns from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment so we also have their nine-year track record of crowdfunding success to help us through any problems. \n\nThe project will be submitted to IMDb. Backers listed as getting an IMDb credit please be aware that although submitted these credits are subject to IMDb approval.\n\nWe are building relationships with a number of partners like the team at BackerKit, manufacturers, fulfilment partners and everyone else we need to make sure that our campaign is completed to your satisfaction.\n\nOur pledge to you is that we will always do our utmost to deliver on our commitment to excellence.\n\nNOTE: We have budgeted for rewards and production based on current treaties, exchange rates, and tariffs. With the final form of Brexit still unknown, we want to make special note that our plans may require significant revision should Brexit or any domestic or global turbulence affect the production of Ren or delivery of your rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kate Madison: Mythica Entertainment\n2 created \u00b7 31 backed\nMythica Entertainment is a team of independent filmmakers in the UK committed to providing high-quality entertainment, specialising in the...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "TIP JAR", "descp": "Receive the backer-only updates and access to the post-campaign BackerKit store.\nNOTE: VAT/sales tax is not included in your pledge.

Ten (10) generic bases will be provided as part of rewards that include a Gameboard-1 unit. Games can also be played with purely digital pieces. \nOur display refresh rate allows fast-paced gameplay with low latency, from multiple contact points, when using physical or digital objects. \nWe've also designed the Gameboard-1 to connect to your personal electronic device for private screen game play or augmented reality applications.\nWIFI and Bluetooth integration allows personal electronic devices to create virtual interactions with the board environment, with or without internet access.\nTo increase screen real estate, the Gameboard-1 can even connect multiple gameboards for a multi-screen gaming experience, using NFC sensors and internal antenna arrays to make wireless connection seamless and fast.\nConnecting multiple Gameboard-1 units is a snap! (This image is a render to illustrate multiple-board functions.)\nGorgeous hardware isn't enough. We're gamers and we know what we want: more games! \nThis campaign will help us finish building a single marketplace that will offer thousands of individual titles a la carte and an optional monthly subscription service for unlimited access to that vast library of games and gaming tools. \nIt's like Netflix for games, including everything from classics like chess and checkers to modern strategy games to interactive and original creations from partner game creators, with networked game play similar to PSN or Xbox Live.\nWe are building partnerships with some of the biggest names in the hobby and gaming industry to create a robust library... and we're excited to reveal more partners over the course of this campaign.  \nWe want anyone to be able to bring their games to the platform. Our open developer SDK means that it is simple for developers to add and update their games in the ever-expanding games library.The Last Gameboard marketplace isn't restricted to board games. Developers can make any game or content they want: from purely digital board games to games that interact with physical pieces, cards, and dice in ways we haven't even imagined yet.\nWe don't take the term \"Partners\" lightly.  We provide GitHub, Architect and Engineer access to help drive innovation and product roadmap.  We are building a community. We are the community.   \nThe Last Gameboard technology is fully compatible with Unity and Unreal.\nThe Developer Edition includes everything you need to start creating your own games, programs, and innovations for this platform.   \nGameboard-1 is beautifully designed from the inside out. It's a sleek console with real world game play informing every element of design. \nWe have our prototype in the lab right now and cannot wait to share the first unit from the manufacturer in the coming weeks!    \nHere are just some of the hardware features we plan to include with every Gameboard-1 unit we ship:\nThe Gameboard-1 is designed with thin edges to maximize playable surface area, chemically strengthened glass and a plastic housing designed for durability.\nThe 1920x1920 LCD display exceeds the specification for high-definition, so that every detail is crisp and clear.\nPlus, at only five pounds, the device remains lightweight and portable. The on-board battery allows up to four hours of game play, so the game can continue by candlelight if the power goes out.\n Two USB-C ports support not only peripheral devices, but with a USB-C to HDMI adapter you can output the contents of the screen to another device, making Gameboard-1 perfect for Twitch and YouTube streamers who want to embed or overlay the game within Wirecast or OBS.\nPlay online with networked play, or download your game and enable the Gameboard-1 local WIFI network to connect private screens and peripherals when offline.\nFour speakers and microphones let sound become an integral part of your game play, while WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity makes syncing with your personal mobile device a breeze.\nAn onboard 64 GB eMMC hard drive stores your key files locally, while a 64-bit CPU and 4GB of RAM keep everything running smoothly on our custom-built The Last Gameboard OS (TLGOS).\nFAMILIES:  From your living room to visiting grandparents, now your entire game library can travel with you. Enjoy a family game with the kids, then stay up late with the latest strategy game.\nGAMERS: Thanks to full compatibility with D20Pro, now included in your subscription, gamemasters can direct the action with every tool available in a multi-player virtual tabletop... on a real tabletop! Interactive maps, combat management, and access to tabletop systems\u2014from Dungeons & Dragons to Pathfinder and beyond\u2014make Gameboard-1 a crucial part of your weekly campaign.\nGAME STORES: Immediately demo many of the games on your shelves for customers, helping to increase sales, then bring out Gameboard-1 again for open game night. Game stores are all about community and The Last Gameboard helps you focus on creating the extraordinary experiences that keep bringing regulars back to the table.\nSTREAMERS: An essential tool for tabletop streamers, Gameboard-1 lets you bring the details straight to your online audience. Forget trying to set up an extra camera above the table and lighting the board properly: now you can display partial or full game AV output right inside your favorite streaming software, while you focus on the interactive play that your audience loves.\nDEVELOPERS: Whether you're adapting your classic board game for TLGOS or creating an innovative new experience that merges tabletop with the unique capabilities of Gameboard-1, you're at the cutting edge of new technology, bringing games to a new generation of gamers.    \nWe've designed Gameboard-1 with the following technical specifications that we intend to meet or exceed in manufacturing:   \nA successful Kickstarter is just the first step in the process of bringing the Gameboard-1 to your door! \nFollowing the Kickstarter we will prepare and launch surveys on BackerKit, where you will be able to manage your pledge, update your shipping address, and where we will charge market prices for shipping and fulfillment. Please DO NOT add money for shipping during the Kickstarter, so that we can keep those costs as accurate as possible for each pledge level prior to shipping.\nWe are excited to use BackerKit for pledge management, where you will be able to select add-ons, update your shipping address, pay fair market prices for shipping, and track the status of your rewards.  \n The initial development of Gameboard-1 was funded thanks to a seed round of private capital, which allowed us to complete design of our prototype and finalize our manufacturing partnerships. Now we're bringing Gameboard-1 to Kickstarter to raise money to fund:\nManufacturing Testing (including beta boards)\nThe Manufacturing Run\nPackaging\nGameboard-1 Case Development\nWith your help we'll be able to transition our product from prototype to retail-ready.\nMost importantly, this limited-edition Kickstarter helps bring together the core community of gamers, streamers, and developers who will receive first access to the Gameboard-1.  \nAbout the Company\nIn 2018, avid hobby gamer Shail Mehta met with hardware guru Rob Wyatt over beer to discuss the fundamental flaw with touchscreen devices: why couldn\u2019t any digital device recognize physical objects for varying shapes and sizes, especially the types of objects that are needed for hobby gaming.\nGameboard-1 was born out of the need to address the analog problems of hobby games while maintaining the essence of why gamers love to play. Gameboard-1 solves the problems of set-up/take down, learning/teaching new games, inability to explore games before buying, games that cannot be easily saved, finding someone to play with and much more.\nIn January 2019, The Last Gameboard, Inc., was formed. They began to establish relationships with game makers all around the world, incorporating both Unity & Unreal to bring the best hobby gaming content to TLG\u2019s upcoming platform.  \nShail Metha - CEO / Co-Founder\nShail has a passion for gaming. When she immigrated to the US in the 90s, Shail encountered a group of children in her apartment that were playing chutes and ladders. Shail, not knowing English, just began to play. The role of gameplay in creating community and fostering human connection has been central to Shail\u2019s work at The Last Gameboard.\nIn her professional life, Shail has a financial background working for hedge funds and venture capital funds. She has consulted for the Nuclear Regulatory Committee, City University of New York, City & County of Denver \u2018s projects, and Triunity Engineering. Has managed teams and executed projects throughout her career. Shail is the driving force for the vision and future for The Last Gameboard.\nRob Wyatt - CTO / Co-Founder\nRob moved from the UK to the US nearly 20 years ago. Known as the \u201cGuru of Hardware\u201d in the industry, Rob loves creating new technologies in gaming and is an avid skydiver. He was the system architect of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox console and went on to work at Playstation, Atari and Magic Leap. Ron owns several patents in AR/VR including a patent on multiple app sparse pixel time warp in AR headsets and processing. He is a visionary, designer and maker of The Last Gameboard\u2019s incredible technology.\n Dustin Hatchett - Business Development\nDustin has been an avid gamer since he first played TSR\u2019s Boot Hill and FASA\u2019s Star Trek RPG in 1983. In his 25 years in the gaming industry, Dustin has managed multiple retail game stores in Denver, Colorado and owns a production company producing live action role-playing games and multiple game conventions. For the past 20 years, he has worked in technical and project management roles for large telecommunications companies.\nDustin will bring his extensive game industry knowledge and background in project management as co-owner of Rocky Mountain Games (a pre-visualization and development company) to The Last Gameboard as Business Development Coordinator.\nMike Horn - Advisor\nMike is a recent inductee into the Pop Culture Hall of Fame who grew up in the collectibles business. After college, his first job was as a buyer for Diamond Comic Distributors, the world\u2019s largest wholesaler of comic books and supplier to thousands of comics and hobby shops. His job was to line up and buy trading cards (initially) and later all licensed merchandise.\nIn 1994, he left Diamond to form his first company, Palisades Marketing. Originally a marketing consulting agency, he evolved it to become a leading manufacturer of licensed collectibles. By 2005, Mike had grown Palisades to nearly $7 Million in annual revenue with 20 full time employees. Afterwards, Mike formed SwagDog and Power Up Factory, two successful ventures in the collectibles industry, before returning to consulting with the formation of Golden Strategic Development in 2019.\n Lys Galati - Marketing\nElysabeth \u201cLys\u201d Galati was seven years old when she finished reading the leather-bound silver foil edition of Frank Miller\u2019s The Dark Knight Returns. Still overwhelmed by the book, her mother asked \u201cLys, your math is getting better. Do you want to come up with the adults and play D&D?\u201d. Nothing was the same after that. A simple game night became an origin story.\nAfter a stint with Diamond Comics doing everything from customer service to buyer, Lys saw a gap in the industry. Lots of incredibly creative people who put their heart and soul into products who often didn\u2019t have the time and (sometimes) skills to promote themselves properly. Sphinx Public Relations started in 2000 and has been an ongoing business ever since. The company was founded on the idea that all geek voices, regardless of budget, deserved a chance at the spotlight.  \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nADDITIONAL PARTNERS\nBackerKit\nZombie Orpheus Crowdfunding Management\nArrow Electronics\nWant to stay on top of all the latest news about Gameboard-1?

During a game you engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It\u2019s like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it\u2019d take to watch one.\nFiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong \u2013 inspired by films like Blood Simple, Fargo, The Way of the Gun, Burn After Reading, and A Simple Plan. You play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. \nSo what's in the box? \nThe new Fiasco retains all the features familiar to old friends, while being much more welcoming to new ones. \nWe\u2019ve tossed out all the dice and index cards and replaced them with playing cards. Setup elements? On cards. Tilt, Aftermath and positive and negative Outcomes? On cards. It speeds up play, adds intuitive, strong visual appeal, and just plain improves the play experience. \nAs an added bonus, it\u2019s now possible to \u201ctune\u201d playsets, combining elements from your favorite Fiasco settings old and new. Since playsets are now decks of cards, we\u2019re committed to rolling out old favorites and new surprises regularly, and we\u2019re looking into how we can share the tools you need to make you own. \nThe game has been playtested thoroughly and is ready to go. We\u2019ve taken great pains to make it beginner friendly - everything you need is in the box.\nThe start of any Fiasco is in the Setup. You and your friends (3-5 players) will choose one of the playset decks that sounds fun and put it on the table with the Engine deck. That's all you need to play the game, but we'll also include a game board and player aid cards to guide you and make sure everyone is on the same page. \nInside the box you'll get three playsets- Dragonslayers, Poppleton Mall, and Tales From Suburbia. These are some of the most popular and well-loved playsets for classic Fiasco and we think you'll have a great time with them! You can also back at reward tiers that include Expansion Packs- more info on those in the What's Included section below.\nThe prototype deck for the Poppleton Mall playset\nTo create the Setup, you'll shuffle the playset deck and hand out all the cards to the players. The players will then take turns choosing Relationships from their hand and placing them between any two players, establishing connections between characters. \nOnce you have the Relationships chosen, you'll add details to each relationship, including Needs, Locations, and Objects that will all help to drive your story. \nOnce these connections are in place, each player looks at the relationships on either side of them and determines what sort of person their character must be. The last step is putting together a name from the options on the back of each playset card. \nPoppleton Mall all set up and ready to play\nOnce the setup is done, you'll use the Engine Deck to begin playing Scenes in two Acts. Each player will take a turn framing a scene about their character, choosing the setting and determining what their character wants. Other players will join in, offering suggestions and playing their characters. After a minute or two, the other players at the table will decide whether the scene has a Positive or Negative Outcome and give you a card. \nThe Fiasco Engine Deck prototype\nEach player will get two spotlight scenes in the first act and two in the second. In between you do the Tilt, which uses elements on the Outcome cards to determine some crazy new twists in your story. At the end of the game, you'll use the Aftermath cards to determine how your characters' stories end up, before you describe your final epilogue.\n Praise\n\"Damn this Fiasco game is ingenious.\" \u2013 John Rogers, TV and film writer for Leverage and The Librarians\n\"Fiasco is unique among RPGs because it encourages us to actively reach for that moment we all dread in most games, that moment when something truly awful is going to happen, with possibly dire results for our characters.\" \u2013 Wil Wheaton, Actor and Writer\n\"I think, for me, there\u2019s a kind of non-Aristotelian catharsis in that active rehearsal of everything I fear and dread and also pine for; it\u2019s a chance to dance with Poe\u2019s Imp of the Perverse, to give in, to make the dangerous choice\u2014it\u2019s the same thing release I get from the act of writing. But writing is a solitary discipline for the most part and Fiasco\u2026 Fiasco is so gloriously communal.\" \u2013 Kelly Sue DeConnick, Writer of Captain Marvel, Pretty Deadly, and Bitch Planet\n\"The joy of Fiasco comes when the line between game and story blurs and suddenly you\u2019re sitting around a table with the brilliant and wonderful souls you allow into your home and you all try to make the perfect Big Black Box. Impose logic, reason, design, over the chaotic horror of existence because in story-space, in a game-space, because here we CAN. We aren\u2019t just allowed but it\u2019s ENCOURAGED. Draw this map of hell, we tell ourselves. Later on we can find our way out.\" \u2013 Matt Fraction, Writer of Hawkeye and Sex Criminals\n\"Fiasco is roleplaying stripped down to sheer elegance, to virtually zero ramp-up time. The notion of playing ambitious crooks with poor impulse control \u2014 inspired by a host of movies like Fargo or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels \u2014 is both inspiring and immensely replayable. But the real genius of Fiasco... is that now you can enjoy it in almost any setting you like.\" \u2013 the 2011 Diana Jones Award Committee\nAwards and Honors\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, 2011 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, Best Support, 2009 Indie RPG Awards \nFiasco \u2013 Judge\u2019s Spotlight Award, 2009 ENnie Awards\nFiasco \u2013 Finalist, RPG of the Year, 2010 Indie RPG Awards Boardgamegeek.com \nActual Play Videos\nPodcasts\nCatastrophic - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catastrophic-a-fiasco-podcast/id1063907406\nFandible - http://www.fandible.com/fiasco-with-great-power/\nGosh Darn Fiasco - https://goshdarnfiasco.simplecast.fm/ \nOne Shot - http://oneshotpodcast.com/tag/fiasco/ \nThe Tilt - http://thetilt.libsyn.com/podcast \n Please Note!

We\u2019re cautious about the possibility of overcharging some of you, so rather than set flat rates by country, we\u2019ll be adding shipping costs when your package is ready, though BackerKit. This will get you the most accurate rate based on the time we send and your location.\nPrices do not include shipping or customs!\nPlease keep in mind that these are estimates, and with things as they  are in the UK/EU, these numbers could change. We're continuing to work  with our shipping partners and will adjust as needed as we get closer to  charging for shipping.\nAlso, while we say \"the rest of the world\" there are some  restrictions imposed by our partners- shipping to Russia, Brazil, China,  Israel, and Saudi Arabia may incur additional charges, due to increased  difficulties shipping to there. We'll continue to look for affordable  options.\nIf shipping charges turn out to be too expensive for you, you will be  able to request a refund of your pledge amount after the campaign  through BackerKit, either by sending us a Kickstarter message or email  to info@bullypulpitgames.com. \n This Kickstarter campaign is designed to be very lean and straightforward - our goal is to get the word out to as many people as we can, so that more people can find out how much fun the game is. If you back this Kickstarter at any level you\u2019ll get immediate access to the pre-release draft of the rules, and we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll love them. Please play, and tell your friends! \nThe primary reward for jumping on board now is the chance to help us explore this new direction for the game and to get access to the upcoming playsets before they're publicly released.\n Fiasco was created by Jason Morningstar and Steve Segedy. Together, we run Bully Pulpit Games, and we've been creating and publishing award-winning games such as Star Crossed, Night Witches, The Warren, and the original Fiasco since 2006. This is our sixth Kickstarter campaign.\nBrennen Reece created the layout and visual design for Fiasco.

That said, while we don't expect any problems, shipping from overseas means that there is always a slight risk that a cargo ship will be late and things will be delayed by a month or so. We will keep you informed!\n\nFULFILLMENT\nWe'll be using the same local fulfillment service as we have for all of our previous campaigns to handle U.S. customers.

They handcraft twenty-sided dice, build their own campaigns from scratch, even wage legal battles against the United States prison system to assert their right to play.\nFor decades, role-playing games like D&D and Pathfinder have been banned in many United States prisons. Some wardens claim these games are demonic and foster fantasies of escape.\nYet even when books and dice are banned, incarcerated players have found creative workarounds. They band together to battle monsters and overcome obstacles, in virtual worlds as well as real life.\nInmates say these games are rehabilitative and are helping them prepare for life on the outside.  Recent research studies agree: Cooperative gaming builds skills like teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity.  Even more importantly, games like D&D bridge racial divides. In California, the gaming table is one of the only places where prisoners of different races and gang affiliations set aside their differences to do something cooperatively.\nLET'S PLAY is told primarily from the perspective of inmates who have waged legal battles for the right to engage in gaming rehab. Some lost; others--like Kevin--changed the system forever.\nHandmade prison D20\nFor eight years, Kevin battled the California Department of Corrections. It all started when he returned to his cell to discover that his gaming materials had disappeared, including hundreds of pages of handwritten campaigns and elaborate maps that adorned his cell from floor-to-ceiling. \nDuring Kevin's jury trial, the legendary creator of Dungeons & Dragons, Gary Gygax himself, flew out to testify on his behalf.\nExcerpt from Gary Gygax's letter to Kevin after the trial.\nThanks to Kevin's lawsuit, role-playing games are now an official activity at several California prisons. But the battle is not yet over. Though Kevin won the lawsuit and the right to play, his novels, maps, and campaigns were never returned to him. Do they still exist in the basement of some courthouse? We want to find out.\nThrough the story of the lawsuit and the players, like Kevin, who were impacted by it, LET\u2019S PLAY aims to get to the root of the national controversy around role-playing games in America\u2019s prisons and explore philosophical questions around inmates rights, the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games, and the purpose of the criminal justice system.\nFinally, LET'S PLAY is a film about perspective and identity\u2026 about using role-playing to see the world through the perspective of different characters and building empathy.\n                                                                           >>>-<<<\nPERSPECTIVES FROM THE PLAYERS ON WHY ROLE-PLAYING GAMES ARE SO IMPORTANT IN PRISON...\n\"We were hardcore. We\u2019d play from soon as we got back from breakfast to lockup. Saturday or Sunday\u2014all day long.\" - Mark, former inmate, California \n\"We used to run underground games with no books or anything. It was pretty L33t.\" - Melvin, Inmate, Colorado\n\"Rehabilitation in the Department of Corrections is structured in a way that gives no alternatives. Not everybody is built the same. Dungeons & Dragons is my rehabilitation that I can deal with to escape into my own reality to solve my own problems.\" - Aaron, former inmate, Colorado\n\"Our rules are no evil characters, no leaving the team behind. Selfish players will usually die.\" - Carlos, Inmate, California\n\"Prisons are the most segregated places in the world. The D&D table is one of the few places where you can have blacks and whites playing together without fear of reprisal.\" - Jared, Founder, Prisoner Reentry Network\n\"It became more than just Dungeons & Dragons at that point. It started that way, but it became about the first amendment in prisons.\" - Kevin, former inmate, California\n                                                                        >>>-<<<\nA.K.A... HOW MY CAREER DEVELOPING CRIME SHOWS CAME TO INTERSECT WITH MY LOVE OF D&D\nThe creator and brainchild of LET'S PLAY, Elisabeth de Kleer, brings to the table(top) over ten years of production experience in the 'true crime' genre. While directing shows for CBS, Netflix, National Geographic, the BBC, VICE, and the Discovery Channel, Elisabeth has interviewed hundreds of inmates in prisons across the united states.\nAn interview at a maximum security prison in Texas.\nWhen not investigating cold cases or interviewing inmates, Elisabeth can be found at the gaming table or writing articles about the rehabilitative impact of role-playing. Some of you may have already come across one of her articles in VICE:\nDragons in the Department of Corrections\nHow Inmates Play Tabletop RPG's in Prison where Dice are Contraband\nOr the following award-winning documentary she produced for VICE in 2017 about a couple cellmates in Colorado who played together both inside and outside of prison.\nElisabeth has also partnered with a San Francisco-based organization called the Prisoner Reentery Network that is using gaming as tool to help recently-released inmates reintegrate into society. This is where she met Kevin and uncovered the story of his lawsuit against the Department of Corrections. \nA beautiful piece that was filmed by ABC News on this group.\nHowever, while her articles and short film have brought attention to the topic, Elisabeth believes a longer form documentary is the best way to do justice to this controversial topic.\nOver the last couple years, Elisabeth and her team have filmed dozens of interviews with inmates and former inmates who have played role-playing games at prisons across the country. So far this film has been self-funded, which is why we need your support. Here are some of the ways your money will be used to help us finish the film:\n Fees for accessing and copying legal materials related to D&D cases. This will allow us to take a deep dive into some of the most interesting lawsuits, like Kevin's, and attempt to  track down the gaming materials that were confiscated from him.\n Cost of putting together a professional camera crew so we can film gaming groups inside prison. (We've already done the most difficult part, which is getting soft approval to film in the first place. Now we just need funding to make the most of this special opportunity.)\n Funds for hiring an animator to breathe life into hand-drawn inmate fantasy art and to create a visual style for the film. The art will be used to illustrate the story in a way that weaves together magical elements with real life. For example, the warden of the prison might be depicted as a dragon or \u201cboss\u201d and the prison itself, a dragon\u2019s lair. These visual intersections of gameplay and real life show how the game becomes a platform to express and explore their inner struggles and demons.\nCreating a marketing and distribution plan that will promote both the film as well as recreational therapy behind bars.\nWith $60,000, we believe we can create a short film that takes a deep dive into one of the most interesting prisoner rights cases in history, but it will be tight. Each additional dollar we raise makes it possible to include additional content and improve the production quality of the film so that it can compete against the Hollywood heavy-hitters at film festivals around the world. If necessary, film grants (which are very difficult to obtain during pre-production but much easier when the film is nearing completion) are also an option we're considering for down the road if expenses surpass the money we raise through crowdfunding.\nTo bring this project to life, we've put together an awesome team of filmmakers, gamers, and experts.\nAnd we're partnering with the following organizations...\n Hawke Robinson, a Department of Health Registered Recreational Therapist, founder of RPG Therapeutics LLC http://www.rpgtherapy.com/ and RPG Research  https://www.rpgresearch.com/, uses role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, Doctor Who, No Thank You Evil, and others as tools for rehabilitation.  He has been researching the effects of RPGs on participants since around 1985, and developing programs using RPGs in all formats (tabletop, LARP, computer-based, and solo) to achieve educational and therapeutic goals for various populations since 2004. When he's not lecturing and teaching workshops on gaming-as-therapy, you can find Hawke driving around the country in an RPG gaming bus.\nHawke Robinson will serve as an on-camera expert and advisor to the film.\nThe Prisoner Reentry Network, founded by attorney Jared Rudolph, is an Oakland-based nonprofit that supports successful transitions from incarceration to the community. Jared works as a trial lawyer at the San Francisco Office of the Public Defender, and regularly speaks about mass incarceration and its history. Every other weekend, he runs a Dungeons & Dragons game called \u201cSecond Life\u201d to help recently released inmates build community and reintegrate into society.\nJared Rudolph and the Prisoner Reentry Network will be featured on-camera, and Jared Rudolph will serve as a criminal justice advisor to the film.\nA PRN-facilitated \"Second Life\" game in San Francisco.\nKanaka Endeavors is a 2D20 gaming system developed by Danny, an inmate in the California Department of Corrections. Danny has been testing the system with his gaming group behind bars as well as players on the outside and hopes to roll it out when he's released from prison in 2019. \nDanny will be featured on-camera and Kanaka Endeavors will help fulfill some of the crowdfunding rewards.\nDanny and the other D&D players pictured in an article entitled \"Nerds United\" that Danny wrote for the prison newspaper.\nMusic for the Kickstarter video was provided by: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music \nFINALLY...\nIf you can't help us monetarily, please help us by spreading the word through social media. The more people know about this documentary, the better we can get the word out about the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games in prison.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy far, our biggest hurdle is getting on-going access to film games behind bars.\n\nGetting IN to prison is harder than one might expect. Both state and federal facilities have extensive rules for media visits. Additional staff must be brought in to accompany the production crew. Some states prohibit cameras entirely.\n\nFortunately, Elisabeth de Kleer has extensive experience navigating prison media rules. Over the last 10 years, she has filmed at dozens of maximum security prisons around the country (primarily for Discovery Channel shows) and developed relationships with the administrative staff that approve filming requests.\n\nWhile we've received soft permission to film games we've been following at a couple different prisons, where we ultimately film will depend on how much access we are given. The ideal scenario would be one where we'd film a game over the course of many months, following the trials and tribulations of the inmates both as characters inside the game and in real life. To do that, we need to show the administrators that we have enough of an audience to warrant the additional time and effort on their end to host us, as well as to pay our professional film crew for their time.\n\nPut simply, the more backers and funding we have, the better our chances of getting prolonged access to some of the subjects of our film.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kleer Creative\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nKleer Creative was founded by Elisabeth de Kleer, an award-winning documentary filmmaker with expertise in interviewing and crafting...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Public Shout Out", "descp": "Welcome to the game!

There are documentaries about motocross riders out there, but they are mostly about men. We are always treated like the sideshow despite the fact that many women can totally hold their own when riding with guys,\u201d says Eline. \nEline was blown away to receive letters and emails of support from women all over the world with similar stories in motocross, following the pilot\u2019s release. We'll be sharing their pictures, videos, and stories throughout the campaign.\nOriginally from Estonia, Eline is a motocross champion and the first woman in Canada to jump her dirt bike onto an airbag. Passionate about motorcycles and filmmaking, Eline is dedicated to telling stories of badass women.\nThe completed pilot episode is 8 minutes long and now we are raising money on Kickstarter to add FIVE more 8-10 minute episodes to complete SEASON 1 of Diaries of Badass Chicks. These episodes will be filmed over two weeks in Lower Mainland, BC Canada in the summer of 2020, involving as many awesome racers and riders as possible. It will be one hell of an epic shoot!\nThe 2020 Calendar will have its own shoot in August/September 2019 with the release of the calendar planned for November 2019, making it a perfect Christmas present!\nHaving the principal photography for the series in 2020 enables us to maximize the budget and really hone in on the production value. Plus, whoever has visited Vancouver, BC in the fall, knows why it is labelled \"Raincouver\", so we want to avoid the challenges of dealing with heavy rain\u2014especially since one of our episodes involve a freestyle motocross airbag! \nWe are so excited to have all of you on board to bring this EPIC, BADASS and GROUNDBREAKING series to life!\n#WEAREBADASSCHICKS\nDIARIES OF BADASS CHICKS is Fan-Supported and Creator-Distributed.

You take on the role of a Wanderer\u2014someone who died, but didn\u2019t end up in Heaven, Hell, or any other traditional afterlife.  Devoid of any memories of your life on earth, you find yourself in an endless desert filled with gateways. Search different planes of existence for clues of your former life - or a semblance of one. Along the way you'll encounter strange inhabitants, alien cultures, and other humans who\u2019ve lost all hope and are bent on destroying you. \nAfterlife is Alice in Wonderland meets What Dreams May Come set in a world inspired by the works of Guillermo del Torro, Hayao Miyazaki, and surrealist artists. \nFind lost memories, come to terms with how you died, and discover who you truly are. \nStepping onto the Tenebris for the first time you realize you're in an outlandish world full of creatures, cities, and customs you don't recognize. A city built atop a giant skeleton, a roadside diner in the middle of the desert, a vast dark pool of inky water. Nothing here is truly human and you're the alien here, far from home with no hopes of return. Salvation lies in the memories you've lost so you travel and search - you are a Wanderer. \nAs a Wanderer your ultimate goal is to regain your memories and find your Requiem\u2014a true end in a place known as the Beyond. In order to do this, a Wanderer must do what their title implies and travel. By travelling into different Limbos\u2014different gateways to the Beyond\u2014you find memory fragments. These glimpses of memories summoned forth by your unconscious give you Resonance. Gain enough Resonance to experience a Break, a full blown memory of your past life, bringing you closer to your Requiem. Each Break creates an opportunity to heal, to strive to remember, to fight for your personality - and your soul. \nLimbos may be cities, forests, or even entire worlds. Each Limbo is populated with its own unique inhabitants who have no idea of any realm beyond their own, much like humans on earth. Wanderers enter (and exit) Limbos through the Tenebris, but consider Limbos their own realms. A Limbo may appear like a person\u2019s version of Heaven, or it may appear totally alien\u2014it all depends on the Limbo.  \nWanderers don't travel the Tenebris alone, it is far too dangerous for that. Instead, you travel with a Crew, a group of lost souls who you met on the boat ride from the world of the living to the world of the dead. A Crew travels together for protection and companionship, personalities may differ or even clash, but these people are the only ones who truly understand what you're going through.\nMechanics in Afterlife: Wandering Souls center on player's action and GMs do not roll any dice. Instead, GMs set scenes, develop plots, and present their players with obstacles. Players decide how they want to overcome these obstacles.\nYou make checks to determine whether your chosen action is a success or not - to make a check you roll a pool of six-sided dice (d6s). A die face of a 4-6 is a success and you must gain enough successes to meet the Challenge set by the game master (GM). \nIf your check is a success - you do what you set out to do. If your check is a failure - things get worse. When things get worse you take damage to one of your Concept pools - Health, Hunger, or Will. Or the GM escalates the scene by pulling in a plot twist, more enemies, or other surprises.\nTo prevent things getting worse you may spend points from your Vitality pools, which is an in game currency representing extra resources a Wanderer has to throw at a problem.\nDuring character creation, the GM takes on the role of the Boatman, guiding your Wanderer on a boat ride from their mortal life to the Tenebris. They will ask you a series of questions based on a variety of dice rolls, and how you answer gives your Wanderer different stats. \nThe memories your Wanderer retains during character creation are vague and highlighted by one brilliant feature your Wanderer refuses to forget. Throughout play you\u2019ll experience more concrete memories during Breaks illuminating the shadows of your lost memories. Things may not always happen as you remember them and part of the journey is the surprise.\nWanderers have many tools, which you may use to make checks easier and perform fantastic feats. \nDuring character creation, the Boatman gives each Wanderer a martial item - a Bow, Sword, or Shield - which reflects how they deal with conflicts. This mystical item, called an Approach, grows as they grow and stays with your Wanderer until they die. Your Approach isn\u2019t limited by earthly limits places on the concepts of a sword, shield, and bow; bows can deflect, shields can slice, and swords can be missiles. \nWanderers use Talents to mold and manipulate the world around them. They can be anything from summoning a mythical beast to reading someone\u2019s mind. Your Talent is a gift bestowed upon your by the Boatman on your ride to the Tenebris. You may learn new Talents as you advance. Depending if your Approach is the Bow, Shield, or Sword your Talent will be different than those with a different Approach, but same Talent. \nAfterlife is a game about a Wanderer's personal journey to recovering their memories. Wanderers recover memories when they see something or someone that reminds them of their past life while exploring a Limbo. This is called a Fragment, and the GM uses it to create a Break - a private scene where your Wanderer re-lives a memory. When the Break concludes the Wanderer has a newfound sense of self, for good or bad, and you get to unlock a Death Mark.\nDeath Marks are tattoo-like markings that  are constantly shifting, flirting on the edge of imperceptibility, whispering forgotten secrets in Wanderer's ears. Each Death Mark is linked to a specific memory and grants Wanderers special abilities to use in game. Death Marks are predetermined in character creation by your Wanderer\u2019s ride with the Boatman. \n\nCheck out the exciting rewards you can get through backing our Kickstarter.

A Wanderer's Guide to Mirages & Limbos is a brand new setting book. It introduces new Limbos and Mirages for GMs to use in their game along with player focused information on how to interact with Limbos and Mirages. We'll also take a deeper look into the different species you can meet within the Tenebris and give each of them an in depth write-up. This book will be 14.8 x 21 cm, full colour, soft cover, and roughly 100 pages depending on the final word count. \nPlease note - because this was a stretch goal this book will be done later than the core book. We'll offer an option for people to wait and bundle their package to save on shipping. \nShipping for all physical rewards will be charged after the campaign ends via a pledge manager. Prices for shipping change on a weekly basis and we've estimated the following shipping costs, which we will try our best to meet when sending out our rewards:\nNetherlands:  \u20ac5\nEU:  \u20ac9\nWorld:  \u20ac13\nThe EU rate includes the UK for the time being until the result of Brexit is determined.\nDigital rewards will be fulfilled via DriveThruRPG, a trusted partner we've worked with for many years.\nOur stretch goals include physical reward upgrades, new books, and getting a host of amazing talent to author custom Limbos for our backers.

Legends are born, friendships are forged, and they begin to experience real-world personal growth.\nFor the past seven years, we have been using tabletop games as therapy to help kids become more confident, creative and socially empowered. We're ready to help thousands of children around the world, but we need your help! \nCritical Core is a tabletop role-playing game designed to help kids on the autism spectrum build social skills and confidence. It's a great way for parents to engage with their children at home, and for professionals and experienced gamers to use as a group social skills tool.\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and co-developed with autism advocates, parents, therapists, and educators.\nPLAY\n\nSuitable for cognitive age 9+, including teens and adults.\n2 to 4 players recommended, plus one adult that acts as the facilitator. (Game Master)\nPlayers must have basic listening and verbalization skills.\nWhen running games with young players on the spectrum, parent or certified therapist should be present.\nExperienced gamers will be able to integrate Critical Core into their favorite platform: Ruleset is adapted and streamlined from D&D's 5th Edition OpenSRD.\nA great introduction to tabletop role-playing games for everyone.\nThe Critical Core Starter Set has everything you need to play. The game has been tuned to be as easy as possible to get started and stay engaged. \nPLAY\n\n Facilitator's Guide - For parents, therapists, and Game Masters, our best practices on running fun and effective therapeutic gaming groups.\n Player & Game Master Guides - Quick-start rules and playing guides for players and Game Masters.\n Adventure Modules - Tested and tuned to be challenging and fun.\n Dice (4 sets) - One for each player, one for the Game Master. Enough to run a 3 player game out-of-the-box.\n Character Sheets - 4 popular hero archetypes, each with their own unique abilities.\n Game Cards - Not required for play, but helpful aids for both players and Game Masters - Visualization, quick-reference rules, and spell cards.\n Game Tokens - Visualization aids for working with the included map.\n Reusable map - whiteboard marker friendly. \nPlease note: Artwork shown is work-in-progress and may be subject to change!\nWe believe that Stretch Goals should improve and enhance the usefulness of Critical Core, so we're planning a steady stream of new adventures, characters, cards and tokens that you can use at home or in therapeutic settings. Plus a few extra surprises that will unlock at higher levels!\nCritical Core is fit-for-purpose, designed to help neurodiverse players get started and stay engaged. At the same time, facilitators are provided with the right tools to make the experience effective without it 'feeling like therapy'.\nEach encounter the players face is targeted to help build strength in areas that are related to challenges associated with autism spectrum disorder.\nCritical Core is scaffolded around the DIR/Floortime model, and game encounters map to the FEDC framework. (Function Emotional Developmental Capacities)\nBut all of this is under the hood. At its heart, Critical Core is simply FUN.\nPLAY\n\nWhen kids engage in a world of fantasy play they are free to explore new ideas and relationships in a safe and fun sandbox. Skills learned while playing Critical Core can last a lifetime.\n Although designed for kids on the autism spectrum, Critical Core is just as beneficial (and fun) for all kids. It's an easy stepping stone into the fantastic world of tabletop role-playing games.\nCritical Core is built on established developmental frameworks and distills seven years of practical gaming therapy experience into an easy-to-use format. It is an amazing tool that can be used at home, at school, in a therapist\u2019s office, or out in the community. And above all, it's great fun.\nPLAY\n\n\nGame to Grow - Adam Davis (MA Ed) and Adam Johns (LMFT)\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) organization that runs tabletop RPG therapy gaming groups every week. Founders Adam Johns and Adam Davis are distilling 7 years of experience and best practices into the Critical Core project so that the benefits of intentional gaming can be spread to an even wider audience.\n\nVirginia Spielmann (MSOT) - Executive Director of STAR Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder in Denver, Colorado.\nVirginia is a British trained Occupational Therapist with more than 20 years experience working in pediatrics. Virginia co-leads the development of the Critical Core Project, defining the system within the established DIR Floortime\u2122 framework of developmental intervention.\nmcgarrybowen Greater China - creative agency\nThe Critical Core project was initiated and co-created by creative agency mcgarrybowen Greater China as part of an ongoing program to provide creative solutions for social good.\nICDL - The Interdisciplinary Council on Development and Learning\nA not-for-profit organization dedicated to promoting each person's development to their fullest potential. ICDL was formed over 20 years ago to be the official home of DIR\u00ae and DIRFloortime, recognized as the next generation of evidence-based intervention for autism and other developmental challenges.\n \n \nYour passion and support can make Critical Core a reality. Please, pledge now and then get a friend to do the same. Together we can bring the incredible benefits of intentional gaming to those who need it most.\n  We're committed to getting this right. The majority of our time will be spent improving and refining the Critical Core Starter Set with the feedback from beta testers and testing groups. We also have some final artwork and design work to take care of, and of course there is the physical production. We'll be keeping you informed throughout the process, and probably asking for some help and advice along the way! \nGame to Grow is a not-for profit 501(c) company, and our donations are allocated to helping run game groups for kids across the Seattle region. Kickstarter is important for two reasons:\n First, you are an amazing community, and if anyone can help spread the word about the incredible benefits of role-playing games, it's you!\n  Second, there are costs involved in developing and manufacturing Critical Core, so Kickstarter helps us to produce this amazing project!\nPerhaps you already have a favorite role-playing game and are wondering how Critical Core can fit into your gaming life. Like many of you, we are avid gamers and have many games we\u2019ve loved for years. \nCritical Core can improve the games you\u2019re already playing.\nIf you\u2019re already playing an established RPG with your kids, your students, or your community, Critical Core can still help you improve your game and boost your outcomes. \nCritical Core contains a rule system, designed to be easily accessible to a neuro-diverse population as well as new facilitators, but that\u2019s not all! If you are already established using a game that you enjoy and find effective, you\u2019ll be able to use the other components of Critical Core that are designed to support a game facilitator in helping their players learn and grow.\nCritical Core contains a unique module design where in-game scenarios are targeted to real-world development outcomes. This can be translated to most established role-playing games. Additionally, the Critical Core kit includes a facilitator\u2019s guide which contains the learnings of the past seven years of facilitating role-playing games for social growth.\n  Do I need prior experience with role-playing games to run Critical Core?\n                          No. Critical Core is a 'rules-light' tabletop RPG, and the instructions will be designed to help brand new Game Masters quickly learn how to facilitate games that are enriching and fun. We are also planning to release video guides and tutorials to help you out! \nI'm already playing tabletop RPGs with my kids!\nAwesome! You already know the amazing benefits we're talking about. You also know from experience, that tabletop RPGs can be easy to pick up and play, but learning how to be a great Game Master can be challenging, especially for new players.\nWhy not use an established role-playing game platform?\nCritical Core's rule set is adapted from D&D's 5th Edition Open SRD. We have taken out some of the complexity for new players and Game Masters. Think of Critical Core as an entry-level platform: easier for parents, schools, and clinics to pick up and play.\nAre you trying to replace my favorite game?\nNo way! We see Critical Core as a stepping stone to the wide world of RPG gaming. Actually, we hope that as kids grow familiar and comfortable with the system, they can move on to your favorite platform. If you're already using some of the great games out there, then more power to you!\nSo how is Critical Core different?\nWe have applied our experience and best practices to help children (and caregivers) have the most effective and fun experience possible.\nMeticulously designed adventure content to help empower kids with social and problem-solving challenges.\nGame encounters, guidebooks, mechanics heavily influenced by established developmental frameworks (DIR/Floortime).\nRules have been adapted to be easier for new players and Game Masters to pick up.\nAdventures divided into 'one-shot' chapters that can be completed in 90 minutes.\nGoldilocks Content'  -  not too complex/scary and not too easy/cartoony. Just right.\nI've been GM'ing for years, what's in this for me?\nFor starters, you'll be able to pick up the Critical Core system in minutes. We have had inquiries from organizations from across the globe who want to start using Critical Core. You could be a great mentor or GM partner for Critical Core games. Please contact us for more info on how you can help!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCritical Core is based on our learnings in using tabletop RPGs over the years as a therapy, and we're confident that we have a solid system in place.

We are finetuning the layout design to make sure that it is readable and navigable, with appropriate tables and charts laid out to be both engaging and useful. As Adam Johns said in a previous post, putting a decade of experience in therapeutically-applied RPG into a simple and easy to understand format took more than a few revisions. Some bits were clarified after the last round of tester feedback, and some less-accessible elements were removed entirely to be saved for a more comprehensive training program down the road. The perfect was becoming the enemy of the good, as the saying goes, so we refocused on the goal of an approachable and accessible \u201cstarter set\u201d for applied role-playing games, and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Building Biagofma", "update_content": "Greetings Backers! \n\u201cOther Adam\u201d Adam Davis here again with another update from behind the screen.

Over the last few years, I invited 30 award-winning authors to write in response to my art.THEN AGAIN: Vintage Photography Reimagined by One Artist and Thirty Writers is the singular anthology that assembles these richly imagined stories and poems with the captivating images that inspired them.\nImagining possibilities and forging new worlds, the stories and poems amplify the art. The artworks intensify the writings. Throughout the collection images evolve, characters re-appear, plots reveal, symbols come alive. We dream together. \nOnce I thought I might spend eternity with you, before I knew what it was or what it felt like. Instead there is this skulking fellow, who disappears whenever I turn around. (from Paul Park's \"Memory Tower\" in THEN AGAIN)\nTHEN AGAIN is a collector's edition of limited quantity and abundant quality. The professionally designed book will feature over 30 full-color images, each paired with its corresponding story or poem, all printed on heavyweight premium paper stock bound in sturdy softcover.  \nThe Booklet will be a shorter, seven or eight chapter version of THEN AGAIN.\nLike all Kickstarter campaigns, this one is all or nothing. To fund this project, we need to reach our goal of $30,000 by April 30. If we do not, no one's credit card is charged and the project is unfunded.\nThis campaign is your opportunity to get a copy of the book and to join in the fantastic community that's bringing this project to life!\nBraiding them into her hair would never work, even ignoring the smooth skin where her human ears no longer were. No, her rabbit ears had their own ideas. (from Andrea Martinez Corbin's \"A Lullaby from Long Ago\" in THEN AGAIN)\nAbout the Art\nYou can find vintage photographs languishing in attics, basements \u2013 perhaps even your own - and in antiques stores. I rescue them, but I do not preserve them like a conservator. Instead, I collaborate with each image to create something new with the old. \nOver the last couple decades, I\u2019ve developed a technique for painting on vintage photographs. These rediscovered portraits and snapshots are the basis of my art: both canvas and inspiration for my painting. By the time I find them, the original chains of personal connection have broken. Subjects are freed to become characters cast and costumed, players in another story that forms fresh bonds with new audiences.  \nPearl was the first Cephalopod Ambassador to the Dry Lands. They did not realize that no one would listen to her. Eight is a very great age for a squid, though, as it happens, not for a human. Plus, she\u2019s a girl, and who knew that would make a difference? (from Kij Johnson's \"Tool-Using Mimics\" in THEN AGAIN)\nContributing Writers\nTHEN AGAIN presents original stories and poems, each written in response to my artwork, by some of the freshest and most accomplished voices in literary and speculative fiction and poetry, including recipient of a 2018 Arab American Book Award, poet Safia Elhillo, author and essayist Akiko Busch, young speculative fiction writer Erin Roberts, best-selling author and multiple award winner Elizabeth Hand, Guggenheim and NEA fellow Mary Ruefle, another NEA fellow and short story writer Renee Simms, World Fantasy Awardee Sofia Samatar, and recipient of the World Fantasy Award - Life Achievement John Crowley... \nAnd many more top-notch authors:\nUnoma Azuah,  Tina Connolly,  Andrea Martinez Corbin, Paul Di Filippo,  Jeffrey Ford,  Shawn Frazier,  Kij Johnson,  Kirsten Imani Kasai,  Karin Lowachee,  Simone Muench,  Paul Park,  Christine Poreba,  Jennifer Rapaport,  Gregory Scheckler,  Hollis Seamon,  John Seven,  Jim Shepard,  Karen Shepard,  Hasanthika Sirisena,  Sara St. Antoine,  Marjorie Thomsen,  Sarena Ulibarri, and Izzy Wasserstein.\nPlus reprints of poems by Pulitzer Prize winner Jorie Graham and 2018 Wallace Stevens Awardee Sonia Sanchez, to which I made a artworks in response (please note, the Sonia Sanchez poem will appear only on the printed full version of THEN AGAIN, available at the $90 reward level and above).  And an introduction by curator Judie Gilmore.  \nYou'll find more information about each author below. \nCollision of Tomorrows (after Self-Portrait as Apollo and Daphne, by Jorie Graham)\nLimited Edition\nThe funding goal of $30,000 affords an edition of 500 beautifully designed books. I\u2019ll be delighted to make more if there's demand, but there are no plans for broad distribution beyond this Kickstarter campaign. I plan to produce only a couple hundred more than the quantity of book rewards chosen here. \nTHIS is the place to get your book and be part of this effort!\na quick breakdown of where your dollars will go\nHow the Project Came To Be\nFive years ago, curator Judie Gilmore invited me to participate in an exhibit for which authors wrote in response to the art. Inspired by one of my artworks, Hollis Seamon wrote a stunning short story, so thoughtful and potent on its own. Her story further re-created the already transformed photograph. \nTogether the art and writing generated a third radiant thing.\nI was hooked, and wanted more. So, I studied hundreds of poems and stories, and invited authors whose style could enhance the growing collection of art and writing. Each author chose which artwork to write on, and I offered some of them character prompts from other stories in the anthology. \nThe culmination is a treasury of distinct, but intertwined tales and pictures to spark your imagination and wonder.   \nThe book itself is a collaborative work of art.\nAt this moment, 90% of the writers have finished their stories and poems, receiving an honorarium for their work. All the art is ready, and the designer is set to go. We\u2019re connecting art, writing, and now you. \nWe are getting this done together!  \n\u201cI want to be a Flowerhead!\u201d cried Erik Von. \u201cI want to be a Flowerhead when I grow up!\u201d But Father wouldn\u2019t have it, and he yanked Erik Von away... (from John Seven's \"Flowerheads\" in THEN AGAIN)\nHow You Can Join In\nBecome a Backer: Please consider backing this project at a level you\u2019re comfortable with.

Our puzzle novel The Maze of Games has been no exception. Years after we ran two fantastic Maze campaigns on Kickstarter, we're still finding new pathways and puzzles within the Gatekeeper's domain. We wanted to take everything we have for The Maze of Games and put it into one massive omnibus package, supplementing it with fun new material. But to do that we had to send author Mike Selinker and developer Gaby Weidling into their own maze. As you may have guessed from the video above, things went a bit awry. The two are now stuck in the maze.\nOn the upside, before the Gatekeeper trapped Mike and Gaby, they were able to gather quite a bit of stuff. For the first time, you can get everything for The Maze of Games in one place, including a bunch of new items for fans who thought they had it all. Fresh off the book being solved for the first time, we're Kickstarting a new answer guide handwritten by characters Colleen and Samuel Quaice entitled The Keymaster's Tome. There's The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour audio puzzle suite and a new audiobook for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze. If we're very clever and very lucky, we can help Mike and Gaby escape the room and add a few more goodies to our cache. \nAll the digital and physical rewards. Well, most of them, anyway.\nAlong with the puzzle creations we've lined up for you, we have a unique adventure. The Maze of Games Escape Room by Epic Team Adventures opens its doors today, March 14th. You can book your experience today at epicteamadventures.com! Designed by Gaby, Mike, and ETA's Jesse McGatha and Richard Thames Rowan, this intense experience is the first of several mind-bending puzzle rooms set in the Gatekeeper's world. When you book, you can use the escape room discount code we've added to every backer level so you can experience what Mike and Gaby are going through. Hopefully you'll have an easier time getting through the maze than they are.\nBelow you'll find all the details on The Maze of Games Omnibus and Escape Room Experience, including descriptions of all the items, backer levels, stretch goals, and the Maze of Games Escape Room. And what would a Maze of Games Kickstarter be without puzzles? Make sure to come back as we update. Mike and Gaby will send us messages from inside the room, and we'll need your help to decipher them. See below for details, and keep an eye on @LoneSharkGames on Twitter for all the puzzling info. Mike and Gaby have assured us there are secret badges along the way for everyone who can help them escape the maze. \nThe Maze of Games hardback, The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze, and the Maze Map.\nThe Maze of Games is a puzzle novel Mike had trapped in his head for 18 years prior to 2013, when we took the unique book to Kickstarter. It's the story of two British children from 1897, Colleen and Samuel Quaice, who get trapped in a series of increasingly deadly mazes by a skeletal guardian called the Gatekeeper. What makes the book unique\u2014other than its strange story and dynamic art by Magic: The Gathering artist Pete Venters\u2014is that the pages are in the wrong order. You must solve the puzzles and restore the narrative in order to help the children escape the maze. A 40-page section called the Conundrucopia features all of the best modern-day puzzlemakers writing puzzles in the style of the 1890s. It's cool. \nThe Two of Diamonds spread in The Maze of Games.\nIf you pledge to this Kickstarter campaign, you can get access to:\nThe hardback of The Maze of Games, its PDF, and its audiobook narrated by Wil Wheaton.\nThe softcover of The Theseus Guide to Guide to the Final Maze and its PDF.\nThe recently updated second edition of the Maze Map poster and PDF, a unique 20\"x30\" story maze by Mike, Eric Harshbarger, and Corey Macourek.\nAudio albums of The Maze of Games Soundtrack by composer Austin Wintory and the Songs in the Key of Maze EP by Marian Call, Kirby Krackle, and Paul & Storm.\nA discount code for the solvable ebook for iPhone and iPad by Puzzazz. \nThe covers for the Maze of Games Audiobook, Songs in the Key of Maze, and the Maze of Games Soundtrack. Art by Pete Venters, graphic design by Elisa Teague.\nEach backer who receives physical goods will pay the actual cost of shipping their rewards. Final shipping rates and costs will be loaded into our PledgeManager, and you will pay for your shipping via the PledgeManager as well.  We'll charge backers as close to our actual shipping costs for their shipping address as we can for each order. Lone Shark is not making any profit on shipping and handling. FYI: The Maze of Games hardback is a heavy book. See the FAQ for our current shipping estimates.\nPlus there's a lot of brand new stuff you've never seen. Including this amazing project. \nPLAY\n\nFor years, we've imagined a live experience where you get thrown into the Gatekeeper's maze and have to solve your way out. We knew of only one team who could bring this vision to life: downtown Seattle's Epic Team Adventures. Our friends at ETA have made some of our favorite rooms: the film noir-themed The Sparrow Files, the Poe-inspired The Raven and the Red Death, and many more. ETA's team includes some of the Maze's biggest fans, and so we collaborated with them to make The Maze of Games Escape Rooms.\nSome of the sights in the Maze of Games escape room. This image is spoiler-free and not used in any puzzles in this campaign.\nFar from being satisfied with making  one Maze of Games escape room, ETA concocted an adventurous plan to make four rooms in the same space, all themed around authors trapped in the maze. Gaby and Mike worked with ETA designers Rich Rowan and Jesse McGatha to craft these escape rooms, and we got our Gatekeeper Wil Wheaton to narrate the whole thing. It's a tremendously cool experience that you can see in the video above.\nWe hope that you can all make it to Seattle and match wits with the Gatekeeper. To encourage you to visit us, all reward levels of this Kickstarter campaign include a discount code good for $35 off the cost of a full room booking of The Maze of Games Escape Room at Epic Team Adventures. If you pledge, click this link to get access to the code, allowing you to book your room experience on the ETA site today. The code can be used any time in the next year. Remember: Pledge, get the code, book the room.\nFor those who just want to buy it all now, look at the level called Everything Maze Plus A Full Room, which lets you pledge for an entire room plus all the physical and digital rewards. We can't send out individual codes until after the campaign closes, so if you're in a hurry to book, get your $35 code here today and then pay the rest on the ETA site.\nThe Keymaster's Tome mockup cover (not final art). Designed by Skylar Woodies with handwriting by Gaby and Mike.\nThe Keymaster\u2019s Tome is a new physical book made for this Kickstarter, available in both printed and PDF form. People have been asking us since the dawn of this project when we were going to have a Keymaster to go with our Gatekeeper. The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze was the closest we could get to an answer booklet without divulging the Maze's secrets to everyone, and it was fun to add more puzzles too. But just this past month, a group of puzzle solvers finished the final puzzle in The Maze of Games. With that done, we felt that the time was right for an answer book, so Mike and Gaby hand-crafted The Keymaster's Tome, a version of The Maze of Games puzzles (not the story) with answers, conversations, and tidbits hand-written in the margins by the Quaice siblings as they make their way through the maze. Here's as much of a look as we can show you. \nPage spread from The Keymaster's Tome. Spoiler hands not included.\nThe book is available as a PDF in the Just The New Digitals level, as well as a softcover in the Just The New Book & The New Digitals level. \nStretch Goals\nWhen we started the campaign, The Keymaster's Tome was 60 pages detailing answers for the main puzzle section of The Maze of Games. Now that the campaign has exceeded our funding goal, we're adding hand-written and annotated answers to more puzzles.\nUNLOCKED: $13,500 - We added 24 pages of Conundrucopia answers in our hand-written, story-based style. That raised the Tome from 60 pages to 84 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $15,000 -  We added 8 pages of extras: the endpapers, the library card, the credits, and so on. Everyone who pledges to this campaign will have their name in The Keymaster\u2019s Tome. This got the Tome from 84 pages to 92 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $17,500 - We added 8 pages of The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze answers. This got the Tome from 92 pages to 100 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $20,000 - We added 8 pages of soundtrack and Maze Map answers. This got the Tome from 100 to 108 pages.\nUNLOCKED: $25,000 - We added an audio answer key to The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour, recorded by Mike and Gaby! \nUNLOCKED: $30,000 - We've begun the creation of a new Maze of Games website with The Keymaster's Tome content for backers to access!\nUNLOCKED: $35,000 - We're including cool Maze of Games wallpaper (in black and white and color) in every digital bundle!\nUPCOMING GOAL: $40,000 - We'll include the Maze of Games escape room 2-page spread from Puzzlecraft in every digital bundle and add the handwritten answers to The Keymaster's Tome!\nCovers for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze audiobook and The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour. Art and graphics by Pete Venters and Elisa Teague.\nWe\u2019re introducing two new audio products as part of this campaign. First,The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze now has its own audiobook, which adds a new chapter to the existing one for The Maze of Games. Both star Wil Wheaton doing all the voices.\nThe second audio project is The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour (originally named The Audiophonic Conundrucopia), a radio show hosted by Wil alongside us and our puzzlemaker and musician friends Kid Beyond, Molly Lewis, Austin Wintory, Francis Heaney, Eric Chaikin, Greg Pliska, and Wil Zambole. It's easy to turn it on. You must solve the puzzles to turn it off.  \nMike and Molly Lewis record something old-timey for the Variety Hour. Photo by Gaby.\nBoth of these new audio experiences supplement The Maze of Games audiobook, created by Skyboat Media. If you've only got the physical books, open up your ears for a whole new way to play. \nThe Gatekeeper's Edition. Created by Elisa Teague and Regent Publishing, ambigram by Scott Kim.\nOK, we swear this story is true. When we first made The Maze of Games, we made 250 copies of a black and silver leatherette-bound in-world book called The Gatekeeper's Edition. It has deckled pages, a library card, a ribbon, and other boss features. We fulfilled all of those and agreed never to make that edition again. Done and done.\nBut ... our guy Shane was cleaning up the warehouse in preparation for a move last month and literally tripped over a box of Gatekeeper's Editions. We assume we kept them in case some didn't reach their destinations, and everyone forgot about them. Now that we found this treasure trove, we couldn't just keep it locked up. So we're making a mere ten absolutely, positively, very last ever copies of The Maze of Games Gatekeeper's Edition available at the Keymaster's Trove level, along with a signed copy of the Keymaster's Tome. If you're interested in owning a piece of history, take a look at that level. \nMike Selinker is the president of the Seattle design studio Lone Shark Games. He's the co-designer of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Lords of Vegas, Unspeakable Words, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Thornwatch, and many other games, as well as the author of other books like Puzzlecraft, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and Game Theory in the Age of Chaos. While at Wizards, he helped design and develop games like Betrayal at House on the Hill, Risk Godstorm, and Axis & Allies, and was a creative director on 3rd edition Dungeons & Dragons. He\u2019s also the executive director of the political advocacy group Basket of Adorables. He can be found at @mikeselinker. \nPete Venters is the book's illustrator, and one of the most popular game artists around. He is best known for his nearly 300 pieces of trading card art for Magic: The Gathering, but has also worked in concept art, comic books, and book design. He is the illustrator for the Gothic Charm School trade paperback, written by his wife, Jillian Venters. He and Mike have collaborated on projects for Disney and Wizards of the Coast.\nElisa Teague is the book's graphic designer. She is a game and puzzle designer, her latest titles including Geek Out!, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk, Lions and Tigers and Bears - Oh My, various Dungeons & Dragons and other RPG modules, and the upcoming Kingdom Hearts Talisman. She has also been an art director, developer, and production manager on over 100 titles in the industry, including Lone Shark Games' monster hit (pun intended) Apocrypha Adventure Card Game.\nGaby Weidling is the book's developer. She's a game, puzzle, and event designer whose  handiwork can be found in games like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow\u2019s Walk, Apocrypha, and more. Some of her favorite puzzle projects include developing The Maze of Games and Puzzlecraft, designing a series of escape rooms set in the world of Magic: the Gathering\u2019s Innistrad, and teaching puzzle design at DigiPen. She spends her spare time trying new things, cuddling her cats, and just generally being a sunshine cannon. Someday she\u2019ll quit the game industry to become a detective or reboot Matlock. Maybe both. She can be found at @ermahgerdgerby.\nTanis O'Connor is the book's editor. Her past work includes design, development, and editing on Dungeons & Dragons with Wizards of the Coast, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game at Paizo Publishing, many other game and puzzle events, and 5 (!) MIT Mystery Hunts. Do not try this at home. \nOh, right, we nearly forgot. Gaby and Mike are trapped in the Maze of Games escape room for the entire length of this campaign. We'd go and let them out, but it's more fun to let you figure out how to free them. We're going to give you daily puzzles of several types, all of which combine to figure out how to get them out. It'll all end in a final campaign-end livestream, but before we get there, you better get cracking on these puzzles. \nHere's what you got:\nIn the campaign video above and six later update videos are seven rebus puzzles. Those are visual addition puzzles like the kind you see on the show Concentration. Each leads to an answer, which will get you one of seven badges. The first one contains this image. Another hidden puzzle across all the videos will get you the eighth badge.\nIf you follow our Twitter account @lonesharkgames, you'll see a set of 20 daily Tom Swifties. Those are puzzles where Tom says a sentence in a particularly punny manner such as \"'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.\" In our Gatekeeper Swifties, the answers are all names of authors the Gatekeeper has trapped in the Maze. Answering all of them will lead to a final instruction which gives you a ninth badge. The first ten such puzzles are gathered here.\nAt five geek-themed events\u2014the MIT Mystery Hunt, the JoCo Cruise, Emerald City Comic Con, the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and this week's PAX East\u2014we'll be there giving out postcards. All five puzzles' answers combine together in a specific way to get you a tenth badge. \nThe first event postcard. We'll post the rest after each event ends.\nFinally, getting Mike and Gaby out of the Maze of Games escape room will get you the eleventh badge. That's only available when the campaign comes to an end.\nWhen you have an answer for any of these puzzles, submit it on our answer site. You'll get a response from us that will let you continue your quest and maybe give you a badge. When you get one, use it as your Kickstarter, Facebook, or Twitter icon. That'll show off how smart a puzzler you are, and maybe even that you care if Mike and Gaby get out alive. Regardless, we'll see you in the Maze.

The Maze of Games Escape Room is ready for opening, the audiobooks are recorded and formatted for download, and the third-printing books are getting ready for shipment. All the digital rewards and most of the physical rewards are ready to go.\n\nThe only physical object that isn't finished is The Keymaster's Tome, because we hope the campaign lets us make a larger version of it. When the campaign is over, we'll finish up work on that and send it to press in the United States. When all that's ready, we'll get it all to our fulfiller for shipping in the US. It may take longer to get our non-US orders done, but we'll get them fulfilled as quickly as we can.\n\nThis is the first of TWO puzzle book campaigns we'll be doing fairly close to back-to-back. After this one finishes, we'll start readying the campaign for the long awaited reprint of Puzzlecraft: How to Create Any Kind of Puzzle.

It was where some of the greatest writers of the 20th Century got their start and some of the most iconic characters made their debut, from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan and John Carter to Maxwell Grant's The Shadow to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. \nWithout the pulps, comic books may never have introduced the super-hero...and then where would we be today?\nThe pulp magazine era was bristling with brawny men and statuesque women globetrotting, and getting into and out of danger. Their exploits quickened the pulses of their readers, young and old alike. They gave rise to some of the most enduring heroes known the world 'round.\nTo honor and celebrate a bygone era, I have partnered with most of my Crazy 8 Press team. If you've loved Aaron Rosenberg's work on ReDeus or From this is Hell or Paul Kupperberg's super-hero comics and adventure stories or the intergalactic adventures from Mary Fan or the noirish stylings of Russ Colchamiro, then you know what you're in for. Aaron, Paul, Mary, the late Glenn Hauman, and Michael Jan Friedman are all signed on for the project. \nAdditionally, I have assembled a stellar line-up of other writers \u2013 Derek Tyler Attico, Jim & Becky Beard, Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Robert T. Jeschonek, Amy Lewanski, Karissa Laurel, and Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg \u2013 to produce new thrills and chills, spanning the traditional pulp realms of mystery, sword and sorcery, horror, science fiction, romance, and high adventure, in a volume appropriately titled...Thrilling Adventure Yarns!\nMeet Professor Ironheart! The Blue Mask! The Green Lady! Cannon Belle! And many more brand-new heroes that would have made pulp-era creators proud.\nAn Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished World War I aviator tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign. \nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns -- in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable British artist Alex Ronald. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $4,500, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package--to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't. Just take any existing package of $25 and up and add to it the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list. Then send us a message letting us know what additional reward or rewards you've qualified for. (International backers, there will be some additional postage; if you're interested in an add-on, shoot us a message and we'll figure it out.)\nGet listed as a patron on the acknowledgments page                                     10. \nReceive a one-time mention as a character, street, company, etc.             35.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #1                                                                                   20. \nCrazy 8 e-book package #2                                                                                   20.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #3                                                                                   20.\nPackage #1 includes Six Scarlet Scorpions (a Pat Savage novel) by Will Murray; No Small Bills by Aaron Rosenberg; In My Shorts (a short story collection) by Paul Kupperberg; Pulling Up Stakes by Peter David; ReDeus: Divine Tales, and The Fire Dragon by Mary Fan.\nPackage #2 includes The Camelot Papers by Peter David; Finders Keepers by Russ Colchamiro; Flynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil by Mary Fan; a collection of five short stories by Keith R.A.

DeCandido, Will Murray and Peter David.\nIn many ways, Will has been almost single-handedly keeping the pulps alive with his articles and short stories throughout the years.

Vancouver, British Columbia found out after a breakout of White Sun, a virus capable of bringing back the dead in a viciously primal state. Panic turned into destruction as corpses marched through the streets, tearing at the flesh of anyone in their wake. \nHope was fleeting. \nGlobal superpowers came together and formed the International Bio-disaster Response Agency (IBRA). Cleaner Squads were dispatched into the unfolding crisis. Their mission: extract the living and clear out any dead that stands in their way.\nBruce Deacon, fireteam leader of CS-42, was among the first wave to arrive. Entering the besieged city only to discover\u2026\nIn Vancouver, when it rains it pours.  \nWhat is Vancity Outbreak?\nVancity Outbreak is a graphic novel about a deadly virus that turns victims into ravenous undead cannibals. Bruce Deacon, the squad leader of a bio-disaster response team, is sent to rescue the survivors trapped within the city. He meets a student nurse named Jane Riley and together they work to escape the quarantine zone. Only to discover that they bit off more than they could chew.\nWhiplash Comics uses real actors and real locations. We tell stories through the medium of a camera and create stunning visuals through composting the photographs. The result is a truly unique style that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. \nOur cast includes real models, actors, makeup artist, musicians, and other creatives. Together, with very small budget, we put together TWO action-packed issues. Reid Lucier tailored each photo using graphic compositing to add the effects while working with Cale Boudreau to input the story. \nWe've had a booth at Vancouver\u2019s zombie walk, comic conventions and met with successful creators to learn everything we can. It paid off and we want to continue going forward! With your help we can pay for the printing costs, shipping fees, and begin working on future comics!\n\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 2 - Crossings\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\n\nReward Tiers\nTier 1 - Bite\nTier 2 - Infection\nTier 3 - Viral Spread\nTier 4 - Outbreak\nTier 5 - Pandemic\nTier 6 - Apocalypse\nTier 7 - Annihilation\nOur Vision\nWhiplash Comics brings graphic novels to life through photography. With a successful Kickstarter, we can bring both issues of Vancity Outbreak to market, tainted with our blood, sweat and tears.\nAnd we don't plan on stopping there! \nWe have more stories in the works including: issue #3 of Vancity Outbreak, a spy comic, a VR short movie based on Vancity Outbreak, and even branching off into illustrated comics.\nWith enough support we can deliver more jaw-dropping visual storytelling. We made Vancity Outbreak with a budget of $200, having a group of creatives from all walks of life come together through nothing but passion. \nOur goal moving forward, however, is to offer compensation to the actors, extras, make-up artists, and everyone else that contributes. This is an important step if we want to maintain our cast for continuity sake. The photoshoots last anywhere from 10-12 hours and often require re-shoots. Tons of work pours into each comic which requires intricate planning to put together. \nWHO ARE WE?\nReid\nCale\nWhat's the backstory? How did Vancity Outbreak come about?\nReid Lucier had the idea for Vancity Outbreak after finishing a zombie themed photoshoot with our resident Bruce (Roberto Lanzas) and Jane (Yu Sarah Matsushita). After editing the first photo, he noticed how cinematic the shots were and found the inspiration to make a comic. Reid created a short PDF comic book with the photos he had.  A year later Reid decided he wanted to continue Vancity Outbreak and really do it right with a full graphic novel in mind.  After bringing up the idea to the original cast and receiving a lot of enthusiasm from them to do more, Reid sat down to write a full graphic novel.  It took all about 10 mins to realize writing was not his speciality.\nThat\u2019s when he met Cale Boudreau, a creative writer and zombie fanatic, online. Together, with couple cold ones and some poutine they created the vision for the comic.  They began casting actors, makeup artist, and looking for props and locations to shoot.  Shedding their blood, sweat, and tears to make it happen. \nTwo full issues were shot, and Reid went to work on editing, and layout, special effects etc. Now finally we are thrilled to get these issues into your hands!\nWhy back us?\nBecause we know where you live, and the next time you open your front door we'll have our undead associate waiting for you...\nOur associate :)\n Just kidding...maybe? \n\nPrinting\nSize: 6.6 by 10.25 inches\nCover:  10pt paper stock, Matte anti-scratch, green foil stamping\nInside paper stock:  85lbs matte\nBinding: Perfect Softcover\nWe shopped around and did our research.  We walked a few indie comic events and 8/10 books we picked up, flipped through and impressed us were from Print Ninja.  We contacted Print Ninja and they sent us a few samples.

With a photographic comic these problems become more complex.\n\nHere's the good news: All the work is done and the first two comics are 100% complete! We simply need help to fund our first printing run and to bring forth all the great rewards with it. \n\nWe have a TON of interest from actors wanting to join future projects. If our stretch goal is met, we can begin creating issue #3 and offer an incentive to the cast to devote more hard work and time.\n\nWhen using real people, conflicting schedules can occur such as people dropping out of the project and doing reshoots. These are working professionals in the industry so their schedules are often hard to align. \n\nOur contingency here is find a day that works for everyone. We can also break up shoots into two smaller days.

In the ancient forest of Soza, a fighter, a thief and a hermit go searching for a magical sword that can control minds!\nIt was shot in the woods by the Yoghurt Rooms in East Grinstead with some scenes in Ashdown Forest.\nWe are hosting a MOVIE PREMIERE in the East Grinstead Cinema on Sunday the 9th of December. In order to do this screening, and hopefully more in the future, we need a BBFC certificate, and they're very expensive!\nWith your support, we hope to screen this film, not only for this story, but on behalf of all micro-budget film makers. We want to bring big independent features into the cinema, where they should be!\nThe film stars Xander Phillips as Tias, Seth Easterbrook as Ulysses, and Martyn Eade as Mars. It's a more classic style fantasy, with a fully original classical score, which I have written myself.\nWe recommend arriving at the event at 6:30 PM\nThe doors will open at 7:00 PM and there will be one intermission in the middle of the film. The cast and crew will be there, handing out awards to pledgers, answering questions, and trying our best to hide our nerves (me in particular!)\nYour pledge will help us to cover the costs of this release. Not the film cost itself. We paid for that for the love of making film. The budget was probably around \u00a32000 in total, mainly due to old style clothing and you guessed it - swords! This funding will help mostly with the certificate, the theatre rental, and if we overshoot our goal, it will begin to help cover costs of printing, ink, paper, cases, posters and rewards.\nAbove all, your pledge will - quite honestly - give us a little more hope in this field of art. To make something that people give a chance, to give their time and money to experience something new, whether good or bad, gives us the ability to learn from the experience, and a little more confidence in putting the time and money into future films.\nUPDATE ON THE RATING: It is now a 12A, confirmed!\nIf your kids like classic fantasy adventure, bring them! :D\nThis is a \"fantasy epic\" so it's not short. It has been cut down, so it's faster-paced, but after debating for a long time, I could not bring myself to divide this film into two halves. Although it was almost possible, it would have spoiled the structure of the script, and the way it was intended to be. But as promised, a 15-minute intermission, and some possible surprises during :) Like the way cinema used to be!\nPlease pass this link to anyone who you think it might appeal to. We're always looking to build relationships with backers who may also be trying to get into the film-making game. That's the whole idea!\nThank you for your time in looking at our film, and I look forward to meeting you and posting all those rewards.

I ask for help at the last minute, well after I've done everything I can. (Although one day, I hope to try new methods!) Therefore there are practically no risks for backers.\n\nThe film has already been written, shot, edited and scored. We are in the absolute final stages of audio mixing, which will probably be done by the time this kick-starter is launched. I will then test it with Chris on the projector, make any adjustments, test again (I usually aim for first or second test to be the final one), then it's done. If I die, the show goes on. If the cinema gets fried by a dragon, then we might have a problem.\n\nSince the campaign ends the day before the premiere, the film is scheduled to be tested within a week from now. The only risks are technical ones, computers deciding to fight me, which I am pretty used to by now! If some horrific freak technical problem happens and the Premiere can't go on, then I would know well before the kick-starter would end, and would not allow it to take the money from its backers in the first place. I have already started production on the rewards, which are relatively easy to complete at this stage from previous experience.\nVHS is a bit of a tricky one, but we reckon we've solved it doing some tests.\nWhen the film is on that projector, tested and given the nod, it stays there.

My name is A. M. Paulson.  I am a dyslexic writer with a few stories published and am writing a comic book series through Oneshi Press.  I had lots of issues in school with spelling and reading with the letter 'c' being a true enemy of mine for my early grade school years.  Later in life I learned a rule to spell with the letter 'c'.  The letter 'c' sounds like a 'k' before a, o, and u as in cat, cot, and cut.  The letter 'c' sounds like an 's' before e, i, and y as in cent, city, and cyst.  Now I am inspired to write a picture book to teach this rule to help other kids like myself.  I sent it to many publishers, but they had no idea what to do with it and rejected it on the grounds they didn't know who would buy it.  I know this story can help many kids, so I got together with a friend, and we planing to put it on Amazon Kindle.  We need $100 for art supplies  and to pay the artist.  We have other goals as well.  \nThose goals are...\n$200 for an audio book\n$300 for a paperback printed edition\n$500 for a hardback printed edition\n$1000 for an animated short of the story\nI am not one to ask you to give money without seeing the manuscript.  So, the rest of this post is the story 'Mary and the Letter C.'  I hope you enjoy it ;)\nMary and the Letter C\nBy: A. M. Paulson\nMary was very sad. She had failed her spelling test, and her parents said it was because she did not try hard enough to learn to spell the words.\n\u201cHow can you spell the word \u2018cat\u2019 k-a-t?\u201d her dad had asked.\n\u201cThe word \u2018city\u2019 begins with a \u2018c\u2019 not a \u2018s\u2019,\u201d her mother had said. \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d\nMary had tried to tell her parents she spelled the words the way they sounded just like her teacher told her to do, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. Instead they sent her to her room without any dinner.\nAs she sat on her bed, Mary decided the only reason she failed the test was because of the letter \u201cc.\u201d She wondered why the letter \u201cc\u201d sounded like the letter \u201cs\u201d when you sang the alphabet song, but when used in words, it sometimes sounded like a \u201ck,\u201d for example in \u201ccat.\u201d For hours, she thought and thought. \nMary thought about how the letter \u201cc\u201d doesn\u2019t really have a sound of its own.\nMary thought about how the letter \u201cc\u201d steals spelling jobs from \u201cs\u2019s\u201d and \u201ck\u2019s.\u201d\nMary thought about how much better the world would be without the letter \u201cc.\u201d\nMary thought about hammering out the letter \u201cc\u201d into the letter \u201cI\u201d or squeezing it into the letter \u201co,\u201d or bending it into the letter \u201cv.\u201d \nUntil at last, she fell asleep. \nIn middle of the night, a sound woke Mary up. Jumping up and down on her bed was a fairy. The fairy had the wings of a honeybee and a dress made of letters.\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the fairy. \u201cI\u2019m Spella, the fairy of spelling and grammar. I\u2019m here to teach you about the letter \u2018c\u2019.\u201d\nMary closed her eyes to go back to sleep. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to learn about the letter \u2018c\u2019.\u201d Mary said. \u201cGo away, so I can go back to sleep.\u201d\nSpella flew over to Mary and whispered in her ear, \u201cLearning about \u2018c\u2019 will help you pass your next spelling test.\u201d\nMary opened one eye. \u201cIt will?\u201d\nSpella nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nMary sat up.\nSpella flew to the middle of the room and clapped her hands, and the letters \u201cc,\u201d \u201cs,\u201d and \u201ck\u201d appeared. \n\u201cYou are right about the letter \u2018c\u2019 being troublesome,\u201d Spella said. \u201cLots of children your age have trouble knowing which of these three letters to use at the beginning of a word.\u201d\n\u201cBut my parents said no one had trouble with it,\u201d Mary said, remembering what her mom and dad had said before they sent her to her room.\nSpella shrugged. \u201cSome people have no problem with it. Everyone is different.\u201d\nSpella clapped her hands again. The letters \u201ck\u201d and \u201cs\u201d vanished in a puff, and the letters \u201ca,\u201d \u201ce,\u201d \u201ci,\u201d \u201co,\u201d \u201cu,\u201d and \u201cy\u201d appeared. These letters made two rows. \u201cA,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d were in one, and the letters \u201ce,\u201d \u201ci\u201d and \u201cy\u201d were the another. \nThe fairy pointed at the two rows of letters and said, \u201cBelieve it or not, it is really these letters that determine in words that begin with a \u2018c,\u2019 if that \u2018c\u2019 sounds like a \u2018k,\u2019 or an \u2018s\u2019.\u201d\nMary did not believe Spella. She wondered how vowels had anything to do with how the letter \u201cc\u201d sounded. However, instead of asking, Mary waited for Spella to go on.\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Spella, as the letters \u201ca,\u201d \u201cc,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d began to glow. \u201cThe letter \u2018c\u2019 has the hard sound \u2018k\u2019 before \u2018a\u2019, \u2018o\u2019 and \u2018u\u2019 as in the words cat, cot, and cut.\u201d\nThe letters \u2018a\u2019, \u2018o\u2019, and \u2018u\u2019 stopped glowing. Spella pointed to the other row of letters, and that started glowing.\nSpella then said, \u201cThe letter \u2018c\u2019 has the soft sound \u2018s\u2019 before \u2018e\u2019, \u2018i\u2019, and \u2018y\u2019 as in the words cent, city, and cyst.\u201d\nSpella clapped her hands and the letters vanished in a puff. The fairy looked at Mary with a large smile on its face. \nMary scratched her head. \u201cThat is kind of confusing.\u201d\n\u201cYes it is sort of confusing,\u201d Spella agreed. \u201cBut English is a hard language with over one-hundred different spelling and grammar rules. For example, the \u2018k\u2019 sound can also be spelled with a \u2018c\u2019, \u2018k\u2019, \u2018ck,\u2019 \u2018ch,\u2019 or \u2018que.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so stupid!\u201d Mary groaned. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be good at spelling.\u201d\nSpella hovered in front of Mary. \u201cBeing good or bad at spelling has nothing to with being smart or dumb. Now will you let me help you learn to use the letter \u2018C\u2019?\u201d\nMary nodded her head. Through out the night Spella helped Mary understand the rule about using the letter \u2018C\u2019 in the begging of a word. It was not long before the Mary was able to spell words with the letter \u2018C\u2019.\nSpella asked, \u201c How do you spell the word \u2018cart\u2019?\nMary spelled. \u201c C-a-r-t\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Spella cheered. \u201cNow how do you spell the word \u2018city\u2019?\n\u201cC-i-t-y\u201d Mary spelled.\nSpella gave Mary a thumbs-up. \u201cThere see you got it.\u201d\nMary gave Spella a hug. \u201cThank you so much for all of your help, Spella.\u201d\n\u201cThanks are not needed,\u201d Spella said. \u201cI\u2019m a fairy after all, and fairies help people.\u201d  \nSpella signed sadly. \u201cNow I\u2019m sorry to say that I have to go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to get through school without you. No one has ever tried to help me like you did,\u201d Mary said with tears forming in her eyes. \u201cI wish you could stay and be my friend forever.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Spella said. \nSpella clapped her hands again and a card appeared in Mary\u2019s hands.\n\u201cWe will always be friends.\u201d Spella flew in front of Mary\u2019s nose. \u201cIf you ever need any help in spelling or grammar, just do what the card says, and I\u2019ll come.\u201d\nSpella vanished in a puff of smoke and letters. Mary put the card on a table next her bed, lay back down on her bed, and fell a sleep.\nThe next day, Mary woke up thinking the whole thing had been a dream. Then she saw Spella\u2019s card on the table and knew it had happened. She also knew it would not be the last time she would meet her fairy friend Spella, the spelling and grammar fairy.

Now imagine that same near future demands you have the trendiest dating app which requires you to upload your... DNA? A bit intrusive, right? What are the ethical guidelines when it comes to advancement in technology? Where do we draw the line between right vs. wrong? Who\u2019s to say we haven\u2019t crossed it? \nXYXX explores a near future in which one technological innovation alters the lives of lonely singles everywhere. Technology. Reality. Privacy. Identity. Love. These five themes are the backbone of XYXX -- and our team can't wait to tell more of these stories!\nElle (Meredith Shank) downloading XYXX for the first time\nThe Origins\nBack in the fall of 2015, Conor Patrick Hogan and Cory McConnell came up with the idea for XYXX over a case of PBR in a Silver Lake backyard. Conor provided the PBR, Cory provided the Silver Lake backyard. Below you'll find a segment of the original pitch that was drafted from this brainstorming. It's remarkable how little was altered from its core inception. \nA segment of Conor and Cory's first story area, 10/12/15\nOnce the pilot was written, Conor and Cory invited four other writers (Andy Holt, Samantha Levy, Lyz May and Kim Ndombe) into the world of XYXX and fleshed out an entire first season  together. Producers Scott Sullivan, Maija Gustin and Daniel Marks provided instrumental feedback during this period too. Black Mirror was an obvious inspiration in early meetups, with Orphan Black's tonal fluidity and High Maintenance's structural ingenuity providing further assistance with our own series' blueprint. Once the entire first season was written, Conor and Cory reached out to directors and casting directors -- purposefully searching for new, unknown (to them!) accomplices who would challenge their storytelling process and collaborate on ways to make the world of the series even more grand. \nXYXX Casting Session, Spring 2016 [From L to R: Chris Redondo (Casting Director), Morgan Dameron (Director), Cory McConnell (Editor) and Conor Patrick Hogan's fingers (Writer)]\nOnce Morgan Dameron (director) and Chris Redondo (casting director) were aboard, the next few months blurred. Casting bled into VFX trials which bled into production meetings and, finally, 3 days of filming. From the first setup, everyone was aware that our premiere episode's leads -- Meredith Shank and Jim Cummings -- possessed an uncanny chemistry. \nElle (Meredith Shank) first meets Harry (Jim Cummings)\nXYXX was finally a living, breathing thing.\nThen 2 years flew by. Sadly, no one seemed interested in XYXX. So we're moving ahead solo!\nThe Near Future\nXYXX is a near future anthology series that aims to be pro-reality, not anti-technology. By using a black and white tableau for \u2018reality\u2019 and bright, bold colors for \u2018technology\u2019, we plan to ask our audience: just what is truly revered in society now that our screens have become so ubiquitous \u2013 is it true human connection or merely the appearance of said connection? \nHarry (Jim Cummings) previews the XYXX profile of Elle (Meredith Shank)\nWhile this aim may appear grandiose, it\u2019s the subtleties of the separate romances our team plan to delve into that will make this series stand out from any counterparts. Episode 1, a true world-building introduction, delves into what transpires when you begin online dating (for the first time ever!) in our near future world. Episode 2 explores the repercussions when one spouse in a relationship won\u2019t upload their DNA to the questionably invasive app. Finally, Episode 3 tackles a high school senior's blossoming sexuality when it doesn\u2019t necessarily match that of heteronormativity in this brave, new world.\nAs long as XYXX engages an audience enough to make them simply consider the moral quandaries almost on our doorstep -- while also (hopefully!) making them laugh -- the cast and crew will have accomplished their goal. \nElle (Meredith Shank) receives a rather unwelcome text\nThe Plan & Crew\nWith your crowdfunding contribution, the team behind XYXX will shoot Episodes 2 and 3 in the Winter of 2018 and then release all three episodes as Season 1 in the first half of 2019. We're excited to have some new teammates -- Brandon Smithson (director, ep 103) and Leslie Wasserman (casting director) -- with many of our first episode's crew returning too.\nCONOR PATRICK HOGAN (Co-creator / Writer / EP )\nConor Patrick Hogan stayed in the closet way past his expiration date. During his early twenties (while still closeted!) he produced a feature film, Trailerpark, based on the collection of short stories by award-winning author Russell Banks. Once he departed from Ohio (and finally came out!), he moved to LA and worked on various TV shows including Modern Family, Covert Affairs, Banshee, SIX and Chicago Med, where he is currently the script coordinator. Conor's super worried about people casually uploading their DNA to random apps, but that's why he appreciates Cory's perspective on the whole sitch.\nCORY McCONNELL (Co-creator / Editor / EP)\nCory McConnell is a producer and editor living in Los Angeles. XYXX has been a labor of love during time off from his day jobs, including stints at CollegeHumor and The Ringer. He is ambivalent about uploading his DNA to phone apps, but vehemently against the proliferation of electric scooter startups.\nMORGAN DAMERON (Director 101 & 102 / EP)\nMorgan Dameron is an award-winning writer, director and producer who has always blazed her own path. Born in Kansas City, MO, Dameron was awarded the Women in Film and Television in Kansas City\u2019s \u201cTrailblazer Award\u201d for Up and Coming Women in Film while still in high school. She received a full scholarship to the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, where she graduated summa cum laude. She has been supported by prestigious programs such as the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, The Caucus for Producers, and Ryan Murphy\u2019s HALF Initiative. Dameron has directed groundbreaking digital series and branded content garnering tens of millions of views. Her first feature film, Different Flowers, received rave reviews during its national theatrical release and can currently be seen on Showtime. Kansas City Women in Film and Television recently bestowed her with the \u201cSpirit of Kansas City\u201d award for her work bringing film production to her hometown and Duke University\u2019s Talent Identification Program recently honored her with the Early Achievement Award. She lives in Los Angeles.\nBRANDON SMITHSON (Director 103)\nBrandon Smithson is a LA-based filmmaker who got his start in entertainment by shooting music videos and fashion shorts in NYC. Some of his previous work includes two music videos for Bob the Drag Queen and a behind-the-scenes short with recording artist Brandy.  In 2016, his digital series Inner Circle garnered international press and was featured in Gay Times. More recently, Brandon serves as creator of the episodic series Fish Tank which takes you on a comedic adventure into the dating lives of two trans women.\nLESLIE WASSERMAN (Casting Director)\nLeslie Wasserman is a casting professional for film and TV. She was recently the Casting Director for Dekkoo Series I\u2019m Fine and Del Close documentary For Madmen Only. Her work includes Cameron Crowe\u2019s Roadies, Strangers 2: Prey at Night and Of Kings and Prophets. Upcoming films include Lady and the Tramp, Mustang, The Devil Has a Name, City of Lies, Four Kids and It, and TV series Shark Lords.

Where the story about the time that the wood elf cavalry saved the day, or how the onslaught of the orc hordes could not be stopped. We wanted to create a history with our friends.\"\n  \u2013 Ron Newcomb\nThe Rangers: Rise of War game has been years in the making. This game\u2019s journey began back in 2014 as The Rangers film was being developed. Since 2015 it has been play tested by the creators and gamers to develop and refine the most diverse game play we could provide, a game that we would want to play. Each army offers a diverse makeup and features that add depth and create unique outcomes in game play. The game is set in the high-fantasy world of The Rangers, Adrasil. The Rangers franchise includes several films, as seen on The Fantasy Network, a comic book, and a live-action role playing event, \"Weekend Warrior\u201d.  \nFACTIONS\nHUMANS\nBased in the Kingdom of Olaran, the humans are a young race, divided into the Landwards, who hold power and the Rangers, who are an elite group of warriors that are the eyes and blade of the king. The Human faction is allied to the Wood Elves. Veteran Human units can be upgraded to a Ranger. Human Heroes may inspire the populace of a region to double their production output.\nWOOD ELVES\nThe Elven Lords like to stay to themselves, but during this time of war, the ancients must join the age of man and emerge from the depths of their hidden palaces in the Green Wood or fall under the weight of the Shadow Elves and their Orc hordes to the north. Their alliance with the Humans is tenuous and fraught with suspicion. Wood Elf units possess \u201cswiftness\u201d and may move 2 spaces during their turn. Wood Elf Heroes have a +1 movement and may engage enemy troops at long range with their bow in an adjacent territory during their turn.\nSHADOW ELVES\nThe Elven Lords of the North, known as the Umbran, are an ancient and noble people. Adept in the arts of war and magic, they are fierce in battle though small in number. Their subjugated allies, the Orc hordes, make up for their lack of numbers. Shadow Elf s possess \u201cstealth\u201d and may move 2 spaces during their turn and a +1 initiative to the opening die roll at the start of the game. Umbran can hold +1 additional spell card. Umbran Heroes may strike and retreat in the same turn too on a die roll of 1, 2 or 3. They may also choose to attack with an Orc Horde they are adjacent to.\nORCS\nThe Orc Warlords and their hordes are brutal and vicious in battle. Hordes overrun and crush their enemies by tenacity and sheer weight of their numbers. The Orcs are allied to their masters, the Shadow Elves. Orc warriors cost half as much as all other units. Orcs may choose to pillage a building for half its resources in return. Individual Orc troops may also \u201cberserk\u201d, sacrificing themselves and tripling their attack value for one turn of combat + max unit/region ratio.\nCREATURES\nShould you choose to quest with your Hero, you may find yourself face-to-face with a beast from ancient days. These ancient creatures are difficult to kill and dangerous in a fight.\nSHIPPING\nWe will be handling shipping cost after the campaign. Our goal is for Friendly Shipping worldwide with fulfillment centers and local publishers. Each of these countries (US, Canada, Europe, Australia/NZ, Asia) we plan to send bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly.

A new novel from Matt Vancil, author of Hopjockey and creator of The Gamers and JourneyQuest.  \nIn a distinctly Trekkian universe, mankind has finally reached the stars! But we never shed capitalism along the way, and that lerd\u2019s only gotten worse. \nThis future is no utopia. Forget diplomacy\u2014humanity\u2019s presence in space is focused solely on seizing exoplants and extracting their resources. The ships of the Coalition are interstellar company towns, run by indifferent AIs and designed to keep their crews in constant debt. Inequality is rampant\u2014if you\u2019re wearing a red crew shirt, life sucks: you\u2019re overworked in hazardous conditions while under constant surveillance and living on top of one another. And you have to pay for your own health care. And the whole time, the smirking officers are telling you the only reason you\u2019re not enjoying the good life is because you\u2019ve chosen to stay poor. So, nothing at all like the world today.\nAfter surviving fifteen years in a red shirt, Webb is nearly burned out. She joined up like any starry-eyed kid did: to get her own ship. But that\u2019s never going to happen\u2014not now that the officers loathe her for being the crew\u2019s elected (and powerless) representative, even as she\u2019s trying to break out of the enlisted ranks herself. But rank has little to do with leadership, and hers will be put to the test when the starship Independence collides saucer-first with with a threat they\u2019re completely unprepared for: aliens that don\u2019t look like us.* When the ship\u2019s social order breaks down from a truly alien threat, it\u2019s falls to Webb to save the crew, the ship\u2014and herself.\n*You can have sex with most aliens.

I\u2019ve written three other books and I currently teach filmmaking at DigiPen, aka \u201cNintendo University.\u201d I may have totally lifted this from my bio. \nThe novel isn\u2019t written yet, and I\u2019d like to change that.

Nerrena, who also wishes to obtain the orb as it belongs to the Lich Lord she brought into the realm, hunts the party down. \nNow, the adventurers think they\u2019re ready to face the Devouring Dungeon...to find the mythical Fountain of Experience.\nThey\u2019re not ready.\nThey\u2019ll probably die horribly. \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n Torvold Therapy Session, Season 3!\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n Sasha Therapy Session, Season 3!\nPLAY\n\nSeason 3 completed principal photography in April of 2018.

Funds received during this campaign cannot be applied to shipping or add-ons. \nExample: if someone pledges $70 for the $50 level, the extra $20 will go straight into improving the show.

A lot of the art in these rules is placeholders and we're still tinkering with fonts and backdrops for legibility purposes, but the content is the current iteration of the rules.\nJuly 5 - The first review is in! In German. However, you can read the somewhat amusing Google translation of it here.\nKilling Lee Garvin? Huh?\nKilling Lee Garvin (KLG for short) is a game with a mission. To make fun of the improbable yet inevitable mortality of game designer Lee Garvin (Tales from the Floating Vagabond, Badass Zombie Killers, etc.), which hopefully is quite a few years off. And also because on his way there he has racked up a lot of medical bills that he feels honor-bound to pay while simultaneously faced with the problem of doing so on what you can make as an indie game designer. And the minor distraction of being evicted and living in his car for the past several months. So, with the assistance of cartoonist Ron Leishman (co-creator of Captain Canuck), I'm trying to help Lee out a bit.\nGreg: Being a board/card/rpg game designer is creatively wonderful, but sucks in a lot of other respects. Publishing is already a low-income zone with no job security and negligible benefits, and game design is a ghetto within that zone.\nAnd if you are an independent game designer, it can be even tougher. Lee Garvin is a friend and like me, an indie, but unlike me, life has not been kind to him. In the sense that \"being in an accident, going into a coma and waking up medically bankrupt\" is \"not been kind\".\nAmong other things. Lee has endured a laundry list of improbable bad luck events that would make a good script for a slapstick version of Final Destination.\nBecause I'm a game designer, I see everything as having game potential, so I humorously told Lee I should make a game about killing him off. And the more I thought about it, the more it actually started to make sense...\nAnd so, Killing Lee Garvin was born... At the time I started work on this, Lee still had a roof over his head and the project was meant to just help with his medical bills, but as his life circumstances took a more...outdoors turn, the focus has turned to helping him first get that roof (any roof) back, so that he can try to do all the things those of us with roofs take for granted.\nLee: I wasn't entirely sure Greg was serious about doing this at first, but I should have guessed; he made a game about stalking slasher victims (which I have played quite a bit). And for the record, It wasn't an accident that put me into the coma; it was the doctors who were trying to get me to breathe after I got pneumonia. The accident was a different time.\nBut to give an example of where the cards are coming from, long ago, in an age known as \"The '80s\", I was a Boy Scout (Go Troop 35!). While at one of our troop cookouts, the guys were spread out all over the grounds of the church that served as the host for most of our events. Being Scouts, we were naturally very curious about nature. Being Boys, we were reckless and quite foolish in our endeavors. Being the '80s, safety had not yet been invented. Some of my fellow scouts were expressing their curiosity towards nature by whacking a wasps' nest in a tree with a long stick. I was walking from around the other side of the building at the time, so naturally, I turned the corner just as they knocked the nest out of the tree, and it hit the ground, and all the wasps in the world flew into my open mouth. I really, really wish I could say that was the worst pain I have ever experienced.\nIf one accepts the \"many worlds\" theory of alternate realities, I died in 437 of them. But this being the 1980s, and my father being from Texas, as long as the kid could breathe and no bones were visible, he saw no reason to get medical professionals involved.  \nBut I did get ice cream.\nLife-threatening calamities and ice cream. The Lee Garvin story...\nGoals?\nGreg: KLG has a few simple goals. Be a good, hilarious game. Help out Lee. The latter part is simple. After the production costs are taken into account, Lee gets half. And this is not Hollywood accounting. Lee gets most of his projected cut as fast as I can cut the check after the Kickstarter ends. And if it is funded with time to spare, I'll write as much as I can out of my own account, just to give him a head start. And the more people we get on board, the lower the production cost is per game. So, the more people that want to kill Lee, the better off he ends up. I'm not exactly sure how the karma math works on that one, however...\nLee: One thing I want to make crystal clear is that, yes, I am in a bad way (hell, I'm sleeping in my car right now), but I am not alone, and there are others who have it worse than me. So yes, I will be using some of the money from this project to dig myself out of the hole I'm in, but a full 50% of it, I intend to donate to the Jack Vasel Memorial Fund. This is an organization that has already helped me quite a bit, so I just want to return the favor. They exist to do nothing but help Gaming Professionals who have hit hard times.\nAbout the game\nKLG is a simple 3-6 player game that hides a significant amount of strategy and backstabbing. There are two ways to win. First, you can \"heal\" Lee and you win. Second, you can manipulate someone else into killing Lee and if you have the best game position at that time, you win. So, you can be a good guy and save him, or a bastard who engineers and then takes advantage of his untimely demise...\nIt's a single-deck game, with 54 cards and a bunch of tokens in three colors for representing Lee's health. Cards are simple. They have a number, a color and a type (Harm or Help). Every round you choose from a selection of face-up cards to add to your hand, play cards secretly and reveal them. Harm cards give Health tokens to other players, Help cards put tokens back in the common pool. If you get too many tokens of a particular color, Lee becomes an ex-game designer and it will all be your fault. You are a bad person and Lee's ghost will haunt you. Even if it was another player who gave you the tokens that made you lose. It's pretty easy to end the game by bringing about Lee's untimely demise, but to win you also have to have the best board position when that happens. Not so easy. So you may have to work very hard to keep him healthy...right up to the moment where you push him in front of a bus.\nBut you can also make deals involving the cards. And break them. You do not know exactly what other players are holding, but you do know who has what tokens and what will trigger the end of the game. So, the deals you make and the order in which they resolve is an important part of each round. So, cards are revealed and the round leader (player 1) says \u201cHey player 4, I won't hit you with the Squirrels if you don't Mug me\u201d, and player 4 says \u201cSure thing!\u201d Of course, since player 1 does their action first, player 4 does not have to abide by the deal, but they will. This time. \nAnd whoever is the current round leader has to narrate Lee's life events using the revealed cards for that round. So player 1 looks at the cards and says: \n\"Lee compensated for the stresses of GenCon with a regular cardio workout. But while jogging in the park one morning he was mugged and beaten. And then the squirrels found him...\u201d\nKLG gameplay video\nPLAY\n\nA game of KLG takes ten to thirty minutes to play, and strategy really depends on who you are playing with. People who are trying to win by healing Lee will have a different strategy than those trying to bring about his premature end, and how you play depends on how many of each type of player are in your game. But you are simultaneously playing against the table (the state of tokens and their distribution) and against the other players (what are they trying to do, and to whom?). \nStretch Goals \n$15,000: The basic game\nNot really a stretch goal. This covers the production, art, the Kickstarter cut and enough room to get Lee some money. The base funding level is not low-balling it in expectation we will blow through it. It is a realistic number so that if we reach, Lee gets some help. Given the fixed costs like art (most of the cards are custom caricatures of Lee), this is the minimum level to make the game happen.\n$20,000: Custom meeple\nThe \"first player\" meeple in KLG denotes who gets first pick of cards and deal-making opportunities each round. If we get $20,000 in pledges, we will have a custom meeple made that is an embarrassing caricature of Lee Garvin. My personal preference would be him looking like an out-of-shape Bane (admit it, he's meeple-shaped), but if we reach this goal, Lee will be browbeaten into supplying some pictures and people can vote on their favorite in the comments section.\n$35,000: Quality upgrade \nThe base level of the project turns a profit, but is a short run game and much of the cost is the artwork and the higher cost per game for short run printing. The $35,000 level is the minimum for getting a large print run from China. The lower cost per unit means we can upgrade the quality of everything. Cards, box, tray liner, rules, the works.\nIt's a big jump from $15,000 to $35,000, but depending on the printer I'm pretty sure we will be able to get a useful \"printed in China\" price for some level of pledges north of $15k but less than $35k. We are going to provide the best quality available for whatever level of pledges we do get, but this stretch goal guarantees we can go for the best. You're spending $25 on the game, we want it to look and feel like a good value for the money (in addition to repeat play value for the money).\n$50,000: Organ tokens. Instead of the normal colored bits that are the health tokens, we will spring for the cost of custom blue brain, green lung and red heart tokens to represent Lee's health.\nLaser-guided Chainsaw Add-on!\nOne of Lee's game designs is a cheesy little non-collectable card game called Badass Zombie Killers (or BZK), where the game is about preparing for the zombie apocalypse, having the coolest and most vicious gear, and the game ends when the zombies actually show up. You can download an image of the rules cards from this link.\nNow, unlike Lee who is living in his car in Colorado, the irony is that the remaining stock of BZK actually has a roof over its head in Virginia, close enough to where I am to go get them. So, if you've every wanted a copy of BZK and saw that it is out of stock on Amazon and ThinkGeek, this is your way to get one. So, with the cooperation of Reality Cheque and Skortch'd Urf, this game of prepper one-upmanship can now be yours! Just add $17 to your (US-only) pledge for KLG and we will ship them both at the same time. The $17 covers the BZK and the extra cost for shipping, since we will have to go from a First Class 12oz box to a flat rate Priority Mail box.\nHobo Capitalism Add-On!\nMatt Vancil suggested something to Lee after the \"hobo knife\" picture was posted in Update #23, and the following is entirely Lee's doing. I claim no credit for it. There is now a \"Hobo Capitalism\" add-on in this campaign. For US$10, a US backer will get an official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 (as seen in Update #23), an autographed picture of Lee holding a knife that is probably not yours (much nicer than the picture below but no guarantee he will look any more sane), and in a hat-tip to Munchkin, a special rule for Badass Zombie Killers that can only be utilized by the rightful owner of said knife. This add-on price includes postage in the US. So, you can add this to any game pledge and it will be sent to you directly from Lee's high-tech manufacturing facility, which will probably be the front seat of his 2008 Saturn.\nThe official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 has a number of unique features*. It can be smuggled through metal detectors! Each one is hand-crafted by Lee himself and will have its own unique character. It has trace amounts of Lee's DNA in case you need to leave it at a crime scene to confuse the forensic team. And in an emergency it can be disassembled to give you several feet of duct tape.\n*Due to variances in the manufacturing process, the ability of the Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 to cut anything tougher than a McDonalds pancake is not guaranteed. This product not endorsed by the SHA (Stabby Hobo Association).\nAnd here, for the second time anywhere! The tentative official Badass Zombie Killers Hobo Knife\u2122 Rule \nIf you have an authentic Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 in your possession, you may do the following once per game. Discard 4 Badassery worth of Weapon cards or Modifier cards from your hand (that is, the total Badassery value or bonus of the cards must add up to at least positive 4) into the Dumpster. Whip out your Hobo Knife\u2122 and Shank one opponent's character.  \nTo Shank, you must choose one of that character's special abilities, and place the blade of the Hobo Knife\u2122 so that it covers it completely. That ability is not available for use for as long as the blade remains lodged in the character (until dislodged by a special effect). At the end of the game, the Hobo Knife\u2122 is returned to its owner. Don't make them come over there.\nShipping\nGames will be shipped in the US by First Class or Priority Mail (depending on whether they top 12 ounces with the stretch goals), and tracking numbers will be available.  \nSame as USA, just a little more expensive. \nEU-bound games will ship from the EU to avoid Customs charges and will go via regular mail within the EU.  \nAustralia-bound games will depend on the level of funding. At the low end they will be shipped via an intermediary service, while if we get into stretch goal territory we can probably use a normal fulfillment center. \nIf you are backing this project from Mars, we will arrange to have your package put on the next available manned flight (losing the entire shipment we shoehorned into the Schiaparelli lander soured us on automated interplanetary delivery options). Kickstarter does not have Mars in their system so contact us privately for shipping cost. Due to Customs restrictions, we cannot ship to the Moon or other planets at this time. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter (third if you count collaborations), and the fourth that Lee has started or been a collaborator on, so while we are not \"veterans\", we have some experience with the process. But this one has the potential to be significantly bigger than previous ones. The project goal is modest and will turn a profit that can go to help Lee, but if it exceeds its goals by a lot, then the scaling goes from \"domestic short run printing\" to \"seafreight container from China\", and from \"local pack & ship\" to \"hire a fullfillment service\". The numbers have been run for both cases and work out, and give sufficient wiggle room for stretch goals. However, I do want to avoid \"stretch goal creep\", since I've seen over-promising on other projects, and overly ambitious stretch goals also cause significant production delays.\n\nFortunately, I have a friend in the gaming industry (Mark Walker of Flying Pig Games (look his projects up)) who is both local and has significant experience with Chinese printers and domestic and international fulfillment operations. So in the unlikely event this explodes like kittens, I'm sure there will be headaches, but the headaches will be manageable. And if worst comes to worst, I can always blame it on Lee... (Lee: Hey!)\n\nThe timeframe from \"end of Kickstarter\" to \"game in your hands\" is going to vary based on how successful it is. The moment the minimum threshold is reached, the art will be contracted and the artist is ready to go on it. If it reaches a \"China production\" threshold, we have several possible suppliers and will have to choose one, and if we hit the top tier for custom game pieces, this will probably add a little to the production time as well. Of course, if we hit these thresholds with time to spare it means we can get them underway even before the campaign ends. One thing that will be a delay at the high end is that seafreight will take about a month, compared to domestic short-run printing that would take a few weeks from printing to delivery. My best guess at this point is \"on time or sooner\" for a barely funded campaign to \"a month or two late\" for one with all the stretch goals, but the benefit of the latter is a much nicer looking product (and more money going towards Lee's medical bills). The listed delivery date is an intermediate value, and if you have funded other campaigns you know how that goes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Nice guy", "descp": "You just want to help out, because you're a nice guy.

BUT there were no resources specifically made for kids. Lindsay is changing that with QUEER KID STUFF.\nWhat is QUEER KID STUFF?\nQUEER KID STUFF imagines a kinder and more equal future through highly-accessible, educational entertainment for all ages. Hosted by a tie-wearing queer human, Lindsay Amer, and their non-binary best-stuffed friend, Teddy, it\u2019s Mr. Rodgers\u2019 Neighborhood meets Gender Studies 101!\nQueer representation and content for children is scarce and QUEER KID STUFF aims to eliminate stigma by educating future generations through videos. QUEER KID STUFF allows young people to have access to a queer resource that is specifically made for them. Parents, teachers and LGBTQ+ adults can use the video as a tool to help them explain queerness to the kids in their lives; recommended for all ages (grown up too)! \nWHY DOES QKS NEED THE FUNDING?\nTeddy and I are making our last two seasons of QUEER KID STUFF and we need your help! We realize the value and potential of QUEER KIDS STUFF and want our final seasons to be the best they can be. With your help, our episodes will be higher quality; we can pay our crew, dedicate more time to each episode, and pay our awesome special guests. Running a webseries is time-consuming and expensive, we want to keep making great content for teachers, kids, and parents but we can\u2019t do it without you!\nWHO DOES QKS PARTNER WITH? \nTeddy and I have collaborated with a handful of LGBTQ+ influencers and organizations. Here are a few highlights <3\nWho is part of Queer Kid Stuff Team?\nLindsay Amer - Creator, Writer, Editor, and Host \nLindsay Amer is a queer activist, artist, and storyteller. They obtained their BS from Northwestern University in theater and gender studies and their MA from Queen Mary University of London for theatre and performance studies. They were named a Rising Star by GLAAD, are a Webby Award Honoree, and have been recognized by HuffPost, Teen Vogue, Refinery29, and Kidscreen for their work. They also serve as co-founder and artistic associate of Bluelaces Theater Company, making multi-sensory theatrical experiences for people with autism and other developmental differences in New York. When they\u2019re not taking down the patriarchy, they\u2019re probably roaming around Brooklyn with their uke, their incredible partner, and their new puppy! Follow their shenanigans on twitter and instagram @lindzamer\nHannah Rimm - Director \nHannah Rimm is a writer, photographer, and filmmaker in NYC. Her work has appeared across the internet, in publications such as Bustle, Autostraddle, and Allure. When she isn\u2019t directing Queer Kid Stuff she can be found hanging on a trapeze, talking loudly about feminism, and hunting for the perfect fried chicken sandwich. Also, she is very gay.\nMeghan McCarter - Make Up Artist/Stylist \nMeghan is an advocate for inclusive education through the dissolution of barriers-to-entry at all levels. This begins with community-based action that equips educators, parents, and students with the tools they need when they need them, without precondition. Mostly she does that by making Lindsay look really handsome on a semi-monthly basis but, when she's not doling out fleek brows, she also tutors primary and secondary school students and runs a weekly queer-oriented drink & draw in Bushwick.\nEmmie Finkle - Production Designer \nEmmie Finckel is a New York based scenic and properties designer specializing in new work and immersive/sensory design.

Recent acting credits include: Old Names for Wildflowers (The Tank), Double Falsehood (Letter of Marque), Revelations (NYWinterFest), SHE: A Choreoplay (HERE Arts), HVMLET (SheNYC), Hand To God (Kitchen Theatre Company), Out There! (Bluelaces Theater Company), and Battle of Central Park (The Tank).

They have been lucky enough to work on interviews for the Guggenheim Museum, 2016 Democratic National Convention and even Jimmy Buffet's latest CD Buried Treasure. Narrative films are still their true love, especially projects focused on the LGBTQ community. Their latest projects include a fantasy short about a women who grows a beard in a Hasidic Jewish community, a webseries about 20- somethings with D-list superpowers, and a documentary focused on trans people navigating life in 'Trump's America'.

When we shared a demo of our early work (well, hobby) on Imgur and Reddit, the community response was so positive and energizing that we decided we should commit full-time. The footage you see in the video above is the result of our preliminary work, and we're dying to dig in and upgrade literally every feature you see. This Kickstarter, we're asking you to join us to help make truly fine and fun augmented reality & dragons.\nFresh and warm, straight from the egg\nTo bring augmented monsters and heroes to life, we\u2019re using token-based augmented reality. Each token you place and move around your table is transformed into beautifully animated creatures and cravens (or heroes, if you're the sort). In the final version, the QR-coded cards from the demo will be replaced with polished, professional tokens that add to your tabletop roleplaying experience.\nYour one-inch tokens will come in four varieties: print-and-cut, grayboard, ceramic, and engraved wood. To move your characters and beasties through space, you simply move the tokens through a scalable grid that AR&D will generate for you.\nPrototype ceramic tokens\nPrototype wooden inlay tokens\nHero breeding and cultivation is perhaps the best part of tabletop RPGs. Our first core feature is a comprehensive character creator. From within AR&D you'll be able to summon and customize exactly the right hero for your adventure, stick him on a token, and bring him to animated, living-and-breathing augmented life. Want an Elven archer, an Orc cleric, or a Half-demon barbarian? Pick what speaks to you, gear them up, and make them kiss we mean take them on adventures.\nA mockup of the character creator\nAR&D will let you choose from the classic mythological races like Human*, Orc, Elf, Demon-touched, Dwarf, Lizardman, Halfling, Half-giant, and Gnome. Regardless of which you choose, you can customize their natural variations, put them in clown makeup, and select from epic sets of armor and gear to complete the ensemble. (*mythical human, naturally).\nYour new character, ready to murder hobo his way into infamy\nWithin AR&D will be your very own monster farm. Summon up mesmerizing art and captivatingly sculpted monsters that can breathe fire, fly, burrow, and generally end your player characters' dreams. Most of our next months will be dedicated to building up armies of Very Bad Dudes for all of us to play with. On first pass, there will be 25 unique, animated, resizable monsters ready at launch, with more if we hit our stretch goals or find ways to extend out the day/night cycle.\nTo make the library of baddies truly endless, other stretch goals will make it possible for you to upload 3D files you create or find on your own. You could 3D scan yourself and be your own character class! One of us already turned himself into a playable lvl 13 Coward, complete with wooden cart, cabbages, and despair. It\u2019s a prestige class for Peasant, in case you'd like to roll one yourself.\nTo build the best version of AR&D that we can, we'll need you. While we've already had a ton of fun playing around with early versions, we want your help in making a lasting, rich, and robust play experience. As we finish up testable chunks of design, we'll be counting on you to play with us. Long before the final version is issued, your job will be to tell us all the ways in which it breaks, or better yet all the ways in which we can make it shine.\nOur stretch goals will help define how far you all want us to push AR&D. The more bells we ring, the better AR&D will be on release. Also the louder the bells will be.\nWe'll add the ability for you to upload any 3D file you create or download for use in your games. You can share models with friends, scan yourself, or we'll point you in the direction of some open-source libraries to dive into. By making it possible to use your own files, you'll have limitless flexibility in bringing your campaigns to life.\nWith the shared tabletop feature, you can remotely see and interact with the same table your friends are using. You could move your character behind cover in Vermont and your friends in Texas would see it happen right in front of them. You'll have to trust your DM that the Gorgon really was staring your escort in the face the whole time.\nWe'll create a fully integrated character sheet for you to use in-game. Update your stats live as you play and save your sheet session-to-session, character-to-character.\nCombat Assistant lets you toggle displays to track hit points and initiative for each character on the map. He won't *actually* assist you in combat, but at least he'll helpfully tell you how badly you're doing (or, if your DM is a pushover, that you're still alive and fully en-limbed).\nWe'll double our library of animated monsters and beasts. Rampaging LG Unicorns, here we come!\nOur milestones for this Kickstarter are already quite ambitious, so we'll only unlock further stretch goals if we hit all of our first targets.\nWe love Kickstarter, and we love the enthusiasm Kickstarter backers bring to a project. We need a big community of vocal RPG fans to help propel this project forward.\nSome of you may wonder why the funding threshold is set so high. Well, we have huge plans for AR&D, and we're setting ourselves on a course for the next year and a half. We want to make something enduring and worthy of your support. To complete a project that lives up to our hopes and dreams will take everything we've got; half-way simply won't do.\nElder Labs was started by Dan, one of the cofounders of Elderwood Academy. We've always been passionate about fantasy tabletop gaming, and when we first saw augmented reality in action our hearts stopped.

First, we need to build a product that is seamlessly fun to use while playing tabletop RPGs. While we love playing with the demo, we're certain there are extensive opportunities to make it more fun for everyone.\n\nSecond, we're basically trying to create an MMORPG's worth of digital assets from the ground up, to be optimized for iOS and Android and serve you the most attractive digital garden of animated monsters and heroes ever. We've lined up everything we need to get it done, but it's no mean feat, and half done will probably mean undone.

But your friends took a peek and now they all want to grow their own god. You\u2019ve got your trusty twelve-gauge handy to blast a tentacle here and there and make sure your creature grows to completion first. To do otherwise would be madness!\n  Building An Elder God is a fast-playing card game of Lovecraftian construction for 2-5 players ages 8 and up. The rules are easy to learn and a typical game takes from 15-30 minutes, depending on the number of players. Build a Cthulhu-esque tentacled monstrosity to completion before the other players, using damage cards to blast your opponents\u2019 creatures (and slow down their progress) in order to win! There are 115 standard cards in the set, plus 10 Necronomicon pieces. A full-color rulebook is included.\nGameplay: Draw a card, play a card. You either choose a tentacle card to grow or heal your own beast, or play a damage card to blast off the tentacle of an opponent's monster. The Necronomicon and Elder Sign pieces provide additional options to heal yourself or punish your foes!\nThe game is complete, and in fact sold through its first printing a few years ago! We're running this crowdfunding campaign to bring Building An Elder God back to gamer shelves and into stores while making a higher-quality product the second go-around.\nWhat's Changed? We are making sure the stock and coating will make the cards sturdy yet easy to handle and shuffle right out of the box. The Head and Body cards now have alternate sides so that everyone's monster can look unique at the table. The Necronomicon pieces are now punch-out cardstock rather than cards the players are expected to cut themselves. And we've done a light rewrite of the rules for clarity and are printing them in full color.\n  Building An Elder God got a shout-out as Best Kids Game of 2011 in episode #239 of The Dice Tower podcast by Chris of The Secret Cabal. Hear the episode by clicking here (our mention is in the last seven minutes of the episode).

In addition I have run three Kickstarter campaigns in the past\u2014all funded, and all shipped out the primary rewards to backers. But I discovered how easy it can be to underestimate the time and expense necessary to deliver stretch goals and secondary rewards. It's important to avoid those pitfalls, so I'm implementing the following for this campaign:\n\nSimplicity: It's tempting to chase a high-dollar total by adding lots of stretch goals and extra rewards. Being a one-man company working with a talented-but-busy freelance artist, I'm going to keep the focus on the core game. We may add a few stretch goals but they will likely be digital rewards or improvements to the core product.\n\nTransparency: I'm separating the funds from this crowdfunding campaign in a separate account, and will create a backer-accessible spreadsheet that shows each expenditure and explains what the funds are being used for. This will remain live until all rewards have been shipped.\n\nThe only delays to delivery I can foresee would include unexpected hold-ups from the printer, overseas shipping, or delay in customs when the product enters the United States. We've built-in some time to help account for those and give us enough resources to get things shipped to our backers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jamie Chambers\n5 created \u00b7 137 backed\nJamie Chambers is an award-winning, best-selling tabletop game designer with nearly two decades of publishing experience.

To say thank you, we're sending everyone who backed this Kickstarter a PDF copy of Dinner and Dice: A Gaming Cookbook. Thanks for sticking with us and helping us spread the word!\nWe love this design but it's pretty clear the market will not support manufacture at this point. Really, we're saving our company a lot of money by not setting it up for manufacturing. In the end, that's what Kickstarter is all about.\nWill we try again? \"Never say never,\" right? But we don't think so. We have other design ideas we want to implement and plan to move forward on those. Stay tuned for our latest designs by signing up for our e-newsletter at www.carolinagametables.com \nAre you late to the campaign and dying to have a Cabinet Game Table of your own? Email info@carolinagametables.com. No promises. But we'll see what we can do.\nWhat about the other game tables? Yes, we *definitely* still do those! We started this company by Kickstarting the Dining Game Table in 2015 and we have several designs. Go to www.carolinagametables.com for our full catalog.\nThe Finished Product: a Cabinet Game Table, with table attached!\nPhoto from the factory floor: a Cabinet Game Table in Cherry finish!\n  Want to upgrade your game storage from merely functional to multi-functional? From bearable to beautiful? From disposable to indispensable? \nThat's why we designed the Cabinet Game Table!\nIt\u2019s a Game Cabinet\nThe storage is specifically for games. Shelves designed to hold game boxes on their edge for easier access. Six smaller drawers for dice, cards, and other accessories. A bookshelf for game books (such as RPGs) up to 11\u201d tall\u2014with extra depth so the spines are protected in the interior. Two larger drawers for anything too big for the smaller ones. And double doors on the bottom open to large storage spaces for bigger games.  \nIt\u2019s a Table\nThe leaves of the table stow away on the sides of the cabinet. The trim on the front converts to the legs and a support stretcher between them for maximum support and stability. Simply connect the leaves, attach the legs, and fasten to the Cabinet to transform it to a three person table.\nIt\u2019s a Game Table\nAnd when you want to play a game, the top is reversible. The flip side has a one inch lip to keep dice and game pieces on the table. The 29.75\u201d x 40.5\u201d fabric\u2013lined play area has enough room to handle a 24\u201d x 36\u201d game board with space to spare.\n                     $3099 YOUR CHOICE Cabinet Game Table\nOne Cabinet Game Table stained with the finish you want and upholstered with the fabric you want (from our selection of Options, see below). See Delivery below. Retail price after the Kickstarter is $3199.\n$2999 CHERRY + BLUE Cabinet Game Table\nOur most popular combination for game tables is Cherry finish and Dark Blue fabric, and we predict it'll be the same for Cabinet Game Table orders! That's why we're offering this package at an additional discount. This reward level is for one Cabinet Game Table in Cherry and Dark Blue. See Delivery below. Retail price after the Kickstarter is $3199.\n$2999 EARLY BIRD YOUR CHOICE Cabinet Game Table\nShop early and save! The first ten backers can choose their finish and fabric (from our selection of Options, see below) at a discounted rate. See Delivery below. Retail price after the Kickstarter is $3199.\n$25 Carolina Game Tables Coasters!\nWe appreciate your willingness to help our campaign! Pledges at this reward level receive a set of 6 leather coasters imprinted with our logo. Kickstarter will prompt you to add shipping before confirming your pledge. \n$2 Stay Connected!\nPledge at this level to stay updated, then please share the Kickstarter using the links above! We have a Social Media stretch goal which should get you a little something as thanks!\nAny \"Your Choice\" Cabinet reward level allows you to choose from the following colors of stain and fabric. You will let us know about your choice in a survey after the Kickstarter. For more about the Indonesian mahogany and velveteen fabric used, see Construction below. \nYou can see a variety of finish and fabric combinations on actual tables in real customer's homes on our website!\n$25 A Set of Our Coasters\nWant a set of Coasters with your Cabinet? We can do that! Add $25 to the current total of your pledge. \nWhy No Option to \"Add-On\" a Game Table?\nOur website does a much better job of handling all the purchase options that go into ordering a Carolina Game Table than this Kickstarter ever could. Please check out the payment options and designs on our websie (see quick links below), and feel free to ask any questions here or email us privately at info@carolinagametables.com. \nRemember, all our designs include a table top in the price!\nBut the main reason we can't offer other tables as add-ons is the whole reason this Kickstarter exists: To determine if there are enough people interested in this design! If we meet our Kickstarter goal without other tables added to the total, we know the Cabinet Game Table design is marketable and sustainable.\nClick here to read more about the Coffee Game Table on our website!\n  Click here to read more about the Kitchen Game Table on our website!\n  Click here to read more about the Dining Game Table on our website!\n  Click here to read more about the Streamer Game Table on our website!\n  Click here to read more about the Tablezilla Game Table on our website!\n  Click here to read more about our Chairs and Side Tables/Benches on our website!\n  We are not collecting payment for delivery during this Kickstarter. \nDelivery will be billed at a later date (target May 2018). \nThere are three options for shipping the Cabinet Game Table. You do not need to tell us which you want until your order is complete!\nWhite Glove Delivery\n\u201cWhite glove delivery\u201d means your package never touches a forklift. They deliver to your residence and bring it to the room where you want it. They unpack your order (trust us, we\u2019ve done that ourselves more than a few times, and you don\u2019t want to!) and put it together. They then remove all the packing material before they leave. \nEstimate White Glove Delivery prices to your area by going to our Calculator here. You'll also be able to test the rates for delivery of our Game Tables, Chairs, and Side Tables/Benches. You'll see for yourself how much you can save on shipping overall by ordering the Carolina Game Table of your dreams, plus matching Chairs and Benches, to go with that sweet Cabinet Game Table!\nFreight Delivery\nIf you're ordering multiple pieces for a game store or other business location, this may be the best option for you. We'll work with you to provide an estimate.\nPick Up from Hickory, NC\nOur showroom for Carolina Game Tables is in Hickory, NC! We can have the factory deliver your order to us for you to pick up. We'll work with you to arrange a day and time to pick up your order. There is NO COST for this service (we love to meet our customers!), but you need a vehicle large enough to accommodate the boxed item and enough people to move it. We're not getting any younger. :)\n  Carolina Game Tables, owned and operated by Clint and Jodi Black, continues a family tradition going on three generation of furniture manufacturing. You may also meet our daughters (gen 4!) at a convention sometime. Those building and shipping our beautiful furniture are contracted to do so, which keeps our costs low and the prices of our tables low as well. These are not made in someone\u2019s garage or during weekend hours\u2014we \u201cshare time\u201d with other companies in a professional furniture manufacture facility using the latest tools through our special agreement.  \nJodi and Clint Black with their daughters at the Carolina Game Tables showroom\n  We also make games to play on our beautiful gaming furniture.  Jodi is Pinnacle Entertainment Group COO and Managing Editor. Clint is Savage Worlds Brand Manager and the Rules Guru for all of the amazing products we create at Pinnacle. Savage Worlds is an award-winning tabletop roleplaying game (we hope you\u2019ve heard of it!) created by our good friend Shane Lacy Hensley. Our most recent Kickstarter for Pinnacle was the Doomtown Reloaded card game. Check out Pinnacle at www.peginc.com.\nCarolina Game Tables are built with a frame of solid Indonesian mahogany: the legs, edges, sides, and trim are all solid hardwood, stained with one of four finish colors (see Options, above). The play area under the fabric is plywood and the fabric is glued on, wrapped around, and bolted up into the frame. This means you can drill through any part of the fabric to add DIY lights or other electrical embellishments (and we don't need to add the costs for UL certification). \nThe Cabinet Game Table is made from the same Indonesian mahogany. In places where solid mahogany isn't feasible or necessary, plywood and/or MDF are used with a mahogany veneer. The same stains are used so it matches your Carolina Game Table, Chairs, and Side Tables/Benches. \nPhysical assembly of our Game Tables and the Cabinet Game Table uses screws, nuts and bolts, glue, and mortise/tenon construction. \nYou won't need to do any of that, though! This render shows how the Cabinet will assemble in your home: the top piece fits into the bottom. You'd also insert the drawers. Finally, the shelves behind the glass doors are adjustable. And really, we recommend you let White Glove Delivery do everything.\nStain-Resistant Heavy Duty Fabric  \nWe use hardy commercial grade velveteen and glue it to the plywood used in the play area. The velveteen is the kind hotel lobbies use for durability and ease of cleaning. It\u2019s completely synthetic and there is no padding underneath to trap and hold odors. The fabric is rated \u201cW\u201d for water-based cleaners only. You don\u2019t need to buy any special dry cleaning agents or pool table \u201cfelt cleaner\u201d and in fact, should never use them! Just make sure your household cleaner doesn't have bleach. :)\nFinish  \nThe factory uses mahogany to build the table, but the surface you touch is actually a polyurethane lacquer sealing the finish color. To clean the wood of your table or Cabinet, simply use a no-wax dusting spray. We also recommend you protect your table top by using tablecloths, placemats, or coasters to make it last a long time.  \nRemember this is a fine piece of furniture! Treat it how your grandmother treated her nice dining room table. \nIf there's a single theme to what we hear about our company, it's that people appreciate our customer service. That's flattering, but we're just gamers, treating gamers how we want to be treated!\nWhat we hear the most is our tables are well made and versatile. We're honored people see that. Here's where Clint's many years in the furniture manufacturing industry pay off. We're not making the cheapest game tables, but we're not \"bespoke\" either. We're aiming for \"Game Tables for Real Life\"\u2014one piece that serves just as well as a fine dining room table (or Cabinet!), as it does a game table. \nRead our Facebook reviews here.\nRead our Google reviews here (we just launched that page). \nHere are other reviews on our website. \nAnd a few random others...\n     \u201cI don\u2019t always game on a mahogany table custom-crafted for a tabletop enthusiast\u2019s unique needs by the folks who make Deadlands and Savage Worlds.

But it's not just her story... it's mine, and yours, and the story of millions of Americans who struggle with mental illness and its devastating effects on our lives. You are not alone. \nMichelle White grew up an only child, the offspring of drug-addicted parents. \nBut slowly at first, and intensely at the end, Michelle and her family were overcome by a potent mix of genetic and environmental factors as her bipolar disorder intensified and eventually cost Michelle her life.\nWe've seen Michelle's story repeated in various forms throughout our lives; a healthy, happy person, brought low by mental illness, addiction, and the failures of the American mental health system.\nHer story ended in tragedy, but millions of others don't have to. We're hoping that, by making this documentary as raw and unflinching as possible, we will stir discussion and encourage those who are struggling with any aspect of mental illness, in themselves or in the people they love. Michelle\u2019s story serves as a learning ground for how to effectively confront stigmas that surround diseases of the mind. \nMichelle and her husband Randall created an intense life together, living fast while contributing to their community. Shortly after their daughter Charlotte was born, Michelle\u2019s mental illness kicked into high gear. Doing what he could to deal with the actions and decisions that come with a partner experiencing brain meltdowns, Randall began documenting their life on his video camera.\nIn early 2017 Randall approached Jason about doing something to honor Michelle's legacy. He had countless hours of footage, recordings, and audio of his wife's breakdown; from the early stages to the final steps, but needed the help of an experienced filmmaker to turn the raw footage into a complete story. \nJason is currently editing the archival footage from Michelle's final few years, attempting to make sense of both her senseless death and the life she lived so vividly. However, in order to best tell the story, we need to find more context for her life. We need to travel to her home town and interview her family, her friends, we need to understand how she reached the final stage where she felt suicide was the only option left to her. We need to acquire additional interviews to cut together with the footage of her life. \nOur goals are to edit the footage of her life, shoot additional interviews and footage, and edit these together into a compelling documentary that both honors Michelle's legacy and shines a light into the darkness for others to follow. \nThis is a unique and personal story for our team. Kickstarter not only helps us fund the significant costs associated with post-production, but your support gives us the freedom to tell the story the way it should be told, without the kinds of compromise that come with television deals and traditional documentary financing. \nSuccessfully completing this campaign allows us to finish editing the film, submit to festivals, and get the story out to the public. These funds are first for additional interviews, which include hiring a qualified documentary crew, renting quality gear, and travel to interview subjects. Additionally, the raw footage and the final edit will need significant color correction and sound design. \n\"A Song for Michelle\" will be submitted to festivals worldwide in hopes of bringing awareness and attention to the prevalence of mental illness and how it's treated\u2014or, more often, not treated\u2014here in the United States. It is our primary hope to reach out and let people know they are not alone, they are not isolated and forgotten, and that there are millions of us working to find hope and help. \nLosing someone you love to suicide is one of the worst forms of torture a person can endure. Randall White had already lost his brother and best friend to suicide before Michelle took her own life. This film has the potential to help millions of other people know they are not alone in their struggles by getting to know the beautiful person that Michelle White was.  \nI almost turned this project down. My friends and loved ones begged me not to do it. \nYou see, I was still recovering from a life-threatening head wound I had suffered at the hands of a loved one with mental illness. I had brain trauma and I was in a bad place. I was broken, physically and emotionally. I had been sleeping on the floor at a friend's house, waking to a pillow stained with blood and dried tears. \nIn the first couple of months I struggled to even write my own name, or remember basic life functions, without blinding headaches overtaking me; a year out, how could I possibly be in a place psychologically and emotionally where I could tackle this subject matter? How could I make this film? \nThe answer was simple: I had to. Having lived it firsthand, I was in a unique place: I'm not only a successful filmmaker, but I have first-hand experience living with loved ones who struggle with mental illness, and seeing the devastating effects it can have on a family. I felt an overwhelming obligation to tell this story, to reach out to others who, like me, loved someone who was suffering, or were suffering themselves. \nI wanted to reach out and tell them it's okay, you can survive this, you can overcome, please, please don't give up. I wanted to reach out to each person and hug them, to whisper in their ears \u201cFight... don't give up.\u201d And I know, no matter the risk, I have to make this film. \nThanks for your support! While the majority of your pledge will go straight into production, we also want to thank you by offering the following rewards at each pledge level.\nTIP JAR \u2013 Thanks for your support!

Here's the breakdown:\nWe're filmmakers, not fulfillment experts, so we're leaving this process TO the experts.\nWe'll handle pledge management in BackerKit, the industry leader in post-campaign backer care\nWe plan to fulfill via Ship Naked, which integrates directly with BackerKit.\nDIGITAL FULFILLMENT\nDigital downloads of the documentary and lecture series will be fulfilled via Vimeo-on-Demand. Remaining digital downloads will be fulfilled via the \"Downloads\" tab in BackerKit.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING\nMost parcels will ship by USPS First Class. The cost of domestic shipping is included in your pledge level.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nParcels will ship from Ship Naked warehouses in the United States, marked with the retail value of your items. We cannot mark items as gifts or commercial samples, but generally DVDs with a retail value of $20 or under are not held up by customs in the EU.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, but not our first movie. Jason and his team have delivered numerous successful films and know what it takes to complete a challenging movie.\n\nThis project has unique challenges, including the sheer volume of footage, the emotional weight inherent in the footage, and the absolute necessity of getting it right. Michelle's story deserves to be told with respect and courage. All of these challenges are not insurmountable, but they represent intellectually and emotionally difficult work. As such, we've given ourselves a two-year timeline to complete and deliver this project. While it likely won't take so long, we don't want to race the clock when sensitivity to the subject matter is so important.\n\nOnce the project is complete, delivery should be as simple as working with BackerKit and Ship Naked to issue surveys and ship rewards. DVDs and t-shirts will ship from the manufacturer directly to the fulfillment center in order to keep the process simple.

We are all connected in countless online ways, the tabletop gaming market has finally broken through the $1 billion ceiling, and the most invested type of project on Kickstarter are board games. Feels like a golden age of games, doesn\u2019t it?\nBut with all those social-networks and event discovery platforms, and with all those classic and hundreds of new games coming out every year, we still don\u2019t have a simple online environment dedicated to nothing else but finding great games and local people to play them with.\n  Whether it\u2019s Chess, Poker or Settlers of Catan, Bridge or Bloodrage, Pandemic or Magic the Gathering, whether you are looking to try a new game or host your own classic one, we decided to develop the PlayPals app as a simple solution for:\nConnecting with local people in your area for a playful get-together.\nDiscovering and Joining board games, card games, dice games, role-playing, etc\u2026\nCreating and Hosting your own game event. \nFinding new players for your game group.\nLearning to play new games before buying them.\nSaving your neighbors from another lonely evening of Seinfeld re-runs :)\nAnd much more\u2026  \n       PlayPals Beta version is already in the app stores and you can try it out right now in the links at the bottom of this page. \nBut first, check out the results and comments we got from the three weeks soft-launch we did in Vancouver, Canada two months ago:\n   Click to view the in-app three weeks soft-launch results: \nPLAY\n\n    Unlike other projects in Kickstarter (which are usually pre-development), we already invested the time and money to develop the first version of PlayPals. It wasn\u2019t cheap, quick or easy, but the app is already in the app stores and is completely free for use.  \nTo understand the market and community better, we also decided to test it in Vancouver, which required us to reach out to thousands of local board gamers through extensive online advertising, countless chats, many events and meetups, and more than a few fun games. During this test, we also made sure to connect and personally meet with most of the friendly game store owners in the Vancouver area, and hear their comments and suggestions.  \nAnd guess what?! The test in Vancouver was a great success. We got great comments and suggestions, and even got requests from people all over North America (and as far as Italy) that we launch their city next. From our talks with the users, we also learned a lot about all the features and functionality that are still needed to make PlayPals a fully developed platform the board gaming community deserves.  \nAll those development and marketing activities are going to cost more than we can afford personally. We already invested in the first chapter, and we now need your help in writing the next one.  \nSo, bottom line is, to develop PlayPals' next mobile and web versions, to keep it completely free for use for all us board gamers, as well as to be able to launch it in more cities and countries, we need a minimum of $80,000 USD for:\n\u2022 Online Marketing & Advertising  \n\u2022 Data and Third-Party App Services  \n\u2022 Development & Testing of new versions  \n\u2022 Local Launch Activities and Events across the US, Canada and Europe  \n\u2022 Outsource & Experts Help  \n\u2022 Media Production  \nNote:  \nAs we a have a combined 36 years of professional experience in online marketing and platforms development, we are confident that our skills and experience will enable us to keep it all as efficient and cost effective as possible in today\u2019s expensive market (where the average cost of just one developer is $10,000 USD per month).\n.\n.\nWhat you get if we reach our goal:\nYou get to kickstart the first dedicated platform for Tabletop gamers, and the following rewards according to your investment level:\n           Check out the cool t-shirts we're giving out to almost all pledge levels:\n  PlayPals t shirt\n   What you get if we exceed our goal:\nAny funding beyond our goal will enable us to launch PlayPals in more cities and to introduce new options & capabilities we have planned in our \"Future Features\" deck:\n    So... \nWhether you are a casual player or a board game geek, an owner of a game store or bar, a game creator or a publisher - if you are interested in growing the tabletop gaming community into its rightful place in mainstream culture, then please join our quest and help us make PlayPals the best app it can be for all of us Tabletop gamers.\nThank you for your consideration. (and please share this project with friends who might like to join the quest).\n.\nIt all started a few years ago when I emigrated from Israel to Canada. As a new resident in Vancouver, I found a new and beautiful place to live and work, but I also discovered that contrary to my expectations, it wasn\u2019t easy making new friends and building my social circles.\nBeing active with many meetups and meetings for my consultation work definitely helped, and I got to know some good people and to make a few friends, but there was still something missing.  \nI wasn\u2019t looking for another date, meetup or music event, but for something different where I could actually get to know the people I was with. My social quest continued like that for a few years, that is, until I was invited to join a board game by a local friend who knew I used to play back in the day.\nAfter a few months of good games and great people to roll dice with (or rob resources from), it became apparent that I had found what I was looking for: a simple excuse to meet local people in a fun environment for a few hours.\nBut I'd also found out that there was no simple way to find those local games or people, and talking to my new playpals only confirmed it, there was no mobile app or web platform to do this one simple thing.\nI played with the idea of creating such an app for a few months, and when I was ready, I presented it to Guy, an old friend and an experienced online entrepreneur from Israel.  \nGuy listened to it all, realized why such an app could be useful in his own life, and immediately started to breakdown the necessary Development & Marketing steps for the next 6 months (as he often does :)  \nIt was obvious in that very moment, that this was something that needed to be done. So, we decided to dial back on our client work, to sacrifice some personal time, and to invest the needed funds to develop a beta version of PlayPals as a proof of concept.  \nSix months later, after many long days, nights and weekends brainstorming, outlining, defining features & functionality, designing the UI and UX, and working from two time zones with our app development team in the Ukraine - and here we are: with the app in the stores and the PlayPals\u2019 team ready & willing to take it to the next level.\n  To read about our current professional lives and our combined 36 years of skill & experience in online marketing, product development and all things startup, you can read all about us on our LinkedIn profiles:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ariksternberg \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/guysagie\n  PlayPals in the App Stores\nYou can download and try the PlayPals app right now (but if we haven\u2019t launched in your city yet, you probably will not see a lot of activity, yet).\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.play_pals&hl=en \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/playpals-discover-local-tabletop-game-events/id1207049719?mt=8\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe development of PlayPals\u2019 next version with the new features and functionality is a relatively straightforward process, not easy, but straightforward. \nThere may be delays (as there usually are), but since we already developed the current version and got great results and feedback, and since we have past experience creating and optimizing other types of online platforms and services - we are confident that we are able to provide you with what we promised: A fully developed platform for people who like tabletop games and people :)\n\nSo the biggest challenge for us, as it was for any successful \u2018Local Events Discovery Platform\u2019 that came before us, is to launch PlayPals in specific cities in the US, Canada and Europe, and to make sure that those locations become self-sustaining, with a consistent growth powered by the active local Tabletop communities, as well as by the countless occasional players out there.\n\nWhich is why we first tested PlayPals with a soft-launch in Vancouver a few weeks ago. A successful launch that taught us about the needed features and functionality for our next version, but more importantly, about the best ways to communicate and activate the many types of tabletop players in our community.\n\nSo even if one of us is crushed to death in a board-game landslide, we are confident that the rest of the team will make sure the dice keep on rolling and that everyone gets what they were promised.\n\nThank you for your trust in us, and let's bring PlayPals to all Tabletop gamers around the world!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Arik Sternberg\nFirst created \u00b7 10 backed"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 10 or more", "title": "\"PlayPals Backer\"", "descp": "Thanks so much for joining our little quest and helping us make PlayPals the app the board gaming community deserves.\nBy taking this pledge, you\u2019ll be the first to get development updates & news about your city launch.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 25 or more", "title": "\"PlayPals Patron\"", "descp": "With this level of investment, you become an essential part in transforming the PlayPals app into a fully developed platform.\nAs a \"PlayPals Patron\" you get:\n\u2022 The \"PlayPals Patron\" badge on your profile\n\u2022 To test and comment on new features before we release them.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 60 or more", "title": "\"Neighborhood Captain\"", "descp": "If you consider yourself a board-game geek, and believe (like we do), that it\u2019s about time we got our own dedicated platform for finding great games and local people to play them with -

Through the course of the episodes, she would learn about the different pitfalls, challenges and opportunities that come with living inside a video game. Each episode will average between 5-7 minutes in length, plus a 14 minute pilot which has already been shot.\nSerena the Healer\nTHE WORLD OF AFK  \nAFK is an ambitious adventure web series which has already screened a successful first season on national and international platforms. \u2018AFK\u2019 follows the adventures of gamers trapped inside their avatars\u2019 bodies in the world of an online video game. These disparate individuals are forced to work together in a new land with no rules, no game masters, and no respawns... only the fittest, fastest, strongest and most cunning will survive.\nThe diverse world of AFK\n  www.afkwebseries.com\nAFK: Lord of the Rings meets Battle Royale meets The Breakfast Club. \nAFK has action, adventure, witty dialogue, romance, and plenty of gaming references which are sure to put a smile on the faces of hardcore gamers - while still being accessible to a wider audience. It combines compelling drama with humour to explore the social issues that gamers face, and the way we shape our identities and communities online. Already one of New Zealand\u2019s most successful, award-winning web series, AFK has a passionate, engaged and growing audience hungry for more content.    \nSome of our many reviews\nSeason 2 of AFK has now been greenlit by NZ on Air and TVNZ, and will commence filming in early 2018. In the interim, we want to expand the world of AFK with a closer look at the adventures of one of the new characters who will appear in the second season...and our first look at what it means to live the life of a support class in the gaming world. \nCO-PRODUCTION with ZSOFI PICTURES\n'AFK: Serena's Journey' will be produced by Jonathan Zsofi and his talented team, while Epically Casual focuses on the production of AFK Season 2. As the Creator of such lush fantasies as 'Hadir and the Deep' and 'Te Makutu, The Curse', Jonathan will bring his strong visual style to the miniseries, while still ensuring it feels part of the larger world of AFK. \nJonathan Zsofi\n  A still from 'Hadir and the Deep', written and directed by Jonathan Zsofi\nCHARACTERS:  \nSERENA THE HEALER (Milly Kimberly Grant)  \nMilly Kimberly Grant\nSerena is a New Zealander, who has mysteriously arrived in the game about three weeks later than everyone else, and is therefore having to play catch up. As a healer with an unusual level of control over her magic, she finds herself viewed as a valuable resource by all manner of players, and must decide when to use her abilities and when to hold back. Ironically, she must risk her life every time she chooses to use her healing powers, which put a massive strain on her body. \n Serena is played by Milly Kimberly Grant, who is both an accomplished actor and performer. She has most recently appeared in the web series adaptation of the stage play \u2018The Factory\u2019 and is currently working on \u2018Shortland Street: The Musical\u2019  \nNEIL THE BARD\nAndy T. Tran\n Serena will be accompanied on her journey by Neil the Bard. In the real world, Neil is a geriatric veteran of the Korean war who is only in the game because his grandson set him up an account and gave him an Asian character as a joke. Raised on Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks, Neil fancies himself a bit of a charming rogue (even though he\u2019s playing a bard) and is immensely enjoying being in a younger body, although his incredibly non PC way of expressing himself (and bouts of dementia-related confusion) are an occasional inconvenience.   \nNeil will be played by gifted LA based actor Andy T. Tran. Andy was born and raised in Houston, TX, and his affinity for the arts came from his father, a gifted artist and musician. Andy's most recent TV roles include NCIS Los Angeles, Bones, The Last Ship, and Reckless.\nTogether, Serena and Neil will travel through a world where people are starting to come to terms with the fact that they will never return home, a world where the weak have already been weeded out, and only the strongest and most ruthless have survived...\nOur Thanks for Your Support\nWhat can we offer in return for your support?

The more funding we have, the more crew we can employee. A full budget makes the entire production easier for everyone involved, ensuring a smoother production process and a fantastic final product.\n\nMeeting our goal of $17k means we can produce \u2018AFK \u2013 Serena\u2019s Journey\u2019, and at a cost of approximately $500 per minute of footage (roughly, an hour or two of shooting), we will need to cut costs wherever possible. Rest assured, this won\u2019t affect the final product, but it means the entire team will need to make sacrifices - so join us, and help us make the best instalment of AFK ever!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Peter Haynes\n4 created \u00b7 6 backed\nPeter Haynes is a filmmaker based in Auckland, New Zealand, and director of the Award winning web series 'AFK'.

Currently the movie is mostly funded but making a push for our final funds. The team has already self invested over 150k, So we are very passionate about making this movie a possibility. So you can guarantee its going to be done right and finished and be engaging to watch. \nWith the funds we are trying to raise, we hope to use them for paying our resources, location fees, permitting, a production motorhome, housing for cast and crew, crafty and airline flights for our out of state talent. We aren't looking to you to help us with our whole movie, just some of it. \nAlso if we raise more money, we would love to pay our crew more than our indie rates, we would love a send Alexa mini to shoot on, and we would love to extend our shooting by two extra days. So anything helps us realize these goals.\nTHE STORY\nA Wiki-Leaks release illuminates the collusion amongst politicians and the medical industry that drives the cost of medical care to an unattainable price for the middle class. With the guilty parties' names and addresses being released, a vigilante movement springs up around the Untied States. After his father loses the battle with cancer, Mason, along with Thompson and Bobbi, seek violent justice and hope for riches along the way. A shotgun blast sparks a string of unintended consequences that leads the group down a dark road.\nSOCIAL RELEVANCE....\nThis movie packs a punch that goes straight to the breadbasket of our current healthcare system, or lack-thereof. As our country becomes more unhinged, we become more divided, and it feels like we are spiraling toward a civil war. What would that war look like? It wouldn\u2019t be states versus states. Somedays it feels like left versus right, others urban versus rural, many times neighbors versus neighbors, but usually the problems can be traced back to rich versus poor. The haves and have nots. No matter where you stand politically, most people agree, our Healthcare System has serious problems. Medical costs soar and doctors, medical insurance and pharmaceutical companies post record profits while many Americans don\u2019t have access to healthcare, and if they do it can still leave them in financial ruin. Something needs to change. With no agreeable path to resolution, a growing pension for violence, and a loved one\u2019s life on the line, how far will people go for justice, vengeance, for change? There is always unexpected collateral damage for revenge. \u201cWhoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.\u201d -Nietzsche\nTHE TALENT\nWe have spent soooo long casting for this movie between Seattle and Los Angeles. We feel like we nailed it. Everyone on board has had years of experience perfecting their craft and several are award winning actors. Sometimes you don't need A listers, this is the perfect example. Hell some of our actors might even become those A listers in the near future. Russell Hodgkinson, Rich Morris, Brian Sutherland, Amanda Viola, Anisha Adusumilli, as well as tons of others. We think they are all going to mesmerize you with their portrayal of the modern American. \nTHE LOOK\nWe are crafting a look very similar to Hell or High Water. Out in the high desert. A lot of this movie takes place on the road and we've spent a lot of time finding great locations and picking our color palettes meticulously. Will be shot to look very filmic using some post film grain options as well as the Arri Alexa and Anamorphic lenses. We've chosen our wardrobe and styling very carefully as well and we have a great production designer coming up from LA to help us create the world in which our characters live in.  \n          wardrobe tests\nTHE GEAR\nThanks to our partnership with Northwest Camera co, We will be utilizing the full arsenal of gear. So we are shooting this on the Arri Alexa mini, as well as Cooke anamorphics. We are going for that true western vibe. So cinemascope was the obvious choice. There will be drones, steadicam, chase cars, process trailers, etc. We are doing this right to make the visuals an extension of our powerful script.\nTHE DISTRIBUTION\nWe have already been in talks with several people about having our movie premiere at some very weighty festivals. This is based on who's attached to the script and really what its about. Its gonna be one of those movies that everyone is talking about.

Get your membership today!\n   Our social fabric is in chaos. Animosity and intolerance are on the rise. We're here to suggest a surprising form of resistance: MEDITATION.\nResist the system with us. What is the system? The sum total of our culture, social conditioning, economics, and politics. \nAwaken strikes at the heart of what this system depends on: perpetuating our illusion of separateness. When we meditate, we are rejecting the need for constant stimulation, detaching from consumerism. By contrast, we are cultivating a healthy, loving relationship with ourselves one that doesn\u2019t rely on what we own or how we look, but which is rooted in the simplicity of who we are, our inherent and fundamental goodness as human beings.\n   Awaken is a new kind of meditation app that will open your mind to see the person society has influenced you to be. Come be a part of the revolution. Inspired by Eastern philosophy, each audio-guided Awaken meditation digs into the heart of our real everyday lives, including our relationships, our habits, work, culture, and society. Each week, we will release 2-5 new practices that delve into classic themes and teachings, as well as current trends and subject matter, such as intense topics that reflect what is happening right now. Bringing mindfulness into all the facets of our everyday lives is an ongoing process of renewal. Our app will meet that need by refreshing and renewing on a timely basis to respond to peaceful ever-changing personal and societal needs.\nOur Practices Feature: \nClassic mindfulness meditation, \nContemplation with a journaling prompt,\nOpportunity to share your wisdom and connect with other members. \nOur Method is about exploring what's true for you and your own experience and connecting and sharing with others. With social media becoming more and more frivolous and superficial everyday, the Awaken community is about real, heartfelt connection, and the wisdom that arises from intentional conversation. \n  We know there are a lot of meditation apps out there - but none of them are talking about culture and politics, undoing racism and sexism, or about the impact that all these systems have on our minds and hearts. How can we can separate from the world and somehow have a pleasant, peaceful internal existence without addressing what\u2019s actually going on around us? Yet that\u2019s what other meditation apps seem to be teaching. \nWe\u2019re different. We believe that internal and societal transformation need to happen simultaneously.\nOr, as one of eye-opening Awaken teachers Rev. angel puts it: \"Love and justice are not two. Without inner change, there can be no outer change; without collective change, no change matters.\" \nWe hope to build a strong community and even a movement of bringing mindfulness more deeply into our lives, culture, and politics. We're not *just* a meditation app alone, and we\u2019re fortunate to be working with some leading luminaries in the application of mindfulness to our lives and world:\n    In one sense, Rev. angel, Lama Rod, and Greg Snyder are not just meditation teachers. They\u2019re teachers of the world, farseeing prophets whose teachings point the way out of our current chaos toward a more harmonious inner and outer world for all beings. Immersing yourself in their teachings is absolutely life-changing. Awaken is here to let you do just that!\nAfter incredibly positive feedback from test users this past spring, we're asking your help to take it to the next level. We're pre-selling discounted memberships so that we can develop a fully featured app for both iOS and Android and to compensate our teachers. Help us achieve this mission and be a part of the change. \n We're so excited to share the project and build it further with you!\nTime for the good stuff! Support this Kickstarter to become an Awaken member! Whether you sign up for a month or for life, membership means you're a part of the community, which means you can: \nUse the app \nAccess our full library of meditations \nAttend our live, virtual teachings and enlightening discussions\nREWARDS Include:\nTalk with the creators of Awaken or our knowledgeable teachers. \n Go deeper with your practice and receive teachings specifically individualized to where you are.\n One-on-one collaboration with a teacher is a time-honored tradition across meditation lineages that can be truly transformative.\nWe also offer half-day or full-day retreats and seminars. We'll work with you to personalize our methods and teachings to your needs and organization. \n\nIf you have any questions about any of the rewards, just shoot us a note at kickstarter@whynotawaken.com.\n  Why We Created Awaken & The Story So Far \nPLAY\n\nRavi here. The idea for this app crystallized for me the morning after the 2016 US Presidential election. I was at week-long silent meditation retreat, and when the results were posted that morning, I was devastated, along with pretty much all the participants at the retreat. Thankfully, the teachers leading the retreat decided to break the schedule of dawn-till-dusk meditation. Instead, they facilitated group conversations and awareness practices geared at allowing us all to process emotions and support each other. \nWhile there was no changing the results of the election, what happened that day was transformative for everyone in the room, whether it was simply moving through stages of grief or even brainstorming creative methods (of which this app is one). The day combined all the things that make Awaken special - mindfulness practices, contemplation, and supportive conversation and authentic sharing. Being so moved by the experience, I had to find a way to share what I had been through - and the result is this app. \nWe've spent the Spring testing our prototype with a small group of users, and results have been off the charts. Check out what people have been saying:\nThere is a long way to go, but we really believe we\u2019re building something special - an amazing app, community, and movement. And from the beginning, I knew I didn\u2019t want to do this as a regular, profit-focused startup - so we\u2019re going to function as a worker-owned cooperative. Instead of owning 80%+ of the company, Susan and I own one share each, just like everyone else we\u2019ll work with - and while profit is a long ways off, we\u2019ll be putting most of any extra money we make towards social causes instead of keeping it for ourselves. I wanted to send a clear signal to our community that we care first and foremost about our mission. We\u2019re doing a bunch of other things differently as well - you can read more below or on the About section of our website.\nAbout Our Approach & How We\u2019ll Use the Funds \nWhile we ask for a monthly membership fee like other meditation apps, profit maximization is not our goal - transformation of self and society is. We'll use the funds we raise to sustainably provide a great digital (and hopefully, down the road, physical) space for our community, and to compensate our terrific teachers, ensuring our meditation content is top-notch. We pledge to be fully transparent with expenses and include you in the process of financial decisions. And as soon as we responsibly can, we'll be switching to a pay-what-you-can model to maximize accessibility (and we\u2019ll even have some scholarship memberships available when we launch). You can find out more about what makes us unique on our organizational philosophy page. \nWe have big dreams about what the future of meditation, our social institutions, and the world could be - but we need your help to get there. Let's build that future, together. If you have any questions about our fledgling company or any of the rewards or anything else, just shoot us a note at kickstarter@whynotawaken.com. \nAbout the Founders \nThe co-founding team of Awaken, Ravi Mishra and Susan Stainman, have backgrounds in mindfulness, tech, entrepreneurship, and art. We handle the development of the app and production logistics, and, for now, we guide most of the meditations. \nBorn in India, raised in California, living in Brooklyn, Ravi is desperately trying not to be a cliche, and failing. In his simultaneously best and worst hipster impression, he's combining his expertise (technology and entrepreneurship) with his deepest passion (meditation and Buddhism) to try to create something that \"helps people\" or \"makes the world a better place.\" When not being self-referential in an app bio, you can find him teaching meditation at the Dharma Den, running or biking around Brooklyn, or pursuing one of too many hobbies (current favorite: learning how to spin fire poi). He was a very active participant in Occupy Boston and has worked at one of the largest activist/online campaigning organizations in the world, Avaaz.org. He's been practicing in the Zen tradition for almost a decade and is soon to be a student in the Mountains and Rivers Order Zen lineage. \nSusan is a Susan, most of the time. When she's not Susan-ing, you can find her at her studio in Brooklyn making her art or teaching meditation. Then again, you could argue that exactly then is when she's most Susan-ning. It's all very confusing, this notion of identity. (This bio was written as a placeholder by an Awaken co-founder who'll remain nameless. Upon reading it, Susan declared she could do no better. But we'll take just a second and plug her art.)\nAnd We Like To Have Fun\nThis didn't make our final video, but in case you have a minute and enjoy laughing, we present, for your viewing pleasure...\nPLAY\n\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe wanted to make sure we kept risks and challenges to a minimum before we turned to you to help bring our dream to life, so we've created a prototype of the app for the iPhone.

Created by Matt Vancil, Demon Hunters is the story of a ragtag group of divine warriors battling against an ancient demonic foe WAY out of their league. We had no idea what we were doing, but we did it anyway, and then did it again with its sequel, Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake. In the years since, we\u2019ve churned out a bunch of different projects, but we never really stopped working on Demon Hunters. \nBetween comics and RPGs and projects that never quite made it to fruition, we\u2019ve continued to develop the world and its characters. We\u2019ve always loved the Demon Hunters universe, but we never felt like we got to spend enough time in it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited to introduce their world to a new generation of fans with this new series.\nIn fact, we're so excited to share it with you that we don't want to wait for this Kickstarter to end. You can watch the first episode, Demon Hunters: Missionary Opposition, RIGHT NOW!\n   It\u2019s all true. Every myth. Every legend. Every pulp adventure and campfire story. This is a world of gods and monsters. Magic and Mad Science. Demon janitors and ninja vampires and sentient christmas trees. A world where an unwitting populace is under constant threat of being eaten or eradicated or erased from history. A world in desperate need of protection. That\u2019s why there\u2019s DEMON HUNTERS. These monster killing badasses work for a super secret organization known as\u2026\nThey keep us safe and oblivious from the terrors that dwell in the darkness so the rest of humanity can just focus on worrying about racism, sexism, corporate greed, and destroying the planet with our pollution and self-indulgence. Hard to say who\u2019s got the better end of that deal.  \n Demon Hunters is like Men in Black, Agents of Shield, Supernatural and Buffy the Vampire Slayer all rolled together. No aliens though. Disbelief can only be suspended so far.\nTo date, the Demon Hunters property has been pretty heavily focused on a very small group of characters. Namely, those two goobers you see in episode one, Gabriel and Silent Jim. But the Brotherhood is a vast, global organization. There\u2019s a whole world of stories to tell in the Demon Hunters universe, and it\u2019s not all killing monsters and saving the world. With Slice of Life, we\u2019re focusing on not-so-epic adventures from the less prestigious corners of the Demon Hunters universe. Stories from the folks working behind the scenes to make sure the actual demon hunting goes off without a hitch. From the low-level chapters left to do the crap jobs nobody else wants to do. And maybe we\u2019ll get a peek at an ancient enemy that turns out to not be quite as annihilated as the Brotherhood thinks. Let\u2019s take a look at the initial lineup:  \nTHE EPISODES  \nMissionary Opposition - Another day, another crap assignment for Gabriel and Silent Jim. This time they\u2019re stuck on a door-to-door monster sweep with a set of less-than-flattering cover identities. Just the latest in a long line of indignities that Gabe both can and inevitably will go on about at length. Written by Jimmy McMichael and directed by Ben Dobyns. \nThe Clean-up Crew - The battle\u2019s over and the hunters have all gone home, but who\u2019s gonna clean up all these demon guts? Time to call in the Cleanup Crew. We follow Edgar and Nikita as they mop, shovel, and industrial-strength bleach their way through what for most of us would be the worst day of our lives. For them, it\u2019s a Tuesday. Written by JR Ralls. \nHappy Anniversary - Wen\u2019s having a rough day. As a succubus working for the Brotherhood, she has a lot of rough days, but today is special. Today\u2019s the anniversary of...well, something she\u2019s never quite gotten over. She\u2019s barely holding it together as it is, but being assigned a new partner may be what sends her over the edge. Written by and starring Sarah Moore. \nThe Amazing Velma - Velma was willing to do anything for fame and fortune, and that\u2019s just what her mysterious benefactors were looking for in a recruit. Now that she\u2019s sold her soul for dazzling magical powers, it turns out dealing with demons can really get in the way of your day job. Abraca-get off my friggin' stage!

He's also reluctantly appeared onscreen as Herr Doktor, a character Vancil created specifically for him despite Jimmy having no interest in acting, a weak grasp of the German accent, and a crippling fear of public speaking. A solid 60% of the Demon Hunters canon only exists inside Jimmy's brain, and as such he is under 24-7 protection by a cadre of highly trained DG bodyguards. He laughs in the face of target word counts.\nEmilie Rommel Shimkus is a writer, actor, and vocalist from the PNW. She plays Wren the Bard in JourneyQuest and recently produced her first short film, Tell Your Children.

Ralls is the writer and producer of the film Dark Dungeons, based upon the Jack Chick comic. He has also published multiple short stories in various publications.

She's played the sorceress in The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, and is looking forward to reprising her Demon Hunters' role as the insanely destructive Anti-Tank Sally. If all explodes according to plan, she'll be helping write her character's Stretch Goal skit!\nBeau M. K. Prichard is a freelance writer and theater director/producer in Seattle. He was born in Australia, raised in New Zealand, and educated by Quakers in Oregon.

Now you get to be the target of such an onslaught. You choose an available character, and we'll film that character insulting you. Yeah that's basically it. Characters may include:\nGabriel\nAnti-Tank Sally\nThe Amazing Velma\nWen\nDuamerthrax the Indestructible (if unlocked)\nThe Purple Ninja (if unlocked)\nTree (if unlocked)\nAnd more to come\nAt $500, you can choose the much-coveted Red Card, which allows you to flag bad puns, off-color remarks, or other violations by our cast and crew, both from set and in-person at conventions. We'll send that person to time out, sub in somebody new, and film and upload the results for you. And now you can bring your Red Card with you, with a dual-color etched metal card (2.75 x 4.5 inch) that includes your name and backer number.\nPARTICIPATION LEVELS\n$1000 - Be a FEATURED EXTRA in an episode! You get to hang out on set and appear in the episode. Travel and Lodging not included.\n$1999 - Join us for a day and play Demon Hunters: A Comedy of Terrors with us.

And you also get an actual custom prop from the show, and we'll sign it.\nWe've got A LOT of stretch goals planned and we hope we can get to all of them. To start things off, each stretch goal we hit unlocks another new episode. Here's a little peek at some of what we've got in the works, in no particular order.\nNobody likes working Warehouse duty, but at least hauling all that freight around the Brotherhood's infinite storage dimension serves a purpose. It's the bureaucracy that'll break your spirit every time.\nWen makes a new \"friend\", and discovers a sinister secret that's been kept hidden from the world. All that and a fan favorite character makes his triumphant return. \nMatt Vancil returns as Duamerthrax The Indestructible. We don't know what he's gonna do yet, but Matt agreed to let us paint him red again, and it's not like we were gonna say no to that.\nAnti-Tank Sally finds herself a bit indisposed as she takes on a cabal of demon-summoning cultists. Who will come out on top? Spoiler alert: Sally wins.\nIs that all we've got? Hell no! We can't stop coming up with Demon Hunters stories! But to get the rest, you've gotta unlock them.\nThis is really important, so read carefully:  \nWe will charge for all shipping after the campaign in BackerKit. In order for your rewards to ship, you will need to pay shipping fees at that time. Do NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now.  \nThe Short Version\u2014  \nInternational Backers: expect to pay less than $9.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.  \nDomestic Backers: expect to pay less than $5.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.  \nThe Long Version, for people who like details\u2014  \nInternational Backers: we are working with a third-party agency to fulfill your orders from warehouses in Europe, Canada, and Australia. This should help cut your typical U.S. shipping costs by a huge margin. Please be aware that you may still be responsible for import duties. We must comply with international law and can not mark your reward as a gift or as a zero value item. Duties will not be included in your shipping charge, with one exception...  \nEU Backers: We will include VAT for EU members when we charge for shipping in BackerKit. That way your package should arrive with much less hassle and holdup. And a bit faster as well.  \nDomestic Backers: we want to get the best-possible shipping and handling rate for you. Rather than over-estimating expenses now, we will charge actual rates when we are ready to ship.  \nAll Backers: by handling shipping this way, we reduce unknown costs now, which means we know exactly how much we can put into the production budget, and then we can use economy of scale to make specific shipping orders with exact details. What will shipping cost, you ask?  \nESTIMATING SHIPPING COSTS  \nInternational orders will average $.99 handling per item, plus local shipping costs. This should still be much less than you have paid in the past. (For example, in 2013 our cost to ship a DVD internationally began at $8.59 and went up from there as the weight increased.) Unfortunately, we cannot calculate this more precisely until we know our volume and can negotiate for the best rate possible. Domestic orders will start at the current Media Mail rate for a five ounce parcel, plus a minimum of $.25 handling per item. You can estimate that shipping will begin around $3.99, plus more for larger or heavier packages that include more than a DVD. Again, we'll use our volume to negotiate for the best-possible quote.\nThe MAJORITY of Add-Ons will be made available in the BackerKit Pledge Manager AFTER the campaign ends. In order to make sure the MOST money goes to the production itself, it just doesn't make sense to offer add-ons during the campaign. Example: A T-Shirt add-on would be $70 before shipping costs.\nThat said, THESE ADD-ONS ARE AVAILABLE during the campaign. Just increase your contribution by the amount of the Add-on and we'll ask you to specify what you ordered in the Backerkit survey after the campaign is over.\nDemon Hunters: A Comedy of Terrors RPG Corebook PDF - $15\nGamemaster's Apprentice Cards PDF - Demon Hunters Edition - $10\nMore may be unlocked during the campaign", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a lot going on this year, and delays are possible. Most of us have day jobs, so we'll be filming on weekends and other free moments. That said we've had 19 years of practice. Still, delays can happen. \n\nAdditionally there are several previous campaigns in various stages of fulfillment this year, which may cause some delays in this Kickstarter's fulfillment. We have done our best to estimate a reasonable time we think we can deliver even given these potential conflicts, but anything can happen. \n\nWhatever happens, we are committed to keeping you informed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE BIBLE", "descp": "You get the PDF of the Demon Hunters World Bible!

Feats and Traits\n4. Pregnancy\n5. Magic\n6. Sexual Societies\n7. Sex and Religion\n8.

OGL Information\nThis project is to publish a color PDF/hardcover of the book, ensuring payment for the authors, developer, artists, and layout person. The book's included artwork will depict nudity and sexual situations. The book supports a diverse look at the subject matter, meaning it is not strictly aimed at a heterosexual audience; it is LGBTQ friendly.\nEVERY backer receives an IMPASSIONED version of a Talented Adventurer PDF by Margherita Tramontano. A normal version of Marena is available from Rogue Genius Games from Christina Stiles Presents. The impassioned version adds erotic art, new info from the rules, and information on the character's love life.\n  150 Backers are UNLOCKED! That means ALL backers (including $1 backers) will receive a PDF exclusive IMPASSIONED version of the Talented Rogue by Will Wells. \n 175 backers is unlocked! That means that every backer at the $20 and above level will now receive PDFs of all standalone Stretch Goals that we reach! \n We've reached an amazing 200 Backers! Just as promised we've now unlocked an exclusive IMPASSIONED version of the Talented Bard, PDF, by Kimberly Wells. All $20+ level backers will receive this PDF. \nThe authors talk about The Book of Passion's contents and inspirations on The Other Side and Stargazer's World and Know Direction. \nYou can connect with the authors, developers, editors, and artists on our Book of Passion Facebook page. You can ask questions there, make suggestions, and get a sneak peek at some of the more sensual art. You can also reach the authors and others here on the Book of Passion thread on the Paizo Forums. \nCome by and like the Misfit Studios Facebook page and Christina Stiles's author page to learn about this and other projects we are up to.  \nWe are funded, and the first stretch goal has been met! Please note that $10 and $20 backers do benefit by stretch goals that increase the size of the book, such as the class options.\n              Art prints and bookmarks and buttons.\nAdventure by Christina Stiles.\nShort Story by Christina Stiles.\nImpassioned Talents for RGG's Talented Line.\nMythic support.\nIconics book.

Getting up and addressing a crowd like that, It's not easy."}, {"status": []}], "comments": []}}, {"backer": "Zombie Orpheus", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "WE BELIEVE ART HAS THE POWER TO WAKE PEOPLE UP.  \nEight years ago, the artist Shepard Fairey made the iconic image that captured a period of HOPE in America. Today we are in a very different moment, one that requires new images that reject the hate, fear, and open racism that were normalized during the 2016 presidential campaign. So on Inauguration Day, We the People will flood Washington, DC with NEW symbols of hope.\nThis art has been already been commissioned by the Amplifier Foundation. Some of the greatest activist artists working today, including Shepard, Ernesto Yerena, and Jessica Sabogal, have collaborated with photographers to create a series of images that capture the shared humanity of our diverse America.\nNow the tricky part: printing and distributing these images on a massive scale in time for Inauguration. \nMuch of Washington will be locked down on Inauguration Day, and in some areas there will be severe restrictions on signs and banners.  But we've figured out a hack.  It's called the newspaper!  On January 20th, if this campaign succeeds, we're going to take out full-page ads in the Washington Post with these images, so that people across the capitol and across the country will be able to carry them into the streets, hang them in windows, or paste them on walls.\nEvery dollar you put into this campaign will buy six ads printed and distributed for us.\nAmplifier will also distribute these images as large placards throughout DC at Metro stops, out the back of moving vans, at drop spots to be announced in the coming week via our social media feeds, and, on January 19, as free downloads for you to print and share as you like.\nAnd for every donation over $5 we will even send a postcard of the art of your choosing to the incoming President after he takes office! (Stay tuned for the text we will use!)  \nThis art is meant to spark a conversation, and after January 20, our work will continue. What does WE THE PEOPLE\u2014these three famous words in the preamble to the Constitution\u2014mean in the 21st century? Over the next several months, Amplifier will partner with organizations, schools, and everyday families to create spaces across the county, in both red states and blue, where we can speak, listen, and share our answers. Watch for updates on this as the campaign funds and moves into the world!\nWHO ARE WE?\nSHEPARD FAIREY is one of the most accomplished street artists in the world, and creator and founder of Obey Clothing and Obey Giant, first becoming known for his \"Andre The Giant has a Posse\" sticker campaign while at the Rhode Island School of Design. He became widely known during the 2008 presidential election for his Barak Obama \"Hope\" poster. \nJESSICA SABOGAL is a first generation Colombian American muralist. Her art serves as a haven, a tribute, a creative outlet of adoration and exaltation for women with stories often untold. Her pieces possess a vision of female identity that is revolutionary and powerful, brave and beautiful. Most recently she has created a visual campaign entitled, \u201cWomen Are Perfect\u201d which attempts to spread this simple but necessary notion worldwide.\nERNESTO YERENA is an artist living in Los Angeles.  His art brings political concerns to light with subject matter that depicts cultural icons, rebels and everyday people voicing their stance against oppression. While Yerena identifies as Chicano he also strongly identifies as Native/Indigenous to this continent which is often seen in his work. Highly recognized for his activism, Yerena is the founder and curator of the Alto Arizona Art campaign (2010) as well as a founding member of the We Are Human campaign (2009).\nTHE AMPLIFIER FOUNDATION:  Our non-profit is dedicated to amplifying the voices of grassroots movements through art and community engagement. We do this by funding collaborations between those movements and contemporary artists so that their messages can reach a wider audience. Our goal is to flip artists into activists and observers into participants.  \nOur work has supported Criminal Justice Reform projects with Cut50.org, Environmental campaigns working with Indigenous groups against the KXL pipeline and in defense of Treaty Rights in the Black Hills, and we have, just this week, commissioned, and started printing and distributing the majority of the art for the Women's March on Washington as an official partner.  \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe are here to find partners as much as funding.  When this message is heard we want them to know it comes direct from the people.  Our goal is 10,000 backers in this Kickstarter and ten times that many participants after Inauguration day. \nTHE REWARDS:\n STAY TUNED FOR PHASE 2!\n___________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo matter what, we have the ability to get tens of thousands of pieces of this art printed to distribute for free in public. We also have guarantees from the silkscreen and offset printers that our product can be made in a timely manner. There is a very, very small chance the Washington Post could reject our ad at the last minute, though we have been talking to their ad department for some time and they know what we are running. If that were to happen, we would buy ad space in other DC papers that day, and we would continue to spread the art beyond Inauguration Day via billboards, bus-shelter ads, etc.\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nCREDITS \n\n/ PHOTOGRAPHERS /\nDelphine Diallo: www.delphinediallo.com\nRidwan Adhami: www.ridwanadhami.com\nArlene Mejorado: www.amejorado.com\nAyse Gursoz: www.aysegursoz.com\n\n/ ARTISTS /\nShepard Fairey: www.obeygiant.com\nErnesto Yerena: www.hechoconganas.com \nJessica Sabogal: www.jessicasabogal.com\n\nFILM\n\n/ SOUNDTRACK /\n\u201cRock The Nation\u201d by LA Symphony \n\u201cThe War\u201d by The Procussions\nSoundmix by Split Rock Studios: jasonsarubbi.com \n\n/ CINEMATOGRAPHY /\nEric Becker: www.weareshouting.com\nMax Basch: www.maxwellbasch.com\nMike Lawrence\nMelinda James: www.aboutherfilms.com\nAdrien Oneiga: www.oneiga.com\nLenny Mesina: www.therapystudios.com/editors/lenny-mesina\n\n\n/ Produced / Edited / Directed by May Day / www.maydaycreative.org /\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard to the President", "descp": "We will send a postcard hand signed with your name to the president with the art of your choosing.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["498 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "We The People Sticker Pack", "descp": "Five stickers from the \"We the People\" series, one from each of the 5 art pieces.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card to the President", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,756 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Amplifier Sticker Super Pack", "descp": "Super pack of stickers which include 20 mixed Amplifier Stickers from a selection of renowned international artists including Shepard Fairey, Ernesto Yerena, Chip Thomas, Josh MacPhee, Roger Peet, Gregg Deal, Jessica Sabogal and more!

Lovecraft? \nhttps://www.facebook.com/professorgrownup/\nhttp://www.professorgrownup.com\nThis project is a full length CD of catchy children's songs about the Lovecraftian mythos, often overlaid with kid-centric moral lessons (like making friends, trying new foods, or the joy of reading) but brimming with references only parents will get. The music itself ranges from lullabies (\"Goodnight, Cthulhu\"), to surf-rock (\"The Color Out Of Space\") to mariachi (\"Mi Go, My Amigo\") and will be recorded with some of the best musicians Colorado has to offer. \nThe album will be tracked and mixed at Evergroove Studio in the forests outside of Evergreen, Colorado. VERY ROUGH vocal and guitar demos have been recorded, so it's just a matter of bringing in the string quartet, trumpet-players, bass, drums and sousaphone necessary to realize the musical vision of this project. \n\nBonus Songs\nIn addition to the 11 songs about the works of H.P. Lovecraft, this project will also include 3 bonus songs about the works of Lovecraft's pulp writing buddy Robert E. Howard, most famous for the character of Conan the Barbarian. The three songs, based around the Conan short stories (not the movies) include the tunes \"B is for Barbarian,\" \"Never Trust A Wizard\" and \"He Did It Anyway\" which impart the same kid-friendly life lessons as the Lovecraftian material. \nAbout The Songs  \nAgain, these are just samples of the rough demo versions of the songs and are in no way representative of the final product. When the album is funded, it's going to be packed with the most talented studio musicians Colorado has to offer.\n\nThe song order on the album hasn't been finalized, but the 11 songs chosen for the album are as follows.\nJust Say Fhtagn! A song co-written with Specialists webcomic writer Shawn Gustafson, this cheerful tune gives kids an alternative to swearing. \nWe Don't Eat Our Friends. No matter how delicious they appear and no matter how monstrous our appetites, it's really never okay to consume our friends, and this is a song about that.\nSecret Book Club. A low-key ditty encouraging kids to accumulate brainpower through reading, while also mentioning a number of famous fictional tomes referenced in Lovecraft's work. \nLovecraft Bath. A catchy song about getting clean in the bathtub, and also non-Euclidean math thanks to the wonders of rhyme.\nMi Go, My Amigo. A mariachi song about how cool it is to have friends who are different from you. References flying fungi from Yuggoth.\nThe Reanimation Song. A song about Dr. Herbert West, how not everyone appreciates his hobby, and how that's okay. Lets kids know that they can have a passion for things different from their peers.\nInnsmouth Is My Kind Of Town. A silly tune about the seaside town where the Deep Ones congregate. The music begins to sound like it's going deeper underwater as the song continues. \nThe Necronomnomnomnomnomicon. This one encourages kids to try new foods that they may be unfamiliar with. \nThe Color Out Of Space. The surf-rock story of a color that was bullied by the other shades and decided to take a vacation on earth to make some new friends. \nHey Hastur. A rock duet about how it's not okay to make fun of peoples' names, especially not the elder god Hastur.\nGoodnight, Cthulhu. A quiet lullabye about dread Cthulhu, urging him (and your child) to go back to sleep and stay that way. \n  About The Artist\nCameron Hays (aka Professor Grownup) was the bass player and songwriter for a number of bands of varying success over the last 20 years. His former music project Choke The Word became the first Colorado band to use Kickstarter to fund an album, and later received a Westword Music Showcase Award. He's also a professional educator who has worked with infants through graduate students at various times in his career. He is currently completing his dissertation for a PhD in Curriculum & Instruction and he feels he's too old to play in bands anymore, so the Professor Grownup pseudonym isn't arbitrary. \nIn recent years, Cameron has developed a rare medical condition that largely prevents him from playing instruments, so songwriting, composing, and now singing have become his musical outlet.\nCameron started working with Brad Smalling at Evergroove Studio when recording the Choke The Word CD, and has partnered with him for a number of other projects (including the orchestral techno-industrial project Violent Science and the ongoing \"heist music\" project The Mile Heist Club). \n  About The Studio\nNestled in the foothills of Denver, Evergroove is Colorado\u2019s first and best affordable, solar-powered, recording studio. They offer audio recording, mixing, & mastering for most genres and have worked with local, touring, & national artists. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe 11 songs for the album are already written. In fact, the acoustic guitars and vocals have already been recorded. However, the album won't be released until we think it's ready, and that means studio musicians. The funds from this Kickstarter will go to paying for these musicians to add their flavor to the songs and make them truly sing. That said, musicians can be unpredictable, and scheduling may run into some snags, which would delay the album. We fully anticipate being able to release the album (and the other rewards like t-shirts and songbooks) in a timely fashion, and we'll keep you in the loop if things go off the rails.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Cameron Hays\n3 created \u00b7 77 backed\nI'm a musician, songwriter, music producer as well as a professional educator.

At about the same time, I was tracking double bass for an album, and after every session my hands would be inflamed, swollen, painful and itchy. After consulting with an expert at a hospital with a renowned allergy facility, it came to light that what I was allergic to was prolonged pressure on my skin. I\u2019m basically allergic to the physical world. That effectively ended my music career, such as it was.\n\nSince that time, I\u2019ve done a little bit of studio work, but I have to take pretty potent steroids in advance so that my hands don\u2019t turn into mittens full of angry bees. I wear ugly shoes because they are comfortable and prevent my feet from swelling after standing all day, and I\u2019ve learned to seek out the good chairs in any room so that I don\u2019t end up with hives on my spine and the backs of my legs.\n\nI\u2019m telling you all of this because I still want to make music, but I just can\u2019t play instruments anymore. I\u2019ve got a bunch of musician friends who have been very generous with their time, and have done free studio work for me. It\u2019s great to have such wonderful friends who have so much faith in my projects, but I really feel they deserve to be paid for their work.\n\nThe motto for this project is \u201cEveryone Gets Paid.\u201d It\u2019s important for me to acknowledge all the creative people in my life who regularly donate their time to me, unpaid. That\u2019s the people at Evergroove Studio, who take time out of the insane production schedule to let me record there. It\u2019s the musicians who act as my hands. It\u2019s the graphic designers, artists and photographers who have contributed their time and money. There are others too, and I want them to have credit (and money). By helping my project, at any level, I am one step closer to being able to compensate artists of all sorts for their time and creative energy.\n\nFor everyone who has shared the Professor Grownup Kickstarter campaign already, I\u2019m eternally grateful. Every pledge, from the $5 on up, means I\u2019m that much closer to being able to complete this thing, which in many ways is my surrogate for all those years of playing in bands.

Our focus is creative tales of light, hope, and redemption.

They seek out his mother's old friend, the infamous reformed gunslinger Kulta; but what they find is more than what anyone bargains for. \nOutlawed Faith is a science fiction action adventure which brings forward a strongly charismatic, but unlikely and reluctant, hero to the rescue of innocence in danger. The story brings together a mashup of genres (Steampunk/Western) creating a perfect blend for adventure. \nSteampunk is an explosive genre still open to full exploration in novels and films. \nThe story gives a nod to the ever-loved Firefly franchise and serves those who still crave more of that saga. \nThe film is being produced by The Forge Studios, an independent film company, who believes in the filmmaker formula of Affordable + Efficient + Professional = Success. \nWe've developed a budget and are seeking to raise $1.3 million to fund production of the film, with principal photography to commence in 2017.\n ADD-ONS \nIf you simply increase your pledge by: \n$10 get The Rangers DVD \n$10 get Drustan Chronicles DVD \n$10 get The Rangers Card Game \n$10 get The Rangers Lt. Wolf Miniature \n$12 get The Rangers T-Shirt\n$5 get The Rangers DIGITALLY\n THE OPPORTUNITY  \nThe Forge Studios raised a little more than $5,000 in investments and donations to fund our \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d short for Outlawed Faith -- a vision for what the feature could be. We have other stories as well, but once we did the short concept piece for Outlawed Faith, its potential became abundantly clear. We are passionate about this story, and believe that this is the story to move ahead with RIGHT NOW. The steampunk genre is one that has not often been explored in films, and we are ready to do it. The unique twist we\u2019ve built in offers a distinctive appeal that has already generated a lot of buzz.  \nWe are currently seeking a feature budget of $1.3 million dollars to finance the production, post-production, and distribution budgets for Outlawed Faith, this Kickstarter campaign will give us the seed money to help with development and shop the script to investors.\nOutlawed Faith will be a new addition to The Forge Studio\u2019s original, transmedia content library. Outlawed Faith is set in our own unique universe. We look forward for it to be explored within books, board games, video games, collectibles, and accessories.\nThe Forge Studios is an independent film studio focused on producing original Fantasy and Science Fiction content. The Forge\u2019s big vision is a new and disruptive formula. It is to distribute our content and other curated syndicated programming via streaming IPTV on multiple platforms with a transmedia approach to storytelling that will include an interactive web portal, ancillary products, and experiential events to connect with, and retain, an engaged customer base.\nIn addition, The Forge also seeks distribution of our original content through the traditional theatrical and television models. While this could lead to breakout financial success, it will be offering content through IPTV platforms and interactive web portals that will ensure earlier and more consistent revenue streams.\nThere is an opportunity to generate revenue through streaming platforms specifically for Fantasy and Science-Fiction. We believe NOW is the time to move on this while there still is an open window to the market place. As an early innovator in this platform, The Forge can define the space for Fantasy and Science Fiction. \n  We break down the barriers to traditional filmmaking, inviting fans, investors, and local film enthusiasts to actively participate in our projects, with our #TogetherFilmmaking approach. We believe there is a severely under-served audience of Science Fiction/Fantasy enthusiasts who we work to serve with The Forge Studios\u2019 films, products, and experiential entertainment. Sci-Fi film projects are traditionally an expensive hit or miss proposition for studios, we have proven that we can do more for less and the demand has never been greater. Barriers for both domestic and international distribution have decreased, creating a global opportunity for indie filmmakers.  Outlawed Faith is geared for success.\nA PROVEN TRACK RECORD  \nThe Forge Studios\u2019 team is built on success and experience bringing together their unique backgrounds for the collective good. They have individually produced feature films, documentaries, and shorts. They bring unique skills, film and business contacts, as well as notable releases to the studio.  \nWE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE AND FOLLOWED THROUGH  \nFunding each project with an innovative combination of crowdfunding, investor capital, and gifts-in-kind The Forge Studios produces high-quality, original content for a fraction of its Hollywood-produced equivalent, with past films to show for it. For The Forge's first \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d, The Rangers: A Shadow Rising, released in 2015, the team created 60 minutes of award winning content for under $40K, that we generated via a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014. The Rangers sold out at previews and is currently available streaming online and on DVD. \nFollowing a similar approach, The Forge\u2019s historical fiction short, C\u2019est La Guerre, won acclaim at the 2015 GI Film Festival. In 2015 went on to produced multiple short film projects. In the first quarter of 2016 we brought to market our first transmedia product with another successful crowdfunding campaign, this time for The Rangers Combat Card Game.\nIn the spring of 2016 we worked together with Renaissance Women Productions to develop Daily Bread, a post-apocalyptic drama series. Hired-on we filmed throughout the last six months and are now in post production on that project. With a clear slate ahead of us, we now have our sights clearly on Outlawed Faith.\n  Ron Newcomb Director, Writer, Actor, and Producer: Ron has written and directed award winning short, and feature-length independent films. He founded the FCF, a network of over 1,700 filmmakers and film enthusiasts of faith, organized and co-leads the DMV Producers Association, as well as being involved in other film groups. Under his Opening Act Production, LLC team, Ron developed the feature film, The Fellows Hip: Rise of the Gamers, a coming-of-age story about how a group of four friends learn there\u2019s a little bit of geek and hero in all of us. Since its debut in 2013, TFH has been distributed internationally and has been dubbed in several foreign languages. Ron also produced, Made in the USA: A 30 Day Journey, which is a documentary that explores what the brand \u201cMade in the USA\u201d really means these days. Ron\u2019s innovative transmedia concept, along with his strong IPs, of The Rangers, and Outlawed Faith, have the potential create a new, dynamic and lucrative model for independent filmmaking.\nSkip Lipman   Writer, Actor, Costume Designer, and Producer: Skip has been designing and fabricating costumes, weapons, and armor for more than two decades. He is best known for his critically acclaimed documentary, Darkon, which won the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the South by Southwest Festival in 2006. Darkon has gone on to be featured on HBO, IFC, and the Smithsonian Channel, it achieved limited big screen release, and full scale international distribution on DVD.  He is an accomplished writer and creative consultant for various film projects. In addition to his filmmaking experience, he has worked extensively in the game and hobby industry. He has been involved in every aspect of development, manufacturing and distribution of gaming accessories. Skip's practical know-how, artistic vision, and attention to detail translates to high production value at an efficient cost and the ability to conceive of an extensive range of merchandise that augments the team\u2019s transmedia approach.\nArel Avellino  Cinematographer, Actor, Marketing Director: He is an entrepreneur, teacher, and filmmaker. The culmination of all of his efforts over the last four years has been to answer one question, \u201chow do you make a living making films?\u201d This question is what spurred him to start his own company, Avellino Studios, March 2012 as a film company that would solve the problems of independent filmmakers who struggle to make a living, making films and webseries. This is ultimately what led him to meet Ron Newcomb, who was a guest on the Film Thrive podcast, which brought on filmmakers to discuss how they have made a living making films. After interviewing dozens of filmmakers about their successes and failures in making a living using their craft, Arel began to pursue certifications and experience in marketing. He is now a Certified Customer Acquisition Specialist and Funnel Optimization Specialist, which are skills that are instrumental to marketing and distributing films and webseries today.\"\nSheila Avellino Writer, Actress, Artist, Social Media Manager: She is an accomplished artist, model, actress, and writer. As a natural-born artist, she has been working as a commissioned illustrator since age fourteen. She exercises her artistic abilities as often as she can, putting them to use in graphic design, illustration, painting, and other creative outlets, including spray-paint art. Her combined abilities in photography, modeling, and writing have led to a strength in social media, which she put to use as the Creative Director of her and her husband\u2019s independent film company, Avellino Studios. Sheila's voice on social media has allowed her to establish personal audience base of over 4,000 fans, raise more than $10,000 for her fantasy novel, \u201cSketch,\u201d and promote fellow artists. She now focuses those considerable talents generating content for, interacting with, and growing The Forge Studios' social media audience.\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere is the deal... $1.3 million is a lot of money, it's our goal, but we may not be able to make the movie we envision.

Gadz pumart udz zak dru ruthanna! Rekkart Barludz Orku yeglorad!\n \"Yes! Context!\" \u2013 Silver Tom\nA few years back, as I was writing the script for JourneyQuest, I realized I\u2019d painted myself into a corner. I\u2019d written a bunch of lines for a language that didn\u2019t exist. And not only did the language not exist, the lines to be translated weren\u2019t exactly simple. There were grammar jokes and syntactical misunderstandings, insults and idioms and colloquialisms that wouldn\u2019t work as a string of gibberish. For the jokes to play, the language had to sound organic, realistic, not like a chain of blah blahs. Nonsense words wouldn\u2019t work. I needed an actual language.\nSo I built one. I hammered out some basic grammar (declensions and conjugations; masculine, feminine, and neutral nouns; past, present, and future tenses; active and passive voices; and a handful of pronouns) threw about 200 words into the pot, shook it, and poured out a language.\nAnd it worked! The language sounded authentic. The grammar jokes landed\u2014many fans have told me their favorite scenes in the entire series involve the orcs. The language was a hit. And it grew.\nFor Season Two, I offered fans the option of coining new Orcish words to help fund the show. The response was overwhelming\u2014by the end of the campaign, fans had added over 1,500 words to the language. We printed a dictionary with all the grammar rules so people could learn the language and use it in their games\u2014it listed all the words, who coined them, and who or what they were named after. We had a fully functional conlang.\nThe Orcish words proved so popular that we brought them back for Season Three. Fans added another 900 words to the language\u2014so many that we\u2019re printing an updated edition of the dictionary. And now\u2019s your chance to get in on the fun.\nHow to Coin Your Orcish Word(s)\nBackers of every reward level will get to coin at least one new word to be featured in the dictionary. Here\u2019s how it works.\nFirst, go to the Online Orcish Lexicon. Any word on the list is unavailable\u2014it\u2019s already been coined. Any word not on the list, however, is fair game. Pick whatever you fancy. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a word that exists in English\u2014if you\u2019ve got an idea for a great Orcish word, I\u2019d love to hear it.\nNext, decide on who or what you want to name your word after (it can be yourself). I\u2019ll be in touch throughout the campaign and will coin new words as we go. I\u2019ll be updating the Online Lexicon with each new day\u2019s words. Priority is first come, first served, so early bird and worm and all that.\nStretch Goal Goodness\nSLAIN! \u2013 $5,001 \u2013 The Final (Fore)word\nThe foreword to the new edition will be written by ul runak.\nRAZED! \u2013 $7,500 \u2013 2nd Conjugation\nA second conjugation for verbs will be added to the dictionary. Currently, all Orcish verbs use the same conjugation and have the same infinitive form (ending in \"\u2013a\"). A new conjugation will add some much needed variety to the language. The grammar section will also be updated to include rules for the new conjugations. All new verbs coined during this campaign will become 2nd conjugation verbs.\nPILLAGED! \u2013 $10,000 \u2013 Cover Prints\nAll pledges at $50 and above will receive a print of the cover art by fantasy artist Jacob Blackmon.\nSLAUGHTERED! \u2013 $12,500 \u2013 3rd, 4th, and 5th Declensions\nNew declensions for feminine, masculine, and neutral nouns will be added to the dictionary for variety. Currently, all Orcish nouns follow one of two declension patterns, and use a limited number of endings (ex: \u2013ad, \u2013ul, \u2013id) depending on their gender. New declensions will add some much needed variety to the language, and will make it easier to keep the Orcified versions of words closer to what they were named after. The grammar section will also be updated to include rules for the new declensions. All new nouns coined during this campaign will have the option of using one of the new declensions.\n$15,000 \u2013 +1 Bonus Word\nAll backers at all levels will get to coin one additional word.\n$17,500 \u2013 The Combative Case\nOrcish currently has five grammatical cases: the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative. This goal will add a sixth case: the combative, a case used exclusively for threats and insults. Which should trigger some interesting changes to the phrase book.\n$20,000 \u2013 A Brief History of Orckind\nThe dictionary will include a history of the orcs and how they came to be. Additionally, I will commit to continuing the Orcish Word a Day project, and will ultimately turn it into a page-a-day desk calendar to be funded by a future campaign.\n$22,500 \u2013 Holidays and Festivals\nThe dictionary will include a list of Orcish holidays and festivals. Anyone who sponsors an Orcish clan will have a chance to contribute to the list.\n$25,000 \u2013 Orc Tales! Woo-oo!\nThe dictionary will include a short story written entirely in Orcish. Additionally, I will commit to creating an illustrated Orcish children\u2019s book to be funded by a future campaign. Anyone who backs this campaign at $10 or higher will receive a PDF of the children\u2019s book.\n$27,500 \u2013 Double Content\nDouble all coined content! Everyone gets to contribute twice as much to the dictionary: two (well, four by this point) words, two phrases at $50 and above, two clans sponsored at $100 and up. For the $2,500 reward, I will deliver twice as many books. For the $5,000 reward, it will become a two day campaign.\n$30,000 \u2013 Dwarvish\nI will begin developing the language of the orcs\u2019 most hated enemies\u2014the dwarves. Dwarvish language will become canon in Fartherall, and its dictionary will be funded in a future campaign. All backers of this campaign will receive a PDF of the Dwarvish-English Dictionary.\nBonus Words for Patrons\nAs a special thank you to my patrons, all backers of my Patreon will get to coin a bonus word, regardless of whether they contribute to this campaign. Anyone who becomes a patron over the course of this campaign will also get the bonus word.\nBanner Graphics\nYou can download Facebook and Twitter graphics for the campaign from Dropbox.\nAdd Ons & Shipping\nAdd ons\u2014such as additional words and phrases and copies of the dictionary, plus a few other things\u2014will be available through BackerKit.

We are just about ready to open our doors, and are targeting an April 2017 launch.\nWe've got a location, we've got a great plan, and we've raised most of the funds we need to get going, but we need your help to make Rook & Rogue Board Game Pub as special as it can be. \nThe goal for our Kickstarter is to raise money to add some special touches -- these are things we would love to add to the pub but haven't been able to include in the budget. \nWe polled people from Facebook to determine which goals to fund first.\n   These are 2\" x 3\" vinyl stickers that are extra durable and can be used on a car.\n  These pint glasses have the Rook & Rogue logo on them.\n  These black cotton zip-up hoodies have the Rook & Rogue logo on the back, and the rook on the front.  Available in size from youth XS to Adult 5XL\nWe are offering Kickstarter backers membership at a 10% discount from our regular price.  Membership is required to access Hobby (over $35) and Grail (over $75) games from our collection.  Casual Games (under $35) are available to any customer without a fee.  \nBoth Rook Members and Rogue VIPs will receive our top-secret membership card.  We can't show you a picture of it, but we promise it will be one of the coolest cards in your wallet.\nMembership is offered in two tiers:\nRook Membership - $5 / month or $50 / year \nGrants access to Hobby Games\nUnlocks the ability to reserve board games and tables in advance for parties of any size (online or by phone)\nIncludes fancy top-secret membership card\nRogue VIP Membership - $10 / month or $100 / year\nGrants access to Grail Games\nUnlocks the ability to reserve board games and tables in advance for parties of any size (online or by phone)\nIncludes fancy top-secret membership card\nYour membership period begins when you complete your first visit with us.  When you enroll, you can choose to auto-renew, or manually renew monthly or annually.\nWe are passionate about RPGs as well as board games, and we love putting together special missions for birthdays, special occasions, or just because.  You pick the system, (or even a specific module) and we'll run it for you if you give us enough notice.  If you have questions about this reward, please contact us.\nWe will put together a party for 20 guests including food and non-alcoholic beverages.  Advanced notice is required. If you have questions about this reward, please contact us.\n  We are starting our board game collection with 300 games. Our first goal will add another 50 games to our library before launch. We will send out surveys after the KS closes so that you can help us determine the 50 new titles.\nWe want to have flexible options so that you can choose to blast the lights at your table so you can see every detail of your custom-painted miniatures, or to dim the lights for a quiet dinner date. If we reach our second goal, every table in the restaurant will be able to choose the brightness at their own table. If the Server Call Button project is also supported, you will be able to change the lighting at your table with the same button.\nWe know that many gamers will be in our pub for hours at a time, and you don\u2019t necessarily want the server to keep checking on you every ten minutes while you take on the goblin hoards. If we reach our third goal, we will place a wifi-enabled server call button at every table so you can get refills or order additional food whenever you\u2019re ready. \nWe want the experience at Rook & Rogue to be extra special, and that means offering things you may not be able to afford to have at home. If we reach $8,200, we will include 4 board game tables from BoardGameTables.com in our store. These will have recessed play areas, fold out cup holders, and a removable top. \nWe have set our backer rewards for pint glasses that have our logo. If this goal is funded, we will upgrade all pint glass backer rewards to mugs instead. \nOne of the great things about social board gaming is getting to know new people. This is not something everyone enjoys, but we want to make it as simple as possible to find other people to play with if you are someone who likes to meet new people through board gaming. If this goal gets funded, we will add a monitor to the area behind the hostess stand which will display in real-time people who are looking for other people to game with them. There will also be virtual bulletin boards for local events outside of our pub, upcoming pub events, and shout outs for things like birthdays and anniversaries. The virtual bulletin boards can also be accessed online, so you can start looking for fellow gamers, create new posts, or see what\u2019s happening at the pub before you head out.\nWe are planning to offer 50 mbps wifi to our customers at launch. If we reach $10,400, we will upgrade our internet connection to 150 mbps for blazing fast speeds. Want to host a LAN party? Want to use our space as a co-working space? This speed should have you covered. (If this goal is funded, we will also provide Ethernet switches for small-scale LAN parties \u2013 think 4 \u2013 6 people.)\nThere are plenty of places to watch sports in Bellingham, but how many places to watch E-Sports? How many places to watch Critical Role? If we reach our full project goal of $12,600, we will install a 12\u2019 motorized screen and an HD projector in the space. We will use this equipment to host special events such as movie or TV screenings, and to live-stream E-Sports, Twitch, or You Tube.\nBeyond???\nWe have some great ideas if we pass all of our planned projects.  Most of them involve things like getting some additional space and offering private rooms.  These are pie in the sky ideas, and it would take an awful lot of support to make something like that happen.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk to our project is a delay to our opening date. We have already secured a location and funding for the primary needs of the business. We have decades of restaurant and project management experience on our team, and are working hard to mitigate the project risks. We are confident in our ability to meet our commitments, but we will be working with some providers (in particular printers for backer rewards) with which we do not have a solid track record. We will plan as far in advance as we can to ensure that we meet our backer commitments in a timely manner.\n\nWe will keep backers informed via regular proactive communication as we approach launch day.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "One Month Raven Membership", "descp": "As a Member at the Rogue Raven, you'll get access to our hobby games.

In other words, it's pay-what-you-can. \n  A Vampire Night Bus cussing out local Unicorn Butt Cop propaganda\nEXPLORE THE UNIQUE WORLD OF THE TINGLEVERSE IN GLORIOUS FULL MOTION VIDEO. Using long-abandoned Full Motion Video (FMV) game techniques to emulate the singular style of Chuck Tingle\u2019s renowned stock-photo covers, the game not only looks like it was summoned directly from Chuck's imagination, it also evokes the joyful spirit of his stories that we love. That said, you don't have to know the Tingleverse to be a Buckaroo. Project Tingler is ultimately a story about positive sexuality, self-acceptance, love and personal growth. Like Doctor Tingle\u2019s (Ph.d in Sensual Massage from DeVry Institute) 4,000 word masterpieces, Project Tingler will be a brief but sexily refreshing respite, rather than an hours-long epic journey.\nNAVIGATE THE TINGLEVERSE in search of your cute son (name of Jon): Your cute son (name of Jon) is missing! To recover him, you\u2019ll have to dive deeper and deeper into the tangled, wrangled, hard-bodied web that is THE TINGLEVERSE! Explore a magical world rendered in glorious FMV (Full Motion Video)! Visit exotic and erotic locations like the desert! A bus depot! The beach! the void. Annnnnd\u2026.jail!\nHELP PROVE LOVE IS REAL for all who kiss through a variety of seduction minigames: As you journey to save your cute son (name of Jon), you\u2019ll come face to face to butt to mouth with a variety of down-on-their-love foes who seek to get in your way and muss up your hair. But are they enemies of you or enemies... of themselves? Help them figure their biz out by tingling their minds, bodies, and souls. \nGET TINGLED BY OUR CUSTOM SMUT! The very nature of the Tingleverse is The Rawest of Graphic Sensualities, but players who aren\u2019t down with visual depictions of sexual content needn\u2019t fear. While we're working with video and real actors (the cast will most certainly SURPRISE and AMAZE you), there won't be explicit footage of people taking a trip to bonetown. Our salacious scenes are literary in nature and read aloud by talented performers, intended to pound the most sexual of your organs...Your imagination.\nOur exquisitely handcrafted smut puts the anal in artisanal\nWe\u2019re also including a Kitten Mode, where sexual situations will be replaced by footage of kittens playing. If you wish, you may also engage Kitten Mode on its own, just to watch some kittens playing, because why not.\nCONFRONT THE ULTIMATE EVIL in The Tingleverse - The Dark Magician Ted Cobbler: Ted Cobbler, the *Dead Gobbler* (not his actual title) has spirited away your cute son (name of Jon) for reasons as inscrutable as they are unsettling. A virtuoso of Dark Magic\u2014indeed, a veritable Dark Magician\u2014Ted Cobbler has his fingers in many sinister stewpots. Take heed: despite the master-class glamour he casts to disguise it, all of Ted Cobbler\u2019s fingers are exactly the same length. You\u2019ll need to learn the true meaning of love to withstand his hideous, alluring powers, for Ted Cobbler claims that Love Is Not Real. \n  Chuck Tingle! Few would dare approach the Tae Kwon Do grandmaster and author of \u201cSpace Raptor Butt Redemption,\u201d \u201cGay T-Rex Lawfirm: Exective Boner,\u201d and \u201cTurned Gay by My Existential Dread That I May Actually be a Character in a Chuck Tingle Book,\u201d but beloved indie game developer Zo\u00eb Quinn took the Handsome Unicorn Butt Cop by the horn!\nEvery journey is better with hard buds. Zoe's core team includes Karla Pacheco (Inspector Pancakes; Dreadful Sirens; Marvel), Elby Teufel (hunktears.sexy), Seth Boyer (Welcome to Night Vale; Tiny Cartridge), and John Warren (The Sun at Night; Murder at Mystery Manor; Tumblewords).\nTo see some of us in action and better understand the story behind this game, check out this mini-documentary by Vice that followed us around for the early parts of development!\nOur core team is joined by a motley crew of actors and voice actors, including Anthony Carboni and Jim Sterling, with more to be announced as we go! \nYour support doesn\u2019t just bring The Gift of Tingle to True Buckaroos Around the World (though assuredly that would be reward enough); you can also get early beta access to the game, behind-the-scenes updates and exclusive Project Tingler rewards like having the butt-pounded star of an Original Chuck Tingle Story named after YOU! \nChoose a side; determine the game's ending\nOur first support level is not only a pledge to Prove Love Is Real, it is a vote where you determine a key element of the game itself! Will you join TEAM SPAGHETTI SWEETIES or do you choose THE CHOCOLATE MILK CUTIES???? This may be the most sexy and important decision of your life. \nEarly access to Project Tingler means you get the game before the public does. That's right, you get to prove love before the bucks and ladybucks who abstain from Kickstarting us in the butt. Backers can also get exclusive access to crude Photoshops, making-of clips, and general Tinglenanigans while the hard buds make Project Tingler.\nWe also have mugs and t-shirts.\n      If you're one of the few who decide to be extra nice, you can get a custom Chuck Tingle-style cover with your face on it! These items will be delivered digitally directly to backers AND will be hidden objects to find in the game itself. YOU'RE A COLLECTIBLE NOW, BUCKAROO. (Limit 69)\nWhat about the hardest buds who prove love with high rewards?? You could get a REAL PROP from the production of Project Tingler along with an attached card commemorating the occasion and describing the prop's use during production! Buttplug Bandolier? Executive dildo? Who knows what delights you'll pull from our exotic and sensual treasure box! (Limit 50)\n  For buckaroos who want to BE in Project Tingler, we have two limited reward tiers for you. You could be a HANDSOME LIVING OBJECT in Project Tingler! If you're one of the ten who do this good way, you simply need to send us footage of your face (don't worry - we'll work with you through the process). That's right, buds need not be in Los Angeles to become a living object! (Limit 10)\nFor buds in (or visiting) city name of Los Angeles, you could be one of the three who dons full UNICORN BUTT COP REGALIA in Project Tingler! There will be a production day between November 15 and December 15 (relatively flexible) where YOU can join the game buds for a day of fun and booty shorts. (Limit 3)\nFinally, buds who wish to truly know the way of love can be our highest reward bud and have the good Dr. Tingle himself name a protagonist after you in one of his Tingleverse adventures. This is a digital product and the three buds who do this way will need to understand they will be subjected to literary poundings in heart, brain, AND butt. Please understand. (Limit 3)\nProject Tingler has two main physical rewards \u2014 If you want extras you will have an opportunity to add a UNICORN BUTT COP T-SHIRT ($35 for U.S. orders, $45 for International - prices include shipping & handling) or a TRUE BUCKAROO MUG ($20 for U.S. orders, $30 for International) at the end of the Kickstarter campaign. \nWe don't have any. We have a specific vision in mind for the game, and overfunding will go to polishing & improving the game we already want to make. If we absolutely had to pick a stretch goal, it would be for 69,421 - thank you for not leaving the total as the sexweed number.\nChuck and the Project Tingler team want to make this game like the rest of Zoe's games - pay what you can. Crowdfunding gives us the freedom to make Project Tingler the loving gift to the internet we want it to be and provide voracious Tingle fans with early access to the game, special rewards, and an opportunity to be part of this Truly Magical Process.\nThe greatest funding requirement is the cost of filming the entire game as an FMV Adventure. Why are we going back to a decades-old form of game making that was hastily abandoned and literally no one asked for? Because we are dedicated to pouring our hearts into crafting ridiculously awesome things quite seriously, and FMV matches the stock photography style of Chuck's covers. We\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of our own money and countless hours (we\u2019re not joking. We\u2019re too sleepy to count anything right now) to develop a game that truly emulates the distinct feel of a Chuck Tingle novel.\nOver the last few months we\u2019ve experimented with production pipelines and the tech, and we\u2019ve done multiple shoots, so we know how to minimize risks and waste that can come from needing to re-shoot footage. We've prototyped out a level that meets our standards, because we didn\u2019t want to come to you before we\u2019d eliminated the biggest, girthiest risks in creating the game! Project Tingler has been hard in development for almost a year at this point, and we are well-equipped to handle the challenges that naturally arouse during the process, including ones that aren't exclusive to working in FMV.\nThe core team has shipped a combined 12 games in the past 5 years, and we're well-versed in how to finish a game and accurately budget (ignore what we just said about not being able to count).\nYour support helps us pound the world in the butt with the Gift of Project Tingle...for all Buckaroos Who Kiss The Sky.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nModern-day FMV games are relatively uncharted waters, but thankfully we're coming to you after almost a year of developing the game. Physical rewards will be created and shipped by Amplifier, a top printing and fulfillment company who\u2019ve worked with Nerdist, Geek and Sundry, and more. \n\nThe biggest \"risk\" might be the fact that it's comedy that deals with sexuality - only the most subjective thing we could choose to do. Everyone has a different sense of humor, but we hope that you've got a good feel for what ours is. In case a few things aren't clear, here's what we do think is funny\n\n-The human condition\n-The Bigfoot Pirate Ghost condition\n-Dogs (clothed)\n-Dogs (natural)\n-Unicorns that walk like men, yet are not bound by man\u2019s laws\n-The unexpected juxtaposition of disparate concepts (for instance: pirate, ghost, and bigfoot)\n-The absurd treated as the mundane\n-The mundane treated as the absurd\n-Dad jokes\n-Big Dogs (t-shirts) \n\nHere's what we DON'T think is funny:\n\n-The twenty Twitter accounts that pop up immediately after a current event happens like Left Shark or Ken Bone\n-Racism (stop it)\n-Sexism (stop it)\n-Any other mean-spirited shit where the punchline is punching down\n-The basic concept of people of the same gender being in love and/or having sex with each other. We all take this one very seriously, and it's extremely important us, as we've only got like...one token straight person on the team. You know, just to keep it interesting.\n-That dream you had once where Kevin from Accounting made this face at you, and you were like \"whaaat\", and- I guess you had to be there.\n-People who don't read past the title of a Chuck Tingle book to discover the unironic beauty and joy he brings us.\n\nAlso my cat sits on my keyboard a lot which is a real difficulty and I want you to know that. It's an ongoing challenge and makes it hard to type.

Norris\nWhy a female cosplay calendar?  \nI had a last-minute opportunity to make this calendar a reality in conjunction with Men vs Cosplay (which funded earlier this year). I sent out a call for help, and I got enough cosplayers to fill the calendar! Now, we're at the part where we get to fund the print version! In general, the Women vs Cosplay project is a fantastic way to represent the diversity of the female cosplay community. The calendar also helps folks meet new cosplayers, get inspiration from them, and introduce them to new fandoms. Many also use the calendar as a way to introduce the hobby to family, friends, and co-workers.     \nMy overall hope is that the calendar inspired you over 2017 and beyond with our incredible roster!\nFunding Breakdown\n We are a fan project! Our calendar goal funding will go directly to:\nCalendar Production: As we work with a commercial printer, we need to do a minimum order of 1k calendars, hence the cost. \nT-Shirt Printing & Swag: Estimate based on quotes from suppliers\nShipping: This number fluctuates based on backers, but we have a rough idea of what it will be!\nKickstarter Fees: Kickstarter and Stripe take from the funds for fees. This is unavoidable.\nExtra: Anything raised past 16.5k will go to: safety funds for any calendar production issues, extra swag, and back into the project to make 2017 the best we possibly can! \nWomen vs Cosplay Team\nAnabel Martinez (website) - I'm the Women vs Cosplay project founder! I'm a cosplay enthusiast and the project manager/wife for Allen Amis Creations. Since the project's inception, my husband has been incredibly supportive (and he handles most of the calendar packing/t-shirt folding! I'm also a graphic designer and artist, so my love of creativity naturally extended into cosplay when I got involved in the hobby. \nRaven Cruz aka RevengeLover (website) - Raven's a mind-blowing artist and graphic designer with major industry clients, but she also takes the time for fan-run projects like ours (she's been with us since our first project!). She helps me with the project's art direction (calendar layout, exclusive art for t-shirts/pins, feedback) and is part of the beating heart of WvC. \nEmma Lysyk (website) - Emma is an incredibly talented artist and graphic designer (and overall production ninja!) who will be taking on the mammoth task of the calendar build and more! Not only is she building the Women vs Cosplay calendar, she's handling the male one as well!  \nSam Mort (website) - Sam is incredibly passionate about cosplay photography and helps the project with promotional shoots, video work, and more. He is currently available this fall for cosplay shoots (throwing in a shameless plug for him as well here).\nWomen vs Cosplay Planning Group (everyone is welcome to join!) - This is where we talk about Women vs Cosplay related stuff year-round. Everyone in this group has been invaluable in providing feedback as we expand to our ladies edition!\nCosplayer: Velissedra | Photography: Juan Carlos Bayas\nHow You Can Help! \nWant to help us spread the word on the project?

On a country estate outside Moscow, a colorful band of eccentrics, aristocrats, debutantes, civil servants, and former slaves stand on the brink of social, political and economic changes that will alter their lives forever. As the older generation clings desperately to a deteriorating way of life, the younger one pushes onward toward an uncertain, exhilarating future. By turns poignant and hilarious, sober and irreverent, Chekhov\u2019s play deftly illustrates that the only constant we face as human beings is change. How we embrace \u2014 or reject \u2014 that change ultimately defines our destiny.\nABOUT THE SEAGULL PROJECT\nThe Seagull Project is a multi-generational ensemble of actors, directors and designers representing the full range of theatrical experience \u2014 from seasoned veterans to up-and-coming rookies \u2014 with these common traits: a passion for process and a dedication to craft. Our company uses the work of Anton Chekhov to challenge, redefine and inspire the modern theater through intensive process, inventive productions, and international collaboration. \nphoto by Megumi Shauna Arai\nHOW WE WORK\nFrom the very beginning, The Seagull Project has developed and refined our unique process for bringing Chekhov\u2019s work vividly to the stage. And for The Cherry Orchard, we have pulled out all the stops: an 18-month workshop dedicated to training and developing ourselves in a common approach to movement, voice, and text.\nDirector John Langs in a training workshop (Photo by Truman Buffett)\nSeagull Project Artistic Director Gavin Reub says, \u201cChekhov\u2019s final play was written on the edge. Edge of his health, edge of Modernism, edge of decade long revolution. As a company, we find ourselves on the edge as well. In our workshops, we experiment with how brave we can be. We can play to the 19th century mentality. Or we can follow Chekhov\u2019s mind through the generations, and discover what it means to be push ourselves to the edge of our own potential.\u201d\nSeagull Project Artistic Director Gavin Reub (Photo by John Ulman)\nWhat makes The Seagull Project acting ensemble special is our common approach to preparation. Our actors train regularly in Viewpoints method, Suzuki, Michael Chekhov character development, and vocal work based on techniques developed by Patsy Rodenburg. We also engage in \u00e9tudes practice, in which members of the cast create mini-dramas that explore private or subtextual character moments. These dramatic scenes are sharp, daring explorations that draw out the subtle moods within Chekhov's text. \u00c9tudes allow the ensemble to build the offstage life of the characters, lending nuance and complexity to onstage performances. \nAlex Matthews and others in a training workshop\n  Sylvester Kamara & Brandon J. Simmons in Suzuki training\nOUR FIRST PRODUCTIONS\n All of this preparation has paid off with two successful productions \u2014 The Seagull, in 2013: \n And The Three Sisters in 2015, for which we were honored with the Gregory Falls Award for Outstanding Production:\nTOURING TO TASHKENT\nIn 2014, The Seagull Project received an unprecedented $50,000 U.S. State Department grant and the distinction of being the first American theater company invited to perform in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, at the Ilkhom Theatre's inaugural American Theater Festival. For nearly three weeks, our company taught workshops and attended performances by the renowned company at the Ilkhom. At the end of our stay, we performed The Seagull for two sold-out houses of Russian-speaking theatergoers. \nAt the Ilkhom Theatre, Tashkent, Uzbekistan\n WORLD CLASS THEATER FOR A WORLD CLASS CITY\nAfter two celebrated productions in Seattle and one international tour, The Seagull Project is poised and prepared to continue our mission of establishing Seattle as an international hub for Chekhov performance through the rigorous development of our ensemble and a singular focus on producing world-class productions.\nThe Cherry Orchard is the inevitable next step toward our goal of establishing an American Chekhov Festival in Seattle. Our plan is to present all four of Chekhov's major plays during a month-long celebration of Chekhov's life and work through film, lecture, art installation, dance, and other local, national and international collaborations.\nIf you're a returning supporter, thank you. And if you're a first time backer, welcome!\nARTIST PARTNER: CAROL ROCAMORA\nWe are thrilled to partner with Carol Rocamora and have committed to working exclusively with her superb translations of Chekhov's work. Carol will be visiting us for the run of The Cherry Orchard. And you have a chance to meet her! (See Backer Rewards.)\nCarol Rocamora\nDr. Carol Rocamora, translator, director, and teacher, founded the Philadelphia Festival Theatre for New Plays at the Annenberg Center, a nonprofit professional theatre. She served as its artistic and producing director from 1981 to 1994. She has worked with more than 120 contemporary playwrights, developing and producing their new work for the stage. At the Philadelphia Festival Theatre, she directed many main stage productions of new plays, as well as directed the premieres of her four new translations of Chekhov's plays. She served on the faculties of Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, and the University of Pennsylvania. She currently teaches theater at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.\nDONOR PARTNER: LAURA CHRISMAN\nProfessor Laura Chrisman, who serves on The Seagull Project board, is the granddaughter of renowned fine artist Byron Randall. She has generously donated several pieces of Randall's art for this campaign. (See Backer Rewards). Byron Randall (October 23, 1918 \u2013 August 11, 1999) was an American West Coast artist, well known for his expressionist paintings and printmaking. He shared the company and the left-wing politics of such contemporary artists as Pablo O'Higgins, Anton Refregier, Robert \"Mac\" McChesney, Emmy Lou Packard (his second wife), and Pele de Lappe (his final companion). As a visual artist, he explored a wide range of different techniques and styles and is particularly well known for his vivid use of color and line. His work can be found in the permanent collections of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Phillips Collection, the Hallie Ford Museum of Art, the Schneider Museum of Art, the Bolinas Art Museum, the Janet Turner Print Collection and Gallery, and the Oakland Museum of California.\nFor more information on Byron Randall, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Randall\nByron Randall\n  A Byron Randall painting, \"Hawaii Still Life with Lily and Bones\"\n  A Byron Randall blockprint, \"Holly and Lamp: red\"\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Seagull Project is a company that delivers.

VR stands for virtual reality; each of these films are being created as 360 films that you watch in a headset for a fully immersive experience. Our first piece, Eagle Bone screened at Toronto International Film Festival as one of five pieces chosen from around the world. We were chosen among projects that had budgets that dwarf our project which was made for next to no money and relied upon sweat equity.\nThe Projects\nCh'aak' S'aagi (Eagle Bone) \n\nDirector - Tracy Rector\nFeaturing the voices of Ken Workman and Nahaan, Eagle Bone is a collective step in a new direction of visual storytelling rooted in being unapologetically Indigenous. Through freestyle spoken word and lush Pacific Northwest scenes, the viewer experiences a VR journey of remembrance and reflection on the lessons of the old ones. Teachings that remind us that we are all individual vessels of spirit and change, yet inextricably connected.\nPOWER \nDirector - Lynn Shelton \nCast: Cherdonna Shinatra, Matt Smith, Jody Kuehner \nA VR experience created by award-winning filmmaker Lynn Shelton. Part improvised narrative, part performance art, POWER deals with authority, wealth, vulnerability, drag queens, and more. Featuring the amazing Cherdonna Shinatra!\n  Experience PRIDE\nDirector: Dacia Saenz\nThe pilot episode in an eventual VR doc series of intimate portraits of LGBTQ community members sharing stories of times they were alienated and/or discriminated against, illustrated by comic artist Robyn Jordan. The project invites viewers to immerse themselves in the experiences of those who have been marginalized, discriminated against, and then step into an environment flooded with acceptance, celebration and pride--specifically, footage of the Seattle PRIDE parade.\nDom: A Story of Rebellion\nDirector: Netsanet Tijrongo\nAn immersive doc experience where viewers meet Evanna, a black dominatrix who gives us a glimpse of what it's like to be under her control.\nSlow Moving Houses\nDirector: Mischa Jakupcak\nA comedic, dreamlike cinematic journey about a young girl who interrupts a stranger at his lowest moment and leads him through a surreal discovery, proving his life is not over yet.\nArcadia Flats\nDirector - Joe Jacobs\nCast: Jessica Martin, Evan Mosher, Marc Kenison A short VR horror film about a young woman struggling with a newly discovered condition that puts her--and everyone she comes into contact with--in grave danger.\nOur first project, the poetic documentary experience Eagle Bone, was selected to screen as one of only five VR films at the recent Toronto International Film Festival. It was made with sweat equity and we need funds to compensate the amazing performers for their contributions, and send director Tracy Rector to other film festivals. \nFor our other projects, POWER and Arcadia Flats have both been filmed. But to complete them, we need some resources to finish post production. \nDom, Experience Pride, and Slow Moving Houses are all budgeted at next to nothing, but there are some hard costs we can't get around. These include rental of spaces for the locations, food and catering for our crew and small stipends for actors.\nHello Mechanical Dreamers!\nWe have another video to share with you. This one is highlighting Arcadia Flats, the werewolf thriller piece written and directed by Mechanical Dream's own Joe Jacobs!\nWith less than 50 hours to reach our goal, we want to take this time and thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for your support. Please help us spread the word about our Kickstarter so we can successfully see all of our projects through to completion.\nIn the meantime, don't be too scared...Enjoy sneak peak of Arcadia Flats...\nWho are we? \nMDVR Team at Gasworks Park, Seattle\nMDVR was founded by five filmmakers: Lacey Leavitt, Mischa Jakupcak, Joe Jacobs, Mara Auster, and Chris Mosson. Our backgrounds include everything from award-winning Sundance feature films to high-end, glossy commercials. We're so excited about the new VR medium, and the new storytelling possibilities it's opened up. We're equally excited about starting a new industry with equality in mind.

The Altered:Nozzle is the worlds most extreme water saving nozzle. It installs easily into your existing tap. By atomizing water we can use 98% less water and still retain full functionality. And if you need a little more, then you switch to our regular saving mode. Still 75% savings, but all the water you need.\nMist & Save Mode\nFits into your existing tap.  \nSuper easy installation. 30 sec.\nPays for itself in a couple of months! \nMultiple finishes and sizes.   \nLead Free Eco Brass\nPerfect for kitchen and bathroom taps everywhere. In your home, your boat, at the office, in your vacation home or wherever you have a tap and want to save water.  \nWater stress is a truly global issue affecting over one billion people today, and an estimated 3 billion in 2020. It is a problem we need to do something about. This is our small contribution to this huge issue.\nPLAY\n\nThe old solution for saving water has been to restrict the flow of water. But that only works up to a point. When you're left with only a drizzle, you need a shift in technology. We looked at the problem from another perspective. Instead of restricting water, we wanted to use as much of the water coming out of the tap as possible. The issue with regular taps is that you only use a fraction of the water coming out of your faucet. It bounces of the surface of your hands or plates. Or even worse, it just passes right by and straight down the drain.\nPLAY\n\nWhen atomizing the water we break it up into millions of tiny droplets. Creating a high speed, heavy mist, shooting out of your tap. This increases the surface area of the water drastically and makes it possible for you to come in contact with almost all of the water coming out of your tap. \nPLAY\n\nThe result was even more extreme than we thought. We could have full functionality in washing hands, greens, doing dishes, brushing teeth etc, with only 2% of the water compared to a standard saving tap!\nOne big issue. 2% is not so great when it takes 2 minutes to fill a glass of water. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed a switch to a more regular Saving Mode. You still save 75% compared to your old tap, but you get all the water you need. Perfect for filling glasses, pots and pans.\nPLAY\n\nBeing good to the environment should not have to mean being bad at design. The faucet is part of our interior design, something we spend a lot of money on. So if it doesn\u2019t look good sitting at the end of your tap, then it\u2019s just going to end up in some drawer. And there it won\u2019t do much good at all.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the design of the Altered:Nozzle. We wanted it to stand out and make a statement, but at the same time it needed to look as an integrated part on a variety of different faucets. Finally we ended up with this drop shape. It clearly makes a visual statement at the same time as it makes it easy to switch between Mist and Saver Mode. \nFirst of all we think you should feel great about having saved the planet a bunch of water. But lets talk specifics. Even compared to the lowest limit of the Water Sense US standard, the Altered:Nozzle saves you up to 98%. And except for saving water, that means less energy and emissions to heat and transport the water. That is great for planet Earth. But it is also great for you. For an average household in Europe this translates to savings of \u20ac203/year. In US that number is around $255/year. Basically, you\u2019ve just bought a great looking product that pays for itself within a couple of months.\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign we will contact you so you can choose the finish and size you like for your very own Altered:Nozzle.The Altered:Nozzle will be available in the finishes below.\nIf you think it is difficult measuring your existing aerator, you can easily determine the size with the help of a nickel and dime. First remove the insert and washer from the inside of the aerator. Set a nickel on top of the aerator, and if it\u2019s almost the same circumference, the aerator is a regular size. If it\u2019s not a regular size aerator, use a dime. The dime will fit inside a junior size aerator and will sit on top of a Tom Thumb size aerator. \nThe Altered:Nozzle fits into your existing tap and it takes less than 30 seconds to change it.\nPLAY\n\nApproximately 18% of the water used in our homes is water running through our taps. That is equivalent to 32 gallons per household per day. If we do the math and look at some of the most water stressed cities in the world, that means: 40 million gallons running through the taps in Los Angeles, 50 million gallons in Rio de Janeiro, 220 million in Tokyo and 240 million gallons in Shanghai. \nEvery Day.\nAnd most of it straight down the drain.\nThere are already millions of faucets in the world. That\u2019s why we've developed the Altered:Nozzle to easily install into your existing faucet in just 30 seconds. By altering your existing faucet, rather than buying a whole new one, we get the same effect at a fraction of the cost. It also means lots and lots more people can buy our product. And that in turn means we can save a lot more water which is kind of the point. Saving money. Saving resources. Saving water. Sounds good to us!\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since Kaj first got the idea of atomizing water in the faucet. We have a final product, produced by the final manufacturer and we have come out and met the market. It has really been a long road, but we are so excited to finally get the Altered:Nozzle out to you. We believe that water is a basic human right. We must find ways to get clean water to all people in the world. It is not enough just saving water. We must find ways of only using exactly what we need. That\u2019s what the Altered:Nozzle is about. We also think water stress is such a huge issue that we must find many small solutions in order to have a chance to solve the problem. It\u2019s not a single solution problem. This is our small solution. We hope you love it as much as we do.\nMikael, Kaj and Johan\nWe have a small core team of founders who are all experienced professionals in various fields.

Glad to say that all work well and do as advertised. All metal and no plastic which is good and inspiring for long life. Took a while to work out how to put them on, the instructions were next to useless, and frankly its a bit fiddly but the videos helped immensely. The mist mode is rather an EXTREME water saving mode, and most of the time we alternate between mist and flow, mostly flow. Mist is useless in the kitchen as it it too severe, but flow is good if you can manage the splashing back at times. Unfortunately the nozzel handle keeps falling off as the hex key doesn't actually screw into anything. (As others have pointed out, must be a design flaw). On a few taps we've left it off as the flow mode is whats used anyway, and got sick of putting it continually back on which makes it look like an unfinished home handyman product without the handle. Am thinking about testing to secure the handle with a drop of silicone or something. In some ways we are the beta testers, but surely the securing of handle could have been predicted as a basic engineering problem. The bottom line is that we are still saving a heap of water from the taps, which is good, but the product desperately still needs further refinement and some alterations for the next models to be able to justify the price. Id suggest some redesigns in regards to the attachment of the handles, simpler way to install, better installation videos, and changing to a graded switch rather than just flow or mist.

This is a great problem to have!\nWe have found a wonderful home for our brick-and-mortar shop in the Phinney Ridge neighborhood of Seattle, but we need a community boost to get there! This space is warm and airy, with gorgeous hardwood floors, high ceilings and great big windows to let in lots of light. The venue is fully ADA-accessible, so all our friends will be able to come visit. It's very important to us that no one feel left out or unwelcome in our new home!\nTo make this dream a reality, we need to raise $40,000. These funds will be used as follows:\nRent and deposit to secure a space\nBuild-out of USDA-compliant blending area\nIncrease in inventory\nProper storage for said inventory\nInstallation of a lovely tasting counter\nFurniture for product display\nFurniture and games for our gaming corner\nPOS/cash register\nLegal fees (permits, licenses, etc.)\nInsurance and security\nSignage and shop decor\nHiring an accountant\n\nWe are in the process of  looking for a lovely space to build our shop. We have a clear and dear-to-our-hearts vision for our expansion. Lots of light and a friendly atmosphere will be waiting for you at our community tea shop/gaming hotspot/your new living room.\nWe feel super confident you will love our new home. We plan to be very much involved in the community. In addition to regular store hours and free tasting at any time, we will feature the following perks:\nRegular organized game nights\nSame goes for craft nights\nAnd book club!\nSpecialized workshops on pairing, blending, etc.\nParticipation in neighborhood Art Walks\nHosting local art on our walls\nCustom on-the-spot blending\nEducational focused tea tastings for you and your friends!\nWe've never been able to offer these things to you, our friends, due to being restricted to online sales or busy convention dealer's halls. This expansion will allow us to give you so much more!\nPlease do spread the word. We have a large goal here, and this expansion really is about community! It will sincerely be such a pleasure to see you all in our new home.\nNow for the fun stuff: Stretch Goals!\nIf we reach $42,000 we will give ALL BACKERS a randomized sample pack in addition to their selected backer reward!\nIf we reach $45,000 we will take a community vote on our first Featured Artist!\nIf we reach $48,000 we will take a community vote on a new collection of blends to release at our grand opening!\nIf we reach $50,000 we will host an elegant Celebration Soir\u00e9e, open to all!\nHappy Sipping!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nObviously, opening a retail boutique comes with some risk. A brick-and-mortar operation carries significantly higher overhead. This means we need to seriously up our sales game in order to make this expansion sustainable in the long run, or face going out of business. Scary!\n\nNo need to worry overly, friends. We have plans in place to help us ramp up revenues to the level we'll need to stay open. Our diversification plan will allow us to bring in a whole new demographic of customers. Our intended neighborhood is all about supporting local small business, and the foot traffic is to die for. If we secure the location we want, we'll be only a couple blocks south of the Phinney Ridge Community Center and Red Mill Burgers, and only a handful of blocks north of the Woodland Park Zoo! There are no other tea shops in the vicinity, so we really will have the market to ourselves in that part of town.\n\nWorking out of this new venue will also enable us to distribute our product to retail outlets such as Whole Foods and PCC, as well as greatly increasing our wholesale customer base.

For the current campaign check the updates or go to www.mythicavr.com\nThe promise of virtual reality has finally been realized, and exploring a dungeon in virtual reality is everything you dreamed it could be. The first time you put up your sword to block the blow of an attacking orc, and it feels as real as life, you know that there is no going back to the dice rolls of table-top gaming or the controller clicking of video gaming.\nThere is a hugely important element missing from current virtual reality role playing options, however, and that is your party, your questing buddies, your ka-tet. It's a lonely world without them, and when you're being overwhelmed by a horde of undead skeletons and you hear the battle cry of your friend as he hacks his way in and saves you, you know there is no going without them.\nWe also cannot forget the crucial role played by the game master, the creator of worlds, the dungeon lord, the spawner of monsters, the voice of NPCs. A static world is just that, static, without the game master there to pull the strings and breathe life to the monsters and NPCs.\nWe are excited to bring the complete experience of role playing to you, the way you always dreamed it could be, with Mythica VR.\n  Mythica VR will be released on Steam on the PC, and in the Android Play Store, and iOS App Store. On the PC it can be played with an HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or DK2. On mobile it can be played with a Google Cardboard compatible headset, and we plan to support Google Daydream.\n    Create your character, then join with your friends, or get matched with other players at the same experience level as your character, and play a quest together. A quest may be a one-off or may be part of a larger campaign that you can work through, slowly leveling up your character so that you can take on harder and harder quests. \n   The map builder can be used in two ways, either as a traditional desktop top-down map editor, using the mouse to create rooms and place items and monsters, or you can build the quest around you in virtual reality, walking around the dungeon creating rooms, and placing items and monsters. A simple trigger system will allow you to add logic to your quests.\nFor those who like to create story-rich worlds, you can string quests together into campaigns, where players have to complete each quest to progress.\nIf you are joining the quests with your players you can control all aspects of your quests as they are playing, including spawning items and monsters. You can even control your NPCs and monsters in real-time, acting with your motion controllers and voicing your NPCs.\n   With headsets that support room-scale, like the HTC Vive, you can walk around the room as normal for close range exploration and combat, and for moving outside of the area you have available you can teleport by pointing your motion controller at your destination and pushing a button, much like you can on most current Vive games that support exploration.\nFor headsets with no positional support, like Google Cardboard, you can use two other phones as your motion controllers, networked over wifi to give their orientation and acceleration, much like Wii Motion Plus controllers. With these you can wield your weapons and shield, and also point to a location to teleport. Your old cracked-screen phones finally have a purpose. You may also optionally enable touching a button on of one of your hand controllers to move forward if you happen to be immune to motion sickness.\n Why Teleport?\nAfter trying a number of locomotion options teleport feels the most natural and offers the least possibility of motion sickness. It has been adopted by most room-scale virtual reality games. We will keep our eyes open for better options. Positional tracking for phones is on the horizon and we'll be sure to implement that technology as soon as it is available.\nHow will it look when other players teleport? \nYou will see a streak of color from their origin to their destination. Each player will display as a different color when teleporting.\nMythica is a series of five fantasy films created by Arrowstorm Entertainment. Each one has received successful funding on Kickstarter thanks to loyal and generous fans. We are excited to bring those fans the world of Mythica in a whole new way, and many other worlds, and to introduce Mythica to those who haven't yet heard of the films. Watch the trailers for the Mythica films here.\nIn addition to campaigns created by game masters, Mythica VR will include a story-rich campaign set in the world of Mythica, created by the screenwriters of the Mythica series and featuring the characters that you've come to love from the Mythica series.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers and game producers, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film and game we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there's others out there like us, who we aim to please. You can learn more about our philosophy and our projects at our website.\n  Music is a crucial part of bringing the atmosphere, and Mythica VR will include a number of atmospheric and epic tracks that game masters can use in their campaigns. The tracks are created to have sections for exploration, build-up, combat, climax, resolution, etc. As well as being automatically triggered, the game master can use triggers in the map editor to start certain parts of the music.\nThe music is being created by talented composer and producer Seth Joshua. Here is a track he created for us for our Kickstarter. Imagine it in the background as your gaming party is exploring a village.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating a game is a complicated technical exercise, and often unforeseen difficulties arise, causing budget and scheduling overruns. To mitigate these risks we will be following a few helpful processes:\n\n* We will be following an agile development methodology. That means releases early and often. Those backers who selected the \"Early Release\" reward can expect to receive the game as soon as it is playable and receive updates often after that. \n* We will design the servers so that they can optionally be hosted by players. We don't want you to have to worry that if we run out of budget that you can no longer play. The servers will be designed from the start to be able to be hosted by players so you don't have to rely on our infrastructure. \n* We will not spend money on art until the game is playable. Gameplay comes first with us, and the Unity asset store has great assets we can use until we are sure we are not going to run out of budget for software engineering. \n\nAnd, we are proud to declare that Arrowstorm has delivered on every Kickstarter we have ever funded that has come due for delivery!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Arrowstorm Entertainment\n16 created \u00b7 82 backed\nArrowstorm Entertainment is a team of independent filmmakers and game producers committed to providing high-quality entertainment in the...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wallpaper and song", "descp": "Our gratitude, a Mythica VR desktop wallpaper, and an mp3 of our main title theme from the soundtrack.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2016"}], "stat": ["37 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Mythica VR", "descp": "The game on release, for PC with the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, or iOS or Android with Google Cardboard.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["154 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Early Release", "descp": "For those who're eager to start we're offering early access to the game, and continual updates as it is being developed.

Of course, also do more traditional play-through demos or discussions with large screen of the in-game environment and a small rectangle in the corner of the player on camera.

INCURSION: Knightmare saw the team on their first training mission, a simple cleanup of a small nest of new vampires. That mission turned out to be something worse. \nIn this new book, the Section 28 team is up against an enemy of a different kind. A popular fae-only nightclub is attacked, all the fae present are slaughtered, and Section 28 is blamed. It is up to Team Knightmare, with the help of a new recruit and an observer from across the ocean, to prove that humanity is innocent before the fae declare war.\nThere is a fae war brewing, and humanity is stuck in the middle. Can Team Knightmare save humanity from the fae?\nWhat will happen with the funding?\nThere are three major reasons I'm asking for the funding:\nPrint Books - I'm using this project to fund the purchase of an initial print run of the books, both softcover, and hardcover.\nMarketing Materials - I'll be designing and producing marketing materials (such as flyers and bookmarks) as well as purchasing internet ads to promote the new book.\nGrand Rapids Comic-Con - I've been accepted to Artist Alley at GR Comic-Con this year (October 21-23, 2016) and will be using the funding to purchase supplies and peripheral materials for the show, plus extra books and promotional items. \nREWARDS\nSupport Staff Pledge $1 or more Thank You!

Even though there were delays in editing, everyone did get their product.\n\n2. Editing: The book is going to editing just after this Kickstarter goes live. I will do my very best to make the deadlines, and I have taken specific steps to do so.\n\n3. The Book: This is not my first book.

The Suppliers: I've used all my suppliers before - and the biggest one is Amazon. I know their tech specs and requirements and currently use their services to produce my other books.

You can see and buy my art on sites like Redbubble. I am also a gamer of the RPG, video game, and board varieties.  I'm not a starving artist, but I'm very hungry. \nMy Project: Dungeons After Dark\nI'm making an adult coloring book called Dungeons After Dark. Adult coloring books are a relaxing and meditative way to transition from a difficult day at work, and a great way to connect with your inner child. This particular adult coloring book is of fantasy creatures and races in pin-up poses. A few are in action poses; all are just being their sexy selves.\nHere are some images that will be in the book: \nSize isn't everything, but check out those steins!\n  Got wood?\nA whole lotta goblin goin' on.\nHow My Twisted Mind Works\nOne day I was playing a role-playing game (RPG) with my regular group. (Spelljammer, if you're curious.) In the game my friend Soranna is a gnome with a slight obsession with dwarves and halflings. In game, as a gift someone gave her a flask with a dwarf in a pin-up pose etched on it. I decided to draw a picture of that dwarf. She was delighted and several people around the table said that they would be happy to buy a book or coloring book of similar images. Thus an idea was born.    \nWhen I Plan to Spend the Gold\nAs soon as this Kickstarter successfully concludes, I'll order a print run of 500+ copies of Dungeons After Dark from a printing company. I will also provide electronic copies through the awesome people at DriveThruRPG. \nI have a great deal with a printer in China, but I'm hoping that a local printer will be able to print for a similar (though likely higher) price. Assuming that the printing is started within a month of the Kickstarter's end, I think that copies should be in the mail by the end of October. If it gets drastically overfunded, most if not all copies should be mailed before Christmas.\nHow I Plan to Spend the Gold\nThe entirety of the funding goal will cover printing, packaging, and postage. More than that will be profit to pay for my work and time. Extravagant overfunding will allow me to swim in a pond of money like Scrooge McDuck.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have already completed final art on the book, including the cover.

That means those who have backed to get all the new material will get FOUR books, and that will be at least 1,000 pages of text and maps, ideas and mechanics! But we don't think that would be enough for our awesome supporters. If we hit that goal by the end of July we will be doubling down. Sixty complete characters, Four sets of Vehicle deck plans and three additional adventures, specifically designed for RPG or Miniatures play. \nThat means folks who supported for as little as 40 dollars will get a total of SEVEN books as PDFs, and everything they will need to start a campaign! Sixty characters for use as patrons, companions, enemies or ready made PCs in a pinch. Four vehicles to take those characters across the Earth, through the sky above it, across the oceans or through the darkness of space. What more can a referee need? \nPlease help spread the word! Help yourselves by helping us!\nBest Value Pledge! Pledge $40 or more and get the Full Electronic Library  \nFor a pledge of $40 or more you get The Full Electronic Library All six of the books (three existing and three from this project) as downloadable PDFs. You will get the three current books as soon as the Kickstarter finishes and then the other books as they are completed. We hope to have all three done by August of 2017. In addition you get any and all extra books we fund through this Kickstarter (which could be three or even more!) PLUS if we get to 100% by Midnight on the 4th of July we will add FIFTY complete characters as a FREE add on. But wait there is more! If we get to 100% by the 4th AND we get a supporter from Africa and one from South America we will ADD a group of TEN VILLAINS as well. So for 40.00 you get at least six and up to NINE (or even more) books, plus up to sixty full characters, all as PDF downloads. It will be at least 1,200 pages of material! Please take a look and help us spread the word! Thank you ESTIMATED DELIVERY: Aug 2017\nPlease help us fund the Second Edition of Stars of Empires, the Role Playing rules for the Hive, Queen and Country Victorian Science Fiction Universe. We plan three books, a 200-page Referee's Guide, a 150-page Player's Guide and a 250-page Ground Vehicle Sourcebook.\nIn 2016, a game publisher called Black Pigeon Press and I put out a Victorian Science Fiction Role Playing game titled Stars of Empire. We used their game engine and my Hive, Queen, and Country (HQC) setting. This fusion provided gamers with a tabletop experience where they could be challenged by the story and not by the rules. Unfortunately Black Pigeon Press closed its doors. Instead of letting the Hive, Queen and Country Universe just die I formed Aerolyth Enterprises LLC and began self publishing. With the help of a number of friends and a successful Kickstarter we've been able to produce a miniatures game and two source books. Now we would like to come full circle. With your help we will produce two core books, one for Referees and one for Players. \nBritish Infantry Fighting Machine ready to face The Hive\nTo support both Role Playing and Minaitures gaming we will also be producing the Land Fighting machines book for the HQC Universe, over 100 designs, 3D graphics, histories, orders of battle, tables of organization and equipment and color schemes! The book should run about 300 pages and will be out by June 2017. We have playtested at conventions across the country including Origins, Gencon, DragonCon, Diecon, Borderwars and Colonial Barracks.\nRole Playing or Miniatures Gaming; The Bugs make life challenging for players!\nRole Players and Miniatures Gamers will find this an extraordinary place to adventure, detailed and playable. We look to provide products that keep gamers interested in what's happening on the gaming table, not trying to find information in the game tables\nHow will the Second Edition be different? \nOriginal Back Cover of Stars of Empire\nThe original edition was 8 by 10 inches and had 286 pages. The new edition will be two core books totaling 350 pages and be 8.5 by 11 inches The original was black and white one column per page while the new edition will be in full color with two columns (easing readability considerably). The new game engine is optimized for Victorian adventure and is highly streamlined to speed play and allow for more storytelling. A new and much simpler template for creatures and NPCs will be provided that allows a referee to easily manage them during game play. The extra page count will allow us to detail the cultures of this universe in greater depth. \nAnimal Data Sheet\nA large amount of new material will assist referees in developing their own versions of the worlds we designed. We are including additional artists that will help players and referees visualize the characters, cultures and creatures with which they can interact. What will your money help us with? Your funds will help us purchase artwork and editorial services. \nWe are also looking to bring out the Ground Fighting Machines book in rapid succession. The designs for it are all nearly completed. It will contain pictures, designs, performance data, and background for over 85 ground vehicles. At least 20 of these will be available for purchase as 6mm or 15mm miniatures\nHow we are Different?\nThe Hive, Queen and Country Universe is a hard Science-Science Fiction setting. First published in 2010 the background has been researched and discussed for over a decade. The detailed Universe has been created by a community of Role Playing and Miniatures Gamers, historians, scientists, engineers, lawyers, rogues, vagabonds, and heroes, Hive, Queen and Country has unprecedented depth and scope, with the flexibility to allow you to set pretty much any sort of campaign your game master and players desire. We present a detailed and fully realized game universe: Steampunk with an emphasis on the Steam-not the punk! \nWHAT HAVE PEOPLE SAID ABOUT OUR PREVIOUS GAMES? \nThe Miniatures Page Readers Poll 2011-Best Science Fiction Supplement \nColonial Barracks 2014 Winner of Gunney Award for Most Cinematic Game \n2013 Winner of Gunney Award for Most Enjoyable Scenario \nComments from Amazon First Edition of Stars of Empire:\nI finally got to play in a game of this. It was great! The book gave the GM enough material to create a completely believable world and made it challenging to get through. The GM did the character generation and I felt that all were well balanced with skills and equipment. \nGreat game all around. I can't wait to play it again! Excellent work. Characters are believable. \nSettings are fantastic, yet realistic. Scenarios are engaging and well thought out. All in all a great work. \nFlying Machines of the Worlds 1902: \nThis is fun book packed with info, loads of fun just to sit and read. Would work for almost any system. \nFirst Edition of Stars of Empire: FOR WHOM THE GEAR TURNS\n . . . if you enjoy d-20 games and are looking for a Steampunk world to immerse yourself in, I would definitely check out this title. There are tons of creatures, settings and characters available to create interesting scenarios and keep you engaged. The tone is realistic and the story has gravitas, so be prepared to assemble a group of serious gamers to play with.\nFirst Stretch Goal\nMars as seen by the Victorians, as it exists in HQC\nAt 6,000 we will unlock The Explorer's Guide to the Solar System. This will be a 150 page volume with at least ten adventures, set on Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Each adventure will highlight the unique features of the world or region in which it is set and will include detailed maps and other game aids.\nSecond Stretch Goal\nRMS Royal Albert, the first Ewing and Stuart drive vessel\nThis unlocks at 9000.00. In HQC Space Travel starts in 1870 with an Imperial Russian expedition to the Moon. Engineers, scientists, visionaries and politicians never look back from there. By 1880 Mars and Venus have been reached and stations orbit both worlds. In those five years more people from Earth have been in space than in the entire \"Space Age\" of Our Timeline. This book will devote at least 200 pages to the first fifty years of Victorian Space travel! Stations, to and from orbit craft, long haul cargo freighters and passenger liners will share the book with sections on the war-craft of the period, which become more and more important as a sinister arms race takes hold on Earth and Venus.\nThird Stretch Goal\nAn early topographic map of the International City site, Western Equatoria Venus\nAt 12,000.00 we will give you the keys to the International City! The International City on Venus is a key hub for exploration and exploitation on that world. What would a planned metropolis that is at the intersection of the City Beautiful movement and fortress designs of such brilliant engineers as Brailmont, Jervois and Sere de Riverieres look like on a world as alien and dangerous as Venus? This will be in the format of a period travel guide, such as Baedeker's. Maps and detailed descriptions of locations and events will be included. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second attempt to Kickstart this project and the fourth, fifth and sixth books we are publishing at Aerolyth Enterprises. In our first Kickstarter we promised a 256 page full color book detailing Venus. We delivered a 309 page work, and with the exception of the signed book plates we delivered on time! \n\n\nIn the year since we ran this project we have worked on a lot of material we need to complete before these projects are ready. We have play tested at numerous conventions including Gencon. The basic outlines of both books are complete but we still need to format all the information, do continuity checks and produce a pair of products that are attractive and filled with usable information.\n\nWe have a number of artists that will work on this project, so we have every hope that if one should be unable to complete their work we will be able to find alternates.\n\nThe vehicle project has two authors, Terry Sofian and Arun Rodrigues. We have collaborated on a book already and work well together. Our skill sets overlap so we should be able to ensure completion of that item.\n\nSingle point failures exist with Arun and Terry. Arun is the lead person for the graphics and Terry is lead for the text and background. We do not anticipate any tremendous issues with that, both the first two projects are well along.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "A grateful thanks!", "descp": "Check the couch for spare change!

Watch Season 0 below!\nThe Gamers: Episode 1 is The Gamers project fans have been asking us for since Dorkness Rising.\nIn The Shadow Menace we\u2019re going back to what people loved about The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. Tabletop RPG comedy. Gamers sitting around the table, playing a roleplaying game, controlling fantasy characters. Then we cut to those fantasy characters and see what our actions are like as if they actually happened.\nAnd in this show, we\u2019re throwing in a twist. The fantasy world\u2026 is our own world! A modern fantasy. Gaming in the world you know, and what it looks like when you deal with real world situations through gaming mechanics.\nMark rolls up a new character\nWHAT ABOUT GAMERS 4 AND HOW DOES THIS SHOW FIT IN?\nWho remembers when Iron Man launched the Marvel cinematic universe? And then along came Thor. And Captain America. And slowly, we all began to realize that an AVENGERS movie might actually happen.\nGamers 4 is our Avengers. It's an epic team-up, assembled to conclude a story that began in 2002 with The Gamers, when we laid the seeds of a payoff that would bring everything full circle.\nWe laid more groundwork in Dorkness Rising.\nThen we expanded the mythology with Hands of Fate and Humans & Households. We put huge spoilers right in the middle of the screen and nobody caught them.\nNimble greats the Darkness characters\nNow we're continuing the story with The Gamers: The Series. We're putting the game pieces on the board and pushing them closer together. We're filling in the missing details, learning The Shadow's agenda, exposing the rules of the GAMERS universe. And of course, we're sitting a group of players down at a table, giving them a quest, and laughing hard at how their actions play out within the world of the game.\nIt's old-school meets new-school, with the gaming comedy that you crave, plus a heist-film twist, where we get to see how adventures set in our world would play out, especially with a savvy group of rules lawyers, munchkins, and story players.\nNimble puts the pieces together\nThis is the Gamers that fans have been asking for. And if we get to make this show, we get to pay off everything when Gamers 4 launches.\nWe've been doing this since we created the genre in 2002 with the original The Gamers. And we've been right there beside you, laughing with you the whole time. Now, geek is chic and there is a huge influx of fantasy and gaming films, shows, and even gaming themed episodes of existing shows. Some are great! But even now, with gaming in the mainstream, some make gamers the butt of the joke. We continue to love and respect gaming and gamers and want to make more stuff to laugh at *with* you for years to come.\nA mysterious ritual\nSO WHEN IS GAMERS 4?\nWe need three episodes (135 minutes total) to bring us from here to the events of Gamers 4. However, thanks to our Patreon supporters, we should be able to complete even more episodes of this show while Gamers 4 is in development. We can't rush the timeline for writing and planning Gamers 4, but we can tell as much of this story as possible while we're getting there.\n\u201cI backstab him with a ballista.\u201d \u2013 Nimble, the Thief\n\u201cSomeone finally understands us.\u201d \u2013 Gamers at every convention ever\nSince the original GAMERS film, we\u2019ve gone on to create classic roleplaying features like DORKNESS RISING and HANDS OF FATE, plus GAMERS shorts like HUMANS & HOUSEHOLDS and NATURAL ONE.\n  At the end of THE GAMERS, fantasy stereotypes Rogar, Nimble, Newmoon, and Ambrose\u2026 sorry, \u201cMagellan\u201d\u2026 accidentally stepped through a portal into our world, where they defeated their own players. They\u2019ve been stuck here ever since, without direction or purpose. Until now.\nA new gaming group has uncovered the group\u2019s old character sheets and the original GM\u2019s campaign notes. Now, the new players will set out to finish the story of the original Gamers as our heroes...\nencounter minions of The Shadow who have infiltrated our world\nsearch for a portal back to Fartherall\napply a dose of fantasy justice to evildoers across the multiverse\nCutting back and forth between the players at the table and the game, this first episode abuses line-of-sight rules, wrestles with grappling tables, and explores what happens when retro gaming meets sophisticated rules lawyers and when fantasy-world characters try to defeat modern villains.\nFeaturing the returning talents of Nathan Rice (Newmoon), Justin McGregor (Magellan), Phil M Price (Nimble), and Matt Shimkus (Rogar), we are also proud to introduce a new group of players:\nMegan \u2013 Anna Clausen, the gamemaster\nZach \u2013 Jay Irwin, Rogar's player\nCharlie \u2013 Maggie Ferguson-Wagstaffe, Newmoon's player\nJamie \u2013 Khanh Doan, Magellan's player\nBrad \u2013 Brandon Simmons, Nimble's player\nPlus a special appearance from Russell Hodgkinson (Z-NATION) as The Professor.\nAnd thanks to our monthly Patreon supporters, we have already completed a special Season 0 of the show to bridge the gap between the original film and now, which you can watch right here (Rogar Episode coming very soon. It's finishing up post production):\nBut this isn\u2019t just a show about the original film, THE GAMERS. While this series can stand entirely on its own for new gamers and fans to enjoy, it is also the next part of the meta-story, a saga that we\u2019ve been telling for fifteen years. This series runs concurrently with the events of THE GAMERS: HANDS OF FATE and leads directly into THE GAMERS 4, which will conclude the adventures of Joanna, Lodge, Cass, Gary, and Leo. But don\u2019t take our word for it: just watch this.\nIf you\u2019re a hardcore Gamers fan, this is where we lay the final pieces into place for the explosive GAMERS 4 finale. In this show we\u2019ll uncover The Shadow\u2019s mysterious agenda, explain the link between Fartherall and our world, and reveal secrets and connections that we set up in THE GAMERS and DORKNESS RISING. In other words, the pay-off begins! \nOur primary goal for this campaign is to raise enough money for the 45-minute pilot episode of THE GAMERS: SEASON ONE. Any extra funds raised will help increase our production value for this episode and help subsidize the cost of future Patreon-funded episodes, including a ridiculous DEMON HUNTERS and GAMERS crossover Christmas Special.\nIf you love THE GAMERS and want to help full episodes release on a regular basis, when this campaign ends we also encourage you to become a supporter of our monthly Patreon campaign. Our big goal is to receive enough ongoing Patreon support to stay in constant production on this series, rather than having to run multiple large Kickstarters throughout the year. Patreon supporters receive special benefits, including early access to new episodes, big discounts for add-ons in BackerKit, and producer credits.\nWHO ARE WE?\nWe are Dead Gentlemen Productions and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment.\nDead Gentlemen Productions began in 1999 with the production of DEMON HUNTERS. Based on that film\u2019s success, we went on to shoot a sequel, DEAD CAMPER LAKE, and followed up with THE GAMERS, REVAMPING DOYLE, HOUSE RULEZ, DORKNESS RISING, DEMON HUNTERS: ORIENTATION VIDEO, two editions of the DEMON HUNTERS RPG, and a DEMON HUNTERS online comic.\nZombie Orpheus Entertainment was founded in 2010, producing three seasons of JOURNEYQUEST, THE GAMERS: HANDS OF FATE, HUMANS & HOUSEHOLDS, NATURAL ONE, DARK DUNGEONS, ATTACKING THE DARKNESS, STROWLERS, and annual performances of THE GAMERS LIVE at Gen Con Indy.\nTHE GAMERS \"THE SHADOW MENACE\" is our latest collaboration between the two companies.\nThis season is produced by Don Early and Lindy Bousteld, written by Ben Dobyns, and directed by L. Gabriel Gonda, based on Matt Vancil\u2019s THE GAMERS.\nThe supplemental Pathfinder adventure is created by Rogue Genius Games, a small third-party publisher, supporting mostly Pathfinder and Mutants & Masterminds, but also ICONS, Savage Worlds, and Call of Cthulhu. Titles range from small one page products called \"#1 with a Bullet Point\" that list a few new themed items, feats, or spells, to Gingerbread Kaiju, an edible family board game.\nOwen K.C.

See below under Backerkit for more details.\nNOTE ABOUT SIGNED PRODUCTS: Signed products will NOT be available as add-ons in Backerkit.

You'll get to hang out with us, have photo opportunities, get stuff signed, and check out early footage of the show. You're responsible for your own transportation to Seattle and lodging, so plan ahead on this one!\n(or) Background Prop - Send us something unique that you'd love to have appear in the show. This is subject to prior approval. We will contact you after the campaign is over to work out what you're sending us. If we find whatever you send us to be deemed inappropriate (which won't happen if you follow our instructions... RIGHT???), we reserve the right to not use the prop. You pay for the shipping, including shipping and handling if you want it returned. We are not responsible for damage to your prop, or if its lost, stolen, etc\n(or) Virtual Rendezvous: Have a 60-minute VIRTUAL RENDEZVOUS ($80) with available creators or cast on Google Hangouts.

You get to name one of The Shadow's minions and it becomes canon in the world of Fartherall. Additionally the name will appear on a list of The Shadow's minions in the episode. We will create an audio recording of The Shadow saying your minion's name in some kind of line for use on your smartphone or computer. We will publish and publicly recognize all the backer-created minions of The Shadow once the episode releases. This Reward is now included in the $750 level and above.\n$500 Reward - Character Sheet Credit:\n\nChoose two of the $250 rewards, plus all lower-level rewards, and send us a photo of yourself (we will work with you on what kind of photo works best), and we will create a credit for you in the style of the character credits in the beginning of the show. \nExample of a Character Sheet Credit\n$500 Reward - Red Card: NEW! Choose two of the $250 rewards, plus all lower-level rewards, AND you receive a much-coveted Red Card. This allows you to flag bad puns, off-color remarks, or other violations by our cast and crew, both from set and in-person at conventions. We'll send that person to time out, sub in somebody new, and film and upload the results for you.

Plus, by popular request, at $2000 and above we're also including a full size Mark the Red cardboard cutout standee!!! As always, you will be responsible for your own lodging and transportation, as well as to arrive on set on the day we schedule you. So check your September calendars now!\n\n This is really important, so read carefully:  \nWe will charge for all shipping after the campaign in BackerKit. In order for your rewards to ship, you will need to pay shipping fees at that time. Do NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now.  \nThe Short Version\u2014  \nInternational Backers: expect to pay less than $9.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $55 reward. \nDomestic Backers: expect to pay less than $5.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $55 reward. \nThe Long Version, for people who like details\u2014 \nInternational Backers: we are working with a third-party agency to fulfill your orders from warehouses in Europe, Canada, and Australia. This should help cut your typical U.S. shipping costs by a huge margin. However, please be aware that you may still be responsible for import duties, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Duties will not be included in your shipping charge, with one exception...\nEU Backers: We will include VAT for EU members when we charge for shipping in BackerKit. That way your package should arrive with much less hassle and holdup. And a bit faster as well.\nDomestic Backers: we want to get the best-possible shipping and handling rate for you. Rather than over-estimating expenses now, we will charge actual rates when we are ready to ship. \nAll Backers: by handling shipping this way, we reduce unknown costs now, which means we know exactly how much we can put into the production budget, and then we can use economy of scale to make specific shipping orders with exact details. \nWhat will shipping cost, you ask?\nInternational orders will average $.99 handling per item, plus local shipping costs. This should still be much less than you have paid in the past. (For example, in 2013 our cost to ship a DVD internationally began at $8.59 and went up from there as the weight increased.) Unfortunately, we cannot calculate this more precisely until we know our volume and can negotiate for the best rate possible. \nDomestic orders will start at the current Media Mail rate for a five ounce parcel, plus a minimum of $.25 handling per item. You can estimate that shipping will begin around $3.99, plus more for larger or heavier packages that include more than a DVD. Again, we'll use our volume to negotiate for the best-possible quote.\nADD-ONS & BACKERKIT\nWhat is BackerKit?\nWhen the Kickstarter campaign is over, we will need to finalize the details of your rewards, your address, and that sort of thing. That happens in the form of a survey that we email out through BackerKit. When you fill that out, you will have an opportunity to purchase add-ons to your reward. You'll be charged shipping for the Kicsktarter reward, and for the additional items you pick up. So it's kind of like the checkout stand at the store. \nWhen will the survey be sent out?\nNot for at least 30 days after the Kickstarter ends. We're buggering off to Gen Con in Indianapolis after the campaign ends, and when we get back we will be gearing up for production... so super busy. Once the dust settles we should be able to get the survey out to you so you can pick up some tempting add-ons, which will help raise more money for the project. So make no mistake, we want to get this out the door asap.\nAdd-ons\nIn Backerkit you will find add-ons and exclusives, such as:\nExclusive T-shirt(s)\nDigital Downloads\nSoundtracks\nRewards available at higher levels that aren't limited or signed, such as the Bag of Holding\nThe previous films like: \nThe Gamers: Director's Cut DVD\n  The Gamers: Dorkness Rising Special Edition DVD\n  The Gamers: Dorkness Rising Definitive Edition BluRay\n  The Gamers: Hands of Fate DVD\n  Humans & Households and Natural 1 DVD\n  The Gamers Live 2012 DVD\n  The Mask of Death Pathfinder Adventure\n  The Shadow's Dungeon Pathfinder Adventure\n And more!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any film project, there's a ton of things that could go wrong that we just can't plan for. And with any Kickstarter, there may be delays, challenges, changes, and whatnot that may occur in trying to fulfill the rewards. This is not our first rodeo, thankfully. We've been through giant storms, generators catching fire, last minute casting changes, and toddlers helping to pack packages. \n\nBetween Zombie Orpheus Entertainment and Dead Gentlemen Productions, we have EXTENSIVE experience with this process. We know how to communicate when delays or the unexpected comes up. We're prompt in responding to backer inquiries, and we know how to deliver on our promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "NPC", "descp": "Get backer-exclusive updates, and backer access to rewards in BackerKit after the campaign is over.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2016"}], "stat": ["106 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "CREDIT", "descp": "We'll thank you by name in the END CREDITS, you get EARLY ACCESS to stream new episodes, and you get a printable digital poster.\nIncludes previous reward\nINCLUDES:\nName in CREDITS\nEARLY ACCESS to stream new episodes\nDIGITAL POSTER\nBacker-exclusive updates\nBacker-access to add-ons in BackerKit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2016"}], "stat": ["434 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "DIGITAL DOWNLOADS", "descp": "You receive the HD DIGITAL DOWNLOADS ($15) of Season 0 (35 minutes) and Season One Episode One (45 minutes).\nIncludes previous rewards.\nWA Resident tax included\nINCLUDES:\nDIGITAL DOWNLOAD ($15)\nName in CREDITS\nEARLY ACCESS to stream new episodes\nDIGITAL POSTER\nBacker-exclusive updates\nBacker-access to add-ons in BackerKit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2016"}], "stat": ["1,005 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "THE DISCS", "descp": "Get the DVD & BluRay DISC PACKAGE ($20), which includes Season 0 (35 minutes), S1E1 (45 minutes), and the internationally acclaimed hit \"The Gamers\", the original 45min short film that started this series off over 15 years ago!\nYou also get the color PDF of \"The Gamers: The Module\" Pathfinder Adventure ($10), written by Rogue Genius Games!\nIncludes ALL PREVIOUS REWARDS.\nWA Resident tax included\nSHIPPING: We will charge for shipping in BackerKit when fulfillment begins, which allows us to keep those costs as low and as accurate as possible.

Now you can get extra rewards just for being a generous fan of quality comics.\n I've been involved in the roleplaying game industry for most of my career. I run my own freelance illustration company, James Stowe Illustration. Four years ago I started an online comic project called Sidekick Quests that combined my experience with roleplaying games with my love of illustration in a project that I could share with my kids and ideally other geeky parents could share with their kids.\nInitially I created a simplified version of 4th Ed. DnD for my then 6 year old son\u2019s birthday party. I had been toying around with some long form comic ideas and once people really started responding to the work I did for that party I decided to expand upon it.\nAnd now here we are. I really want Sidekick Quests to be a living roleplaying game. I find the idea of a comic that can be played as an ever changing and expanding roleplaying game setting is something I\u2019ve always wanted to play. And if it is also a way to introduce a new generation to tabletop RPGs, all the better. It was from the ideas and solutions I worked into those initial sheets that I developed Sidekick Quests, both as a comic and as a stand alone roleplaying game for kids. Two of the characters from the sheets (the ranger and the bard, see above) actually converted directly into characters in the comic (those being Benton the Scout and Dalea the Amateur Minstrel respectively. I have always enjoyed world building, so taking those sheets and creating an entire world around them was one of my favorite parts of the process. I have pages and pages of notes and thumbnail sketches about the World of Adventur (the setting of Sidekick Quests) and its denizens and lore.\n  Sidekick Quests is one of the great joys of the internet. Part roleplaying game, part web comic, it's unique, and delightful. Kids and parents alike will love James Stowe's lively, wonderful creation - as my daughter and I already do.\nJohn Kovalic - innovator of fantasy roleplaying comics since 1997, creator of Dorktower and Munchkin artist extraordinaire!\n(James Stowe\u2019s) world and characters captures imaginations in young and old alike. Sidekick Quests is doing a huge part to seed the next generation of tabletop gamers with positive messages and healthy table habits that encourage inclusiveness and fair play. You cannot go wrong laying down your hard-earned dollars on this campaign.\nBrian Patterson - creator of d20Monkey  \n(Sidekick Quests the Roleplaying Game) feels like the best game of DND you played as a twelve year old indoor kid, in all the best ways.\nChris O\u2019Neil - Kobolds Ate My Baby and 9th Level Games  \nSidekick Quests is engaging, dynamic, and everything that a kid's RPG should be. It's got old-school charm, indie sensibilities, and is just plain fun.\nTracy Barnett - Exploding Rogue Studios\nJames took what could've been a one-off internet meme and turned it into an earnest love letter to fantasy adventure.\nDaniel Solis - Creator of more fantastic indy tabletop games than you can shake a Kodama branch at.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is James Stowe's very first Kickstarter. While the updated comic and script for the adventure are complete the 10 bonus pages, art prints, and maps still need to be created and the adventure copy needs to be edited and laid out.Every publishing project carries risks. Sidekick Quests is created, illustrated, written, game developed and directed by one guy, James Stowe (with some amazing assistance from his editor/internet guru Anna Izenman and writing/playtesting help from his family) If James were to be struck my lightning or choke on a ham sandwich, it would have a big impact on the completion of this project than a larger company might see. Sidekick Quests uses outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks and delays there James can\u2019t foresee or control.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "Just 72 hours left on Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hello everyone!  \nThank you so much for your support.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, and have now just finished up production on Mythica 4 and 5, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, Mythica 2: The Darkspore and Mythica 3: The Necromancer have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers. Mythica 4: The Iron Crown digital rewards have been delivered, and physical rewards are currently being manufactured.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 5: The Godslayer - the final, and definitely the most epic Mythica film yet!\nYou can learn more about Mythica at: http://www.MythicaMovie.com\nOr join the Mythica fan group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/531601233681817/\nIf you missed the first four Mythica films and want to get them right away, you can order digital downloads here:\nhttp://watch.arrowstormentertainment.com/\nYou can order Blurays and DVDs here:\nhttps://mythica4.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Godslayer\nAs the Lich King's zombie legions ravage the world, a cursed young sorceress (Marek) embarks on a quest to obtain a weapon from the gods, with her friend Dagen, a self-serving half-elf rogue. But when she joins her sworn enemy in a desperate attempt to save the world, she must recover the good in herself before her friends are all dead, and defeat the Lich King before the gods are destroyed and the world forever enslaved.\nWatch the trailers for the first four Mythica films below!\n          Melanie Stone plays Marek, an escaped slave and natural-born necromancer. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, Riot, and Miracle Maker.\nKristian Nairn plays Tek, God of the Forge. Kristian is from Northern Ireland, and is a real-life giant, standing 6'11\" tall. He is a world-renowned DJ and actor, best known for his role as Hodor in Game of Thrones.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew's voice. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less than Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known to his scifi and fantasy fans for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars, Once I was a Beehive and Dudes and Dragons.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series. You can see her in the upcoming TV series, Age of the Living Dead.\nThe film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all under way. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, lots of magic, giant CGI sets, armies, etc. We want this finale of Mythica to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nYou may have noticed, we really stepped up the VFX game in Mythica 4, all because of your contributions. We want to really take it to the next level now, and are confident we can blow you away if you give us a chance.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $85,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $85,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better! PLUS, our films release at all different times around the world. Our Kickstarter backers usually get to see the finished product months ahead of the general public.\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there are others out there like us, who we aim to please.\nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 4, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :)\nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles:\nJason Faller - Writer/Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Writer/Executive Producer\nJohn Lyde - Director\nJennifer Griffin - Producer\nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and purchase our past projects on our website:\nwww.arrowstormentertainment.com\n$110,000 - MYTHICA BOARDGAME\nIf we reach $110,000 you will unlock the creation of an awesome Mythica boardgame, that will be available as an add-on in Backerkit.\n$400,000 - MYTHICA PREQUEL\nThis is an ambitious one, but let's all dream a bit. If we reach $400,000 in pledges, we will make a Mythica Prequel, featuring backstory's of your favorite characters. How did Marek meet Gojun? What was Dagen up to before he was an adventurer? What were Teela and Caeryn up to? Hammerhead? Gojun? Thane? Even Peregus and Qole... there's a lot of story to be told.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilm is a complicated technical exercise, and often unforeseen difficulties arise, causing budget and scheduling overruns. That being said, we are an experienced group and have successfully completed and released every film we have started.

A great deal of the risk in the project has already been mitigated, and we are too far along to turn back and give up. We are seeking funding to complete post-production, and have the personnel to pull it off, regardless of complications.\n\nAnd, we are proud to declare that Arrowstorm has delivered on every Kickstarter we have ever funded that has come due for delivery, 9-out-of-9!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "Fun New Project", "update_content": "Hi Friends!\n\nLongtime friend and creative collaborator Rob York has just launched a fun looking book series in the vein of Stranger Things meets Goosebumps.

Play as Luna, a young witch who overcomes obstacles with the potions she brews.\nEncounter fairy tale characters and stories from around the world in new settings and situations as you guide Luna on her quest to become a potions master.\nGrowing up is hard, and it\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re a witch! As Luna, you\u2019ll solve devious puzzles and battle monsters with your arsenal of mystical potions. With a little help from your grandmother (a powerful witch in her own right), you\u2019ll explore enchanted lands inspired by your favorite fairy tales \u2013 often with an unexpected twist!\nAs powerful as your potions are, you\u2019ll find yourself up against monsters that can shrug off your most powerful attacks. You\u2019ll have to think on your feet and act quickly to sidestep danger. Manage your resources carefully, or you may find yourself with an empty satchel when you need your elixirs most. \nEver wonder what happened after Miss Muffet was frightened off her tuffet?\n\"Put the kettle to the meddle.\"\nConflict resolution that goes beyond pure combat\u2014calm, charm, tame and scare your enemies\nStrategic combat\u2014use potions, the environment, and even other monsters to defeat your enemies\nQuirky storyline featuring rich characters from folklore around the world \u2013 all with a unique spin\nCrafting system that rewards experimentation\nCountless environments to adventure and search for rare ingredients\nResource management, with a vast number of potions and ingredients\nLuna\u2014Your resident witch-in-training and strong, female lead\nBeautiful, illustrated art style reminiscent of your favorite storybooks and animated tales\n\"Potions: A Curious Tale is a wonderfully charming visual delight that promises a tongue-in-cheek storyline and lovely characters. While still in its early stages, gamers who love crafting and exploration should keep an eye on this game.\"  - SIX Judge\n\n\u201cWhat struck me most about Potions: A Curious Tale is the beauty of the sprites used throughout it.\u201d -  Spong\n\u201cPotions: A Curious Tale makes players re-think the standard hack-n-slash, kill-the-monster gameplay.\u201d - MMORPG\n \"It brought back a sense of nostalgia -- it reminded me of a cross-breed of old school games.\" - SIX Judge\n\"Something wicked, this way. Fun!\"\nCombat is fast-paced, non-linear, and highly customizable. Set your own play style with the potions you use and the way you choose to face threats. Go full-throttle with an arsenal of deadly potions that burn enemies to ashes, or drop a confetti bomb and escape before they can blink. \nPotions\u2019 effects can work together, allowing for powerful combinations of different attacks. They can also trigger helpful and deadly reactions in the environment. \nTiming is key, any pause taken in battle to throw one of your potions leaves you vulnerable as your enemies barrel down upon you. You\u2019ll have to time attacks just right to take down tougher enemies. All potions are friendly-fire, so be careful where you point that incendiary vial! \nSome creatures will even need to be coaxed by other methods to share their goods. You must think carefully about which monsters to engage with and which to avoid or trick. Sometimes, using your enemies against each other is the most efficient solution. \nGet too carried away fighting and you\u2019ll use up your precious potions and have to re-arm before your next adventure. \n\"Every problem... has a solution.\"\nOn Luna\u2019s path to master potion brewing, she must gather rare ingredients to craft new potions. While her grandmother will teach her some potion recipes, most recipes must be discovered through experimentation with ingredients. \nEach ingredient has descriptive text that hints towards its potential use. These descriptions, along with additional hints from characters in the game, can lead Luna to craft undiscovered recipes. \nLuckily, Luna also learns from her failures. So, while an unsuccessful experiment may ruin her ingredients, it also provides her insight that will lead to the discovery of new recipes as her skills grow.\nIf she\u2019s just refilling her potion satchel, Luna can use her trusty recipe book, where she records all of her previous concoctions. \nLuna must manage her potion supplies by avoiding unwanted trouble and exploring to find ingredients for recipes, or go out and hunt exotic monsters to gather rare ingredients for experimentation! \nEnchanted creatures, large and small, dwell in the forests, caves and mountains around Old Haven. Some are harmless or even benevolent. Others are licking their chops at the prospect of having a lovely young witch for supper.\nEach creature in the Deep Dark Forest has its own strengths and weaknesses. While your potions of flame may burn spiders to ash, they\u2019ll have little impact on the lava-loving salamander. Think of each creature you encounter as a tiny puzzle, with abilities, vulnerabilities, and behaviors you can exploit to your strategic advantage (and monetary gain).\nAlthough many monsters hold the ingredients you need to brew more powerful potions, most will be reluctant to part with them. Some may be persuaded by force, others by charm, still others by guile. It\u2019s up to you to brave the wilderness while using tricks, cunning, and an arsenal of arcane connections to win the components you\u2019ll need to become a potions master.\nA good witch chooses her battles wisely! Remember, not every creature needs to be defeated, and picking the wrong fight may be the difference between being the cook and being the meal.\n\"Go stir crazy!\"\nNot only will your wits and potions help you with the monsters you encounter on your adventures, they will also be key to solving the countless puzzles strewn across the lands. Some obstacles will need a special potion to pass, while others will require creative problem solving to unlock their secrets! \nHidden items are scattered all over this mystical land, so don\u2019t be surprised if any rock or thicket conceals a hidden artifact or ancient potion recipe forgotten over the ages. Even your talks with characters can unveil important pearls of wisdom. \nLuna lives in a world inspired by fairy tales and folklore from around the globe, from African folklore to Western nursery rhymes. Luna's wit and intellect help her overcome challenges posed by these enchanted lands. However, in her quest to become a Potions Master, she also learns important coming-of-age lessons in the tongue-in-cheek story line. Respect is earned, advice can be deceiving, and adults aren't always right. \nLuna never quite fit in with her peers as she was always off exploring and experimenting. When one of her experiments explodes spectacularly, Luna learns that she has an aptitude for brewing magical potions. Unable to train Luna herself and desiring to keep the young girl out of further trouble, Luna\u2019s mother sends her to live with her grandmother to learn potion crafting. \nGranny lives in a small village to the north on the edge of the Deep Dark Forest. Her little town, Old Haven, is the last stop for adventurers on their way to find fame, fortune, and glory in the enchanted lands beyond. A respected Potions Master, Granny has more than enough business selling potions and remedies to the townsfolk and travelers. However, with her advanced age, she is happy to take on an apprentice who can venture into the enchanted forests, mountains, deltas, and grasslands on her behalf. \nWhether it\u2019s helping Mary Muffet with a spider problem or assisting the monk, Tripitaka, and his unlikely crew of disciples on their pilgrimage, Luna finds a way to lend a hand with her cunning wit and, of course, her potions. \nFull Release \nThe full release will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux via direct download (DRM-free) and Steam.\nAlpha/Beta Access \nAccess to the alpha and beta will be granted on Steam for Windows initially, with Mac to follow.

No, it isn\u2019t a deep strategic challenge, but it does present players with numerous choices and forces them to adjust their plans as the game progresses. But much more important than that, the game is simply fun to play\u2026and you get to play the bad guy!\"\nUltimate Scheme is @FailroadExpress's Kickstarter Game of the Month for May!\nOwen K.C. Stephens says: \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed Ultimate Scheme when I had the pleasure of crushing Rich Baker in a game session. As a result of the X Factor, it has HUGE replay value, creating new opportunities to try different strategies with every game session. If the idea of using complex plots, ninja agents, the global coffee supply, and schemes requiring Unobtainium sounds like fun way to conquer there world, this boardgame is for you! Five of five stars. Would scheme again.\u201d\nRob Schwalb says: \"I had the opportunity to play Ultimate Scheme with Rich Baker at AcadeCon and I had a great time! Everyone at the table picked up the game quick and by the end we could see the intricacies of the design and how it facilitated a variety of win strategies. This is a fantastic game and I can\u2019t wait to add a copy to my library. Highly recommended!\"\nJennifer Clarke-Wilkes says: \"Power corrupts, but absolute power is for the experts. This is a fun and eminently replayable game of plots and counter plots.\"\n\"I had more fun than I thought I would!\" - Russ at Gamerati Game Day.\nHere's part 1 of a play-through video featuring the Dead Gentlemen's Nathan Rice and Steve Wolbrecht (part 2 and part 3 are also available on YouTube):\nMore to Come!\nUltimate Scheme works for 2 to 4 players, and takes about an hour to play on average - slightly more than an hour with four players, and a bit less than an hour with just two. In the video above, Rich provides an introduction to the game and a walkthrough of the turn order. The card types are listed below, and we have a detailed breakdown of the rules components on our website.\nSetup\nIn Ultimate Scheme, you play as one of the 10+ Factions of the game, such as Gigaton Industries or W.R.A.I.T.H. You also draw one Ultimate Scheme, which might be something like Found an Evil Coffee Empire, Start a Land War in Asia, or Ruin Christmas.\nYou begin play with two minions, placed in the starting location indicated on the Faction card. You'll also draw three Scheme cards and an Action Card.\nTurn Order\nEach turn is broken up into five steps. Starting with the First Player, all players complete the first step, then all players complete the second step, and so on. After all steps have been completed, the player to the left of the first player becomes the new First Player for the next round.\nDraw Step. Each player draws one criminal, subversion, or genius scheme from his or her choice of one of the three Scheme decks.\nMove Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and moves the minion to an adjacent location. After all players have moved one minion, they each take a second move in turn order. During this phase, a player might end up moving one minion twice, or two minions once. A player can always elect to not move a minion.\nResource Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and gains resources from that minion's location.. After all players have collected resources once, they collect a second time, in turn order. Resources cannot be gained from a location more than once per round, regardless of whether the location was depleted by an ally or enemy minion.\nExecute Step. Each player can execute a Scheme, provided the player has the appropriate resources to spend and has a minion in the Scheme's location. There is no limit to the number of schemes a player can complete in a given turn, provided that the resource and location requirements are met.\nEnd Step. If Victory has not been achieved, any minions in hidden locations return to their home cities. The First Player changes, and play continues in the next round.\nHere's a closer look at the primary game elements::\nA Faction Card. Each Faction has its own start location and a special ability. Professor Roboto here starts with additional schemes, and gains more Science every turn.\nAn Ultimate Scheme. Each Ultimate Scheme has its own unique victory condition.\nA close up of three locations. New York provides two Finance Resources, while San Francisco provides one Science and an Action Card. Area 51 is a Hidden Site (you must first get access to the site), and grants Science plus Action and Scheme cards.\nAn Action card. Each action card specifies the effect and indicates when you can play it.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s even better than pulling off scores of nefarious plots and capers? Pulling off dozens more, of course! Plan Number B is an expansion to the Ultimate Scheme game that provides you with more factions, more schemes, more action cards, and more mayhem in general. \nPlan Number B begins as a set of 40 new cards, introducing the Interpol Agent to the mix and up to 4 new factions for the Ultimate Scheme game, but here's the best part - Plan Number B gets bigger and better as we hit our stretch goals. What's on the table for Plan Number B stretch goals?  \nInterpol Agent: A new game element that lets you use the forces of law and order as your unwitting pawns to obstruct your rival's plans.\nThe Event Deck: a set of cards that puts a new twist on each round of the game.\nMore Schemes: a new category of nefarious schemes you can undertake.\nSingle Player Mode: for when you want to play with yourself.\nMore Factions, Locations, Ultimate Schemes, Madness, and Mayhem!\nTo add Plan Number B to your Ultimate Scheme reward, select the DELUXE ULTIMATE SCHEME reward, or any of the rewards above $65. Depending on manufacturing time frame, the expansion may be shipped separately after the basic game is delivered.\n\nIf we surpass our initial goal, we'll be able to increase the value of the reward levels by adding more content to the Plan Number B expansion.\n\nAt 250 backers at the EXPANDED and DELUXE levels combined, we'll add the Event Deck to Plan Number B!\nAt $20,000 raised, we'll include cards for single player mode in Plan Number B, and make a digital version of the single player mode available online for download.\n\nWe'll unlock more stuff as we hit our stretch goals!\n\nWe have no other add-ons planned for Ultimate Scheme beyond what is offered in the reward tiers. We want to keep fulfillment simple and straight-forward, so that we can quickly get the game printed and shipped out to all of our backers. That said, if there's something special you want, or if you want to combine reward levels, let us know in the Comments thread or feel free to message us privately and let us know what you're looking for, and we'll see what we can do!\nShipping rates are calculated based on your country when you select your reward tier, and is not reflected in the base reward pledges.\nWe are partnering with Ship Naked to provide delivery to backers. We had a positive experience with them in shipping our previous Kickstarter project, Primeval Thule 5e, and we think they'll be more than ready to handle our Ultimate Scheme. They'll ship all over the world! \nWe are using Ship Naked's Customs-Friendly Worldwide shipping option, which means that not only is the shipping cost a little lower for us, shipments will be EU-, Canada-, UK-, Aussie-, NZ-, and US-Friendly. \n Ultimate Scheme has been in the works for quite some time. We first brought a version of the game to the First Exposure Playtest Hall at Gen Con 2014, and have been testing and refining the game ever since. At Gen Con in 2015, we provided demos in our booth and continued to get feedback and reactions from fans. We've been to local groups like Gamerati to show off the game and get even more feedback.\nSasquatch Game Studio is a small game publishing company formed by three longtime game industry professionals. We initially came together to produce the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting for multiple RPG platforms, and also produced Princes of the Apocalypse, a big adventure for 5th edition D&D. We are all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the biz. For Ultimate Scheme, we brought in two excellent artists: Lee Moyer to help us nail down the game board and design elements, and Claudio Pozas to provide our card illustrations.\nRichard Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. In addition to extensive RPG design credits, he\u2019s worked on several boardgames and miniature games of note, including the Origins award-winning Conquest of Nerath and Axis and Allies Miniatures game. He also contributed extensively to Risk Godstorm and Axis and Allies Revised.\nDavid Noonan has more than 50 RPG products among his credits, and has written extensively for video games, including Motiga's upcoming Gigantic team action game for Windows 10 and Xbox One.\nStephen Schubert is an award-winning game designer/developer mostly known for his extensive work for D&D and the D&D Miniatures Game.\nLee Moyer has worked as an illustrator on numerous games\u2014RPGs, computer games, CCGs, and more. He collaborated with Keith Baker on The Doom that Came to Atlantic City, published by Cryptozoic Entertainment, and served as the art director (and lead illustrator) for the 13th Age Roleplaying Game.\nLast but not least, Claudio Pozas contributed to Fantasy Flight\u2019s Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs, the Dungeon Crawler ECG by Gifted Vision, and the Ennie Award-winning Counter Collection series by Fiery Dragon, as well as numerous RPGs.\n\"Hitman\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second campaign for the Ultimate Scheme game. After the first attempt failed to fund, we reviewed our campaign from top to bottom to figure out how we can reach success. We took in feedback and created a (hopefully) more engaging cover design, and shot a new pitch video with better production values. \n\nWe also looked for a manufacturer that could work in smaller quantities, so that we won't incur as big of an expense to create more product than we might need. We simplified the components, replacing the more expensive wooden resource cubes with punch-out sheets, which also allows us to create art more representative of the game's resources. Overall, we reduced the cost of the game, and by reducing weight and box size, we've reduced the expected shipping costs as well. \n\nAs a result, we can offer the game at a lower price point, passing our savings on to our backers. In addition, the smaller quantities means a smaller funding threshold, which means that the project success is even more likely.\n\nWe've run two successful Kickstarter campaigns, both for RPG products. Ultimate Scheme is our first board game Kickstarter project, and we've made an effort to anticipate the additional work this project requires to follow it through manufacturing and shipping. We will keep backers apprised of our manufacturing and shipping timelines.\n\nPlan Number B will require some design and playtesting as we extend the expansion through additional stretch goals.

Kazoo is different from everything else on the newsstand.\u201d\u2014Real Simple\n\"Today, I found this f**king amazing magazine called Kazoo. It\u2019s like Rookie but for younger readers. It\u2019s for ages five to 10. It\u2019s a really great group of people.\u201d\u2014The New York Observer, \"Jobs Report: Kickstarter\u2019s Publishing Ambassador Maris Kreizman Details Her Day\"\n\"If you believe young girls deserve to be raised in a different landscape, one that helps them feel like the amazing women that they are and will one day become, consider donating to this campaign. It\u2019s time we cultivate a new generation of women who value themselves not for what they look like, but for who they are on the inside.\u201d\u2014Elite Daily\n\"A new print magazine called Kazoo is uniting top female artists, chefs, writers, and scientists for a single purpose: to inspire young girls to be true to themselves.\u201d\u2014Mental_Floss\n\u201cWhat would happen if we could show our girls a different world? One where they are not limited. Where they don\u2019t have to be sexy. Where they get to be themselves and have people treasure them for it? That concept is what makes the Kazoo video so incredibly moving for moms. We want better for our girls than we had. We want them to believe with all of their might that they can do anything \u2026 and not have society come in and tell them they can\u2019t.\u201d\u2014Babble\n\"What every mom needs to make sure her daughter knows before she grows up\u201d \u2014Cosmopolitan\n\"Get ready for this cool new magazine for our littlest feminists...The idea that a magazine can be completely written by top professional women shouldn\u2019t be revolutionary, but it still kind of is, and it sub-textually gives girls a great message that there are no fields off-limits to them.\u201d\u2014Hello Giggles\n\u201cKazoo magazine brings feminism to girls ages 5 to 10, because you\u2019re never too young to be empowered\u201d\u2014Bustle\n\u201cWhy girls need this new magazine.\u201d\u2014Refinery29\n\u201cIn this ever-changing world, the possibilities for [our daughters] are endless if we keep it that way.\u201d\u2014Pop Sugar\n\"Gender stereotypes have no place in this empowering magazine for girls...Because girls can love princesses, pirates and everything in between.\"\u2014Huffington Post\n\"Kazoo [is] a magazine for girls who wanna run the world, featuring some women who already do.\"\u2014Cool Mom Picks\n\u201cKazoo magazine is changing the way we talk to young girls...it isn\u2019t about what girls look like, but what they can do.\u201d \u2014Naturally Curly\n\"In a world full of Kardashians, reality television and social media, it\u2019s great to see a publication that offers something different and inspiring.\u201d\u2014Hot Moms Club\nIn a world where girls are constantly being fed information on how to look and act, KAZOO offers them something radically different. Rather than give them rules to live by, KAZOO gives girls, ages 5 to 10, tools to create, build, explore, dream, play and ask questions.\nKAZOO will be published quarterly and feature sections on art, nature, science, tinkering and tech, cooking, travel, sports, emotions, citizenship, and critical thinking. Regular features will include: science experiments; comics; art projects; recipes; interviews with inspiring women from athletes to astronauts; and fun activities, including secret codes, jokes, mazes, search-and-finds and more.\nEvery story in each issue will be either developed or inspired by top female artists, explorers, scientists, chefs, athletes, activists, writers and others. Here are just a few of the inspiring women, who have already confirmed their participation in the first issue: \n\u2022MacArthur Genius Alison Bechdel, author of Fun Home is creating a full-page tutorial called, \u201cHow to Draw a Cat.\u201d (It\u2019s the first original, full-length comic she\u2019s published in a year.) \n\u2022New York Times best-seller Lucy Knisley, author of Relish, is creating an original 4-page comic on Elizabeth Robinson, the first American woman to win an Olympic gold in track.\n\u2022Artist Mickalene Thomas, who has shown her work at The Guggenheim, The Whitney, The National Portrait Gallery and MOMA, is adapting one of her portraits into a color-and-glitter-by-number project.\n\u2022James Beard nominated chef Fany Gerson, owner of La Newyorkina and author of My Sweet Mexico is developing recipes for paletas, or Mexican ice pops.\n\u2022Caldecott Honor winner Doreen Cronin, author of Click, Clack, Moo and Bloom, is debuting an original, 4-page short story, featuring a strong girl protagonist.\nGerson's La Newyorkina and Cronin's Bloom\n\u2022National Book Award winner Jacqueline Woodson, author of Brown Girl Dreaming is rounding up her must-read books for girls.\n\u2022Cosmochemist, Fulbright Scholar and Guggenheim fellow Meenakshi Wadhwa, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University is contributing to a story on the Perseid Meteor Shower.\nWoodson's Brown Girl Dreaming and Dr. Wadwha with a meteorite\nThe video above was created by Courtney and Peter Hutchens, the amazing filmmaking duo behind Back East Media.  \nWhen girls are young, they not afraid to ask for what they want. They\u2019re not shy about taking up space or making noise. They own their bodies and are proud of what they can do, how fast they can run and high they can climb. They ask questions (and, as any parent knows, sometimes endlessly). And yet, by adolescence, too many begin to question their own voice. The fallout is real. Take a look:\n\u2022Six in ten girls stop doing what they love, because they feel bad about their looks. And by age 11, 30 percent of them have already put themselves on a diet.\n\u2022Seventy five percent of girls are interested in engineering and related fields, and yet only 11 percent of practicing engineers are women.\n\u2022Young girls earn higher grades than boys in science, yet feel less confident in their abilities.\n\u2022By adolescence, girls are less likely than boys to act, and feel, like a leader.\n\u2022Adolescent girls are nearly three times as likely to have suffered from depression in the past year, compared to boys. \nBy celebrating girls for all that they are\u2014smart, inquisitive, creative, brave, strong and, yes, loud\u2014KAZOO will help shore up their foundation, so that by the time they enter adolescence, they\u2019ll be more likely to question anyone who makes them feel small than they\u2019ll be to question themselves.\nOne more point, here: Girls and women are completely underrepresented in our culture. Look at Congress (80% men); the modern art section of the MET (95% men); the engineering profession (89% men); Oscar-nominated cinematographers (100% men); even children\u2019s books, where boy characters are 3 times more likely than girl characters to appear. \nWhen you\u2019re excluded from the political process, museums, professions, awards, even your own bedtime stories, there is a consequence. The less girls see themselves in positions of power, the less likely they\u2019ll be to believe they can achieve such power. KAZOO is the antidote to this invisibility. It will feature some of the most powerful and inspirational women in their fields, thus giving girls a more well-rounded sense of the world and the possibilities within it. \nMy dream is to get KAZOO into every little girl's hands, so she can not only read, laugh and learn, but also see the world from a new perspective, one where she is celebrated for being true to herself. Making that happen will take time and money. If you help fund this project, it means I could: \n\u2022Pay for printing and postage, the biggest expense\n\u2022Hire an ace designer to help make every page spectacular \n\u2022Hire illustrators and photographers to help bring the stories to life \n\u2022Hire a copyeditor to save me from mortal embarrassment\n\u2022Dedicate more of my time to create a truly awesome magazine (and less to freelancing full-time for other magazines)\nOf course, with every dollar you donate, you'll earn some serious feel-good vibes from knowing you could potentially be changing a girl's life. And if that doesn't convince you to back this project, here are a few other perks:\nThe sticker, hoodie, T-shirt, onesie and tote.\nOn Twitter and Facebook, lots of great people are getting behind KAZOO. Some highlights as of April 2nd.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven the increased competition from digital media (and the rise in postage fees), the landscape for print magazines may seem a little bleak right now. But there's one area of exception: kids' print media. Children\u2019s book sales, for instance, increased 13 percent last year. That\u2019s because kids still enjoy, and indeed crave, turning real pages, and they still get a thrill to see personally addressed mail waiting for them in their mailboxes. \n\nAs parents, too, we want our children to spend less time staring at screens and more time reading, thinking and tapping into their imagination. A printed magazine, which your child can actually hold in her hands and leaf through at her own pace, is the perfect antidote to an otherwise frenzied media culture.

A software solution that has the potential to save thousands of reams of paper from being used by the entertainment industry and will save all of us TiMe.\nMORE LIFE. LESS PAPERWORK.\n*Startwork (Startwork Packet or Start Paperwork) | noun: A 15-30 page packet every crewmember fills out to join a new production. It contains forms from the payroll company, production company and the financier (normally a studio or network). \nTiM allows you to create an Electronic Profile that only you can access or modify. Using a proprietary process, TiM converts scans or digital versions of startwork into a file that your Electronic Profile \"talks\" to, eliminating the need for physical startwork packets.\nLet's start at the beginning...\nSETTING UP THE PRODUCTION\nA production is created within TiM by the UPM, Line Producer or Studio. \nThe production's startwork packet is uploaded, customized, and saved within TiM. \nCopyright CrewBridge Technologies\nProduction documents can also be uploaded into TiM, at any time, after the production has been created. \nJOINING THE PRODUCTION\nThe production invites you (or your department head) to TiM via text or email. A department head can invite new crewmembers to their department the same way.\nLog in and fill out your Electronic Profile, once.  This information is stored in TiM for all future productions and only you can access or edit it using your password protected login. \nYour digital startwork packet for this production is standing by and automatically populated using the information from your Electronic Profile.\nReview, sign, and submit. \nThat\u2019s it. \nYOUR PRODUCTION HOMEPAGE\nOnce your I-9 is approved within TiM you can be granted access to the all of the production\u2019s documents in one place.\nCheck it out!\nPRODUCTION HOMEPAGE\nBACK AT THE OFFICE\nYour accurate and complete digital startwork packet lands in the Payroll Accountant\u2019s \"Startwork Inbox.\" From here it is sent for approval signatures and easily tracked within TiM's \"Startwork Approval Pipeline.\"\n\"STARTWORK PIPELINE\"\nOnce approved, the Payroll Accountant sends a PDF to the studio and payroll company with one click.\nNo more sorting through piles of startwork or tracking down missing information!\nYOUR STARTWORK\nYour fully executed deal memo and start paperwork are saved within TiM and accessible to you at any time, for all past and current productions.\nIN SHORT: Enter your information once, forever. Period.\nAccess any productions you\u2019re working on, anywhere, on any device, at any time.\nElectronic Profile: your information will be securely stored in TiM and used to fill out your startwork packet for you. Choose what information is visible to the crew and modify your Electronic Profile at any time.\nMy Contacts: access and manage the contact information of people you work with across productions all stored within TiM. No more searching through paperwork for a crewmember's Emergency Contact information.\nProduction Homepage: your hub for all of the most recent production documents, announcements and information in ONE place: \n        - Call Sheet \n        - Schedules (One Liner, DOODs, etc) \n        - Other Production Docs (Script Revisions, Box Kit Rental Forms, etc) \n        - Daily Call Time, Crew Lunch, and Camera Wrap \n        - Digital Crew List and Department Specific Information \n        - Production and Payroll Company Information\nPermission Based Access: all documents in TiM can be set up with custom permissions;  you decide who sees what.\nInvite: invite new crewmembers to your Department or Production via email or text message. Save them as \"core crew\" or \"dayplayer\" and their contact information will be saved in TiM automatically. \nStartwork: Access your approved startwork packet (deal memos & rates) at any time for any past or current production.\nDigital Approval: Electronically sign and submit your startwork packet. No more missing information or missing signatures. \n FOR THE PAYROLL ACCOUNTANT:\nScan and upload paper startwork packets or digital forms into TiM and customize them for any production. Save templates to re-use for future productions.\nAssign accounting codes and rates to new crewmembers as they are invited to the production.\nStartwork Inbox: Completed startwork packets, with all required fields double-checked by TiM, can be easily reviewed and sent for higher up approval the moment they are submitted by the crewmember. \nStartwork Pipeline: Track startwork packets as they are approved within TiM. \nOne-Click-Send: Send a PDF of completed deal memos and payroll forms to the studio or payroll company for every crewmember directly from TiM. No more sorting and scanning. \nSecurity\nTiM is designed without the need for long-term storage of sensitive personal information (like social security numbers) and retains only info that is publicly accessible (like name, email, phone number, etc.). Documents will be stored in Amazon S3 using ServerSide (\"at rest\") encryption as well as an additional layer of encryption (using AES256 which is Government level security).\nI-9 documents (passport #s, driver license #s, etc.), won't be stored in TiM, as many studios/networks/production companies require a designated crewmember (like an AD or Best Boy/Key) to fill in the document information as he/she approves the I-9, not ahead of time. TiM doesn't change the I-9 process, it just makes it easier, faster and less prone to errors.\nHow much is your TiMe worth? \nBy eliminating the tedious process of filling out start paperwork TiM saves at least 15 minutes of productivity for each crewmember on a production. TiM will cost a production significantly less than the time savings it generates per onboard (with respect to the average hourly rate of crewmembers).\nTiM also empowers production staff, that are traditionally saddled with the time-consuming task of putting together hundreds of startwork packets, to focus on more important duties.\nIt saves a production thousands of pieces of paper, countless boxes of staples, several cartridges of printer toner, and a hefty amount of electricity.\nLastly, by virtually eliminating errors or omissions in startwork and facilitating a blazing fast approval process, Accounting, Production Managers and Producers will be able to spend a fraction of the time \"processing\" startwork.\nWhy the low price-point? We want using TiM to be a no-brainer (because it is!). An affordable price-point will help us roll TiM out to as many productions as possible. The more productions that use TiM, the better the onboarding process is for everyone. (Plus, we don't want to fill out startwork anymore either!)\nHigh value. Low cost. Greater good.\n\"I wish I didn't have to fill out all this paperwork!\"\n\"ugh hurry up with that app already... I think of you guys every time I fill out paperwork. The system is so broken!\"\n\"Yes for no more paperwork!\"\nOf the hundreds of crewmembers we've surveyed, 95.5% say they are unhappy with the current startwork process.\nHere's a glimpse of this process...\nSomewhere, right now, there is a heavy duty printer that's been running for hours. An office PA or Payroll Accountant is monotonously separating these mountains of printed paperwork and stapling 20-or-so-page packets one by one, for every single crewmember (200 packets? 500? 1000? Depends on the gig).  These startwork packets are then schlepped by the hundreds to set; lugged to each truck and passed off to each department in heaps so no one finds themselves short at the end of a long, grueling work day.\nDay 1 on set of a new production: We\u2019re already low on startwork\u2026 call the office\u2026 more printing, more stapling, another set run, lugging more stacks around and then tracking down that guy who\u2019s only with the production this one day.\nEnd of day 1: Lug these hundreds of crumpled, coffee stained, torn, often incomplete startwork packets back to the office.  The Payroll Accountant then reviews and sorts them one by one. A missing signature... send it back to set. Imagine doing this 1000 times.\nDay 2: Same thing.\nThank you to our Payroll Accountants for getting us paid all these years. We appreciate everything you do.\nEvery startwork packet asks for the same information (multiple times per packet): name, address, email, phone number, etc, yet no two are the same.  Why are we wasting all of this time and paper on every production?  We've spent the past ten months investigating this and the reasoning we've most commonly heard is, \"because this is how it\u2019s always been done.\u201d  \nWe firmly believe....\nA SOLUTION FOR THE CREW, BY THE CREW\n                               TiM isn't just software, it's a movement, and startwork is just the beginning. This is a chance to change an established process for the better\u2014to create a solution that benefits each of us, all of us, and therefore the production and the system as a whole. \nWe have a working prototype (thanks to our amazing CTO and developer, Carmine Guida), but it will take several resources to make TiM the seamless, streamlined solution we envision.\nTogether we can make TiM a reality.\nThese kickstarter funds will be used for:\nSoftware developers to build out TiM\u2019s database. \nPurchasing developer licenses for PDF importing and conversion.\nPurchasing licenses for clerical software like Quickbooks.  \nLegal advisement.\nTrademarking, copyrights and business registrations, etc. \nAmazon Web Services to ensure TiM is fast, reliable, scalable, and secure when supporting any number of users at a time. \nEmail and SMS services for instant notifications. \nWebsite and software development.\n LEARNING, BUILDING, WORKING, and CELEBRATING TOGETHER! \nJoin the movement!\nPlease know, when it comes to beta testing, receiving exclusive updates, and becoming a TiM Architect to help shape the features and future of TiM, your level of involvement is up to you.

Between the both of us we\u2019ve worked in film for about a decade and our distinct paths allow us to see film from the inside looking out and the outside looking in.\nOur partner, Carmine Guida, is the \u201cunicorn\u201d developer that anyone starting a tech company dreams of and hopes for. A vet in start-up tech land, an experienced businessman, and a skilled musician--he is the perfect compliment to two ADs who have personally struggled with the inefficiencies prevalent in the film production industry. His business savvy and communication skills are unparalleled, which is important when building something that, above all else, is meant to address the needs of the people it serves. We are very lucky to have him onboard.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA UNIQUE INDUSTRY\nNo two productions are alike and for any single production, the work force, locations, and obstacles change on a daily basis.

For the first time in history, the prevalence of Internet connected devices has made it possible to bring a truly mobile, technological solution to the filmed entertainment industry. Since we are creating tech to move an entire industry away from the paper processes that are so ingrained in its identity, the primary goal is to make sure TiM actually is easier than current practices; not just technology for technology\u2019s sake. We will accomplish this through extensive user testing and an ongoing dialogue with our fellow crewmembers.\n\nCOMPETITION\nWhere a market exists, so does competition. So, we are focusing on a single pain point: startwork. Our goal is to do one thing exceptionally well at a competitive price, not a bunch of things moderately well at a mediocre price.\n\n\n\n- OUR PLEDGE -\n\nAnything worth doing is hard work and often times high risk; we will continue to do everything in our power to mitigate risk, to pursue this humbly and learn at every turn, and to work through any challenges that arise, persistently and veraciously.

See you in the skies, dragons!\n-Red Level Games\nwww.DragonTheGame.net\nInspire terror and awe in Dragon: The Game, the first open-world sandbox action RPG that lets you experience the world as the dragon.\nDTG: Dragon Simulator Meets Action-RPG\nYou are a dragon, thundering across the sky, soaring with ravenous appetite.   Do you bring majesty, wealth, and power to the lands or are you a creature of legendary terror? \nExperience dragons in their proper role as the monstrous, complex, and epic protagonists that they are. In this open world action role-playing game you bring your dragon's story to life. As you hunt, eat, and age, your dragon develops. You improve and customize its wings, tail, claws, and breath weapon. Over the centuries, you develop your inner draconic magic and other latent abilities, claim territory, and impact the course of history. \nBecome a terrifying or benevolent dragon powerful enough to threaten city states and reshape kingdoms.\nWhen YOU are the dragon, it is up to you to decide if you want to be a destroyer of enemies.\n...or a protector of your city-state...\nYour influence is inevitable\nThe Gameplay\nDTG is a unique blend of action, exploration, freedom, and power. \nThe game as been described as Grand Theft Auto meets Skyrim.  A \"dragon simulator\" with role playing and city-building elements.\nGameplay is emergent. Whereas most games follow the story of a frail mortal aspiring to be great, DTG puts you directly into a flying, fire-breathing, awe-inspiring, customizable, extremely powerful dragon. \nA dragon surveys its lands. Improve your senses to unlock the minimap and other tools of the hunt.\nAs we all know, dragons do as they please. So immerse yourself in the lore and story of the world.  Fulfill quests, rescuing (or eating) princesses, collecting artifacts and wealth. Or, venture out into the world on your own, live off the land, uncover the lost history of dragons, explore the countryside, and leave your own claw-mark in this world.\nSearching for a snack.\nCompletely destructible cities and castles are planned for the full game. Some dragons have adapted to eat nearly anything from wooden beams to rooftop shingles.\nMany villagers are slow and weak, easy prey for an unscrupulous drake. But remember, your actions will create your reputation.\nFlames spread across the ground and ignites near-by grasses and trees. Frost breath causes fliers to freeze and drop from the sky. Acid dissolves your opponent and their gear. Your dragon's breath is a fierce and dynamic weapon.\nFly solo, or soar across the skies with your friends in co-op or PVP games.\nChoose your draconic heritage. Each color, or race, has its own specialty. Don't like the options? Create your own hybrid dragon.\nDragons occupy an enormous creative space and many games include dragons, or riding dragons, or hunting dragons, or being dragon-born, but none have set to the task of building the greatest \"draconic experience \" possible...Until now!\nThe five core draconic races\nImagine the possibilities.  How do villages and kingdoms react when you fly over-head? Do you seek to work with the races of humanoids or do you extort them? Do you build alliances with your draconic brothers and sisters or do you dominate, displace, or slay them? DTG allows you play through an unparalleled draconic experience in a sandbox fantasy universe.  The player guides his dragon through it's life: hunting, eating, and growing powerful over the centuries.  Becoming more powerful, you progress from day-to-day survival to a mighty beast whose presence is felt across the lands. Our goal is to create a story that engages, but does not dictate your experience: \nA dragon sleeps best near her hoard.\nThe lore provides direction but the real story of DTG is created by the player and it evolves organically, in response to the cities and characters you help and those you destroy.  During each play-through your choices as a dragon will shape the world, your actions affecting the centuries to come. Over time technology and magic will advance--the cities, enemies, and draconic rivals you meet will grow increasingly dangerous over the course of the game.\nTo survive and thrive you will need to eat, seek out a lair, and amass wealth; using food and treasure to purchase new body parts, customizations, and weapons, leveling up abilities, and upgrading your dragon's instinct and senses. Receive gifts or demand tribute from nearby kingdoms to accelerate your growth.  Exploration is key. The world is large and filled with gold, magic, and peril.  Every location contains a potential quest event...\nBurn down an infected forest before the blight can spread\nRespond to slavers demanding your surrender or dragon hunters seeking your hide\nDeliver supplies to impoverished village\nPatrolling your territory\nSlaying prides of griffins\nSurvive in an uncharted world\nOther draconic quests to come...\nDaming a river for a near-by village. A day of your dragon's labor is worth months of manpower. Gold and tribute will surely follow your good deeds.\nTornados, thunder storms, high winds, and other weather events present challenges and opportunities for airborne wyrms.\nThe Final Game\nWe've build a strong foundation for this game and poured our hearts, lives, and money into getting DTG to this point.  Your support will allows us to create an unmatched draconic experience for your PC, Mac, or Linux.  We plan expansion to XBOX One and PSN when possible.\nFull Customization: Choose your dragon's bloodline, body type, and anatomy. Choose its color, face, look, and abilities. Customize and upgrades your weapons and armor such as scales, breath weapon, bite, tail, and wings. Adorn its body with spikes, armor, scars.   Are you lean and fast, choosing razor sharp claws, with talons for extra reach and deadly bleeding? Or are you an armored behemoth, careening through the skies with arrow repelling dragonhide.  All combinations and possible.\n5 Core Draconic Races: We are working on 5 core dragon races that have unique abilities, starting areas, advantages, and disadvantages. Customize and empower your bloodline over the generations by passing on traits and achievements to your descendants by completing quests, leveling up, and choosing a mate.\nHunt and feast on tribute as you grow more powerful through the years. Hoard gold, claim a lair and expand your dominance throughout a dragon-sized sandbox fantasy world.  \nChoose who to help and who to eat. Choose which cities will benefit and thrive under your protection and which will burn...\nSingle and multi-player modes for all of your dragon co-op and PVP needs; work together in peace or find out who's the top dragon.\nUsers Mods - The creativity of our players will help this game become greater than we could imagine on our own. Integration with Steam Workshop is planned as well.\nSeveral possible conclusions; never-ending play.\nDeep RPG elements: From background traits, to titles, and rewarding statistics--you've never been able to make the dragon with so many options.  Become the dragon you've always imagined.\nIncredible soundtrack: We have four great songs so far, but our musician S.J. Tucker is working hard to give us a full soundtrack that greatly enhances and narrates your draconic experience.\nOur Challenge--How funds will be used\nRed Level Games has already built a great deal of the world of Dragon: The Game over the past 14 months. Our Early Access release last year on Steam brought in over 12,000 players!  Since then the vision and technology behind DTG has grown and we need our communities support to deliver this remarkable game.\nUnfortunately, we've disappointed some of our fans along the way and earned some negative reviews with progress that hasn't been as fast as they would like, or features that have been removed, tweaked, or temporarily broken along the way.  We hear them, and understand their complaints.  \nAs we have developed Dragon, it has grown us as a team and a studio to create this game. We also recognized the opportunity to upgrade to Unity 5 and \"swing for the fences\" with a much deeper game and more robust codebase. This has been a long but worthwhile path to follow. Now we're on the other side of the time-consuming pivot from a simple prototype released last November to the current multiplayer, 3d Unity 5 dragon experience.\nWhich is why we need your help.\nWe've solved many of our most complex technical hurdles and need your support to make this game incredible.  In addition to what RLG has already invested into this game, this Kickstarter will allow us to....\nThe first set of features, colored blue and stamped with our dragon logo, are slated for completion. We need your help to accelerate development! With your pledge, we can remain an independent studio and deliver a tremendous draconic experience.\nAccess to the game\nPledge today! Your donation of $15 dollars or more will get you access to the current version of Dragon: The Game via a Steam, Humble, or GOG digital download.  We'll send you your activation key ASAP upon reaching our KS goal so you can join the fun right away.  \nBACKER CHALLENGE\nDragon Supporters, We are offering a unique, custom-made piece of Dragon art from our artist Rob Carlos to the next three backers that donate at the $100 level or above.

In the time that Red Level Games undertook to complete Phase One of the creation of Dragon: The Game, we have already learned about many of the risks and challenges that await us here in the crucial Kickstarter funding phase of this games development.\n\nOne risk is that early players of our game are not able to envision the game as it will ultimately be. In allowing for players to become the dragon, it was necessary first to have a flyable dragon and a world in which that dragon could fly. As this was created and shown, the ultimate Role Playing style of the game was not immediately evident. Without that in mind, Dragon: The Game can feel like a simulator alone.\n\nAs we build out our world, populate it with both dragons and humans, and as players begin to create their own dragon narratives, this misunderstanding will dissipate. We anticipate an increasing desire from our community to have main and side quests to follow, more and bigger lairs to inhabit, and new ways in which their own dragon can become differentiated. Growing our community and getting this feedback is one of the most important aspects of this Kickstarter campaign, and it will allow this community to collectively build the universe of Dragon: The Game.\n\nIn addition to real-time progress towards the ultimate experience of Dragon: The Game, we will also develop many uniquely generated skins and enhanced visual creation. After building the world, we want to make it beautiful for our dragons, even if they eventually burn it to the ground!

You direct your minions across the globe to gather resources and complete nefarious schemes such as Build a Freeze Ray or Market Evil Soda. Each scheme earns you progress toward your Ultimate Scheme, your secret victory condition for the game. When you've completed your secret Ultimate Scheme, you win the game!\nBack Ultimate Scheme at either the base game level, or at the Deluxe level which includes the Ultimate Scheme expansion: Plan Number B. Higher reward tiers let you make your own mark on the game, or ship the game in its own aluminum attache case. The base level pledge is a 10% savings over our expected retail value of the game, too!\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164428/ultimate-scheme\nCheck out our playthrough video where Sasquatches Rich and Dave are joined by Dead Gentlemen Nathan Rice and Steve Wolbrecht as they battle for global domination:\n (Parts 2 and 3 are on our YouTube Channel) \nWe\u2019d like to think that great gameplay and a fun theme are all we need to make Ultimate Scheme a big success, but let\u2019s face it\u2014who doesn\u2019t like nice components and lots of colorful cards and pieces? We\u2019re partnering with a top-line game manufacturer to deliver an attractive game made with high-quality components. Your quest for world domination includes:\nGame Board: An attractive 21\" by 21\" mounted game board.\nPlayer Pieces: 25 minion tokens (meeples) and 25 control markers, in five colors for up to five players.\nResource Markers: 120 wooden cubes, 40 each for finance, occult, and science resources.\nUnobtanium: 12 acrylic crystal resource markers\nGame Cards: 136 poker-sized illustrated game cards, including:\n10 Factions\n10 Ultimate Schemes \n63 Scheme cards \n48 Action cards \n5 X-factor cards\nRulebook: Full-color rulebook.\nOther Stuff: The Ninja token, Anarchy marker, and first player token. Maybe a little factory lint.\nWe sat down with Will James of GeekDad - http://geekdad.com/2016/01/kickstarter-ultimate-scheme/\nMore to come!\nUltimate Scheme works for 2 to 5 players, and takes about an hour to play on average - slightly more than an hour with five players, and a bit less than an hour with just two. In the video above, Rich provides an introduction to the game and a walkthrough of the turn order. The card types are listed below, and we have a detailed breakdown of the rules components on our website.\nSetup\nIn Ultimate Scheme, you play as one of the 10+ Factions of the game, such as Gigaton Industries or W.R.A.I.T.H. You also draw one Ultimate Scheme, which might be something like Found an Evil Coffee Empire, Start a Land War in Asia, or Become a God.\nYou begin play with two minions, placed in the starting location indicated on the Faction card. You'll also draw two Scheme cards and an Action Card.\nTurn Order\nEach turn is broken up into five steps. Starting with the First Player, all players complete the first step, then all players complete the second step, and so on. After all steps have been completed, the player to the left of the first player becomes the new First Player for the next round.\nDraw Step. Each player draws one criminal, subversion, or genius scheme from his or her choice of one of the three Scheme decks.\nMove Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and moves the minion to an adjacent location. After all players have moved one minion, they each take a second move in turn order. During this phase, a player might end up moving one minion twice, or two minions once. A player can always elect to not move a minion.\nResource Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and gains resources from that minion's location, flipping the minion on its side to indicate that the location has been depleted for that turn. After all players have collected resources once, they collect a second time, in turn order. Resources cannot be gained from a depleted location, regardless of whether the location was depleted by an ally or enemy minion.\nExecute Step. Each player can execute a Scheme, provided the player has the appropriate resources to spend and has a minion in the Scheme's location. While players take turns executing schemes, there is no limit to the number of schemes a player can complete in a given turn, provided that the resource and location requirements are met.\nEnd Step. If Victory has not been achieved, then players reset their minions used to deplete resources, and any minions in hidden locations return to their home cities. The First Player changes, and play continues in the next round.\nA Faction Card. Each Faction has its own start location and a special ability. Professor Roboto here starts with additional schemes, and gains more Science every turn.\nAn Ultimate Scheme. Each Ultimate Scheme has its own unique victory condition.\nA close up of three locations. New York provides two Finance Resources, while San Francisco provides one Science and an Action Card. Area 51 is a Hidden Site (you must first get access to the site), and grants Science plus Action and Scheme cards.\nWhat\u2019s even better than pulling off scores of nefarious plots and capers? Pulling off dozens more, of course! Plan Number B is an expansion to the Ultimate Scheme game that provides you with more factions, more schemes, more action cards, and more mayhem in general.\nPlan Number B begins as a set of 40 new cards, introducing the Interpol Agent to the mix and up to 4 new factions for the Ultimate Scheme game, but here's the best part - Plan Number B gets bigger and better as we hit our stretch goals. What's on the table for Plan Number B?\nInterpol Agent: a new game element that lets you use the forces of law and order as your unwitting pawns to obstruct your rivals' plans.\nThe Event Deck: a set of cards that puts a new twist on each round of the game.\nMore Schemes: a new category of 23 nefarious schemes you can undertake.\nSingle Player Mode: for when you want to play with yourself.\nMore Factions, Locations, more Ultimate Schemes, more Madness and Mayhem!\nTo add Plan Number B to your Ultimate Scheme reward, select the DELUXE ULTIMATE SCHEME reward or any of the rewards above $80. Depending on manufacturing time frame, the expansion may be shipped separately after the basic game is delivered.\nIf we surpass our initial goal, we'll be able to increase the value of the reward levels by upgrading components and adding more content to the Plan Number B expansion (see below). Our first couple of stretch goals include:\nAt $35,000, we'll illustrate each of the faction cards with a handsome portrait of the Faction leader (these cards start off with simple graphic treatment). We'll also add two more Ultimate Schemes to the base game!\nAt $40,000, we'll add the Event Deck to Plan Number B. We'll also add two more Factions to the base game!\nAt 300 backers of Plan Number B, we'll add the single-player mode to the Deluxe game.\nAt $50,000, we'll replace the wooden resource cubes with specially designed resource tokens: gears for science, dollar signs for finance, and pentagrams for occult.\nWe'll unlock even more stuff as we hit our stretch goals!\nAt this time, we have no add-ons planned for Ultimate Scheme. That said, if there's something special you want, or if you want to combine reward levels, feel free to message us privately and let us know what you're looking for, and we'll see what we can do!\nWe are partnering with Ship Naked to provide delivery to backers. We had a positive experience with them in shipping our previous Kickstarter project, Primeval Thule 5e, and we think they'll be more than ready to handle our Ultimate Scheme. Ship Naked provides Customs-Friendly shipping to our overseas backers, and we'll work with them to provide an optimal experience for shipping overall.\nUltimate Scheme has been in the works for quite some time. We first brought a version of the game to the First Exposure Playtest Hall at Gen Con 2014, and have been testing and refining the game ever since. At Gen Con in 2015, we provided demos in our booth and continued to get feedback and reactions from fans. \nSasquatch Game Studio is a small game publishing company formed by three longtime game industry professionals. We initially came together to produce the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting for multiple RPG platforms, and also produced Princes of the Apocalypse, a big adventure for 5th edition D&D. We are all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the biz. For Ultimate Scheme, we brought in two excellent artists: Lee Moyer to help us nail down the game board and design elements, and Claudio Pozas to provide our card illustrations.\nRichard Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. In addition to extensive RPG design credits, he\u2019s worked on several boardgames and miniature games of note, including the Origins award-winning Conquest of Nerath and Axis and Allies Miniatures game. He also contributed extensively to Risk Godstorm and Axis and Allies Revised.\nDavid Noonan has more than 50 RPG products among his credits, and has written extensively for video games, most recently Motiga's upcoming Gigantic team action game for Windows 10 and Xbox One.\nStephen Schubert hasprovided extensive work for D&D, and also worked on the D&D Miniatures Game, and the short-lived Dreamblade competitive miniatures game.\nLee Moyer has worked as an illustrator on numerous games\u2014RPGs, computer games, CCGs, and more. He collaborated with Keith Baker on The Doom that Came to Atlantic City, published by Cryptozoic Entertainment, and served as the art director (and lead illustrator) for the 13th Age Roleplaying Game.\nLast but not least, Claudio Pozas contributed to Fantasy Flight\u2019s Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs, the Dungeon Crawler ECG by Gifted Vision, and the Ennie Award-winning Counter Collection series by Fiery Dragon, as well as numerous RPGs.\n\"Hitman\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUltimate Scheme is nearly complete, and the remaining tasks of the core game are incorporating card art and rulebook layout. We foresee no challenges with this, and will press forward with completion once we know we are likely to successfully fund. \n\nPlan Number B, the expansion deck, will require some design and playtesting as we extend the deck through additional stretch goals. Some concepts, such as additional schemes or factions, are less complicated than other elements in the expansion, such as the Interpol Agent or the Single Player mode. We anticipate having the expansion ready to deliver at the same time as the core game. If it is not ready in time, we'll ship it separately after the core game. \n\nUltimate Scheme is our first board game Kickstarter project, and we've made an effort to anticipate the additional work this project requires to follow it through manufacturing and shipping.\n\nIn our previous Kickstarter efforts, we successfully worked with manufacturers in China and external shipping companies, and we are confident that we'll be able to work with a board game manufacturer to get this project completed. We are also confident that we can overcome any additional challenges that arise during the process.\n\nAs of the launch of this project, we are still involved in shipping the last of the stretch goal rewards to our Primeval Thule backers (still within the timeframe we expected when we launched that Kickstarter), but we do not anticipate any conflict in completing that process and running this Kickstarter campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sasquatch Game Studio LLC\n5 created \u00b7 12 backed\nSasquatch Game Studio LLC is devoted to delivering top-quality hobby game experiences.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, and have now just finished up production on Mythica 4 and 5, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, Mythica 2: The Darkspore and Mythica 3: The Necromancer have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 4: The Iron Crown - the most epic Mythica film yet!\nYou can learn more about Mythica at: http://www.MythicaMovie.com\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Iron Crown\nWhen a team of unlikely heroes hijacks a steam-powered battle wagon, a daring young wizard (Marek) steals the final piece of the all-powerful Darkspore and embarks on a desperate quest to deliver the cursed artifact to the gods for safe keeping; but when they are caught in a death race between a ruthless team of elite mercenaries and a trinity of demons, Marek must learn to believe in herself before her friends are killed and the Darkspore is lost, to stop the evil necromancer (Szorlok) from uniting the Darkspore and flooding the living world with his legions of undead.\nWatch the trailers for the first three Mythica films below!\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, an escaped slave and natural-born necromancer. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, Riot, and Miracle Maker.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known to his scifi and fantasy fans for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew's voice. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less than Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars, Once I was a Beehive and Dudes and Dragons.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nThe film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all under way. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, lots of magic, giant CGI sets, zeppelins, etc. We want Mythica to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nWe especially want to make the magic effects better in this film... if you use the trailer as a guide, you'll see examples of our efforts to improve the look of our magical effects.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there are others out there like us, who we aim to please.\nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 3, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :)\nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles:\nJason Faller - Writer/Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Writer/Executive Producer\nJohn Lyde - Director\nJennifer Griffin - Producer\nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and purchase our past projects on our website:\nwww.arrowstormentertainment.com\n STRETCH GOAL #1 - $85,000 \nA behind-the-scenes diary - with essays, Q&A's, and notes from the cast and crew of Mythica 4, with on-set photos from Andrew James, the set photographer. All backers will get a PDF copy sent to them. \nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $95,000 \nA new Mythica song! We will commission another song to play in the end credits of the film, and we will send you ALL a digital copy of said song. \nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $100,000 \nA Mythica short story, expanding the universe with whole new scenes and information that you haven't seen on screen. Maybe it's an adventure that Marek and Egan had before the start of Mythica, or maybe it's some Redthorn's adventure between Mythica 2 and 3... I don't know what it will be yet, as we have tons of material to work with... but Jason and I will write it personally -- even though we only really write screenplays, and this will be a new experience for us. And then we will send you ALL a digital copy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilm is a complicated technical exercise, and often unforeseen difficulties arise, causing budget and scheduling overruns. That being said, we are an experienced group and have successfully completed and released every film we have started. We have produced several visual effects heavy projects in the past, and see no reason why we shouldn't continue to accomplish our goals.\n\nOn the plus side, this film is largely complete. A great deal of the risk in the project has already been mitigated, and we are too far along to turn back and give up. We are seeking funding to complete post-production, and have the personnel to pull it off, regardless of complications.\n\nAnd, we are proud to declare that Arrowstorm has delivered on every Kickstarter we have ever funded that has come due for delivery, 9-out-of-9!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "New Sci-Fi Movie from Arrowstorm Entertainment!", "update_content": "Hi Friends,\nThanks so much for your continued support of indie fantasy and sci-fi films.

This allows for easy removable/reattachable pages, while still retaining the sexy look of a traditional notebook.  \nFeatured On:\nDesign\nThe Rekonect Notebook has a hard cover made of high quality black faux leather that gets better with age. We have used a high grade elastic to hold the notebook closed. \nEach notebook comes with high quality grade paper of 120 pages or 60 sheets. When the Kickstarter Campaign ends we will send out a survey asking you which type of paper you would like to have in your notebook(s). These include: line, graph, dotted, or blank paper. Additional packets of paper will come in a total of 240 pages or 120 sheets.\nFeatures\nOne of the coolest features of this notebook is the magnetic spine. The spine is an automatic pen holder and allows you to simply slide and grab any pen or pencil in a hurry. Remember, the pen has to have a metal clip ;). \nUnlike traditional journals, you get to organize pages the way you want.\nDon\u2019t worry, we didn\u2019t forget about the lefties out there. These pages allow you to write easily on any surface without the hassle of book bindings.\n What can I say, some of us are perfectionists.

Why a kickstarter now you may ask? Well, for the past few years Frank has come straight out of pocket and that pocket is now empty... or it has a hole in it... either way there's nothing but lint and a pawn shop receipt in there and neither buys anything.\nWe just need a little help (miniscule really) getting past the post production finish line. All six episodes of season one are shot, picture is locked and 95% color corrected,  and audio is near a final mix. We just need to get a few dollars to pay for music composition, cast and crew screening (the crew went above and beyond they deserve it), web space and design, a handful digital FX work, and a few post production odds and ends.\nThis production has spent at least $15,000 (... I lost count after a while) on this labor of love (maybe an albatross at this point). Many people on the cast and crew have contributed hundreds of man hours already for a web series we consider to be pretty special and unique.\nPlease help us get it across that line!\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nTony Tibbetts (Executive Producer)\nAutumn Perrotta (Co-Producer)\nMichael Scott Robinson (Associate Producer)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk with any crowd funded project is that the project will never see the light of day. Which is not really a huge risk in this scenario because the project is at least 90% complete. Will Frank get completed without fundraising? Probably, but not very soon and not at the level of quality we think it deserves. I think the cast and crew who have contributed their time and energy deserve the best product possible. \n\nIf the project is successfully funded I believe any obstacles will be minor and easily surmountable.

This campaign is also featuring an all original cyberpunk themed boardgame, CYBER:RUN! The 1-4 player, co-operative strategy boardgame will blend film and boardgaming to a whole new level.\nThe Gamers: Natural One\nIn 2013, our partners at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment teamed up with Lynnvander Media and created 2 awesome movies in The Gamers universe: The Gamers: Humans & Households and The Gamers: Natural 1. Since then both projects have won awards, and The Gamers: Natural 1 recently won Best in Genre at the 2015 Gen Con Film Festival.\nThe Gamers: Natural 1 takes The Gamers property to a new genre of gaming, the futuristic cyber-punk style games. With the story taking two of Dead Gentlemen's and Zombie Orpheus' well known characters from our movies The Gamers: Dorkness Rising and The Gamers: Hands of Fate, Gary & Leo, Natural 1 expanded Gary's family and established a new terrific cast and storyline.\nBy successfully funding this Kickstarter we will be able to continue this story as well as create an epic board game to go along with it.\nThe Budget\nSo where is all this money going? How does it all break out? Pretty much like this:\nThe Gamers: Natural 20 picks up six months after The Gamers: Natural 1 left off. Monica and Ryan are preparing for their wedding. Gary and Leo have come to wish them well. But happiness is short lived as Ryan\u2019s business partners make a deal with a nefarious CEO without his consent. His only chance to make things right? MURDER. No, wait. CYBER:RUN. And murder. Oh, come on. A little murder? No? No murder? OK, fine. On this exhaustingly murder-free journey, Monica and Ryan team up with old friends and new. To victory? Who knows? We just know it\u2019ll be on the low end of the scale when it comes to most murders on film. Thanks a lot, standards and practices.\n\nHow Social Stretch Goals Work\nUnlocking Social Stretch Goals enhances reward levels or unlocks a reward for all backers.

We're also excited to announce some new cast being added to the CYBER:RUN line-up. Some of the cast will be flying into Ontario, Canada from the US and other faraway places to make this production nothing but awesome. We need your help getting them here to make an amazing film.\nDead Gentlemen Productions and Lynnvander Media Inc are poised to make an amazing sequel. \nThe Gamers: Natural 20 is based off the works \"The Gamers\" created by Matt Vancil. The\"Natural 20\" universe is created by Thomas Gofton and written by Andy Dopieralski. The film will be directed by Andy Dopieralski and will employ the avenger-like powers of the creative team Zack Ready (Director of Photography), Chris Wilker (VFX Supervisor - N1), Johnathan Karkar (Score - N1), Rob Mayer (Make-up), Mitch Mommaerts (Steadi-cam) and Aaron Soch (Sound Design - N1). The project will be produced by Scott C. Brown, Don Early and Thomas Gofton.\nCYBER:RUN is a fully cooperative action-strategy board game for 1-4 players. The game takes place in a corporate headquarters where players must work together, fighting the security forces, hacking security systems, and collecting resources to complete a series of objectives. As the turns pass the game gets more difficult, forcing players to work quickly to complete their objectives. CYBER:RUN is drenched in the humor and style of The Gamers: Natural 20, and includes a series of optional video-clips that feature the characters of The Gamers: Natural 20, and replace many of the game's cards.  \nKey:\nYellow means you choose either DVD or BluRay, but not both.\nPurple means you get 2 each.\nThe DVD - The DVD will contain the movie, a trailer, and any special features we are able to include. This may include Outtakes, Deleted Scenes, Commentaries and more!\nThe BluRay - The BluRay will be identical to the DVD, just in HD.\nMockup of CYBER:COIN in Ultimate CYBER:RUNNER Package\nCYBER:PARTY - We are holding a CYBER:RUN party at Gen Con Indy 2016 and we hope you can make it.

Backers at this level and those at higher tiers will receive VIP seating invitations to our special screening. We are aiming for this screening to be our world premiere. It may not be able to be our premiere for a variety of reasons, some of which might be opportunities we can\u2019t refuse. Either way, we\u2019re screening at Gen Con, and you\u2019re invited.

We will post international locations that will ship from the US soon, but we know Australia and New Zealand ships from the US.\nYou can go to RoyalMail to estimate your shipping from the UK. If you live in Europe, Russia, Africa, the Middle East & India, your package will ship from the UK.\nFor the LEVEL3 CONTACT & LEVEL 4 CONTACT Reward Levels (DVD & BluRay respectively), Approximate Shipping info: 7oz.; 7.25\" x 10.25\" padded envelope.\nFor all reward levels $99 and above, Approximate Shipping info: 3.8lbs, 11\" x 11\" x 3\"\nInternational Shipping\nWe are working with fulfillment centers to help bring international shipping cost down. Warning: International shipping is still expensive. We don't have control over that but we will do our best to keep the cost down. Please also be aware that you may be responsible for import duties, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Duties are not included in your shipping charge. However, they may not apply anyway.\nOnce the campaign has reached its goal, we have some great Stretch Goals planned. These goals will enhance both the movie and the board game!!! There is a lot we want to add and make this already amazing movie CYBER-AWESOME!!! Things like cameos, new scenes, etc.\nAfter the campaign is over there is typically a survey you as a backer need to fill out. This will provide us with the necessary information to ship your rewards to you. Additionally you will be able to pick up extra copies of the movie, the game, and any other Add-On\u2019s we offer that you can\u2026 wait for it\u2026 add on to your order. This is where BackerKit comes in. \nBackerkit is an amazing crowdfunding fulfillment tool that can act like an online store for you, as well as allow us to offer preorders, and get your shipping information correct. We can also deliver many digital rewards to you through BackerKit.\nAs mentioned above, you will also pay for your shipping through BackerKit. Please note, that we will likely NOT charge your card until we get closer to fulfilling the rewards. We won\u2019t know the exact costs of shipping until we get closer to actually filling the orders. You can expect us to start notifying you in May of 2016 to get ready.\nWe will add more previews to this section as it comes available. Please do not increase your pledge during the campaign for Add-ons or Shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoth Lynnvander Studios and Dead Gentlemen Productions are experienced media companies who have ran several successful Kickstarters.

Anything from shipping mishaps to something tragic happening to a cast or crew member (especially if they don't make their call!!!), things can happen that no amount of preparation can make you ready for. Every film project and game projects has its risks.\n\nWe will always be in communication with you as soon as we know about something and we always commit to resolving it quickly.

With 3 live action films and 1 animated film, we\u2019re focusing on characters from myth, legend, and faery tale.\nWe\u2019re here to explore intimate, magical stories found in poetry and bring them to life on film.\nStill from \"The Worn Out Shoes\" photoshoot by Kat St. John Photography\nWhen artists collaborate, something magical happens. Something new that reflects many intentions, many ways of seeing and responding to the world. It\u2019s easy to find beautiful, ongoing collaborations between poets and dancers, photographers, textile artists, and even graphics artists\u2026 but what about poets and independent, narrative filmmakers?\nTell Your Children is for people who love independent film, for people who love contemporary, original poetry, and for people who love faery tales, myths and legends. We want to create something new, something layered and engaging to present to an audience. Ultimately, we hope to inspire and encourage more collaboration among artists of varying genres.\nOur main focus is to make a quality poetry short (the first of hopefully many!). The second is to fairly pay the professional cast & crew who will help us make it. That\u2019s why we want to show our appreciation for YOUR support in 3 basic categories: \nDigital rewards are delivered digitally, with no shipping overhead, and put your contribution directly into the film. For instance, The Poems at the $30 level will be delivered digitally, saving shipping and paper, and will be pretty enough for you to print out and display, share, or fold into a poetical origami swan, if you choose!\nArtist rewards are works of art, created just for this campaign by artists whose work inspires us, and are placed at reward levels that allow us to compensate the creators for their time to craft and deliver.\nProducer-level rewards offer a big, personal thank you for Super Contributors.\n...of course, we have a couple of extra special rewards for good measure! \nFor those who love our makeup co-artists, Espionage Cosmetics, we have a limited quantity of  \"Tell Your Children Faery Tale Nails,\" a specially curated 3-design set of high-quality, adhesive nail art (which includes the digital link to the film). Learn more about the Faery Tale Nails in the FAQ.\nFaery Tale Nails\nAnd for those of you who clicked over from the Dead Gentlemen, ZOE, or JourneyQuest, Emilie plans to have a little too much fun recording a series of downloadable Wren ringtones.\nStretch Goals\nOur goal is $6,000, which will allow us to produce 3 live action poetry shorts. We also have several stretch goals, including...\n$8k\u2014Produce the Animated 4th Short\u2014Tell Your Children is intended to be a 4-short series, and this animated 4th short is the curling ribbon on the whole package. The poem is written, the animator is ready. Let\u2019s get it made!\n$10K\u2014Local Festival submissions and throwing a fabulous Screening Event (Live music, poetry readings, refreshments, free to the public at the Grand Cinema in Tacoma, WA)\n12k...???? \u2014 We have many more ideas mapped out... including the addition of physical rewards and added films to the project. We can't wait to reveal them to you as the campaign progresses!\nWe are scheduled to shoot the 3 live-action films this coming November, 2015. Each short will be filmed (or drawn!) on location in the Pacific Northwest. We live in a beautiful, moody, mysterious place, and it\u2019s bursting with creative talent at every seam.\nThe creator of Tell Your Children is Emilie Rommel Shimkus, a poet, actress, vocalist, and 3rd generation NW native. Her poetry has recently appeared in the anthologies Sarasvati Takes Pegasus as Her Mount and In Tahoma\u2019s Shadow. As an actress, Emilie is perhaps best known as Wren, a bardic graduate student on the trail of her epic in the fantasy comedy JourneyQuest. Emilie has also appeared in many other short films, commercial campaigns, stage productions, playwrights' festivals, and as a voice actor in video games. In addition to writing the 4 poems in TYC, Emilie will direct 1 short, act in 1 short, and provide voice-over for the entire project.\nOur producer, Rose Hall is also a PNW native and has produced short, feature, and commercial projects. Recent work includes Brothers, (writer, director), Valley of the Sasquatch (associate producer), Marla Mae (co-producer), and her feature film Fugue, currently in development (writer, producer, director).\nOur directors and director of photography are all active, experienced members of the Puget Sound film, theatre, and poetry communities.\nWe are also lucky to add the varied talents and expertise from working artists for our animation, sound track, poster design, and makeup/special effects design.\nTell Your Children is the inaugural film production of The Northwest Renaissance, a non-profit (501c3) organization with more than 30 years committed to the mission to bring poetry to the communities of the Puget Sound area in Washington State. We do readings, workshops, and publications, and we\u2019re excited to add film as a whole new way to inspire and welcome.\nWe are supported by our producing partners, The Tacoma Arts Commission and 4Culture\u2014who have already awarded the Tacoma Artist\u2019s Initiative Program grant to this project\u2014 and by Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, who will provide added distribution venues after we complete and publicly screen the films.\nWe are so proud to be a female-centric, inclusive, and family-friendly film set. That means that all of our key crew positions are female, including the creator, producers, directors, director of photography, assistant director, and several other positions. It also means our set and shooting schedule will be purposefully designed to accommodate working parents and mothers of infants.\nThank you so much for reading ALL of this! Thank you in advance for any contributions you are moved to make to help us create new, engaging art. And please help us spread the word!

THANK YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTell Your Children has already been through a rigorous vetting process. By applying for and receiving the grant money from the Tacoma Artists Initiative Program, we had already drafted a realistic budget, solicited some donated goods and services, and approached the community for support long before launching this Kickstarter campaign. \n\nMost importantly, we have tackled 3 common issues for small independent film projects: We have secured a venue and have permission to screen (The Grand Cinema in Tacoma, date to be mutually agreed upon by us and the theatre); we have community support and publicity options (non-profit organization with existing audience base, arts commission support, local events, list serves, mailing lists); and we have already approached a distribution partner to help us get the film out in to the world after the screening (Zombie Orpheus Entertainment will offer our film as content to their current subscribers).\n\nBecause this is a film that will be shot out of doors in the great Pacific Northwest, we do run the risk of inclement weather. Our producers and 1st Assistant Director are seasoned NW filmmakers used to our ever-changing weather; they always have a rain contingency plan for minimal impact to schedule and budget. (\"It's the NW. It Rains.\")\n\nLastly: Our cast, crew, and production staff is made up of seasoned talent, both on and off-camera.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, with two more films in the Mythica series planned, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes and Mythica 2: The Darkspore have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 3: The Necromancer - our favorite of the Mythica films thus far!\nAlso, if we don't make our goal, Kevin Sorbo is going to be very... DISAPPOINTED!!!\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Necromancer\nWhen her most loyal friend is taken hostage by Peregus Malister, the cruel master of the Thieves Guild, Marek must embark on a corrupt mission to serve the Thieves Guild with her team of would-be heroes. But when the mission leads them into the clutches of Szorlok - their greatest enemy - Marek must sacrifice her ambitions and perhaps her own soul before her friends are killed, to stop Szorlok from obtaining the Darkspore.\nWatch the trailers for the first two Mythica films below!\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, a natural-born necromancer with a club foot. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, and the off-broadway rock opera, Deep Love.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars and the upcoming release, Dragon Warriors.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series, including Disney's Life Bites.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor, and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less that Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nPhilip Brodie plays Betylla, evil henchman of the Thieves Guild. Philip is an extremely talented British actor and writer, known for Zombie Diaries 2, Dawn of the Dragonslayer and A Landscape of Lies.\nRobert Jayne plays Peregus Malister, the sinister head of the Thieves Guild. Robert is a veteran actor and writer, best known for Tremors, Pearl Harbor and Different Strokes.\n The film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all underway. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, dragon sequences, etc. We want the movie to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\n Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\n We're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution.

I'm excited to share our newest project, Women in Practical Armor.\nEdited by Ed Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy, this project is important to all three of us because we feel showcasing an already empowered female warrior is essential. If women in fantasy are capable and intelligent enough to lead in battle, wouldn't they also be intelligent enough to protect their abdomens, tie their hair back, and cover their faces while fighting?\nEvil Girlfriend Media is passionate about breaking stereotypes and creating new mythology, and our goal with this project is to bring you high quality, well-edited stories that will take the fantasy genre to a new level.\nOur authors are a talented and energetic bunch, and as the campaign progresses we'll be sharing interviews, anecdotes, trivia, and special pledge levels from some of the biggest names in science fiction and fantasy. \nEd Greenwood-Editor: An award-winning Canadian writer and game designer, Ed's books have sold millions of copies worldwide, and his writing credits would easily fill this entire page.\nGabrielle Harbowy-Editor: In addition to being the Managing Editor at Dragon Moon Press, Gabrielle is an award-nominated short story writer and anthologist whose first novel comes out next year. This is her fourth anthology collaboration with co-editor Ed Greenwood..\nErik Scott de Bie: The author of eight novels and counting, speculative fiction is only one of Erik's many talents, which include designing tabletop RPGs, mentoring new writers, fencing, and frenetic rock karaoke.\nJudith Tarr: An award-winning fantasy author and frequent finalist on World Fantasy and Locus award ballots, Judith has been writing steadily since her first novel released in 1985.\nTodd J. McCaffrey: New York Times bestselling author Todd McCaffrey has written more than a dozen books and numerous short stories.\nMary Robinette Kowal: Hugo Award-winning author, award-winning puppeteer, and voice actor, Mary Robinette Kowal also won the 2008 Campbell award for Best New Writer, and is one of the hosts of the Hugo Award-winning podcast Writing Excuses.\nBecause we not only want to do this book, we want to do it right. With your generous pledges, this campaign has covered the costs of production in advance. Our continuing goal is to secure funds to properly market Women in Practical Armor as a major release, as well as pave the way for similar projects in the future.\nOne important component of our Kickstarter that we want backers to know is that the first month of royalties of the book will go to a PTSD charity chosen by Gabrielle Harbowy and me. Every day can feel like a battle for those with PTSD, and we want our backers to know that because of them funding the book, we want to give back.\nWe've got an armory full of great rewards for our backers, so why not try one on for size? As the campaign progresses, we'll be unveiling special offers from our authors, add-ons for your pledges, and more!\nHere's a look at a couple items besides the anthology itself included in our backer levels.\n\nStarting at the PATENT OF NOBILITY level ($50 or more), backers receive a limited edition medallion keychain, crafted by Eloise J. Knapp.\nAt the CLOTH COIF level ($150 or more) Editor Gabrielle Harbowy is offering to knit a \"yarn mail\" hood for five lucky backers. Crafted from a design by (and used with permission) Etsy creator WeeBeeUniquesByJulie, it's the perfect thing to keep your head warm and protected while reading our mind-blowing stories!\nThis coif is only one of the special offers put forth by our creators. For example, Contributor Eric Landreneau has offered an e-book copy of his novel Break! A Tale of Cursed Blood to all backers at the CAP level and above.\nBut this book is bigger than just us, and as mentioned above we want to market and promote it as a major release. Your pledges enable us to do just that, and now that we've funded, we're counting on your help to spread the word about how awesome it is.\nSo let's talk about\nThanks to your support, we've covered the costs of production, including paying our authors and artists professional rates. We know all the places we'd like to market this book, and we know more or less what it costs to do so.\nAnd it costs a lot. Money most independent publishers don't have to spend, so many great projects never go out to more than a few hundred people. We're looking to all of our new friends to help us spread the message in the time we have left, so that we can give Women in Practical Armor the launch it deserves.\nOur first two stretch goals are modest ones, but they have significant impact on how we move forward in marketing the book.\n$7000\nBacker T-shirts (UNLOCKED)\nThanks to our backers, our wonderful Women in Practical Armor T-shirts are now included in all backer levels $100 and up, and are available as $25 add-ons to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher. So check out this awesome backer exclusive in the Add-Ons section below, and get ready for our next stretch goal of...\n$10000\nRaises for WiPA contributors (UNLOCKED)\nWe're already paying our authors professional rates, but we'd love to pay them more. So if we raise at least $10000 with this campaign, we'll be re-writing our contracts to compensate them at 8 cents a word.\nThat's kind of a big deal. And it will certainly raise some eyebrows in the publishing world. Which is exactly what we want. We're changing the world, remember? It starts story by story, one word at a time. And with your help, we'll be there before you know it.\n$12500\nEd Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy (UNLOCKED)\nYou probably know by now that our esteemed co-editors can put together a great book, but did you know they can write? Because if we can raise least $12500 with this campaign, they\u2019ve agreed to co-author an original story for Women in Practical Armor! We\u2019re really excited about this stretch goal, and hope you are too.\n$15000\nBackers-only Release Party (UNLOCKED)\nNorwescon 39 in Seatac, WA is a major science fiction event in the Pacific Northwest, and just so happens to fall right in our expected release window. We\u2019re going to be there promoting the heck out of Women in Practical Armor and other EGM releases, but we also want to recognize all the backers whose support made this project possible.\nSo let\u2019s be honest, of course we\u2019re going to have a party. But instead of just a noisy affair in a cramped convention hotel room, we want to invite the entire legion to celebrate with us at once! So if we raise at least $15000 with this campaign, we\u2019re closing the doors to the general public, and opening it up the entire world.\nThat\u2019s right, if we hit this goal the WiPA backer party will be broadcast live on the web, and you\u2019re all invited! We\u2019ll have contests, prizes, contributor interviews and advance readings, as well as a few surprises. (I have it on good authority that Queen Katie loves to sing).\n$20000\nBecause some women like to do it alone, in the shadows.\nThis stretch goal is one we\u2019ve wanted to announce since this campaign started. Women in Practical Armor was never meant to be alone on your bookshelf. It was meant to be the first of several anthologies featuring already empowered female protagonists. So with this in mind, we're now proud to announce the second volume in the series, and our final stretch goal for this campaign.\nWomen in Comfortable Shoes will present stories of rogues, thieves, assassins, and other self-assured ladies, and with your help, we can do it in style. Right now we can't share much more information than the title, but if we hit our stretch goal we'll be able to guarantee the same pay rate of 8 cents a word to all our authors that we're offering for Women in Practical Armor.\nBut wait, there's more.\n Battle Ready Poster ($10)\nActual woman in practical armor Ann Shilling\nWe teased our Battle-Ready backer poster on day one, and are now prepared to share more about it.  \nAs a $10 add-on for backers at PAULDRONS level and higher, we're offering this full color, 12 x 18 poster detailing the armor worn by real-life woman in practical armor Ann Shilling during our Kickstarter video.\nAnd if that weren't enough, we've got a special reward for our backers at MAIL SHIRT and higher levels. It's this crazy new book called...\nExtra Copy ($12)\nYou've already secured yourself a copy of our trade paperback, and possibly even an e-book as well. But what about your friends? No matter how successful our campaign is, or our subsequent marketing efforts, there will always be someone down the line who's looking for a good read and just doesn't know what to pick.\nBut you do. As a $12 add-on, you can order an additional trade paperback of Women in Practical Armor to share with them. This backer-exclusive price is only available through this campaign, and is available multiple times per pledge.\nBacker T-Shirts ($25)\nSo cool. So Comfortable\nWe've been talking about \"mobile marketing\" for a while now, and although some Kickstarter campaigns lead with extras like this, we wanted to keep the focus on the book and our authors. Now that that's out of the way, we're happy to announce our Women in Practical Armor backer shirts.\nThese great shirts are available as a $25 add-on to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher, and automatically included in all backer levels $100 and higher.\nTo add any of these great bonus items to your existing backer reward, increase your total pledge (using the \"Manage Pledge\" option) to cover the cost of each item you want. \nFor a poster, add $10 to your pledge\nFor an additional trade paperback, add $12 to your pledge\nFor a backer t-shirt, add $25 to your pledge\nThere's no need to change your backer level\u2014in fact, we recommend you do not, unless a different level has other options you want (signed copies, medallion keychains, etc). Changing your backer level does not automatically qualify you for an add-on\u2014you will still need to pledge additional funds for additional items.\nAfter our campaign is complete, we'll send a survey to all backers through which you can identify the items you want. If you want to make sure we know your wishes, send us a message as well (Not a comment, though we'll read that too).\nSo what do you say, backers? Are you ready to march an extra few milestones with us? Because we guarantee there's more cool stuff waiting for us down this road.

If we make it to $12,000, I will offer spiral-bound sheet music for all the songs on the album for $12 each. \n\nI write progressive, feminist children's songs: it's time to make an album. \nIn March of 2014, I left a job I loved so I could have more time to spend with my kid (who was then 1.5 years old) and work on my music. It was a financial strain for my husband and me; we no longer had to pay daycare, but we were still looking at a bit of stress from losing my income. \nAt the time, I was teaching music classes at my daughter\u2019s daycare twice a week in exchange for two days of childcare. I learned a bunch of standard children\u2019s songs, including \u201cThe Wheels on the Bus.\u201d At home, we sang the song often, and the Mommies on the bus and the Daddies on the bus always said \u201cI love you.\u201d At school, the Mommies on the bus said \u201cshh shh shh,\u201d and the Daddies on the bus said \u201ckeep the baby quiet!\u201d complete with finger wagging and stern faces.\nThis floored me. Daddies are just as capable as Mommies of soothing their distressed children, and the whole idea that a Daddy would sternly tell their partner in parenthood to \u201ckeep the baby quiet\u201d was upsetting and unfair. I took my outrage to social media, telling the story, and saying \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be funny if I wrote an album of progressive, feminist children\u2019s songs, with titles like \u2018Only Yes Means Yes\u2019 and \u2018Princesses are for Everyone\u2019 and \u2018Wheelchairs are for Wheelies.\u2019\u201d\nThe response was a resounding \u201cYES YOU SHOULD DO THAT, I WOULD BUY IT.\u201d A friend of mine even replied with \u201cThe Mommies on the Bus Say Smash the Patriarchy.\u201d (Ok, he didn't say \"smash.\" Use your imagination.) After much deliberation, I decided to name the project \u201cYes Means Yes!\u201d and adopted a new children\u2019s music persona named Ms. Cacie (my nickname). \nMy aim is to help people educate children about being good to each other and themselves, embracing diversity, and supporting each other with understanding and compassion. I now have 14 songs ready to be recorded, but I need your help to offset the cost of recording and producing the album. Here are the song titles, themes, and a few links to them on YouTube: \n(all these songs are available to view at http://youtube.com/mscaciemusic)\n\"Only Yes Means Yes\" (consent)\nhttps://youtu.be/u5Dze61vZXo\n\"Princesses are for Everyone\" (gender mores)\nhttps://youtu.be/9RnRKeK0u7Y\n\"Different Families, Same Love\" (this is self-explanatory)\nhttps://youtu.be/x2r-7Mp00yg\n\"Even Dinosaurs Have Problems\" (anxiety)\nhttps://youtu.be/lXFN9-2fhNo\n\"Wheelchairs are for Wheelies\" (ableism)\n\"Dance it Out\" (boredom and self-entertainment)\n\"Time to Rest\" (relaxation)\n\"Make a Face\" (empathy)\n\"The Transportation Song\" (different modes of transportation)\n\"Pretty Isn't Everything\" (self-explanatory)\n\"We Are Who We Are\" (non-binary gender)\n\"What Scares Us\" (fear)\n\"The Super Cleanup Game\" (cleaning up and prioritization)\n\"The Alien and his Robot Friends\" (this one is just for fun)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been working on this for over a year, and it's been a financial strain on my family. Please help me be successful so I can continue to make music - I am lucky to have the life I have, but it's no longer sustainable without an income. If this Kickstarter campaign is a resounding success, I will be able to keep doing what I love, and hopefully you'll love it too. \n\nI have the tentative release date set for March of 2016. September and October are my busy season with music and other part-time work; I'm hoping to start recording as soon as possible, but there is a chance I won't be able to start until early November, which gives me four months to accomplish recording, mixing, mastering, getting album art, and printing CDs. I believe this is a reasonable time frame, but I will post regular status updates as they happen. If the album is finished sooner than March, that's wonderful! If it's not, I will communicate every step of the way to make sure everyone knows what's happening. \n\nI am working with other artists for the rewards packages. I've already spoken to the flower crown maker and she is on board and will be able to fulfill up to 250 crown orders by March. The t-shirt maker does screen printing as his full-time job and is also ready to go when I have the orders for him. The limited edition \"The Mommies on the Bus Say Smash the Patriarchy\" album art is going to be done by Monica Gallagher, who is booked through July and August but said she will be able to get it done well before my release date. \n\nI know that March of 2016 seems a long way off, but I would rather be realistic up front with possible set-backs rather than commit myself to a deadline that I'm not confident I can make.

There are feminists of different ages, races, body types, gender identities - this is the intersectional feminist coloring book you've been waiting for.\nFeatured Feminists so far(note, this list is very likely to grow and change):\nWagatwe Wanjuki, Lindy West, Hari Kondabolu, Kimya Dawson, Feminista Jones, Jenny Yang, Jennifer Pozner, Margaret Corvid, Madison Foster, Marcella Arguello, Elicia Sanchez, Betsey Brock, Kaylani Perisho, Avital Nathman,  Michi Trota, Talcott Broadhead,  AND MORE\nAwesome pictures, inspiring quotes - and you can scribble on their faces- this book has it all!\nGimme the book details.\nThis is a coloring book printed on high quality paper made by - you know- professional book makers. I plan on featuring at least 20 different feminists - however, if the funding is there, I'll definitely add more. Each feminist gets their own page and a badass feminist quote, like this:\na page from the Badass Feminist Coloring Book\nWhere does the money go?\nI think it's obvious from the goal that nobody is trying to get rich here, but let me break down where the $4k is going:\n25% gratuity for the feminists featured (I don't believe feminists should work for free)\n30% printing and shipping\n30% labor and artwork fees (I'm drawing every one of these pages)\n15% fees, unanticipated costs etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProvided I don't suddenly lose my ability to draw - there aren't many risks to this project. I've calculated printing costs - but in case my math is off, I hope to use some of that 15% cushion to cover it.

He is a man of stern political beliefs, ones that he is more than willing to kill for.\nIn the first film, Bill went on a rampage in his hometown of Tenderville, Oregon that left 93 people dead. He disappeared soon after, leaving a video that promised he would rise again...\nIn Rampage: Capital Punishment, Bill took over a TV station in Washington, D.C. Using a hostage camera crew, he let the world witness the carnage. As the police tried to intervene, he detonated explosives hidden within the station, killing everyone inside.\nBill however escaped, and has been waiting, biding his time until now...\nUwe Boll on the set of Rampage: Capital Punishment\nOver 35 years of making films, good and bad, exciting and depressing, controversial and amusing, I have found in my Rampage films something I am truly proud of. Rampage is my favourite of all of my films, and the first time I felt I made something that both reflected me fully as an artist, and engaged the audience in the way I intended.\nEver since we made the first film, fans have been clamouring for more from Bill Williamson, and I felt that we should strike now. Bill, his politics and ethics aside, is a character who believes what he is doing is for the people, and the first two films have struck a chord with audiences in a way that surprised even me. So why not get them involved?\nI want to give you the chance to be a part of the action. Let's make a film for the people, by the people.\n- Uwe Boll, Director of the Rampage trilogy\nBill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) delivering his message to the world\nUpon making Rampage: Capital Punishment, we were hindered in raising finance due to how much the first film had been pirated online. I love that Rampage reached so many people, but to those who finance films it was obviously worrying that they would not see a return on their investment, and so we had a much smaller budget than the first film.\nThe money we raise here will support entirely Rampage 3's final action scene, which will leave the streets of Washington ruined, in a sequence more explosive than anything scene before in the Rampage trilogy.\nHelp us by simply pre-buying the film, so that we can guarantee we will get to make the film we want to make, and you will want to see. We also really do want you to be in the action, and are offering our backers the chance to actually be there amidst the chaos!\nSo join us, and together we will conclude the trilogy in the biggest way possible!\nJust a few of our amazing rewards!\nWe're offering you the chance to be a part of the final chapter in the Rampage trilogy. Through simply buying the exciting rewards along the right of this page, you will help make Rampage 3: No Mercy the best film possible!\nWe have a variety of rewards for backers, from copies of the film, to posters, to the costume, to chances to join us on set or even be killed on-screen in the film (with a full on-set actor experience, including a hotel and travel to and from set).\nLook out for one-off special items and opportunities, and make sure to get involved at any level to ensure you get to be a part of the behind the scenes backer-only content that will continue throughout the film all the way up to release.\n-\nWas ist die RAMPAGE Trilogie ?\nDie Trilogy folgt dem desillusionierten Bill Williamson w\u00e4hrend er versucht die Erde von Idioten, Betr\u00fcgen und L\u00fcgnern zu befreien. Er hat ein klares Konzept und startete mit einem Amoklauf in seiner Heimatstadt Tenderville in Oregon, wo er die halbe Stadt ausl\u00f6schte. Dannach versteckte er sich \u00fcber ein Jahr, um dann wieder aufzutauchen und eine ganze TV \u2013 Station als Geisel zu nehmen. In einem Live Interview macht er Amerika klar, dass wir es leider vers\u00e4umt haben die Welt zu retten und deshalb die Erde untergehen wird. Das einzige was jetzt noch helfen kann ist das T\u00f6ten der politischen F\u00fchrer und der Superreichen.  Am Schluss sprengt er den ganzen Sender in die Luft und entkommt selber durch einen L\u00fcftungschacht. Die Polizei h\u00e4lt ihn f\u00fcr tot.\nWarum ist Uwe Boll hier?\nNach 25 Jahren Erfahrung im produzieren von Filmen, bin ich auf RAMPAGE besonders stolz. RAMPAGE 1 bekam die besten Kritiken von allen meinen Filmen und entfachte die besten Diskussionen mit den Zuschauern.  RAMPAGE 2 kann so nicht alleine stehen bleiben ---- wir m\u00fcssen sehen wie es mit Bill Williamson weitergeht. RAMPAGE 3 wird der letzte Teil sein und weil es sehr schwer ist den Film zu finanzieren, brauchen wir eure Hilfe. \n- Uwe Boll\nWarum KICKSTARTER?\nRampage 2 wurde so oft illegal downgeloaded, dass es schwer ist mit einem sich stetig verkleinernden DVD Markt RAMPAGE 3 zu finanzieren. Wir waren in der Lage schon 20 L\u00e4nder zu verkaufen, aber as Geld reicht nicht, um die grossen Actionszenen, die wir planen auch umzusetzen. Denn diesmal attackiert Bill das WEISSE HAUS. Wir brauchen eure Unterst\u00fctzung.\nWelche Preise bekomme ich?\nIn der Liste findest Du tolle Preise und sogar die M\u00f6glichkeit beim Film mitzumachen ----aber haupts\u00e4chlich geht es ja darum den Film \u00fcberhaupt zu erm\u00f6glichen.

We\u2019re Joey Comeau and Emily Horne and we\u2019ve been making our webcomic A Softer World since 2003. You can go look at the comics for free on our website - www.asofterworld.com. For twelve years we\u2019ve been making sad, weird, harsh and sometimes ridiculous comics. Our whole adult lives, it feels like. And now we\u2019re going to stop. A Softer World is ending.\nTo celebrate the end of the world, we want to make a book. A collection of our favourite comics, from the very first to the very last. The final day of this Kickstarter campaign will coincide with the final comic in A Softer World.\n Over the years, people have said some nice things about our comic.\n  \u201c[like] finishing a really good short story, in a fraction of the reading time.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\"Touching, horrible, depressing, and blackly funny. This is brilliant stuff.\" -- Warren Ellis\n\"One of the most curious and most original webcomics around\" - Comic Book Resources\n\"[ASW] isn't a narrative photocomic, but a poem in words and pictures that transcends what even some traditional comics are capable of.\" - The Comic Pusher\nAnd now those people are going to have to find something new to say nice things about. And that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re stopping. We love doing the comic, love what we\u2019ve created, but we don\u2019t want to do the same thing forever. So, we\u2019re going to stop now while we STILL love doing the comic. Before something dies inside of us and all that\u2019s left is the work. And, as Emily pointed out \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s better to burn out than to get old and weird and pathetic.\u201d\nwhere it all started\nOur previous books have been collections in a more traditional sense. The first book collected all of the first 200 comics in chronological order, the second book picked up where that left off, and so on. But we have more than 1200 comics now, and we want to create a book that is only the very best. Sometimes when you look back on your life, you just want the important memories. Not the happiest necessarily. Don\u2019t get us wrong. Skinned knees and childhood funerals helped make us who we are, too. First kisses and broken hearts.\nWe want to make a book that captures (as much as possible) what the comic meant to us over twelve whole years. And so here we are \u2013 The Best of A Softer World. 200 comics. 2 per page! And we\u2019ll be including some of our six-panel comics, for the first time ever in print. All our favourite comics, plus their alt texts, in one beautiful hardcover package. \nWe present:\n\n* To explain the Remix thing: we'll create a PDF of 40 wildly illegal remixes of our own comic text with images from our favourite pop culture shows and comics and release it into the wild on Bittorrent. These are remixes done by us, but obviously inspired by so many awesome fan remix projects over the past few years.\n And because this is Kickstarter and we like fun as much as the next people, here are the rewards! And there are a lot of them. Books, totes, lighters, heartfelt thank-yous and even the opportunity to select one of your own favourite strips to appear in the book.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBarring international trade disputes, port issues, etc. This should be pretty simple to assemble.

Hence, 10th-ish Anniversary Edition Blu-ray. :) Hey, 2005 counts for something, right? The movie received a ton of support from the tabletop gaming industry, enabling real products to be featured in the movie, like Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition, Munchkin, X-Crawl, as well as nerdy comics like Knights of the Dinner Table and Nodwick. This support legitimized The Gamers: Dorkness Rising in a major way. It exploded over Netflix and Amazon and is now considered required viewing in RPG circles worldwide.\nHOWEVER! This movie was our first film ever shot in HD, and it has never been released on Blu-Ray, until now. That means no one has seen this movie how it was originally intended! Even those who have seen the HD digital download have not seen this movie look as good as it does now. Thanks to Ben Dobyns and his digital mastering wizardry, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising is now in the format for which it was intended. We have pushed the limits of the source footage as far as it will go!\nBecause the costs of authoring a Blu-Ray are so much more than a DVD, we are asking you to take up arms again and pledge your continued support in bringing this movie to its fullest potential.

Desperate to save the integrity of his story from the whims of his players' crazy characters - a horny bard, wild sorceress, and cryptic monk - Lodge allows Joanna (Carol Roscoe), Cass's (Brian Lewis) ex-girlfriend, to join the game. With Joanna's help, the group's characters trek deep into the fantasy game world to retrieve the Mask of Death from the evil necromancer Mort Kemnon (Geoff Gibbs). Will their choices in the game save their friendships in real life . . . or will Mort Kemnon triumph unopposed?\nThe Gamers: Dorkness Rising feature in full, glorious 1080p!\nSubtitles: English, German and Spanish.\nCast Commentary, Crew Commentary\nTrailers: The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, The Gamers: Hands of Fate\nBacker Credits\nDouble the content! See the $21,000 stretch goal above!\nMockup cover image\n    In previous campaigns, we have included domestic US shipping in your reward levels. Kickstarter has finally adapted to making shipping much easier to track and budget for, so there will be a shipping add-on when you select your reward level. We continue to be disappointed at the high cost of international shipping, but our top people are working on that teleporter project. We expect to have that sorted any century now. In the meantime, we are also looking for international partners who can manufacture and distribute overseas to help keep those costs down. \nDead Gentlemen Productions is a group of filmmakers located in the Northwest Washington area of the Pacific Northwest. The group largely met while they were in college, formed an LLC after graduation, and have been making geeky comedy together for 15 years. Some members of Dead Gentlemen Productions went on to found Zombie Orpheus Entertainment with designs on solving some of the distribution problems afforded by Hollywood. The result is their Creator-Distributed, Fan-Supported model which Dead Gentlemen Productions has embraced completely. \nBetween Zombie Orpheus Entertainment and Dead Gentlemen Productions, we have created such titles as:\nDemon Hunters\nDemon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake\nThe Gamers\nHouse Rulez\nThe Gamers: Dorkness Rising\nJourneyQuest Seasons 1 & 2\nThe Demon Hunters RPG and Brotherhood Orientation Video\nThe Gamers: Hands of Fate\nThe Gamers: Humans & Households\nThe Gamers: Natural One\nSketch comedy and live improv, like Gamers: Live and Hat Trick Pony\nAnd we have much more to come, thanks to you!\nPoster art by Conner Marx", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experienced quality issues with Blu-Ray authoring in the past. To help resolve this, we are going with a proven company to author this Blu-Ray from start to finish. \n\nA note on fulfillment: We are expecting to receive the inventory prior to departure to Gen Con in Indianapolis. We will not get to fulfilling this Kickstarter until after Gen Con, so mid to late August. Please be aware we are intending on selling this inventory at Gen Con and have factored in the extra inventory into the cost. Do not worry, we will not sell your copy(ies). But we will not have time to fulfill the Kickstarter before we go. Selling these Blu-Rays will help keep us financially stable, as we typically do quite well at Gen Con. The other rewards however, will not be offered at Gen Con. Just the Blu-Rays. \n\nThat said, being that we have not worked with this vendor for Blu-Ray authoring before, there may be delays that move us past our ability to sell at Gen Con. We will make every effort to be clear in our communications and set the correct expectations so that we get the best quality Blu-Ray possible, and reach our fulfillment goals. If all goes well we hope you will be receiving your rewards by the end of August or beginning of September at the latest. \n\nWe will be using BackerKit once again, which has proven invaluable for fulfilling rewards efficiently, as well as raising more money for the project after the campaign has ended. The typical survey you get after the Kickstarter will come from Backerkit, and we will send that out 1-2 weeks after the campaign has ended.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "Amazon Prime!

Once reported, users will have the option of keeping their report private and cataloguing it in case it escalates, or they can make the report public. If they choose to make it public, they will be able to choose from a menu of options on how they want bystanders to support them, take action, or intervene. They will also be given extensive resources including: safety planning, materials on how to differentiate an empty threat from a real threat, online harassment laws and details on how to report their harassment to authorities (if requested), and referrals to other organizations that can provide counseling and legal services.\nBystanders looking to provide support will receive public requests, along with chosen actions of support. You can \u201chave someone\u2019s back\u201d and know that you\u2019re helping them out in a time of need while directly contributing to safer spaces online. HeartMob staff will review all messages and reports to ensure the platform remains safe and supportive.\nWHY: According to a Pew Research Center survey from late last year, 40% of people have been harassed online, and 73% of people have witnessed someone else being harassed online. Among people between the ages of 18 and 29, this figure jumps up to 92%. For too long, many people have left online spaces because they feel unsafe or unsupported. For too long, many of us have sat back and watched, unsure how to ask for help or how to provide support and resources. With HeartMob, you\u2019ll have a system of supporters beside you, and a user-driven set of actions you can take right now to lend a helping hand. HeartMob can change the internet, making sure that we all feel safe, supported, and empowered online. But we need your help to make it a reality.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Hollaback! needs to raise $10,000 in three weeks to support the development of the HeartMob platform. With just as little as $1, you can show your support for the project and get in on the ground floor. And thanks to support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation -- your dollar will go over further. If we hit our goal of $10,000, Knight will kick in $2,500 if we get 250 backers, $5000 if we get 500 backers, and $10,000 if we get 1000 backers.

ON TO THE STRETCH GOALS!\nSlay the Budget. Donate Now.\nBecause we had such gosh darn fun making season one and our fans are demanding more, it's time to gear up for an even magical-er second season of After Forever!\nSeason two picks up right where we left off in season one: The dragon scale worked! After 600 years as the People's Guardian, Cade is mortal and finally free to fulfill her life long dream of opening Lady SconeHearts' Bakery. But in a world where modern technology and disposable culture have forced most wizards, dragons and other magical beings into hiding, it's up to Cade to bridge the gap between the simple, magical culture she once belonged to and the fast paced present in which she's found herself. Joining Cade are Tucker-- a devoted fan-boy, LOTR guru and graphic designer-- and his journalist sister Vivian. Together, they help Cade adjust to her 21st century retirement.\nBut when a handsome warlock from Cade's youth reappears and threatens to destroy modern society and return to the old, magical ways, Cade's bonds with Tucker, modern life, and bakery retirement are put to the test in our particular brand of fantastical realism.\nIf you haven't already, check out our first season!\nOrigin Story\nThe first season was produced purely for the joy of filmmaking by a team of full time students at Western Washington University on a budget of $300. (Most of which went to feeding the crew on set, since SetGrumps are the worst kind of Grumps.) \nWe were honored to be selected as an Editor's Pick on The Web Series Channel's website, (http://www.webserieschannel.com/forever/) and the first season premiered in front of over 100 people at Western Washington University at a live screening. Since then, After Forever has been included in the Middle Women Film Festival, and the Bellingham Film Festival's online database.\nWith all the joy that season one created, our freshly graduated writer, director and producer Natalie Fedak and her team of delusional film friends are eager to unite their learning with an actual budget and create their best screen adventure yet. \nAfter Forever's Season One Premier\nMoney = Magic\nGood fantasy films require a little movie magic, and movie magic requires a lot of money. With the warlocks, giants, and medieval bakeries we're introducing in season 2, we need funds to construct sets, stitch costumes and pay for special effects worthy of our earth-bending warlock, Pax. We weren't able to do a lot of world building in season one with such a small budget, and we are excited to explore what happens when the magic-medieval universe Cade comes from bumps up against modern culture. \nRest assured that we aren't going to write in fancy explosions and pod races just because we'll be able to afford them in the second installment, *cough* we're looking at you Lucas *cough,* but we want some flexibility in the amount of wonder we're able to put on your screen. We plan to DaVinci together as many on-set effects as possible, but some things, like re-growing chopped trees and hurling vicious pet rocks into magma will simply look better in CGI. (Our current alternative to CGI magma is to boil hot sauce in a glass dish on the stove. Please don't let us do that.)\nBut good filmmaking isn't just about good stories or good special effects, it's also about having good people on board to help make each other's dreams come true. This isn't a student project anymore, and we want to be able to give back to the talented crew that's working on season 2. We aren't going to earn living wages with this project, but every donation goes towards making sure our team members can live happy, healthy lives so they can bring their happy, healthy selves to set. \nOther less exciting costs include upgrading some of our basic equipment so that what you hear and see sounds and looks better, and taking care of some little nitty gritty office costs that get overlooked and then bite us in the bum, ala printing costs, website fees, and endless dry erase markers.\nDon't Be a Monster. Be a Backer.\nMany producers like to give pie chart visuals of the budget break down, so we've decided to see that pie and raise it a scone.\nThis Budget reflects the bare minimum that we need to make Season 2. If you help us slay this Budget, a second season will rise from its ashes. \nBUT, if you help us super-slay it, then we can make a super second season. Any money we raise beyond our goal will go straight back into the production, so the more we raise, the more detailed the sets, the nicer the costumes, the cooler the locations, AKA, the more magic you'll get to see on screen!\nBattle Plan\nSeason 2 will feature 9 episodes of about 10 minutes each. As of now, we plan to spend May through July in Pre-production (making costumes, props, rehearsing, scheduling locations etc...) and we plan to begin filming in August. Depending on team schedules and Bellingham's often rainy weather, we should be done by late September and into post production by October. (See RISKS SECTION Below for more details.)\nDepending on our CGI budget, we will spend a couple months in post-production, and plan to premier the second season in late winter/early spring of 2016 on our YouTube channel and at public screenings around the Northwest.\nOur Mountain of Why's\nIt's important to us that funders understand why we do what we do. Sure, on the surface, we make goofy movies and swing around swords, but our content and our production process come out of a very intimate place, and we want you to understand the gooey insides of this project. \nOur writer, director, and producer Natalie wrote After Forever for many reasons, but a chief motivation was to see audiences react to a woman written as a conventionally male archetype (ie, warrior, guardian). BOOM: Cade. Similarly, Natalie wondered how people would accept a more emotional, supportive male character, since the gender stereotypes in Hollywood are equally pervasive for men. Enter: Tucker.\nHer mission wasn't to swap the archetypes just for giggles, it was to subvert the way we label certain traits as male or female, and show that every trait is simply \"human.\" Based off people's reactions to season one, audience humans liked it when movie humans felt human. Huh.\nWith season 2, Natalie's excited to show how dynamic characters can be when they aren't shoved into a box, and unless you're a vampire and enjoy dwelling in boxes, we hope you're excited too.\nOur last little dose of inner-gooey comes in the form of Earth friendliness. Our team has been offered a special deal on a solar powered generator from the sustainability engineers at Goal Zero, and regardless how the Kickstarter turns out, our team will be purchasing the equipment to make our future films with renewable energy. A solar power generator isn't the answer to all our prayers, but it's a start, as is composting and recycling on set, using recycled construction materials, drinking from re-usable water bottles and carpooling everywhere possible. \nWe need a planet to make movies on, and for now, Earth is the one we have and the one we should take care of.\nYou can read more about our Team and their inner gooies on our website under the ABOUT US page.\nwww.afterforeverwebseries.com\nPERKS!\nA Sneak Peek at our Stand Alone Perks:\n$50 pledge: A hand crafted Mini Cade Plush Doll\n $50 Pledge: Miniature Creature Figurine\n $300 Pledge: A hand made youth Toth Bow.\nStretch Goals:\nIf we reach $7000, we can afford to fly in The Sorceress from season one! \nIf we reach $8000, we will make miniature models for some of the epic battle scenes at the end, where we need to destroy a whole bunch of buildings. BOOM.\nIf we reach $10,000, we will include a flashback scene of a little Cade and her warlock friend Pax growing up together.\nIf we reach $15,000, we will film Cade giving a scone-baking lesson at Lady Scone Heart's bakery. Think Ina Garten meets Game of Thrones. \nIf we reach $20,000, we will release Cade's unaired episode from the canned reality TV show Hero to Zero: The People's Guardian.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSeason One is proof that we do what we say. If we meet our goal, Season Two will be made.\n\nTherefore, the greatest risk we face is adjusting to whatever budget we raise. If we raise just a teensy bit more than our goal, then our production won't change too much. But if we raise, say $50,000, then the possibilities for what we can create will expand exponentially, and we'll need time to readjust and implement our new potential (a daunting challenge we are more than willing to take on.) \n\nThe other risk lurking in the dark is staying on schedule. While this has never been a problem for us before, we believe in quality over quantity, so if trolls steal our footage or the rain gods decide to pee on us during an outdoor shoot, we will extend our schedule to make sure we deliver our best movie when it's ready, not a crappy one on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Where the Road Has Led", "update_content": "Nearly three years have passed since last I wrote, and honestly, I didn't know if I would ever post on this page again. \nThe collapse of After Forever was devastating.

Soon, I embraced our play group style and started writing adventures that were more like raunchy cartoons. After all, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. \nOur philosophy: It can't be wrong if it makes us laugh!\nI moved to LA after film school and began film-making and animating. Along the way, I met many fellow gamers and artists. After exchanging hilarious gaming stories with Edward Shannon and Patrick Carpenter, we created the Game Knights half-animated series. We needed a prop, parody version of D&D for the characters to play, so Beasties & Bygones was born! We ended up filling this fantasy game world with so much satire, silliness and raunchy comedy that we realized B&B was too big for just a show, so we started creating the real B&B RPG using storytelling techniques I learned in film school.\nWe are making this ridiculous, possibly offensive parody of D&D because it's funny! \nPlease tell your friends (with a sense of humor) about this campaign. \nEvery pledge that includes a print copy will get one limited edition Afrodo the Archer Meeple FREE*!\n*Afrodo the Archer Meeple is available as an addon to any pledge for $3 each! \nAdventure in the world of the Saytrs & explore sexuality with the Sexuality Supplement!\n We are very close to unlocking the next stretch goal!\nIf we raise $4000, We will create a supplement tat explores the traveling circus in Al'tearth!\n If we reach 150+ backers, this Supplement will be added to the Season One Adventure Bundle.\nTo share click on \"Share this Project\" and then the \u2018f\u2019 button under the video at the top of the page.

They can invoke the Taint to cause randomness and impossible things to happen but they have no control over it. Some of their spells/jokes require people to laugh and most of them feature what we call a Targeted (AoE) Area of Effect.\nDownload Sneak Peek #2 The Ivory Tower of Decency Quick-Start PDF!\nClick here to download the Alpha Version of the Quick-Start!\nAdventure Overview\nNot long ago in a quaint town, a powerful Wizard's child came home and said a bad word. This strict puritan Wizard was so offended, he cast a \"Protection from Words\" spell on his own child, so if he ever spoke that bad word again it would be bleeped. The Wizard was pleased with himself until he noticed that his child was coming home every day, depressed and defeated. He was considered an outsider for not being able to curse while his friends could freely f-bomb each other. The angry Wizard decided, to protect his children from exposure to what he called \"bad words\", he had to cast the spell on the other children as well. He gathered the most powerful wizards and convinced them that to protect their offspring, they had to join forces. They did cast the \"Protection from Words\" spell and not just on all the children but the whole town. Now children could never hear damaging words again and the Wizards Communication Cabal was born. \nOur adventurers stumble into town and are greeted by merchants selling wares, children playing in the streets and somber adult faces. They start noticing the townsfolk are using nonsensical words in place of curses. Eventually, they hear the bleeping as someone attempts to curse. The wizards flex their magic muscles, as more and more words are deemed indecent and thus bleeped out of existence. Soon they target the evil flesh that could tempt our children and a \"Protection from Flesh\" spell is cast. Everybody in the town, including the players have blurry ankles because the wizards decided they didn't want their children seeing a naked ankle. An underground resistance called the Coalition of Cussing (CoC) has been gathering. They've been meeting to curse at each other, define codes for \"bad words\" and to look at each other's ankles. ;)  Will the Wizards accomplish their sanitized goal of having a town full of blurry people bleeping at each other?\nWatch our half-animated comedy series, Game Knights!\nA sophomoric, spoof-filled, fantasy world and the tabletop RPG played in Game Knights, the series.\nBeasties & Bygones is an irreverent, upside down RPG that gives you permission to go too far. Satirical, edgy, social commentary with a comedic overtones. There will be no titillating nudity, but there will be mature themes explored for comedic lampooning. We created a parody game world called Al'tearth where your characters can attack taboo topics while exploring, socializing and misadventuring.\nAll books will be available in Dungeon World and 3.5 Open Game License. To learn about the Dungeon World Rules System click here: Dungeon World!\nNow all we need is finishing funds and support in unlocking stretch goals so we can commission more artwork and writers!\nTheme-based, parody storytelling!\nEvery episode/adventure is crafted around a subject and a thematic question. The players can be aware of the subject but they shouldn't know the exact thematic question. The subject for The Ivory Tower of Decency adventure is censorship, but the thematic question could be: Is freedom of expression worth the risk of Tainting your children?\nBeasties & Bygones adventures are written in a loose 3 act structure.\nMost fronts/encounters represent a different angle/bullet point that will either support the one point of view or support the opposite point of view through challenging dangers/encounters within a loose three act structure. B&B adventures are always designed as if the antagonist is the main character. The players decide how their characters change/grow through role-playing, spending XP, and bonding. Also, it gives the antagonist more depth.\nIf players get too distracted or stagnant the GM can play a Plot Twist. That will change the direction of the whole adventure and move the story along. The Plot Twists typically represent the opponent's actions off-screen!\nAl'tearth is a low tech magic-infused clone of Earth!\nAl'tearth's geography is almost an exact replica of Medieval Earth because it was created with a powerful clone spell by an earthborn wizard from middle ages named Gareth Guygaxian. Since it was created to protect the creatures of magic, it is a low-tech world. The clone spell drained Earth of it's magic, superstitions, \"Mythical Creatures\" and Ancient Gods.\nMany Mythical Creatures call Al'tearth their home but most Beasties were tainted upon arrival:\nSome creatures were but a daydream on Earth & now exist in Al'tearth, like the Dingle Faeries; tainted faeries that serve the Excremental Gods. \nSome creatures were merged into one like the Chupasasquatch; The Chupacabra of Mexican lore merged with the Sasquatch or like Mime-pyres; who were Vampires that merged with Mimes.\nAncient Gods from all mythologies have been twisted into bizarre bygones of their former selves. They govern each other with a yearly award ceremony and grant each other positions in the Zodiac Council. Sampling of Bygones:\nPenetor, the God of Fertility was Priapus in Ancient Greece.\nHermaphrodite wasn't always the androgynous lord of sexual ambiguity, s/he was once Aphrodite, Greek God of love, beauty, and sexual passion:only \nThe races are fragmented across this medieval alter-earth and are as varied as the lands they originated from on earth:\n\nSatyrs are a debaucherous society that elects it's king every four years with a triathlon that includes competing in a drinking challenge, a talent show and public intimate performances. They must have intimacy every 7 days or they frenzy.\nThree-Quarterlings are halflings that grew a little taller then their halfling cousins and have formed a a society that is pretty close to Utopia. They come in all colors and the only judgement they make on each other is size. The taller they are the more status received.\nHalf-Ettins are, essentially a race of co-joined twins. They are rather rare and their life involves heavy co-operation because each head controls half of he body. (Note this will be a cool role-play option as two players can play one half of a character. Wrestling for control of each action or cooperating and making two heads truly better than one.)\nFunding Goals\nThis Kickstarter funds the creation of the Beasties & Bygones Corebook and the Season One Adventure Bundle.

For this print run of the physical books, we are going with a print-on-demand publisher who has a strong reputation to ensure that printing/shipping goes smoothly.\n\nOur backers are very important - that's why we've researched and received guidance from several successful Kickstarters like Ron Newcomb (The Rangers), Andres Salazar (Pariah, MI), and others.

The game world is bursting with loads of content, the book is being laid out in rough form, and some of the artwork for the book is complete. With two different versions of the book, however, there is the potential for possible delivery delays due to unforeseen circumstances.

To that end, we'll be reimbursing our judges, organizers, and gamemasters who run a certain number of hours worth of events. A 1-day badge will be reimbursed for anyone who runs 8 hours of events, and a 3-day badge will be reimbursed for anyone who runs 18 hours of events.\nJust our way of saying thanks!\nSee you in May!\n\nMULTIPLE REWARDS\nSo you want to buy more than one badge? No problem! Just pick the most expensive of your rewards, and after clicking through, simply add on the price of any other rewards you also want. For example, instead of making two accounts to get a couple of 3-day badges, simply pick the 3-day reward once, and then donate 90 dollars instead of 45.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, with several more films in the Mythica series planned.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, has been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers. \nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 2: The Darkspore with you. It is even bigger, better and more epic than the first film.\nHere's a quick word from the creators of Mythica:\nHOW CAN I WATCH MYTHICA 1?\nIf you'd like to catch-up and watch Mythica 1, it premiered in the US on CONtv, so click on the CONtv Originals logo below to create a free account and watch Mythica 1!\nIf you live outside of the US, you can download Mythica 1 directly from our website. Go to: http://watch.arrowstormentertainment.com\nHere is a trailer for Mythica 1:\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Darkspore\nWhen Teela\u2019s sister is murdered and a powerful relic stolen, Marek and her friends face a sinister new enemy - Kishkumen, a foreign mystic bent on reclaiming the Darkspore for his master Szorlok. Armed with twin maps, Marek and her team race Kishkumen and his horde through creature-infested lands, to a long abandoned underground city \u2013 all the while pursued by bounty hunters intent on returning Marek to slavery.\nJoined by the mysterious dark-elf warrior \u2013 Qole \u2013 the team journeys deep underground to discover that the ruined city is now home to an undead dragon. Trapped between Kishkumen and the dragon, Marek and her team must employ all their skill and magic to battle the beast, and combat Kishkumen for their hard won treasure and their lives.\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, a natural-born necromancer with a club foot. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, and He Knows My Name.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars and the upcoming release, Dragon Warriors.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series, including Disney's House of Anubis.\n Rocky Myers play Qole, a mysterious Dark Elf warrior. Rocky is a very talented actor who has starred in previous Arrowstorm films Survivor and Cyborg X. You can also catch him in the action-thriller Safari and the kids adventure, RoboRex.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his first appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor, and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew.\n The film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all underway. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, dragon sequences, etc. We want the movie to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\n Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe've sent Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (the first film in the series) out to a few reviewers and have received some stellar feedback:\nMOVIE PILOT REVIEW\nGEEK DAD REVIEW\nTV EQUALS REVIEW\nALEX BLEDSOE REVIEW\nFAITH GEEK REVIEW\nDUNGEON CRAWLER REVIEW\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade.

Romas Collection of Horn & Hardart Memorabilia\nAmericans once sipped coffee and ate pie around communal tables, sharing their struggles and dreams with strangers at Horn & Hardart\u2019s iconic Automat. Lifetimes ago, these working class palaces nourished a sense of unity that bridged the diversity of class, language, gender and race in the urban melting pots of the East Coast.\nThe story begins in a booming Philadelphia in the late 1800s. White-collar workers are flooding into the offices of newly built skyscrapers, and lunchrooms are springing up to feed them. Coentrepreneurs Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart seize their chance and by the early 1900s have BUILT a thriving chain of small restaurants and cafeterias, the latter a brand new trend of its own. Hardart brings back from Europe inspiration for the Automat, a \u2018waiterless\u2019 cafeteria that proves enormously popular, making the Horn and Hardart chain the dominant American restaurant company for the next half century. Kings of the New York and Philly restaurant scenes, the Automats feed millions throughout the Depression and two World Wars, serving all comers in palaces of marble, silver, and steel. Good food served cheap, and the enduring thrill of the automat machines themselves wins the Automat a place in our culture and hearts alike.\nTravel back in time to experience this unique piece of America's history, an exciting story and one that may seem strangely familiar. More than just entertainment, THE AUTOMAT is a parable of how we once dined happily together before turning to the isolated and unhappy experience offered by fast food, a bad deal that no amount of advertising can disguise.\nOur Goal & Our Drive\nWhat started as a shared fascination with cafeterias and their culture, has turned into an incredible educational journey. As we dive deeper into the archives and hear stories told by people who experienced Horn and Hardart's restaurants first hand we appreciate more and more what we once had but have since lost.\nThe Automat is a project already two years in the making, with hundreds of hours of interviews and archival research behind us. We are seeking funding to complete shooting of the documentary film and to begin post-production work.\nThe money will help pay for:\nInsurance\nEquipment Rental\nPermits\nTransportation\nDirector of Photography\nTranscription\nEditing\nIn the event we exceed our goal we will be able to get further into the post-production process. \nRewards\n  The Team\nDirector/Producer | Lisa Hurwitz\nLisa is Director and Producer of the THE AUTOMAT. Lisa's background is in arts administration. She directed the 2012 and 2013 Olympia Film Festivals and was Executive Administrator at Bumbershoot 2014: Seattle's Music & Arts Festival. She is very proud to have spent 4 years as a volunteer 35mm film projectionist at the Olympia Film Society at the historic Capitol Theater while getting her B.A. from The Evergreen State College. She is also proud to have run the Film Society's successful and crucial digital cinema conversion campaign. \nProducer | Alec Shuldiner\nAlec authored the 2001 PhD dissertation the film is based on, Trapped Behind the Automat: Technological Systems and the American Restaurant, 1902-1991. As a Producer and Historical Consultant on THE AUTOMAT, he is assisting in adapting his dissertation for the screen. Alec received his B.A. in Comparative Religion from Harvard University and his doctorate in Science and Technology Studies from Cornell University. He lived for many years in the Netherlands where automat machines are still popular. Currently he works for Autodesk, a leading provider of 3D design, engineering and entertainment software.\nAssociate Producer | Becki Chandler\nBecki is the Associate Producer for THE AUTOMAT and Production Designer for various film projects and interactive corporate events. She worked as an Operations Manager for a NY based non-profit focusing on human rights, civil rights, fighting anti-Semitism and promoting tolerance. She studied and worked as an Interior Designer & Project Manager for over 15 years. She has served on various non-profit boards, supporting fundraising campaigns, strategic planning, and educational programming. Becki is the granddaughter of immigrants that settled in NYC and ate at the Automat.\nCinematographer | Philip Lucas\nPhilip is a graduate of The Evergreen State College where he studied film with an emphasis on social justice. His work has ranged from experimental travelogues to a broadcast quality sitcom pilot. Outside of filmmaking Philip's main interests are writing, photography, and he is a passionate cook with a flair for French cuisine. He now resides in Philadelphia and has a cat named Leonard Nimoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been extremely fortunate thus far to have access to historians, members of the Horn & Hardart families, Horn & Hardart employees & customers, and celebrities. Many have provided time, archival material, services, and resources in-kind. We have managed to keep our costs down considerably because of those who have graciously supported us. We have not only made a commitment to ourselves but to those who have been part of our journey.\n\nOur risks are not being able to do in-person interviews with those who are strong components to the story. Because this project is based so heavily on personal stories and experiences, it would be challenging to build the story without these. \n\nIt has been incredibly inspiring to hear people talk about this project.

Peasant\u2019s point of view.\nThe story behind Suspension of Disbelief began when we started reminiscing about our LARPing days. Every month was filled with evil villains, horrible monsters and world-ending danger; which lead to the question: \"Who the hell would want to live here?!\"\nProof of Concept Pilot\n Proof of Concept: Fence of Summoning\nThe show started with a few sketches about the crazy things that happen in, really, any fantasy game as seen from the NPCs point-of-view.  We had a few generic townies standing in as our protagonists watching as people were assassinated in broad daylight, corrupted the basic fabric of reality and came up with the dumbest character names.  \nAfter we held an open casting call, those protagonists really took shape.  We initially imagined four men in the roles, maybe gender-flipping one or two if we needed to.  Turns out, we had four phenomenal women blow us away at auditions.  They came in immediately harnessing the possibilities in these characters, breathing a real life into them.  After meeting those four women, there was no question.  Our Salvagers would be women.  And they would be hilarious.\nWe knew we had something special after the initial table read.  We filmed the shorts over a long weekend, building the exterior porch and interior of our own Last Chance Tavern.  As we edited the shorts, we began sketching out future adventures.  The story took a life of its own, growing into its own fleshed out fantasy world.  The more we saw of the work our cast had done, the more we knew that this show deserved more.  After much deliberation, we came to the conclusion that a few short sketches wasn\u2019t going to be enough for these women, these characters or this new world we had discovered.  Taking what we had already filmed as a proof of concept and the centerpiece of the first season, we began rewriting in earnest, introducing more characters, more intrigue and more monsters for our special effects department to play with.\nSeason One is now a feature-length season told in seven episodes.  We follow the Salvagers as they try and survive: monster-summoning fences, rogue adventurers, sentient vegetation, visiting nobility, undead hordes, and totally harmless old men with ulterior motives. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of this new show and we need your help to unleash it on an unsuspecting world!  BWAHAHAHA...sorry.\nFind Us On Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SODSeries \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sod_series\nTumblr: http://isthatblakeoutlaw.tumblr.com/\nFrom the beginning we wanted to tell this story from a peasant's-eye view. We wanted to start off with a simple story of simple people trying to make a life under extraordinary circumstances.\nOut of our first few sketches came the Salvagers. They don't hunt, they don't fight, they don't take sides, they stay out of politics and crazy adventures. The Salvagers pick up what's left behind on the battlefield when the Heroes are done fighting, either because they're victorious or they've fallen and their spirits are on their way to be resurrected. The Salvagers, or others like them, sell gear back to unlucky adventurers or to merchants in town at a reasonable mark-up.\n Dani is played by Madi York\nWilla is played by Madeline Hatter\nSally is played by Adena Brumer \n Myke is played by Christina Leidel\nThis is a world with a severe class distinction between Heroes and the rest of us. For Heroes life is easy, money is plentiful, power is assumed, and death is a minor inconvenience.\nBeing a hero in Arbrontith means weighing your options, following the directions of your Faction and kicking selective ass at a rate that would make a third-world dictator blush.  Being literally anyone else means running, hiding, swearing, scratching out whatever existence you can manage, running some more and definitely NOT farming.  It means turning a blind eye to random crimes and wanton slaughter in the streets.  It means only counting on heroes to do the bare minimum required to get some sweet loot while your home is invaded by goblins or burned by pillaging barbarian hordes.\nSome heroes are assholes.  Ok, most heroes are assholes.  But some show up with the express purpose of robbing and killing their way to the top.  It always seems cool to wear all black and be the villain until you run face-first into an Abyssal Horror and find out what true Evil feels like.\nOf course there are the monsters, too.  The Dark One summons them from the surrounding countryside, conjures them from the Hellmouth (did we mention there\u2019s a Hellmouth?  That\u2019s pretty hazardous to one\u2019s health.) or finds ways to manipulate weaker minds into becoming his eternal Doom Slaves.  They arrive regularly, almost by some unseen schedule, fight heroes (even though instinct should tell them not to go near the place where untold thousands of their brethren have been massacred) and die horribly.  Some are truly terrible and dangerous.  Some, like our artistic goblin friend pictured above, are pretty stupid and relatively harmless.  Just watch out for what\u2019s on his paintbrush.  It\u2019s probably not poop.\n HeadGames Entertainment has been around since 2007. We've spent seven years making films, succeeding, failing, and learning from those failures.

(see below)\nThe concerts were raw, moving, and powerful.  Russian Orthodox Church music,  soldier songs, and folks songs rang through the halls.\n\nThe concerts also included the first-known performance of the original ending of Chesnokov\u2019s \u201cNe otverzhi mene\u201d (Do Not Forsake Me When I am Old) by guest soloist: Glenn Miller.\nWhen we recorded the concerts, we had no intention of releasing them as a CD - but then we heard them and knew we had to share with our family and friends!  The concerts were recorded live and as such, they are not perfect.  However, they bring with them that stunning, true power that only a live performance can bring.\nPlease consider supporting us in the creation of this CD.\n-------\nWhat you get!\nAn amazing CD with songs never-before-performed by an American choir.

In order (high to low):  baritones, light basses, strong basses, strong basses with a good low register, Oktavists with medium range and power, and strong/deep Oktavists.  \nThe more modern, functional, definition of a Basso Profundo is Chesnokov\u2019s strong/deep bass - a bass with an exceptionally low voice with tremendous power.\nWe were lucky enough to have 6+ men who fit these descriptions!\n------\nGlenn Miller, Basso Profundo Soloist\nKnown for his unique Basso Profundo voice, Glenn Miller has performed all over the world.

While at Westminster, he sang and recorded with leading orchestras in New York City under the direction of Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, James Levine, Seiji Ozawa, Robert Shaw and William Steinberg.\n\nHe earned his Master of Music degree in choral conducting from the University of Oklahoma. Additional studies in choir training include work with Dr. Craig Hella Johnson, Dr. Barry Rose and Dr. John Scott in the United States and in England. He is active in the Royal School of Church Music in America, particularly its King's College (Wilkes Barre, PA) summer chorister training course. He also prepares singers for guest conductors that have included James Litton (the American Boychoir), David Briggs (Director of Music emeritus, Gloucester Cathedral), Andrew Lumsden (Winchester Cathedral), Gerre Hancock (St. Thomas Church, New York City), Murray Somerville (Harvard University), Richard Tanner (Blackburn Cathedral) and Paul Trepte (Ely Cathedral).\nHe has enjoyed a distinguished career and continues to be in great demand as a professional choral singer, performing and recording with: the Choir of St. Paul's Cathedral, London; the Choir of St. Thomas Church, New York City; Conspirare (Austin, TX); the Robert Shaw Festival Singers; the New York Choral Artists.  He has served congregations in Wyomissing, PA, Oklahoma City, and Somerville, NJ.

It was developed by the Transolar Team in partnership with Vexing Media.\nTransolar Galactica\nThe Game\nRobot Rundown comes packed with challenging gameplay, loads of humor, and an awesome eight-bit graphic design and musical score. Plus there's a ton of cool video cut scenes built into the game that weave the story into the Transolar universe.\nYou play as Sol-Bot, the underappreciated, motorized newbie heroine of the S.S. Transolar\u2019s crew. After an unintended crash, you learn that the S.S. Transolar\u2019s flight records, including the truth behind the accident, are stored within your databanks. That makes you a target. Now the UGCA is after your beating mechanical heart, and it\u2019s up to you and your Transolar allies to escape.\nRobot Rundown has already been designed, created, and published and it is currently available in the Apple AppStore. But we want to do more...\nRobot Rundown is currently only available on the iOS platform. We want to make our game accessible to as many people as possible, on as many platforms as we can- not just to iPhone users.\nWe want to get Robot Rundown onto these platforms as well:\nAndroid/GooglePlay\nSteam\nPSP\nXbox One Store\nPlaystation Store\nXbox 360 Store\nIn addition to getting Robot Rundown onto multiple platforms, we want the game to get as much exposure as possible in order to gain new fans for our show. All proceeds from the sale of the game will go toward the second season of Transolar Galactica. Our hope is by getting the game out there on as many devices as possible, we'll boost the signal for our series and its upcoming second season.\nWhen the Transolar Team ran into production delays on our second season, the last thing that we wanted to do was stop everything, and just wait silently while we waited for things to start up again. Especially after our fans had been so supportive of us! So we decided to find ways we could continue to create content for our fans without the need for our full film production crew... hence, Robot Rundown was born!\nHowever, even with our hard work, ingenuity, and the support from programmer Brandon Smith of Vexing Media... games are expensive to make! You have to purchase the development software, licenses, and pay additional fees to get your game out there for people to play it. And the Transolar Team was not going to reach into our funds for Season 2 to pay for the game. Our fans want to see the best Transolar Season 2 possible, so we decided to incur minimal costs and just release the game only on iOS. \nImmediately after we released the game, we were overwhelmed with the demand to get it onto other platforms. \"ANDROID! ANDROID!\" our fans cried. Well, we heard your pleas, and we want to deliver. So that's why we're here on Kickstarter with the hopes to raise the funds necessary to get Robot Rundown into as many hands as possible. \nOne thing the funds raised here ARE NOT going to is labor costs. Four people created this game and just like with Season 2 of our show, we want the money to go to improve and distribute the game - Not to line our pockets. So rest assured that the money you pledge will be directly helping make Robot Rundown and Transolar Galactica better.\nHere's the cost breakdown of getting Robot Rundown out there to the world at large:\nAnd the cool thing is by helping fund us, you not only ensure the game will be distributed to every corner of the galaxy... but you also get cool, exclusive stuff in return!\nBelow is a handy chart for you to see what goods you'll get with each pledge tier. \nGAME SOUNDTRACK\nOur music composer for the series, Christian Ballard, laid down a wicked 8-bit style soundtrack for Robot Rundown, and we are really excited to announce that Christian is fleshing out the music from the game into a full album that will be available to our Kickstarter backers first before anyone else! Pledge $25 or more to get your ears filled with 8-bit jams!\nLIMITED EDITION RELEASE POSTERS\nAnd below is a look at the designs for our Limited Edition Robot Rundown Release Posters. There were only 15 of each poster printed. Once they're gone, they're gone! Posters measure 18\" x 24\" and have a matte finish.\nYOUR VERY OWN SOL-BOT!\nAnd, if you've got the gumption (and funds), you can pledge at our top tier and receive this little gal... A handcrafted replica of Sol-Bot, the heroine of our game, and a fan favorite in the series:\nA handcrafted Sol-Bot Figure (Approx. 10\" tall)\n Robot Rundown is a fun and addictive game, but we want to continue to build upon it and keep making it a better and more fun experience for everyone. So if we happen to raise more than our goal of $3500, we have plans to expand the game in really awesome ways. Below is a chart showing our stretch goal increments. Each time we reach one of the goals listed below, we'll \"unlock\" the new aspect we'll be implementing into the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs stated in our project description, the Transolar Team is still working to deliver its second season from our last Kickstarter. Robot Rundown is our way of delivering interactive content to our fans during our production delays.\n\nThere are little to no risks associated with this Kickstarter because the game has already been developed. We're just asking for support to increase the amount of platforms the game is available on.\n\nThere may be a few challenges in tweaking/re-coding the game to function properly on the intended future platforms, but its nothing the Transolar Team can't handle. Since Steam Greenlight is a platform that requires public voting to get a game onto the platform, our challenge there will to encourage all our backers and supporters to help BOOST THE SIGNAL when we submit Robot Rundown to Steam Greenlight, to ensure our approval.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "All Rewards Sent!!", "update_content": "THANK YOU, BACKERS!\nBecause of your support, we've reached our funding goal of $3500.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. :) After the campaign closes, stay informed by reading the kickstarter updates or the official Five Moons RPG blog!\nOctober 28 Update: We hit the $35k funding goal, so the Monster Guide is pre-funded! As a special bonus for that stretch goal, we're adding a free PDF of theMonster Guideto every print Monster Guide reward.\nOctober 22 Update: Here's an example-of-play video demonstrating the skills, combat, and using the \"boost\" game mechanic for various effects.\n  Five Moons is a fantasy RPG designed by me, Sean K Reynolds. Its play style will be familiar to fans of D&D and the Pathfinder RPG, but colored by my experiences in the tabletop, card, and video game industry over the past 19 years.\nDo you spend more time creating a character than actually playing that character? Does the minmaxer in your group hog the spotlight instead of being a team player? Do you think spellcasters are too good compared to fighters and rogues? Does your character's dependence on magic items feel like a \"Christmas tree\"? It's time to reboot your playing experience. \nWith Five Moons RPG, you can play a character that's fun and successful without having to focus on combat math. You can choose skills that make your character well-rounded--without making you vulnerable. You can wear magic items that are fun and flavorful instead of just being a source of plusses. You can defeat opponents using diplomacy or intimidation, and not just with one all-or-nothing roll.\nThis is a game that mixes old-school simplicity with the customizability of a modern RPG.\nThe goals for this game are:\n* Create a book that's easy to read, understand, play, and reference, like the Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box (a product I wrote and am very proud of).\n* Make characters less dependent upon their gear to survive and succeed.\n* Elevate martial characters to have parity with spellcasters, but still maintain fun and distinct flavor for each class. (caster/martial disparity blog #1) (disparity blog #2) (wands obsolete skills blog)\n* Reward roleplaying, teamwork, adventuring, and social interaction instead of focusing on damage output in combat. (teamwork blog)\n* Create a longer play experience in the leveling \"sweet spot\" (the D&D/PFRPG equivalent of level 6 to level 12) and allow characters to level more frequently so they don't remain exactly the same for many game sessions. (leveling \"sweet spot\" blog)\n* Simplify scaling monster encounters against various character levels.\n* Allow for pseudo-medieval fantasy without \"realism\" hindering characters. (fantasy physics blog entry)\n(The above links point to specific blog entries I've made about those points on the Five Moons RPG blog.)\nThe target funding level of this campaign is to create two initial books:\nFive Moons Corebook: A 128-page hardcover book containing player and GM info, such as classes, races, character creation, skills, combat, magic items, environment, and running a campaign. Also known as \"the Corebook.\"\nFive Moons Player's Guide: A 64-page trimmed-down version of the rules, providing everything a player needs to create a character and play the game.\nStretch goals beyond this will fund the creation of additional books, starting with the Monster Guide, a 32-page book of monsters (see Stretch Goals, below).\nSome of the rewards for this kickstarter are multiple books grouped together into bundles. To keep the different rewards and add-ons from getting confusing as stretch goals add more to each backer level, each backer level grants you a specific bundle, and the bundles are described below. This lets you select what set of rewards you want with one bundle instead of having to manually specify add-ons to your reward levels.\nFor example, the \"Ultimate PDF Backer\" bundle offers you the Corebook PDF, Player's Guide PDF, Monster Guide PDF (the first stretch goal), and PDFs of all other books that are unlocked as stretch goals. Bundles will grow larger and more valuable if we reach the stretch goals we have planned.\nConfused? Check out this handy chart! The columns are the backer level, the rows are the rewards, and the dots mean you get that row's reward if you select that column's backer level. Note: I'm committed to this project and these books. Even if we don't pre-fund a book as a stretch goal, the book will get made, so there's no reason not to pick a reward that includes the later books. I'm a game industry pro, I've been making RPGs for almost 20 years, and self-publishing for more than 10 years.\nHere's a description of all the backer levels, unlocked books, and the bundles.\nAdventure #1 (locked stretch goal): Cavern of the Venomous Pillar, a 32-page adventure.\nAdventure #2 (locked stretch goal): A 32-page adventure.\nAdventure #3 (locked stretch goal): A 32-page adventure.\nBook of Treasures (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook of new magic items.\nCharacter Options (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook of new classes and player character abilities.\nCults and Guilds (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook about factions, religions, and organizations in the World of Five Moons.\nCorebook: The Five Moons RPG Corebook.

This bundle continues to gain additional books as we meet stretch goals.\nLike most fantasy RPGs, you can use Five Moons RPG to run your own campaign world or a published game setting by another company. Some of the design decisions for the game were made with a new setting in mind: the World of Five Moons.\nIn this campaign setting, various civilizations are spread out over many islands in a flat sea. Circling above are five large moons (each representing a powerful god-like entity), and below is a cloud of ether inhabited by alien shapechanging dragons. Magical barriers prevented the civilizations from mixing for decades, but the barriers recently collapsed, allowing a new era of exploration, trade, and conflict between peoples.\nYou can run a campaign in the World of Five Moons as a straight-up adventure-based setting with humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, lost civilizations, and all the fantasy trappings you are used to. Or you can look deeper and delve into who created this world, the reason why its various humanoid races can interbreed, and address the question of what it is to be \"human\" in a world where people can alter their shapes as an act of will or in response to environmental factors. Here is an in-character overview blog post about the setting.\nNow that this project has hit its $25,000 funding goal, we can reveal stretch goals here that'll fund the creation of additional books for the game.\n(Keep in mind: I am committed to making all of the books listed as part of this project, whether or not we hit these stretch goals. Having them as stretch goals just means they're pre-funded, which means I can pay the designers, artists, and editors sooner rather than later.)\nStretch Goal #1: pre-fun the Five Moons Monster Guide: Achieved! Now everyone whose backer reward includes this book in print also gets it in PDF.\nStretch Goal #2 (unlocked at $45,000)\u2014Cavern of the Venomous Pillar: A 32-page introductory adventure for low-level characters.\nWe're in the process of determining the cost of add-ons like dice and t-shirts. In the meantime, you can select the following add-ons by manually increasing your pledge, including multiple copies.\n(Be sure to add the listed extra shipping cost for physical items, which are listed after each item.)\nPlayer's Guide PDF: add $7 for each PDF.\nPlayer's Guide in print: add $20 for each book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping.\nCorebook PDF: Add $14 for each PDF.\nCorebook in print: add $35 for each book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping .\nMonster Guide in print: Add $7 for the PDF, or $12 for print+PDF (buy it in print, you get the PDF for free). Add $5 for USA shipping or $20 total for international shipping. (If your reward includes the Corebook in print or Player's Guide in print, you do not need to add anything for shipping the Monster Guide, as it'll all go in the same shipment.)\nAdventure #1 Cavern of the Venomous Pillar: Add $12 for each print book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping. Add $7 for the PDF. (If your reward includes the Corebook in print, Player's Guide in print, or Monster Guide in print, you do not need to add anything for shipping this adventure, as it'll all go in the same shipment.)\nSolo Portrait: Add $75 for a one-third-page black & white illustration by artist Gerald Lee. In this illustration, Gerald will draw one character from your gaming group (or fantasy versions of you or someone you know) in a standing pose or ready for action. This illustration will appear in the Corebook and Player's Guide, and will include a caption with the name of your character (or the player it represents). You will receive a high-resolution image file of this illustration.\nT-Shirts: Not technically add-ons, but JBM Press will be making Five Moons t-shirts using official art! You'll be able to order them directly from jbmpress.com. \nAs other books are unlocked, they'll also be added to this section (mainly for people whose backer levels don't automatically include those books).\nYou can help spread the word about this project by using these badges and this Facebook cover photo on social media. And here is a one-page flier you can hang up at your local game store (get permission first!).

You will also get more snakes in Snakeman's episode and better VFX!\n\u201cDark Darkness\u201d is an adventure-comedy-fantasy web series featuring cross-genre misfits who meet at a Darkness Convention and must learn to get along in order to survive.\n\"Ronald's Summoning\" poster art by Ryan Hume\nWHAT IS \"DARK DARKNESS\"?\n\u201cDark Darkness\u201d is a new adventure-comedy-fantasy web series featuring dark lords, mythical crossbreeds, a vampire-wizard, a sorceress-ninja queen, Jerry the Snakeman, and Ronald the Dungeon Master who is a dedicated D&D gamer. Our characters are quirky and rough but definitely lovable. Ronald is a bit full of himself, since he is a metaphorical wizard at D&D. While Ronald lacks many social skills, he has more than a few endearing qualities. Mordecai is also full of himself, which creates constant tension between him and Ronald. But, deep underneath all that anger there is a weakness that Mordecai has gone to great lengths to hide, including disguising himself as Jesus in hopes of out running a secret from his past. Ganamazol is riddled with responsibility and only wants to be care free, but finds she is the only one who can conquer all that her life demands as a sorceress ninja queen. Jerry the Snakeman is intelligent and a diplomat, but has trouble making any friends other than those of the snake variety. Put them all together and it's a powder keg of personalities that must learn to subdue the explosive results or be captured and executed for a murder they didn't commit. Our characters join forces, or conspire against each other, in a magical, fantastical realm. We have Seasons One and Two written, but are making a short, four episode Season Zero to introduce our characters individually before they meet each other.\nWhere is the money going?\nThis video gives a summary of what we will be spending the money on. We are fortunate enough with the help of several different companies including, Current Media Productions, Hand Crank Films and Varvid, to get most of our equipment costs sponsored. So 10% of the money will go to Kickstarter and credit cards fees, 15% will go toward reward fulfillment & 60% of the money will go to the film professionals that do the work. The other 15% will go to location, materials and food.\n\nWhat's happening right now!?\nThe first two episodes of Season Zero have been released. We need your help to finish Episode Three and Four.  Funds from the Kickstarter campaign will be used to complete post production on Episode Three, \"Ganamazol's Gambit\" and shoot principle photography on Episode Four, \"Snakeman's Solitude\". Look at how much work we put into episode Three so far!\n\nSeason Zero points our characters to a \"Darkness Convention\". What's a Darkness convention you ask? A Darkness Convention is a convention for people who love the Darkness and this is where our characters meet for the first time and discover there may be more to their invitations than just a friendly invite.\nThe Cast:\n    As you can see from the promo video, \"Ganamazol's Gambit\" stars Elle Sonnet as the title character. Elle has a long list of credits and has trained for screen fighting and creature acting. Elle is also the host and producer of Chicly Geek, a geeky news and Con highlight coverage show in a webisode style of nerderific proportions. So obviously she fits in with Dark Darkness like Velma in the Mystery Van.\nElle Sonnet as Ganamazol, photo by Damian Vines Photography\n   \"Snakeman's Solitude\" stars Jordan Donovan who played \"Jerry the Snakeman\" in the original stage play. Jordan is also an alumni Main Stage player at Ryan Stile's Upfront Theater in Bellingham Washington. Jordan has collaborated with Ben Eisner, the series creator, in many plays and with Wilson Large on many video projects over the years. Jordan has also been a partner with Darkness co-stars DK Reinemer & Morgan Grobe in Fellsbrook Productions. We know you will love him as Snakeman because he is truly one of the more gifted actors we've seen. Jordan currently owns and operates Current Media Productions in Bellingham Wash.\nJordan Donovan in early concept make-up and wardrobe for Snakeman\nDD History: \u201cDark Darkness\u201d is based on the award-winning serial play, \u201cThe Dastardly Death of Dr. Darkness\u201d, written by Ben Eisner, which premiered at Bellingham\u2019s Idiom Theater in 2007. The play was optioned in 2008 and the screenplay adaptation was finished by Wilson Large in 2011. Large met with Zombie Orpheus Entertainment's Ben Dobyns for advice on developing a cloud based, fan supported product in the winter of 2011, and that's when the idea for Season Zero came about. Season Zero commenced filming in the spring of 2012. The process of making the series has almost been as epic as the characters journey within the series. Here is a short documentary made by some WWU students on Wilson's passion and progress for the project which was made in the Winter of 2013:\nOUR PLAN:\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:\nAlthough the story is often funny and campy, the production value and level of talent of all involved is quite high. The funds raised will be used to pay for items such as wardrobe, makeup, production design and visual FX. Furthermore, the involvement of key cast and crew requires they be paid for their time and efforts. Other costs include gear, such as camera rental, lighting, and audio equipment. The cast and crew are a passionate, dedicated lot and have worked tirelessly for little compensation to get this project off the ground for the love of the story and its characters.\nWriter-Director Wilson Large has already invested tens of thousands of dollars in the project and has been working over the last five years toward bringing Dark Darkness to audiences around the world via a dedicated web channel.\nWHAT'S NEXT?\nUpon successful completion of Season Zero, which this Kickstarter campaign will fund- THANKS TO YOU-- \"Dark Darkness\" will be on the fast track to attract potential independent investors, giving birth to Seasons One and Two and beyond. The story that these characters share is exciting, fantastic and very very funny. We hope you become fans and that we get a chance to share the entire epic journey with you.\nSTRETCH GOALS-\nStretch Goal #1- $3,500 When we reach $3,500 I will put on a special screening of Season Zero sometime after the premieres and donate all the profits from this screening to the Whatcom Hospice Foundation. Hospice played an important part in the final days of someone very dear to me and I want to give back!\nStretch Goal #2- $4,000 I set the original goal at $3,000 because I knew I could make Snakeman's episode and finish the VFX on Ganamazol with a lot of volunteers for that much money. But, I am a very strong advocate for creating paying jobs in the film industry in my home town.

We want to shoot these scenes with miniatures instead of CGI. We need your help to do it.\nThe Story\nFor the past 14 years, Michael Laine has been trying to do something most people think is impossible: build an elevator to space.\nMichael\u2019s suffered to make this dream a reality. He\u2019s lost his livelihood, loved ones and friends on his quest to make space easily accessible for humanity. Still, there's hope. He resurrected his company, LiftPort, and raised $110,000 on Kickstarter to fund his ambitious experiment yet: making a robot climb the tallest free-standing human structure in existence.\nFamily, friends and supporters have questioned his efforts, and he\u2019s under incredible pressure to pull it off. Is Michael a visionary or just another dreamer? Fair or not, much of the answer to this question rides on his ability to finish this experiment. His company, credibility and ability to continue his space elevator journey are on the line. It's make or break, and we\u2019re capturing it all on film. The lead up. The experiment. Everything.\nThis film is about humanity: both pushing it forward and the struggle of those who dare to do so. It\u2019s about following dreams with dogged determination amidst countless setbacks. Of course, it\u2019s also about the next great leap for humanity. Michael thinks a space elevator can give us permanent access to the Moon for less than a billion dollars.\nThe Experiment and Why It\u2019s Important \nLiftPort has created a prototype elevator: a self-powered robot that can climb a high-strength tether. By climbing 30,000-feet, the robot will test its effectiveness and ability to endure conditions similar to those a full-blown elevator would face. It\u2019s the most rigorous test LiftPort can do on Earth. What would be next? Satellite experiments.\nAfter that, LiftPort thinks it\u2019ll have the technology and know-how to build an elevator from the Moon to space. More than a dozen countries already operate space programs sophisticated enough to blast off from Earth and dock with such an elevator, and that brings the Moon closer than ever before. Reaching the lunar surface would be as easy as riding down a tether -- no hard landings. What\u2019s more, humanity can use the Moon to organize and launch expeditions deeper into space.\nThen, the holy grail: an elevator from Earth to space. While it isn\u2019t possible with today\u2019s technology, Michael thinks LiftPort will have the experience and skill to build it after they construct the lunar system. When scientists can create a tether strong enough for an Earth-based system, LiftPort will be ready to build it -- or so they hope.\nWhy Are Space Elevators Cool? \nCan cut costs of launching cargo from $10,000 per pound to roughly $100 per pound. \n Green energy via space-based solar panels. \nSpace elevators on Mars, Earth and other planets and moons! \nBuild and launch rockets in orbit for deep space exploration. \nLiftPort's ultimate goal: an elevator climbing from Earth to space. For now, they're focusing on a Moon-based elevator.\nWhy are we making this film?\nThe age of doing big things has waned. The railroads, highways, and electric grids were all built decades ago. It appears the epoch of discovery has passed. No human has ventured to the greatest unknown - outer space - in decades.\nThis is a film about the part of all of us that seeks to push humanity forward despite seemingly insurmountable odds. Not all dreams are meant to die when we wake.\nOur Goal\nWe've been working on this project for nearly a year, and have put $20,000 of our own money and countless hours into this project. 75 percent of the principal photography is finished, but...\nWe want to make the film as polished as a big-budget release, with top-notch, miniature-based special effects, stunning visuals and a sweeping soundtrack. To do that, we need to raise money.\nOur goal is to raise enough funds to shoot the miniature-based special effects sequences for the film. Think Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Alien rather than modern day CGI-based special effects. \nIronically, the first-ever film to use miniature-based special effects was the 1902 Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon) by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s.\nThe technology has come a long way since 1902.\nHere's a video of how the Star Wars films used miniature-based special effects to create a galaxy far far away. The BBC recently wrote about how minature-based special effects is making a comeback in the CGI era. \nOur goal of $37,000 will allow us to show you what the space elevator can, should and one day will be!\nwww.c-themovie.com\nOur model miniatures will be built by Charles Adams, who\u2019s crafted models for major motion pictures and Battlestar Galactica.

The team has worked together on multiple projects including another documentary - Kadi - a film about the dangers poor mothers face in Kenya. \nDirector: Benjamin Ahr Harrison\nBenjamin has directed short subject documentaries on three continents. He won two Webby Awards for The Engadget Show, an internet doc-series where he first produced a segment on the lunar elevator. He is a lifelong space enthusiast, and a first time feature film director.\nExecutive Producer: Mahad Ibrahim\nDr. Mahad Ibrahim is a founder and managing partner of Gobee Group, a social innovation design firm that is on a mission to find solutions to the world\u2019s pressing problems through making technology meaningful. Mahad has specialized in producing engaging books, video, film, and mixed media that explain technology simply to broad audiences including a documentary about maternal health in Kenya. He is also a lifelong space enthusiast.\nProducer: Alexis Santos\nAlexis is a writer who's penned pieces on technology, science and space for Engadget. Based near Florida's Space Coast, he's currently leading content efforts for a technology startup. Alexis has been inside Space Shuttle Atlantis and still can't get over it.\nProducer: Idil Ibrahim\nIdil is an award-winning filmmaker who's worked on films showcased at Sundance, Toronto and other festivals. She's usually behind the camera, but she occasionally appears in front of it.\nShe has lived and worked extensively in East Africa and has produced projects filmed worldwide in places including Serbia, Japan, Turkey, Somalia, Lebanon, Kenya and Uganda, but never the moon! Most recently, she was the female lead in Fishing Without Nets, directed by Cutter Hodierne, which took home the Directing Award for US Dramatic Film at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. She also directed and produced the \"Making Of\" Fishing Without Nets for VICE and considers herself a seafarer.\nEditor: Todd Thoenig\nTodd is a freelance editor based in New York City who's done work for clients including AOL, NBC, New Balance, Tanqueray and many more.\nThe amazing team at Make That Thing is helping us with all things Kickstarter. We want to make sure that all our backers are treated right! The best way to do that is to bring in the experts. Make That Thing has a lot of experience managing some of the most successful Kickstarter projects out there.\nThe Rewards\nThe greatest reward you will receive from backing this Kickstarter project is knowing that you have contributed to a top-quality independent film about building the biggest thing ever.\nWe want people to be able to help in ways large and small.\nDigital rewards\nOfficial Backers at the $10 level will have their name indelibly linked to this film through our website.\nIn response to your feedback, we\u2019ve just introduced a new way to watch the film. For $15 at the Downloader level, you\u2019ll snag an HD download of the film after its theatrical release. We will, of course, also recognize your critical contribution to making this film with your name on our website. The key difference between the Downloader and Movie Watcher ($25) levels is that you won\u2019t receive access to the online, early-access preview of the film that will happen before the theatrical release.\nThe Movie Watcher level ($25) gives you special access to an early online screener of the film only available to Kickstarter backers. Shortly after the film has been released, you'll also get an HD download of the film.\nA select group of 50 backers will be a Shoot The Moon reviewer ($150). You will participate in an online review of an early cut of the film.  Give your notes on the film along with other members of the Shoot The Moon team. Backers at this level will also receive the autographed poster, mission patch, access to the online screener, and an HD download of the film. \nPhysical rewards\nWhat journey to the moon would be complete without your very own commemorative mission patch.  The patch will be done in the style of the NASA Apollo mission patches (see image below).  The design is not done yet, but we promise it will be very cool!  NASA has a nice page showing all the Apollo mission patches. The Mission Patch level ($35) comes with access to the online screening, download and your name enshrined on the Shoot The Moon website. The Mission Patch will only be available from Kickstarter. \nApollo 15 Mission patch (Source: NASA)\nNo film about space is complete without an iconic movie poster. We're designing a limited edition one just for Kickstarter that'll live up to that tradition. The exclusive poster will capture the splendor of a space elevator and the audacity of the race to build one. It'll be a special way to show you supported this project from the start. The Poster level ($50) also comes with the online screening, download and recognition on the website. For $100 at the Autographed Poster level, you get the poster signed by the filmmakers, plus the patch, online screening, download and recognition on the website. \nAs a Reviewer you'll be a special part of the filmmaking process for $150. You'll have online access to early parts of the film and can give us notes on what you think. We'll listen and discuss things with you. It'll be as if you're in the editing room with members of the Shoot The Moon team. You'll also score a limited edition Shoot the Moon movie poster signed by Michael and the filmmakers, plus the mission patch, online screening, download and recognition on the website.\nBecome an ace Lunar Cartographer for $200 with a very cool Shoot The Moon rotating (and solar-powered!) moon globe for your desk! You also get the mission patch, online screening, download, and recognition on the website. \nIt's 4.5 inches of solar-powered, spinnin' moon goodness.\nWalk the Red Carpet with us at a private screening for $500. You and a guest will receive tickets to your choice of screening in New York City or Los Angeles. As much as we wish we had a space elevator today to whisk you through lower earth orbit to these cities, we don't! You'll need to find your own transportation to the screenings. We may be able to connect you with Virgin Galactic if you like to travel in style. \nFor the monetarily unchallenged, we have the Associate and Executive Producer levels. Both tiers receive all the rewards and a credit in the film. The Executive Producer level comes with a top hat, monocle and money bag befitting their status. (Sorry, cash not included.)\nYou'll rock a top hat, monocle and a money bag at the premiere... and at home and public, if you want. We won't judge.\nWhy are we doing a Kickstarter?\nThere's no doubt that the Kickstarter funds are needed to realize our vision. We're independent filmmakers working with more passion than money to make a film worthy of something that could be the next big leap in human evolution. \nOur goal for this Kickstarter is mostly about building a movement. We want to connect with the community of dreamers, doers and all those that believe the sole purpose of science fiction is to foreshadow reality.  \nWe know you are out there and we want this Kickstarter to serve as the base for this journey to Shoot The Moon.  \nWe want to spread the word as far and wide as possible, and we can\u2019t do that without you. After all, we\u2019re making this film for kindred spirits: fans of space, science, technology and real stories where people face insurmountable odds.\nJoin us in this adventure to Earth's closest companion: The Moon.  \nWe believe in Kickstarter and are active participants in the community. \nWe had to open a new account for the film, but the members of our team have collectively backed over 60 projects. We've also successfully Kickstarted two of our own. \nOur profiles are:\nBen: www.kickstarter.com/profile/benjaminahr \nMahad: www.kickstarter.com/profile/1097131721\nAlexis: www.kickstarter.com/profile/geek", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been around the video production block many times, but this is the first feature-length production we've done.

Make a Map. Find Adventure.\n\"Worldspinner is the online worldbuilding tool that gamers and authors have been waiting for.  It will give your world a solid foundation upon which your own imagination has limitless room to expand.\" - Philip Athans, best-selling author of Annihilation and The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction\nWorldspinner makes it easy to create your own richly detailed fantasy world in minutes, including continents, mountain ranges, cultures, kingdoms, cities, and more. Then, delve as deeply as you like into customizing your world. You can create beautiful maps without spending hours with paint tools, and without needing to be an artist. \nWorldspinner is a tool, not a game. It doesn\u2019t replace your creativity, but multiplies it. It is hosted online, so you don\u2019t need to download anything and it is available anywhere. The technology is almost complete; the maps and screenshots you see below are all real examples from the working system. \n\"Worldspinner is going to be huge for everyone who loves creating fantasy worlds.\" - Wolfgang Baur, Publisher, Kobold Press and author of Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding\nYou can quickly create a world by selecting from a list of themes and letting Worldspinner figure out the details, or you can carefully control the world creation steps yourself. \nCreate the physical world. Every world is approximately the size of the Earth, and has its own topography: continents, islands, mountain ranges, oceans, lakes, and rivers. Geophysical processes are used to model climate and biomes, so forests, deserts, tundras, and other biomes end up where they make sense. \nPopulate your world and watch history unfold. You choose which cultures you want in your world: Celtic, Persian, Dwarf, or a dozen others? If you\u2019re particularly fond of one, you can even order physical coins for it (courtesy of our partners: Fantasy Coins LLC and Conquistador Games). Then watch as a history simulator fills in the backstory of your world, charting the rise and fall of nations, and populating the map with cities. \nCities & Points of Interest. Each city is automatically named based on its culture. You'll never again have to say \u201cthat city to the West\u201d if you aren\u2019t feeling inspired at the moment, or lose track of the name of that little market town that\u2019s on the road to the capital. The world also contains points of interest such as \"dragon's lair\" or \u201cKing Aethelwulf\u2019s Tomb.\u201d You can influence which things show up by choosing the themes you want to highlight in your campaign.  \nExplore your world and make it yours. Worldspinner creates an entire world with incredible detail, and no two are the same. Explore your world to make sure it aligns with your vision and imagination. You can move, delete, rename or create new points of interest and cities. It\u2019s your world, after all, and you have the final say.\n\"Not since the work done by Judges Guild and Harn in the late 1970s has there been such a great product for fantasy mapping. The ability to generate adventure on a strategic scale, as well as populate it with cities, encounters and other adventure material is awesome.\" - Bill Webb, Frog God Games\nOnce you have created your world, you can define the areas you want to print as maps. Maps can be anything from world map down to details of a specific kingdom. Just as with Earth, a single world can fill thousands of maps. \nSizes. Members can print 8.5 x 11\u201d maps for free at home, which is handy when you need one for tonight\u2019s session. But maps are definitely one of those things that get better as they get bigger. So we\u2019ll print and ship maps in three larger sizes:\nStyles. Worldspinner automatically creates high-quality maps in a range of styles to suit your tastes.  Here are a few examples:\nPolitical\nAged parchment\nIllustrated - click for 4000 pixel wide version\n                                 \"An elaborate temple compound, and rumors of a dark plot?  Whatever.  Let's go check out the pirate islands instead!\u201d - Druk Khalborg, 3rd level Rogue\nSound like your players? No problem! In addition to great maps Worldspinner gives you information and hooks to make it easy to come up with adventures on the fly.\nCities full of Plots. Plots help address the question of \"what do we do in tomorrow\u2019s game?\" If you keep your laptop open to Worldspinner during the game, you can click on any city and see a list of potential plot hooks such as \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the mayor\" or \u201cQuest for a lost book.\" Selecting a plot will bring up more information on a possible adventure to be had, anywhere from a few sentences to a page or two.  \nVisit Points of Interest. Delve into your world to find the most interesting places for your players to explore. If you click on a point of interest, such as a fishing or trading port, Worldspinner will provide you with information about that port. For example, the port was part of a Norse nation founded 450 years ago, but was created 715 years ago by the Elves before they left this part of the world. This helps to provide a consistent backstory for the game, should you wish to use it. \nTrack progress with the Notebook. Worldspinner provides a logical place to keep notes on what\u2019s happened at a given place, or what you have planned there in the future. If the players come back to a town they set fire to a couple years ago, the locals are going to remember \u2014 and so will you.\nThis is the coolest thing I've heard about all year.\" - Ian Irvine, author, Three Worlds\nMost of the rewards for this project include multiple parts. Here\u2019s a comparison of the reward levels and a little more information on each part.\nOne Year of Worldspinner Membership - As a Worldspinner member, we will store up to five worlds for you, with all your notes, for one year. You can also print as many letter-sized (8.5 x 11, or A4) maps as you like on your own printer.  Memberships are automatically extended each time you buy a new map.  If you want to keep using Worldspinner a year later without buying more maps, that's fine... another year of membership is expected to be $9.95.\nAlpha Access to the Website - As a reward for early backers, some of the rewards grant access to the Worldspinner website before it is opened to the public. During this time, you'll be able to generate your world, order your map(s), and help the Worldspinner team prioritize future features.\nHero of Kickstarter - Great heroes leave their marks on history. When one arises, they can break a century-old stalemate to expand a kingdom\u2019s boundaries. Maps are dotted with cities, rivers, even nations named after these great leaders. As a backer at the $30 level or beyond, you can elevate your favorite RPG character to a Hero of Kickstarter. Such Heroes have a chance of appearing in the worlds that others spin, and leaving their names* across the maps.\nLegendary Heroes* - The mightiest heroes become figures of legend. Our artist will create a bust of your hero based on your description, and we (in collaboration with our partner Conquistador Games) will strike coins in their honor bearing their likeness and name*. Coins are made of metal alloy and come in a range of sizes; backers are given choice of preferred size in order of pledge date. You\u2019ll get a coin purse with 500 coins, 100 of which feature your hero. These coins will also be sold at retail, so they will be used in campaigns all over the real world. One of your hero's coins will be a limited edition plated in 24K gold and framed.  Plus, your hero will appear in many other people\u2019s worlds, on maps and in history.  And they will be mentioned in one of the adventures being written for this Kickstarter by professional fantasy and RPG authors.\nPremium Content - A major goal of this Kickstarter is to fund the creation of new adventures to be sold as Premium Content once Worldspinner goes live.  However, all Kickstarter backers at the $40 level or beyond will get all Premium Content funded by this campaign at no additional charge. The more stretch goals you help us hit, the better this gets!\nSponsor a Theme or Culture* - For themes: you collaborate with the author to set the direction, and we develop it into 10,000+ words of content. For cultures: you pick a historical or (non-copyrighted) fantasy culture, and we\u2019ll implement it \u2014 including the history simulator and name linguistics.  You and everyone else can use these on your maps, and you get major bragging rights!\n* Personalized rewards are subject to our approval; we may reject and refund for any cause at our sole discretion.\n\"Creating a fantasy world is an act of the imagination... Worldspinner has both the capability to present an entire world and the attention to detail to bring it fully alive for others.\" - Jeff Grubb, Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms\nThis Kickstarter isn't about making Worldspinner; that's already on track.  It's about making it better.  We've purposefully set the funding goal low, so we can see how far we get into the stretch goals.  The further we get, the more we can include in the release.\nMost of the stretch goals will unlock new content from an amazing collection of fantasy authors and RPG game designers.  This will be sold as Premium Content after Worldspinner launches, but if you back the project during the Kickstarter (at the $40 and up levels), you'll get it as part of your reward.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u2022 As with any software project, there is a risk of technical delays.

Generally a central common building with multiple uses and limited fortifications for defense and a dozen families or less scattered around based on farming or livestock with a clean water source nearby capable of meeting their supply needs. Getting into villages and towns, now you're talking 30-60 buildings, hundreds of residents, markets and other commerce, etc and the means of support and supply become very important. These can lead to key features such as needing windmills to power pumps to bring up water from wells or mill stones for local grain crops.

If you get into a larger settlement, waste disposal comes into play as does market areas and how the businesses distribute themselves through the community which is also affected by how income levels distribute through town.

The myths, the folklore, the campfire stories, and urban legends. Every terrifying tale of things that go bump in the night\u2026they\u2019re all true. These soul-sucking, flesh-devouring, shadow-haunting fiends want nothing more than to eat you and everyone you love. That\u2019s where we come in. The Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch. Most just call us Demon Hunters. If you haven\u2019t heard of us, we\u2019re doing a good job. In the name of all that is Good, we fight the forces of Evil. And we\u2019re hiring!\nDead Gentlemen Productions, creators of the worldwide cult hit films The Gamers, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising,and The Gamers: Hands of Fate,are once again teaming up with RPG professionals to bring you the new Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors corebook. \nOur world is a dangerous and ridiculous place. If you love the TV shows Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and The A-Team, along with movies like Army of Darkness, Evil Dead 2, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, Ghostbusters, and James Bond, we do too and it's all here. The truth is, as mentioned above, it's ALL real. Like the show, Supernatural, the Demon Hunters setting relies on existing lore, urban legends, etc., because we have found that the truth really is stranger than fiction. \nThe Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch is the worldwide organization that operates behind the screen of the mainstream. We are what stands in the way of you and what wants to eat your heart while you watch, you know, because it's Tuesday.\nBecause the forces of evil in our world are SO evil and powerful and prevalent, we use comedy to help fight it back. This game is a training tool to help you face what's out there. So grab your friends, generate scenarios, tell your collaborative story, and laugh. Laugh hard. It steels your soul for the horror that awaits you.\nBefore The Gamers, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, JourneyQuest, or The Gamers: Hands of Fate, there was Demon Hunters. The group that would become The Dead Gentlemen created 2 feature length digital films between 1999 and 2001. The movies were enjoyed by college audiences, and the world we created has inspired us ever since. In 2008 we partnered with Margaret Weis Productions and released the Demon Hunters Roleplaying Game. In April 2014 we relaunched our Demon Hunters story in the form of a webcomic, rebooting the canon, and now we'd like to create a new Demon Hunters RPG using rules inspired by the Fate Core system. Additionally we have developed an adventure generation system based on our experience and tools as screenwriters and storytellers. That's where this Kickstarter Campaign comes in.\nDemon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors Corebook\nThis is a mockup. Actual book may look different.\nWithin the 248 pages of this deluxe-yet-surprisingly-portable Bible-sized (6\" x 9\") roleplaying game book are all the rules and guidelines you need to create your Demon Hunter, seek out and thwart the minions of evil, and survive long enough to keep the mundanes from hearing about it. From character generation to gameplay, it is designed to get you fully into the story quickly. Our system is building on Fate Accelerated & Steve Kenson's Icons Assembled, so if you love those games you're going to love the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors. \nFor the Gamemaster, an adventure generation system utilizing our storytelling structures that provides tables, charts, clever advice, and a host of useful story elements keeps you from going crazy while spinning grand and epic tales of infernal nastiness. \nIt's a gorgeous black and white tome with a foil-stamped leather-like softcover, and makes a great bludgeoning weapon in case of emergency. \nPLAYTESTING UPDATE: Every backer who pledges for the STARTER KIT or higher reward levels will receive playtesting materials in PDF as they become available. We anticipate the first round shortly after the campaign is over. The playtesting materials will be for both gameplay and adventure creation.\nDemon Hunters Player's Guide PDF\nThis brief primer gets your players acquainted with the world and how to build a basic character. It also includes a number of pregenerated playable characters.\nBurnout! A Dynamic Demon Hunters Example Mission\nThis adventure is designed in the style of mad libs so that you can use the elements in the corebook mission generation system, or the Gamemaster's Apprentice cards (Chill! We\u2019ll tell you about those in just a minute - sheesh). Your team of Demon Hunters have to investigate a strange repeat occurrence, unraveling a dastardly evil plot. Can your hunters save the day? \nAntiTank Sally\nDemon Hunters Temporary Tattoos\nOne of the most notable aspects of this setting is that every Demon Hunter has a Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch tattoo (the one with the 3 swords), and every Order of the Infernal Scepter agent is branded with their insignia. At the TREESLAYER reward level and above, you receive these as temporary tattoos.\nCustom Demon Hunters Dice\nWe are still finalizing what these are going to look like. Below is a photo of our initial prototype, subject to change. Final dice images will be available before the end of the Kickstarter Campaign. You will have the chance to pick up Demon Hunters dice of either or both factions (Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch or Order of the Infernal Scepter) at their respective reward levels, or when the campaign is over through BackerKit (See description below), even if your reward level doesn't include them. \nCONTEST: The Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch and the Order of the Infernal Scepter have been at war with each other for ages. You get to pick a side by backing the CELESTIAL TORCH DICE or INFERNAL SCEPTER DICE reward levels. Whichever faction receives the most support, its backers will win a PDF of the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors. This includes BackerKit orders!\nPrototype Dice. Design still being finalized.\nDemon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice Cards PDF\nDesigned by team member and professional game designer Nathan Rockwood, this print and play deck of 60 double-sided cards, themed for the world and style of The Demon Hunters, can generate plot seeds, characters, or encounters on the fly, or help a GM plan adventures. These cards also come with a special link for DriveThruCards to buy a printed deck at a discounted price.\nDemon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF\nA series of suggestions, examples, and pre-constructed setups--the Demon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF used in conjunction with the tables in the corebook, or the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice cards (or both!) gets your chapter of Demon Hunters out in the field and honing their skills, even when you feel like you've run out of story!\nThe Cipherspace Codex\nThe digital collection of everything we're offering, including but not limited to:\nDemon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors Corebook PDF\nFillable PDF Character Sheet\nFillable PDF Mission Record Sheet\nPDF Demon Hunters Players Guide, including sample pregenerated characters\nA Demon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF\nPDF Sample Adventure, Demon Hunters: Burnout!\nPDF of the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice Print and Play card deck\nPDF of the script from our college movie that started it all, Demon Hunters\nPDF of a script from the followup movie of our college movie that started it all, Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake\nPDF 2008 version of the Demon Hunters Roleplaying Game, published by Margaret Weis Productions\nDigital Demon Hunters Wallpapers for desktop and mobile devices\nBacker Milestone Goal Reached! PDF 6-Page D6XD6 RPG Rules Conversion Guide by Lester Smith\nAnd much more if we reach stretch goals!\nOfficial Brotherhood Pin\nThese pins are exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. This is the official Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch pin. The pin is 2\" long with 2 clutches!\nMockup. Not actual pin.\n         Add-ons will only be available through BackerKit. We want to run a simple campaign and have found that add-ons create a layer of complication. So not to worry, add-ons will be available when you go to check out when the campaign is over. We will add previews of those here when they're available.\nWhen the campaign ends we will be using BackerKit to help fulfill your rewards and send out the surveys. BackerKit is like a last minute shopping cart, like the rack with all the candy bars, magazines, and batteries to tempt you at the checkout stand. So if you missed out on something that was revealed during the campaign, or you wanted to add something your reward level doesn't include, you will get a second chance to purchase it with BackerKit. \nGabriel\nShipping costs are out of control. And in particular, out of OUR control. All of the rewards include shipping anywhere in the USA. It is stunning what it costs to ship outside the USA and the paperwork to do it. If you live outside the USA, please note the extra shipping fee on each reward. Kickstarter automatically adds this when you check out. \nWe know from experience that delivering rewards is often underestimated. That's why we're extending the estimated delivery dates. We are aiming to ship much sooner, but better to be safe than sorry.\nWe are offering the print on demand copies of the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors as a link from DriveThruRPG that allows you to purchase the PoD version of the book as close to our cost as we can provide. The print on demand printer adjusts their prices as they need to, so we are unable to provide an exact cost, but it will be less than if you were not a backer. Many backers would like a physical book before their deluxe edition is being traditionally printed, so we are providing this as an option. The PoD version of the book will be a hardcover book, and will not be the deluxe leather-like edition.\nJust to state it again, the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice cards are available this way as well through DriveThruCards. \nSilent Jim\nWe are working with some of the best roleplaying game professionals in the industry to make this game incredible, and we need to pay them for their hard work. You're also paying for the print production and shipping costs to us for all the physical rewards. If you live in the State of Washington in the USA, your WA sales tax is included in your reward pledge.\nCam Banks, Writer, Lead Game Designer: Cam is an award-winning game designer & developer who left New Zealand in 1996 to marry his sweetheart and forge a new life in the USA.

Currently he is gainfully employed in Minnesota as brand manager at Atlas Games, publisher of Feng Shui, Over the Edge, and Ars Magica.\nThomas Deeny, Layout Designer: Thomas is a graphic designer who specializes in book layout and game design. His layout and design work can be found in Margaret Weis Productions\u2019 Firefly RPG line, Magpie Games\u2019 The Fate Codex, and AEG\u2019s Nightfall and Tempest game lines.

He began spearheading this project after ZOECon 1 in 2012, after he ran a Demon Hunters RPG session, co-designed with Jimmy McMichael. Don plays Silent Jim, in the Demon Hunters series, and appears as Mort Agrippa in The Gamers: Dorkness Rising.\nJason Engle, artist: Jason is a renowned artist and illustrator, creating art for the publishing and entertainment markets for the past 14 years. He created the cover art of the 2008 release of the Demon Hunters Roleplaying Game, published by Margaret Weis Productions.

After working in clothing design and the short lived Ethos trading card game, Ben turned his sights to comics. After a cross promotion involving Ethos and Dead Gentlemen\u2019s Luster character (from The Gamers: Dorkness Rising), Ben was invited to join the Demon Hunters webcomic project, where he masterfully brought to life all the crazy concepts bouncing around Jimmy McMichael\u2019s head. He\u2019s also incredibly humble. Masterfully so.\nJimmy McMichael, Writer: Jimmy writes the Demon Hunters webcomic. It is the culmination of a 15-year scheme that has involved playing Herr Doktor in Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake, creating and running the Dead Gentlemen website for far longer than he had any interest in doing so, co-writing the original Demon Hunters RPG and accompanying Orientation Video for Margaret Weis Productions, and working on RPGs based on the shows Supernatural and Leverage. This Kickstarter is the final phase of his master plan. All of the pieces have fallen into place. Let the Ragnarok Protocol commence!\nJen Page, Artist, Graphic Designer: If there was such thing as real life \u2018Experience Points\u2019, Jen would be racking up the geek stats. She\u2019s ambitiously pursuing her own art contributions to role playing games and has 15+ years of graphic design experiencing having worked for such brands as D&D, Magic: The Gathering, Forgotten Realms and Avalon Hill. She's contributed plenty of work to Dead Gentlemen including the JourneyQuest logo, the Luster artwork on the Dorkness Rising cover as well as designed Dead Gentlemen's own company logo. \nNathan Rockwood, Writer, Game Designer: Believing firmly that 'story trumps rules' has led Nathan down many strange paths over the years--medieval reenacting, teaching both English and Game Design, teaching video games IN English class--and one of those paths crossed with the Dead Gentlemen's when he worked as an author and designer on the first Demon Hunters RPG in 2008. Nathan has written for many other games before and since, including the award-winning Serenity RPG, and has recently begun publishing independently, but he's looking forward to reactivating his Brotherhood Chapter... and may even get a real tattoo this time.\nEmilie Rommel Shimkus, Copyeditor: Emilie is an actor, singer, and writer from the Pacific Northwest. She has spent the last decade wrangling documentation of all stripes for tech companies, start-ups, and non-profits. The rest of the time, she keeps making things up on paper, onstage and on film.

The truth is, not only do we need your financial support as a backer to make this a reality, we need your input to make this even better. At certain Backer levels we're soliciting your involvement in the project where we need your help the most.\nAnd now the Demon Hunters: Brotherhood Orientation Video", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLuckily, much of the writing for this project is finished and will soon hit our editor's desk. But the physical products will need to be produced, assembled and packaged, etc. Much of the art still needs to be created. Production delays can happen, and we'll keep in communication if we hit any snags. We have learned a lot on previous Kickstarter campaigns with our sister-company Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, and we are using that experience to make this far more efficient and faster turnout than ever before. We are also using BackerKit to help on the fulfillment side, and we are going with a proven fulfillment service to get rewards out efficiently.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #78", "update_userinfo": "Hunter's Guide Update & Final Hours on DH Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hunter's Guide\nIt's been a lot of back and forth with the printer trying to meet their specifications.

So we finally decided to put the two together in an epic, feature-length adventure, the likes of which has never been seen on screen before. \nWe're confident The Christmas Dragon will become a holiday favorite you return to year after year - a sword and sorcery Christmas adventure for the whole family. (If Willow got together with Rise of the Guardians and had a child, this would be it.)\nAnd... we guarantee delivery in time for the 2014 holidays. It's the perfect gift for the fantasy fans in your life!\nMedieval Europe - Father Christmas is a fading memory, after Christmas hasn't come for several years.\nA young orphan girl, Ayden, receives a magic crystal from a dying elf, with a warning that the North has lost its magic, and that she alone can save Christmas. Ayden and her orphan friends begin a perilous journey, and must escape dragons, goblins, bandits, ogres and other fantasy creatures as they team up with Airk, the wayward son of Father Christmas, to return a stolen Christmas orb to the North. When Santa's magic cannot overpower the growing Snarl (an evil forest with tentacle branches), Ayden and Airk must deliver Christmas on a sleigh pulled by a young dragon, fulfilling Christmas wishes for children to restore Santa's magic and save Christmas.\nBAILEE JOHNSON - Ayden\nThough young, Bailee is a fantastic actress and has starred is several films, including 127 Hours, Christmas Oranges, 17 Miracles, and you may also recognize her from a brief appearance in Osombie.\nJAKE STORMOEN - Airk\nSince being cast in Mythica, the always charming Jake has worked non-stop and has starred in several upcoming films, including Cyborg X and Kiss the Devil in the Dark.\nMELANIE STONE - Saerwen\nAfter featuring in Survivor and Christmas for a Dollar, Melanie seized the opportunity to play Marek, the lead in Mythica. She's a newcomer, but is destined for stardom... you read it here first!\nRUBY JONES, PARIS WARNER, DAVID DE VILLIERS, JACOB BUSTER\nThese kids will steal the show for you. They're fun, charismatic, and talented, and did a great job bringing love and life to the film.\nADAM JOHNSON - Father Christmas/Bandit Leader\nAdam is an Arrowstorm favorite, but is well-known for his myriad roles in a host of projects, including The Veronica Mars film, Dexter, Vamp U, Dragon Warriors, Mythica, Charly, and many, many more.\nEVE MAURO - Aesa\nEve is a world-renowned model, but Arrowstorm fans will remember her best from Osombie and The Shadow Cabal. She has featured in a bunch of films, including the upcoming Cyborg X.\nSo, as per our usual pattern, the film is already shot, and we are well underway with post-production. Sound, music and visual effects are all working frantically to reach our deadline so that Christmas Dragon can be released in time for the holidays THIS YEAR. But a shorter schedule means our post-production elves have to devote substantial time, and more time means more money... So we need your help to ensure this project happens swiftly.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $50,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $50,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nTRACK OUR PROGRESS ON KICKTRAQ - click on the image below to see projections of how we're doing, how many backers we're getting, etc\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution.

We have tricked-out favorites AND all-new nail wrap designs featuring comics Little Vampires, authors Clive Barker and Seanan McGuire, special guest designer Bobak Ferdowsi of NASA, and we even brought in a molecular biologist to help us create MOAR nails FOR SCIENCE!  \nLast year, we brought you \u201cNAILED IT!\u201d the world\u2019s first nail art designed just for nerds, and you blew us away with your response. We knew traditional make-up companies and geek-culture driven companies were underserving (or flat out ignoring) the Geek Girl customer\u2026 but Holy Crom. We tripled our Kickstarter goals, we rolled out an amazing array of nail art all across the country and overseas, and we did a little dance of joy each time we saw you flaunt your #NailsForNerds on the Internetz.

(Not to overshadow their alter-egos, but they\u2019re designers, executive directors, social medial gurus, accountants, kicka$$ sales reps, and other thoroughly reputable business and creative professionals). And we\u2019re growing. Look out.\nNerd Makeup Ambassadors about to work the booth at SDCC\nEspionage Crew at ECCC 2013 (+ Majestic Beards!)\nEspionage Cosmetics was founded by a professional Make-up Artist and a USMC Staff Sergeant, and is run by an all-pro, all-nerd team that is passionate about all of the geeky stuff in the \u2018verse. Annnd we love pretty stuff too! We are based out of our walk-up clubhouse of fandom and glitter in Tacoma, Washington, but you can follow the trail to find our products and Nerd Makeup Ambassadors at conventions and comic book stores all along the west coast\u2014and spreading!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe did this once already, with our last Nailed it! campaign. We were 3x as successful as we\u2019d hoped. We learned a ton about handling the high demand, fulfilling orders, and working with shipping and international suppliers and backers. We\u2019ve always made it our mission to not be \u201cjust another cosmetics company.\u201d For us, that means we always want to give you, our fabulous backers, a fun, satisfying, more-than-basic retail interaction. \nIt\u2019s been a huge year for us, and we are prepared and pumped to handle anything.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY, PROVEN PRODUCT\nWe knew we had a great product before, and now a lot of other people know it too. Easy to use, easy to maintain, and easy to remove. (And stylish as all hell, no matter your nerd parlance.) Even better, we have now a year\u2019s worth of our own working knowledge of the product and immeasurably valuable customer feedback. We know these nail wraps like the tips of our hands. We know why they fell off in the shower and how to repair a ding or a rip. We can tell you how to make them last longer.\n\nSTREAMLINED SURVEYS & ON-TIME DELIVERY\nYes, we love our community. But we also respect our customer experience, and we want you to get exactly what you want, when you expect to get it. We\u2019ve streamlined our reward levels and survey process, which makes it easier for you to make selections and much easier for us to quickly, accurately fill orders. On-time delivery is always a risk for Kickstarter projects, but we have a leg-up: We already know how to plan for and handle the demand this time around. And, as before, we\u2019ve built time into our delivery schedule for unexpected delays and we have plans to circumvent those issues before they happen. \n\nSHIPPING NOTES\n \u2022 Within the US, shipping is included in your chosen reward level. \n\u2022 Shipping to Canada and Mexico will cost an estimated $10 in addition to your reward level (final total calculated upon survey completion).\n\u2022 Anywhere else will cost an estimated $20 in addition to your reward level (final total calculated upon survey completion).\n\u2022 Shipping for Add-ons (domestic and international) calculated separately after the end of the campaign.\n\u2022 We can NOT ship to: China, Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria. Not our choice. It\u2019s a licensing thing.\n\u2022 International backers are fully responsible for any additional customs fees in your own country. (We looked hard into cheaper shipping options, but unfortunately, just because the wraps are small doesn't mean the price to ship them internationally is as well.)\n\nBACKERKIT = BETTER OPTIONS, BETTER SUPPORT, BETTER BACKER EXPERIENCE\nFor this campaign we\u2019re using BackerKit, a 3rd party Kickstarter fulfillment service. This option gives us better integrated survey options and a better ability to update backer info and addresses. Which means that people who missed the Kickstarter can still have the options to pre-order. We\u2019ll fill the backer packages first, of course, and then fill the pre-order packages before they are available in other retail locations. BackerKit also makes it easier for us to handle all our killer add-ons as they are unlocked. We also have access to good tech support before and during shipping\u2014we can catch and fix problems before you even know there was an issue.\n\nSUSTAINABLE, EXPANDING BUSINESS\nWe know, Kickstarter can be a gamble when you don\u2019t know who\u2019s on the other end. But put your fears to rest, friends, we ain\u2019t going nowhere but up. In less than 2 years, product demand\u2014especially the last NAILED IT! Kickstarter\u2014 has required Espionage to expand 3 times, from a living-room operation to 2800 sq ft office spaces. \n\nThe Last Kickstarter alone allowed us to pull 5 NEW FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES into the company. You guys! The creative team is getting paid! That\u2019s right, we all volunteered last time, and now YOU have let us make Makeup for Nerds a real, grown-up, bill-paying J-O-B. Full-time, dedicated employees mean we can expand the product lines more quickly, without loans or credit cards. \n\nAnd hey\u2014our backers know we\u2019re good for it. You know you\u2019re going to get a high quality product and you know we\u2019ll keep you apprised of the whole process. You also know we\u2019re a soft touch for lots of freebies.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Incoming Nerd Misfit UPDATE!", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Diane Smith", "content": "When is the next subscription box being mailed?", "time": "about 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Tina Good", "content": "Oops - this was supposed to be message not comment, sorry....", "time": "about 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Tina Good", "content": "Okay, sorry, follow up to previous....

And if you want to learn more about the creation of this project, check out our interview with A Sound Effect!\nSTRETCH GOALS ADDED!\n$7,000 - TREBUCHET!\n$5,300 - flanged mace  FUNDED!\n$5,600 - great helm FUNDED!\nAlright, now that we've gotten those boring firearms out of the way, it's time to get to the good stuff: medieval weapons!\nWhen we were making The Firearm Sound Library, two things were made apparent:\n1. Our backers were AWESOME!\n2. A lot of them wanted some older, medieval-type weapon recordings. \nHere is where we deliver!\nLet's talk about the project goal. We want to make a fairly comprehensive yet very affordable (AKA FREE) library that will have recordings of some common medieval-era weapons. That means bows, crossbows, knives, axes, spears, swords, slings, and all the implied impacts that anyone making a film or developing a game could use.\nAs with The Firearm Sound Library, quality and usability are the main goals. This means recording every sound effect at top settings, using top of the line equipment.\nBut affordability is also paramount, which is why (just like last time) we only have one reward set at $1, and after the library is complete it will become free to download! So donate what you can to the cause and help us create another library for the entire sound community to enjoy!\nNow, you all want to know how many sounds we will be recording and what they will be. Naturally, each specific sound listed will have multiple takes recorded to provide a wider range of diversity within each sound effect. Also, any interesting visual result (did the weapon penetrate the object or not, did an arrow break on impact, etc.) of the sound effects will be included to give you exactly the right knowledge you need. So the link below will take you to the list of sound effects that you will receive. We currently plan to record just under 500 unique sound effects...each with multiple takes. Take a look!\nSpreadsheet of Planned Sound Effects\nLet's briefly give a little more detail on some of the items being recorded:\nAvarian Recurve\nA light bow of classical east asian design, it is most suited to loose lighter arrows of around 500-600 grains at very high speeds. A very snappy sound is produced.\nEnglish Longbow\nOur bow has a draw weight of 90 pounds and will be loosing arrows weighing approximately 1000-1300 grains. We will be using arrows tipped with short bodkins, long bodkins, and broadheads.\nScythian Recurve\nAn unusual design, the scythian recurve has produced a very fluid, smooth sound when used. We will be using very light arrows of around 400 grains with this bow.\nCrossbow\nOur crossbow uses a steel prod and has a draw weight of 250 pounds. It is spanned by hand and fires extremely thick, short bolts that weigh about 800 grains. The sound of a steel prod crossbow being shot can only be described as \"wicked.\"\nSling\nWe will be using a simple sling made of leather and cord with pebbles for ammunition.\nSeax\nOur seax is of classic broken back design and has a blade length of about ten inches.\nDagger\nOur dagger is from Djibouti and has a long, slender blade.\nSingle Axe\nA small-headed axe with a single blade and a haft of about two feet.\nDouble Axe\nA longer handle of about three feet with a massive, dual-blade head.\nSpear\nWe will be using two thrusting spears, each of about eight feet in length. \nType X Sword\nA weapon with a Type X blade and cast bronze fittings.\nSabre\nA long-bladed cavalry sabre with a basket hilt.\nFor our armour we are using a fairly close approximation to what would be worn at the times each form of armour was in use. Also, it is important that the armour simulators used for impact recordings are set up as they may have been worn. That is to say, no soldier would ever wear just a piece of plate armour, he would have layers of other material underneath. The materials we are using are wool, linen, leather, mail, and steel plate.\nLeather\nHeavy leather such as horsehide. We will be boiling our leather in water as was often done. Underneath the leather will be a layer of wool cloth.\nMail\nMail could be worn over normal clothes or also over other forms of protection. We will be using riveted steel-linked mail over wool cloth.\nPlate\nThere are many ways to wear plate armour, but we are aiming for simulation of a medium-quality breastplate configuration, so we will have a sheet of steel approximately 2 mm in thickness over 10 layers of linen over wool cloth.\nShield\nWe will be using round wooden shields made of boards that are about a half inch thick, covered in glue and linen and with a metal boss. \nFlesh\nIt is illegal in our state to hack away at live people for recording purposes, so we'll be using some beef from the supermarket, or perhaps a pork shoulder. Also, we'll have wool covering flesh to simulate a clothed body.\nSound Tech\nSound Devices 744T\n192kHz Sample Rate\n24 Bit \nThe items and sounds should be reasonably self-explanatory, but if you're uncertain just what a sound effect is going to be, don't hesitate to ask. We are looking forward to this project getting funded, as we already know just how incredible our backer support can be. Thank you for checking out the project, and please help us make this happen!\nThings We've Learned from the Previous Library\nWith the Firearm Sound Library we jumped headfirst into a big project and did a lot of listening when it came to feedback from our backers. The importance of how we format sound effects became very apparent as a sound you can't find is a sound you can't use. This sound library will have metadata just like the last library, and we will use a short name for each sound file to describe the sound for people who don't have a program that can read Soundminer metadata or BWAV.\nA Different Way to Reward\nJust like with the Firearm Sound LIbrary, this will become completely free for download. As with the previous library, we are trying to \"liberate\" these sounds for those that would love professional quality recordings but can't afford professional quality prices. On that note, our library will have a CC0 license, so you can use, share, download, upload...all completely free, with no royalties or need to give us credit!\nWe are not currently lining up ideas for stretch goals, but if we reach our goal before the deadline, we'll certainly be able to add weapons. So, if you'd like to comment with a suggestion for a weapon we can't currently record but could as a stretch goal, please do so, and if we exceed our goal, we'll be recording the most-asked after weapons. Thanks so much for checking out The Medieval Weapons Sound Effects Library.\nCheers!\nBen, Brian, & Kevin", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRenting and insuring equipment is always a liability and challenge. Safe practice with weapons is absolutely paramount. Just because they seem primitive makes them no less dangerous. In some ways, these older design weapons are even more deadly if used carelessly than firearms are.
