[{"backer": "Todd Malkin", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Chart the rise and fall of the East India Company in this cutting negotiation game about high society at the dawn of the British Empire. Created by Cole Wehrle, the award-winning designer of Root and Pax Pamir, John Company: Second Edition is a deep and thoughtful design from a master builder of historical games. \nJohn Company is the second game in our series on the British Empire. In our previous game (Pax Pamir), players attempted to construct a new future for a land caught between two global rivals. This game presented agents of empire as hapless interlopers, caught up in a struggle that they could scarcely understand.\nIn John Company, players move deep into the bowels of empire and take the roles of ambitious families out to make a name for themselves at the dawn of the British Empire. \nThough often upsetting, this vantage point offers a better understanding of how empires work in practice. Empire-building is one of the most common themes in game design, but the vast majority of games get the fundamentals completely wrong. Empires are certainly not heroic enterprises, but they are also not comic book villains, masterminding global domination. Instead, empires are something far more insidious. They are something that happens in aggregate, composed of a thousand little choices and many individuals with their own interests and ambitions. \nJohn Company thrusts players into those thousand little choices. As matriarchs and patriarchs of ambitious British families in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, players guide their children to positions of respectability. To do this they will often cajole for positions of power and prestige within the British East India Company. \nJohn Company offers players a new understanding of British history in the eighteenth and nineteenth century that reflects contemporary scholarship on the subject and extensive research into primary documents. John Company attempts to put the critical events of that time in their proper context and show how the imperial experience transformed the domestic culture of Britain. The East India Company lurked behind every building of a textile mill and every bit of wealth in a Jane Austen novel. \nJohn Company is an uncompromising portrait of the people who made the Company and the British Empire what it was. It is as frank as it is cutting in its satire.  Accordingly, the game wrestles with many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players. Please make sure everyone in your group consents to this exploration before playing. \nIf you'd like to read more about the game's arguments, click here. \nIn John Company, players collectively guide the fate of the Company by securing positions of power and using them to benefit their own interests. As they climb through the Company's ranks, players will find themselves directing critical trade missions, bribing members of Parliament for favors, and jockeying for advantageous marriages during the London Season. If you've ever wanted to play a board game with the narrative scope and skullduggery of a Victorian novel, John Company is your game. \nJohn Company offers its players an  unparalleled economic sandbox that covers the history of the Company from 1710 to 1857 using four scenarios. Once players get comfortable with the games first scenario, they can explore a wide range of challenges, including the end of the Company's monopoly and the growth of enterprising private firms. \nThough massive in scope, John Company relies on a fundamentally simple core that teaches players how to play while they play. Turns begin with players assigning their children to various career paths and then continues through the step-by-step operation of the Company. Players are always able to negotiate so there's almost no downtime between actions.\nNote: these rules are still in development and are not final.\nJohn Company: Second Edition is a dramatic reimagining of the first edition that took over two years of extensive design and production work. \nThe first edition of John Company had a very limited production budget. For this new edition, we have overhauled every element of the physical production and have done our best to make sure the design has never been more approachable for new players.\nWe have rebuilt every graphical element in the game to make John Company more immersive and playable. The rulebook has been dramatically expanded, with plenty of examples and a more conversational style. \n\n\nJust about everything players own can be exchanged at any time. The old promise system has been redesigned to provide players with the ability to give away future favors for crucial leverage in the heat of a negotiation. Players have never had so many ways to make a deal. \nThe old event tables have been replaced with a new event system that is much easier to resolve. Use 20 beautiful punchboard tiles featuring hand-painted Ganjifa-style art by Amita Pai, to bring the subcontinent to life. Though few in number, these tiles create a dizzying array of possible situations, from the reemergence of Mughal authority, the rise of new kingdoms, or the aggressive rejection of the Company's efforts. \nFor this new edition, we have dramatically improved the game's scenarios, especially those dealing with the deregulation of the Company. John Company also features a revolutionary new automata from well-regarded solo designer Ricky Royal. Players will find the negotiations no less fierce in the single and two player modes against a bot that is able to wheel and deal like a human player.\nWe're happy to be working with Backerkit again as our pledge manager to help with your pledge and process accurate shipping fees.  Pledge managers are third-party services that let you manage your order leading up to fulfillment. After the campaign, everyone will be emailed by Backerkit so that we can collect your delivery address, process payment for shipping and add-ons, and finalize your pledge!\n\nAnyone who wishes to supplement their pledge with any of the add-ons may add that dollar amount to their pledge now or adjust their order in Backerkit after the campaign. \nShipping will be charged post-campaign in Backerkit.\nCustoms Friendly: Wehrlegig covers the duty payments and customs fees for backers who receive our games in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia. All other countries or regions may be subject to additional customs fees upon delivery. For our UK backers,  we promise there will not be additional duty payments, so you can consider this project UK-friendly too.\n\nFor folks only pledging for smaller items like coins (Add-ons Only pledge level), shipping will be a fraction of the cost. Depending on your address, most small order shipping will cost less than 50% of the listed rate. \nWe are are continuing our commitment to creating our games that are free and widely accessible anyone that is curious by making our game files available under Creative Commons license BY\u2013NC\u2013SA 4.0. That means we will continue offering a full, free print-and-play kit for Pax Pamir, and later this campaign, John Company! Anyone can use, remix, and share the game, so long as they do not use it for commercial purposes. \nAt Wehrlegig Games our objective is simple: publish beautiful games with historical themes that treat their subjects and their players seriously. These are games that make arguments and encourage discussion. They don't shy away from difficult subjects.\nWe know the audience for such games is limited. In order for us to produce games up to our standards, we rely on a direct sales model. Our games are not designed for traditional distribution or retail channels. The vast majority of all copies produced will be sent to Kickstarter backers or to people who purchase games through our store.  This means we can spend many more resources on the game's physical production without having to worry about retail viability.\nCole Wehrle is a published writer and game designer who currently works at Leder Games in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  He is perhaps best known for designing Root, Pax Pamir, and Oath. Before working in the board game industry, Cole earned his PhD at the University of Texas where he worked on nineteenth century novels and the British Empire. \n\nDrew Wehrle is a game developer and co-founder of Wehrlegig Games. He handles all of the business and operational elements of Wehrlegig. As Cole's younger brother, Drew has helped develop and playtest every game he has designed. Drew previously managed school programs at Chicago Botanic Garden, and as of early 2020, he now manages Wehrlegig Games full-time.\n\nRichard Wilkins is a British board game designer (Renegade, from VPG) and collaborator often engaged in designing and developing solo rules (Pax Pamir, Guilds of London, Tales of the Northlands: The Sagas of Noggin the Nog, On the Origin of Species).  You may better know him as Ricky Royal from the Box of Delights YouTube channel, where Ricky has been demonstrating how board games play for the past 9 years, predominantly to a growing community of solo gamers. As well as a hobbyist in the board game industry, Ricky is a graduate of Computer Science and a software professional of 30 years, with a love for the countryside, his family, and dog (though not necessarily in that order). \n\nAmita Pai is a commercial artist based out of Mumbai, India.  This is Amita's first board game project, bringing her hand painted Ganjifa art pieces to John Company and offering guidance to the visual design elements for the map of India  She loves painting, sculpting, and dancing. More of her art can be seen on her Instagram.\n\nAmarjeet Bitke is a 3D Environment Artist from Pune, India. Amarjeet designed the resin game components to make them both functional and beautiful. John Company is Amarjeet's first board game as he is typically working on digital projects and modeling for video games! Check out his 3D modeling here.\n\nJanek Lipi\u0144ski is an illustrator and designer based in Warsaw.  Janek designed the family portrait illustrations for John Company, his first board game collaboration. While working as front-end developer, Janek's work extends from graphic design to watercolor  painting. You can see more of his art on display here.\n\nThank you to our collaborators: Travis D. Hill (Press Pot Games) for the rulebook support, David Carter for the extra customer service, and all the Backers that help bring our projects to life!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign seeks to raise funds for the first printing of John Company: Second Edition as well as a third printing of Pax Pamir. At this point, all of the files for Pax Pamir are complete and we hope to begin production shortly after the campaign is over. John Company's files are not yet finished and will be staggered in the production timeline.\n\nDrew will continue to manage Wehrlegig's projects full-time. We have built a wide network partnerships with folks around the gaming industry, and we have contingencies in place for every element of the project's production and fulfillment. \n\nWe have built plenty of padding into our schedules to absorb delays, and we will continue to monitor and adapt our logistics planning to accommodate changes with international freight procedures.

It's frustrating to skim the answers spread all over the rules forum to questions that arise when ready to play. This is particular to the John and Co scenario, which as Cole mentioned was intended as an extension of the game, that ended up being added to the main game, however, underdeveloped especially rules wise. The second ed. is not including the John Co scenario, since it has not been considered according to Cole.

You will pay for shipping & handling, plus VAT, GST, and sales tax in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nThe following rates are for shipping & handling ONLY. VAT, GST, and sales taxes will be calculated and assessed in the pledge manager. You will be able to see the final total of your order in the Pledge Manager after the campaign ends and the Pledge Manager opens and if you feel the total cost of your order is unsatisfactory you can request a 100% refund of your Kickstarter pledge within at any time prior to fulfillment.\nAfter the campaign, we will do some record keeping and then send each backer a survey, using the CrowdOx pledge manager system. Yours will be sent to the email address associated with your Kickstarter account. This will give you the chance to give us your shipping address, pay for shipping, and allow you to add any add-ons you want. If you end up changing addresses before we ship your rewards, you can click the graphic above to link to update your survey.\nEstimating additional shipping for multiple copies:\nIt will be cheaper to order two or more copies of The Hero Pledge Reward as one order than as multiple orders but we cannot predetermine how much cheaper.\nOur pledge manager will allow you to add multiple copies of a Reward to your order and shipping for the whole package will be calculated at checkout. You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc.\nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\nUnited States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union+ (Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address. We will cancel and refund orders from countries we do not ship prior to fulfillment if other arrangements have not been made.\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com\nAre you a retailer that wants to jump on the Meeples and Monsters train?

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBackers who pledge at least $5 during the campaign will have access to the Pledge Manager and will be able to make a Late Pledge with the same terms, conditions & pricing as Kickstarter Rewards.\n\nAll images used in this Kickstarter are subject to change and may represent unfinished or non-final art or design. All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays\n* Shipping delays\n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is March 2022, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 10% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. AEG is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email kickstarter@alderac.com for further information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Hero Pledge: Game and Upgrades!", "descp": "A copy of Meeples & Monsters and all upgrades.\nINCLUDES:\nMeeples & Monsters Game\nMeeples upgraded to printed\n4 Towers Expansion\nSolo game rules and components", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["3,733 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Quick Update on Meeples an Monsters", "update_content": "Some folks asked for an update, so here you go! \nWe're in that slow-middle part where not much tends to happen other than surprise delays.

Our hearts, minds and even weekends were poured into this new product, and here\u2019s a small lookbook to give you an idea of how we went about designing the Orbitkey ID Card Holder System.\n\nAbout Orbitkey\nWe believe in clever organisation for better living.\nSince 2013, we've launched 5 crowdfunding campaigns, with over 42,530 backers, raising over US$2.92 million.\nWe love Kickstarter. Not only did you help bring Orbitkey to life, you also allow us to focus on making great products and keep doing the things we love \u2013 without the influence of outside investors.\nWe are a team of 22 passionate individuals based in Melbourne, Australia \u2013 driven by design, innovation and clever organisation. This new project is the result of continuous feedback and hard work over the past year. We hope to have you join us on our journey towards better living.\nHere at Orbitkey, we\u2019ve been taking scalable steps to permanently reduce our carbon emissions, and in April 2020, we became a Climate Neutral Certified Brand!\nClimate Neutral is an independent non-profit organisation that provides tools for companies to:\n Measure their carbon footprint through economic modeling;\n Reduce their emissions by developing and implementing carbon reduction plans;\n Offset their emissions if they cannot be immediately reduced by purchasing carbon credits; and\nUse the label to empower customers to choose brands that choose to pay for their carbon emissions.\nCarbon credits are in turn invested into reducing and capturing carbon dioxide, and can support a range of projects such as forest conservation and renewable energy.\nThis year, we will ensure that at least 50% of our new products will be made from LWG certified leather and recycled fabric materials. Likewise, 80% of our packaging will be produced from recyclable materials. We will also reduce our air freight shipments company-wide by 40%, and at our headquarters in Melbourne, we will reduce our paper and toner emissions by 60%. But we know that this is only the beginning, and we will continue to improve our processes and further reduce our emissions every year.\nWe were named one of ProductHype's Best Kickstarter Projects of 2021.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a pretty good track record with our previous 5 campaigns \u2013 with most rewards being shipped on time or with a 1-month delay at most. Our previous campaigns have also given us valuable experience in all aspects of bringing a product to life and running a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nIt has better prepared us in the challenges associated with tooling, production, logistics, communication, and delivering a high-quality product.\n\nHowever, there are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life.\n\nIn the case of encountering unavoidable obstacles, we have always handled them swiftly and efficiently, and have always conducted things in the best interest of our backers and Orbitkey family. We always keep our backers updated with complete transparency.\n\nWe will do our very best to ensure we deliver what we promise and to go the extra mile whenever possible. Thanks for believing in us!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe've made a commitment that everything we do and build needs to add value and help our community live better lives. If they don\u2019t, we should rethink why we\u2019re doing it, and work out a better approach. Our products are designed with the best materials and built to last \u2013 tested thoroughly to withstand heavy use. We love that we're still seeing plenty of backers from our first Kickstarter campaign in 2013 still using the rewards they received then.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur products are designed to last. However, should you encounter any problems with any of the parts, you can let us know and we'll be able to send you a specific replacement part.\nSustainable materials\nThe leather that will be used in the production of the ID Card holder System is LWG-certified gold-rated leather. It means that the leather is produced in a sustainable way with a focus on minimising environmental impact. The lanyard is also made of 100% recycled woven polyester thread.\n\nWe pride ourselves in using no plastic in our packaging and ensuring that any paper material can be recycled.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAll our factories have been carefully selected and are partners we've been working with for several years. We have team members on the ground who visit the factories on a regular basis to ensure that quality, ethical and environmental standards are upheld.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe plan to optimise our shipping routes by utilising sea freight to transport bulk quantities to local warehouses to reduce the carbon footprint of our delivery plan.\nSomething else\nLike Kickstarter, we've already committed to offset our carbon footprint in 2020. We are proud to be a Climate Neutral Certified brand.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 36 or more", "title": "Orbitkey ID Card Holder", "descp": "*LIMITED EARLY BIRD OFFER*\nSave $9 off estimated RRP US$45\n1 x ID Card Holder in the colour of your choice (you can choose when the campaign ends).\nINCLUDES:\nOrbitkey ID Card Holder", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["406 backers", "Limited (15 left of 421)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 42 or more", "title": "Orbitkey ID Card Holder with Lanyard", "descp": "*LIMITED EARLY BIRD OFFER*\nSave $13 off estimated RRP US$55\n1 x ID Card Holder with Lanyard in the colour of your choice (you can choose when the campaign ends).\nINCLUDES:\nOrbitkey ID Card Holder with Lanyard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["855 backers", "Limited (5 left of 860)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 46 or more", "title": "Orbitkey ID Card Holder Pro", "descp": "*LIMITED EARLY BIRD OFFER*\nSave $14 off estimated RRP US$60\n1 x ID Card Holder Pro in the colour of your choice (you can choose when the campaign ends).\nINCLUDES:\nOrbitkey ID Card Holder Pro", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["579 backers", "Limited (5 left of 584)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 52 or more", "title": "Orbitkey ID Card Holder Pro with Lanyard", "descp": "*LIMITED EARLY BIRD OFFER*\nSave $18 off estimated RRP US$70\n1 x ID Card Holder Pro with Lanyard in the colour of your choice (you can choose when the campaign ends).\nINCLUDES:\nOrbitkey ID Card Holder Pro with Lanyard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,378 backers", "Limited (3 left of 3381)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 85 or more", "title": "Orbitkey ID Card Holder Duo w/ Lanyards", "descp": "*LIMITED EARLY BIRD OFFER*\nSave $40 off estimated RRP US$125\n1 x ID Card Holder with Lanyard and 1 x ID Card Holder Pro with Lanyard in the colours of your choice (you can choose when the campaign ends).\nINCLUDES:\nOrbitkey ID Card Holder Pro with Lanyard\nOrbitkey ID Card Holder with Lanyard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,027 backers", "Limited (5 left of 1032)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 175 or more", "title": "Orbitkey ID Card Holder with Lanyard x5", "descp": "Save $100 off estimated RRP US$275\n5 x ID Card Holder with Lanyard in the colours of your choice (you can choose when the campaign ends).\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Orbitkey ID Card Holder with Lanyard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 225 or more", "title": "Orbitkey ID Card Holder Pro w/Lanyard x5", "descp": "Save $125 off estimated RRP US$350\n5 x ID Card Holder Pro with Lanyard in the colours of your choice (you can choose when the campaign ends).\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Orbitkey ID Card Holder Pro with Lanyard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["90 backers", "Add-ons"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Competition time + New add-on available!", "update_content": "Hey folks,\nIt's a light update from us this week.

So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). \nAt the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   \nPlease note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet.  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  \nOne guarantee we will give is that if we do release the KS exclusive version anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done. The gameplay for this game is 95% complete. The art and graphics are well underway. We are confident that we will hit our release goals with no problems (shipping delays or Acts of God notwithstanding). In addition, our intention is to not release this game to standard retail until all U.S backers orders have been shipped. Our goal is to have it in our backers hands 2-4 weeks before someone can buy it on Amazon.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAll of our games are made with longevity in mind. We use high-quality components for all of our pieces. Short of losing pieces (which we typically replace for only shipping costs), our games should last you for decades to come.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll of our fulfillment and logistics are arranged to limit the number of miles/stops each game travels. It's not only better for the world, but it also makes business sense.

Keep them out of sight but easily accessible whenever you need a quick refresher or to jot down notes.\n\nYour Work Essentials Organised\nWith a dedicated space for stationery and small accessories in the toolbar, you\u2019ll always have quick access to your work essentials, whenever you need them.\n\nCables Kept in Place\nThe magnetic cable holder can be moved anywhere along the toolbar to keep your cable in place and always within reach. No more tangles or cables falling off the table!\n\n Stylish and Functional Work Surface\nThe soft and elegant vegan leather will transform any desk into a warm and comfortable workspace, providing a smooth surface to write on and to use your mouse with ease \u2013 suitable for both right and left-handed users.\nFeel professional, confident, and in control with a simple addition that can make a huge difference.\n\nMade to Last \nThe Orbitkey Desk Mat protects your desk from scratches, stains and spills. The premium vegan leather is exceptionally durable, water-repellent and can be easily wiped clean.\nMade to last and ready to take on whatever the day brings, helping you do your best work.\nThe Orbitkey Desk Mat will help you keep your desk tidy throughout the day \u2013 so you\u2019re always organised and ready for the next. \n\n\nEach Desk Mat comes with 1 magnetic cable holder. Add additional cable holders to manage multiple cables.\nDesign Process\nWe always try to be conscious of what we\u2019re designing \u2013 focusing less on the quantity, and more on the quality of a small, but considered selection of products. Our hearts, minds and even weekends were poured into this new product, and here\u2019s a small lookbook to give you an idea of how we went about designing the Orbitkey Desk Mat.\n About Orbitkey \nWe believe in clever organisation for better living.\nSince 2013, we've launched 4 crowdfunding campaigns, with over 33,000 backers, raising over USD 2 million.\nWe love Kickstarter. Not only did you help bring Orbitkey to life, you also allow us to focus on making great products and keep doing the things we love \u2013 without the influence of outside investors.\nWe are a team of 21 passionate individuals based in Melbourne, Australia \u2013 driven by design, innovation and clever organisation. This new project is the result of continuous feedback and hard work over the past few months. We hope to have you join us on our journey towards better living.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a pretty good track record with our previous 4 campaigns \u2013 with most rewards being shipped on time or with a 1-month delay at most. Our previous campaigns have also given us valuable experience in all aspects of bringing a product to life and running a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nIt has better prepared us in the challenges associated with tooling, production, logistics, communication, and delivering a high-quality product.\n\nHowever, there are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life.\n\nIn the case of encountering unavoidable obstacles, we have always handled them swiftly and efficiently, and have always conducted things in the best interest of our backers and Orbitkey family. We always keep our backers updated with complete transparency.\n\nWe will do our very best to ensure we deliver what we promise and to go the extra mile whenever possible. Thanks for believing in us!\n\n\nCOVID-19\n\nWe're sure that the COVID-19 situation is probably on everyone's mind right now, so we'd like to take this opportunity to update you on how this might affect production.\n\nOur manufacturing partners are back at 100% capacity and have been working closely with us to ensure that everything will progress smoothly, whilst maintaining the highest standard of safety and hygiene.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe've made a commitment that everything we do and build needs to add value and help our community live better lives.

Our products are designed with the best materials and built to last \u2013 tested thoroughly to withstand heavy use. We love that we're still seeing plenty of backers from our first Kickstarter campaign in 2013 still using the rewards they received then.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur products are designed to last. However, should you encounter any problems with any of the parts, you can let us know and we'll be able to send you a specific replacement part.\nSustainable materials\nThe base of the Desk Mat is made of 100% recycled PET felt. On top of that, all our packaging material is plastic-free and 100% recyclable.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAll our factories have been carefully selected and are partners we've been working with for several years. We have team members on the ground who visit the factories on a regular basis to ensure quality, ethical and environmental standards are upheld.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe plan to optimise our shipping routes by utilising sea freight to transport bulk quantities to local warehouses to reduce the carbon footprint of our delivery plan.\nSomething else\nLike Kickstarter, we've already committed to offset our carbon footprint in 2020.

We hope you may come along for the ride...!\nHere at Grail Games, we love what we do, we love great games and we love our fans. To thank our followers for helping us to make some fun board games over the last six years, we have lowered the pledge price for this game as low as it can go. We have subsidised shipping costs as much as we can. We don't want you to miss out on pledging for Whale Riders, because we aren't sure how many copies will make it to retail.\nWhale Riders is a new design with a classic feel from famed game designer Reiner Knizia. In 45 minutes of play, 2-6 players will race to the end of the Ice Coast and back, buying and selling as many resources as possible, to make the money needed to acquire the richest prizes. Will you skip opportunities to gain the greatest treasures, or will you make your money slowly along the way?\nEach player has two actions per turn, but a lot they will want to accomplish. Sail? Buy? Sell? Draw more order cards? All the while, your opponents might be sailing past and beating you to what's on offer down the coast! Once all the precious pearls have been purchased, the game will end and the player with the most pearls will win!\nEach copy of Whale Riders will be carefully planned, prepared and packed. Here is a list of all you will receive. Oh! And please see the Stretch Goals section below for more info on how these components may be further improved and expanded during our campaign...\nThere are a few different pledge levels for our campaign. In summary, this is what you will receive at each level...\nYou will be able to choose to receive your game in English/French or Spanish in the Pledge Manager.\nRetailers: Before selecting the retailer-only pledge level, please contact us through this link: https://support.murano-alliance.com/retailers to discuss your particular enquiry. Proof of eligibility will be collected via a retailer survey upon completion of the campaign and will need to be submitted before receiving and finalising your pledge manager. Retailers will be able to order a number of copies of each title offered during this campaign.\nWhale Riders has simple and short rules, but offers a lot of interaction and interesting decisions for players. It has a classic feel - similar to many of (famed game designer) Knizia\u2019s great designs - but also feels new, sleek and (of course) fun!\n\u2192 Watch Stella and Tarrant form Meeple University teach you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nAs well as the board game Whale Riders, we are offering the small card game Whale Riders: The Card Game to backers during this campaign for a low price! Unlike its big sister, The Card Game is not planned to be sold at retail. Copies will only be made available through this (and perhaps a future KS) campaign, and directly through our online store or at a convention. We hope you may consider backing for both games at our ALL ABOARD pledge level.\nWhale Riders: The Card Game, 2-4 players will sail alongside each other to buy goods along the Ice Coast. What is on offer at the ports will vary in quantity. Sometimes you will be working together with others only to become competitors again when a better proposition comes along. This is a re-implementation of Reiner Knizia's previously released card game, Trendy.\nJust like the Whale Riders board game, the card game is also designed by Reiner Knizia and illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, but it is a much smaller game that plays totally different to the board game\u2026\n\u2192 Watch David from Grail Games (and friends) show you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nWith your help, we can make Whale Riders even better! Should we over-fund, we will use the extra funds to improve the game in the following ways (stay tuned to the updates for more info on these upgrades and expansions)...\n\nAnd please support Whale Riders on social media! With your help we can also unlock the following stretch goals to the benefit of both Whale Riders games...!\nWhat are people saying about Whale Riders?\n\u2192 Eric W Martin from BoardGameGeek!\n\u2192 Tantrum House!\n\u2192 Before you Play!\n \u2192 La preview du Labo des Jeux en fran\u00e7ais (a review in French):\n\u2192 Descubre la rese\u00f1a de Lorena y Napier de Meepletopia (A review in Spanish):\n\u2192 Brettspielhero Whale Riders Preview + Gewinnspiel (A review in German):\nAll backers who pledge $19AUD or more, can add-on as many copies of Whale Riders to their pledge as they would like. Simply hit the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button and add $19AUD for each extra copy of Whale Riders you need. No extra shipping costs need to be added for additional copies at this time - we will charge you extra shipping costs in our pledge manager once we know the total weight of your shipment. (As an estimate, an extra copy sent to the US will cost $2-5AUD per copy.)\nAdditional copies of Whale Riders: The Card Game: If you would like additional copies, and you have pledged for at least $13AUD, please add $9AUD to your pledge for each additional copy you need. No extra shipping costs need to be added for additional copies at this time - we will charge you extra shipping costs in our pledge manager once we know the total weight of your shipment. \nSome other Grail Games titles may be made available during our post-campaign pledge manager. Stay tuned for more info as that time approaches.\nMore about Yellow & Yangtze: Yellow & Yangtze: (also from Grail Games, Reiner Knizia and Vincent Dutrait), is the sister game to the classic Tigris & Euphrates. It is for 2-4 players and takes about 90 minutes to play. In it, you will replay an eventful period in world history and strive to lead your dynasty to dominance.\nPlease note: Backers will select the English or French edition in our pledge manager, bad sadly, Spanish is not available during this campaign.\nFor more info on the game, including images and video reviews, please visit the game on our website or on BoardGameGeek.\nKickstarter will automatically add the following shipping costs to your pledge when you select it. (Please note that the costs below are in AUD, but will be converted to your \"home\" currency when your account is charged should we fund.)\nIf you wish to add a second (or third) game to a single-game pledge, we may need to charge you a few extra dollars to cover your shipment's increased weight. This will occur in our post-campaign pledge manager.\nIf you add-on extra Grail Games titles with our post-campaign pledge manager, the shipping cost for those games will be calculated at that time.\nWe have done our best to keep these shipping costs as low as possible. And, to reduce taxes and fees, games will ship to backers from within the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia*!\n*Australian and NZ backers have the option of paying extra to receive their copies of the game earlier - posted directly from China (and not from within Australia 1-2 months later). If you would like to take this offer, back at the regular shipping level now, and we will give you the option to pay extra in our pledge manager after the campaign. (Note that the 6-pack is not available for express shipping as the package will be overweight).\nBy supporting Whale Riders on Kickstarter, not only are you helping us to produce the game(s) in the first place, but if you back now, you will also receive them:\nat a cheaper than MSRP price,\nwith Whale Riders: The Card Game (if you wish), also heavily discounted and only available through Kickstarter and directly through Grail Games,\nearlier than anyone else will get the games, and,\nwe will be providing copies of some other titles to backers of this campaign at a reduced price as a thank you to you (Yellow & Yangtze and others via our post-campaign pledge manager)!\nBut that's not all\u2026\nThe Whale Riders titles were designed by well-known designer Reiner Knizia (of Lost Cities, Pickomino, Medici, Yellow & Yangtze fame, and much much more). He knows how to make a small game fire on all cylinders!\nThe Whale Riders titles are easy to learn games that are approachable and can be played by almost anyone.\nThe production files are ready to be uploaded to the printer right after the campaign is successfully funded. We will do all we can to deliver on time!\nThe games are full of beautiful illustrations by fan-favourite illustrator Vincent Dutrait.\nCountless hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience.\nWe are committed to fulfilling all Kickstarter pledges before they are available at retail. And on that point: We appreciate the support of game stores and see them as an essential part of our hobby. However, in today's crowded marketplace, our titles are becoming harder and harder to find by customers. Whale Riders will appear in stores, but at this stage, we don't believe it will be widely available. Your best bet is to back now (and at our super-low price - MSRP will be $30USD+) should you want to be sure of owning the game.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nDesigner - Reiner Knizia\nDr. Reiner Knizia is one of the world\u2019s most successful and prolific game designers. More than 600 of his games and books have been published worldwide in over 50 languages and have won him numerous international awards.\n\nArtist - Vincent Dutrait\nVincent Dutrait is currently one of the most highly regarded illustrators of board and card games in the world.

Since our first Kickstarter campaign was received EARLY by backers in January 2015, we have continued to send high quality products to backers on time! We have our systems well in place and use a top manufacturer to produce and ship quality games around the world. Grail Games is beginning to forge a track record of delivering fun games with quality components\u2026 on time!\nHowever, unforeseen circumstances can hold up a project. This can happen at the point of manufacture or during shipment. Grail Games has given a time-frame for delivery of the Whale Riders games that we believe is certainly achievable. If anything does affect the project, backers will be kept in the loop via regular backer updates at every step of the production and shipment process.\nNote that the currency conversions in the pledge level blurbs are a guide only. Currency values may fluctuate during the campaign.\nAlso note: Backers will receive the game at the best possible price and will receive their games before retail stores, but Grail Games cannot guarantee that retailers will not sell the Whale Riders games at a cheaper price than Kickstarter supporters will \u201cpay,\u201d especially months or years in the future.\nFinally, Grail Games will happily send replacement parts of any game damaged in shipment or due to manufacturing mishaps to backers, etc., but if backers fail to inform Grail Games of a change in shipping address or similar, backers may be asked to pay extra costs if they require a replacement copy of the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "WAIT AND SEA", "descp": "Pledge a minimum amount to follow along.\nYou will receive all campaign updates and the chance to upgrade your pledge using our pledge manager after the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["191 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 13 or more", "title": "WHALE RIDERS: THE CARD GAME", "descp": "Receive one (1) copy of Whale Riders: The Card Game!\nThis game will not be available in stores.\n\nNOTE: $13AUD is approximately $9USD\nINCLUDES:\nWhale Riders: The Card Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 28 or more", "title": "WHALE RIDERS", "descp": "Receive one (1) copy of Whale Riders, including all unlocked stretch goals!\n\nNOTE: $28AUD is approximately $19USD\nINCLUDES:\nWhale Riders", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["253 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 37 or more", "title": "ALL ABOARD", "descp": "Receive one (1) copy of Whale Riders AND one (1) copy of the KS exclusive Whale Riders: The Card Game (including all unlocked stretch goals)!\n\nNOTE: $37AUD is approximately $25.50USD\nINCLUDES:\nWhale Riders\nWhale Riders: The Card Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,008 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 90 or more", "title": "OCEANS & RIVERS", "descp": "Receive one (1) copy of Whale Riders AND one (1) copy of the KS exclusive Whale Riders: The Card Game (including all unlocked stretch goals) AND one (1) copy of Yellow & Yangtze!\n\nNOTE: $90AUD is approximately $62USD\nINCLUDES:\nWhale Riders\nWhale Riders: The Card Game\nYellow & Yangtze", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["242 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 199 or more", "title": "SEA SIX", "descp": "Receive six (6) copies of Whale Riders AND six (6) copies of the KS exclusive Whale Riders: The Card Game (including all unlocked stretch goals)!\n\nNOTE: $199AUD is approximately $138USD\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 Whale Riders\n6\u00d7 Whale Riders: The Card Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 200 or more", "title": "RETAILER PLEDGE", "descp": "THIS PLEDGE IS FOR RETAILERS ONLY.\nThis is a deposit which gives you access to a separate pledge manager (to order Whale Riders at a special price).

Monsters allow me to create new and exciting mutants, demons and more to inhabit your exciting campaigns. Although, with all of these creative Monsters lurking, it seemed that something was still missing\u2026\nTerrain was the answer! But so much terrain can be tedious to print and difficult to store\u2026\nAfter spending a lot of time thinking of what I could design and print that would be the most effective for immersive tabletop games, plants and rocks came to mind. They are easy to print, easy to paint and could be used in a wide range of gaming sessions.\nSo, I\u2019ve created a collection of 50 plants and 50 rocks to fill the worlds of your upcoming tabletop campaigns. All the STL models have been printed and tested for a pre-supported version as well. So now all that\u2019s left is to fill up your build plate and press print. In no time at all, you\u2019ll have a multitude of small, easy to use and easy to store terrain for your next game session.\nI decided to keep things simple for you with just three pledges available to backers.\nThere is a pledge for all rocks (including dedicated stretch goals).\nAnother one for all plants (also including their dedicated Stretch Goals).\nFinally, a third pledge: everything proposed during this campaign will be available to those backers who pledge for this level.\n THE CORE SETS \n PLANTS PACK \n CORE SET - 10 Plant Sets - 50 models\n5 OUTER WORLD MANGROVE\n5 VENOMOUS FLOWERS\n5 GREEN MONSTERA\n5 AZTEC PLANTS\n5 ALIEN TENTACLE PLANTS\n5 GIANT MUSHROOMS\n5 ALIEN EGGS PLANTS\n5 POISONOUS SPONGE PLANTS\n5 PHOSPHORESCENT BALLS\n5 EGYPTIAN CACTUSES\n ROCKS PACK \nCORE SET - 10 Rock Sets - 50 models\n5 ANCIENT JUNGLE RUINS\n5 MAGIC CRYSTALS\n5 ALIEN RUIN SPHERES\n5 ANCIENT DESERT BARYTE\n5 RUINS OF CRYSTAL DRAGON'S EGGS\n5 MYSTIC STACKING\n5 SHARP GLACIER\n5 SCI FI CRYSTALS\n5 UNDERWATER CORAL\n5 DWARF STONES\nTHE STRETCH GOALS!\nAll are pre-supported\n \u20ac 1 000  Plants Set- 5 TROPICAL LEAVES + 1 GIFT \n\u20ac 2 000 Rocks Set - 5 TEMPLE RUINS \n\u20ac 3 000 Plants Set - 5 DEMONIC PUMPKINS \n\u20ac 4 000 Rocks Set - 5 ICY CORAL \n\u20ac 5 000 Plants Set - 5 CANNIBAL FEAST BRANCHES \n\u20ac 6 000 Rocks Set- 5 UNDERWATER SPONGE ROCKS\n\u20ac 7 000 Plants Set - 5 ENCHANTED MUSHROOMS \n\u20ac 8 000 Rocks Set- 5 SCIFI CUBIC STONES \n\u20ac 9 000 Plants Set - 5 SCIFI UNKNOWN FLOWERS \n \u20ac 10 000  Rock Set - 5 MARTIAN STALAGMITES + 1 GIFT \n\u20ac 11 500 Plants Set - 5 TROPICAL LEAVES\n\u20ac 13 000 Rocks Set - 5 TRAP ROCKS\n\u20ac 14 500 Plants Set - 5 CARNIVOROUS PLANTS\n\u20ac 16 000 Rocks Set - 5 FOSSIL ROCKS\n\u20ac 18 000 Plants  Set - 5 DANGEROUS MUSHROOMS\n \u20ac 20 000  Rocks Set - 5 EGYPTIAN RUINS   + 1 GIFT \n\u20ac 22 000 Plants Set - 5 GIANT BRAMBLES\n\u20ac 24 000 Rocks Set - 5 STEAMPUNK STONES\n\u20ac 26 000 Plants Set - 5 MUTANT PLANTS\n\u20ac 28 000 Rocks Set - 5 ICE STALAGMITES \n \u20ac 30 000 Plants Set - 5 FAIRY SUNFLOWERS +  2 GIFTS \n\u20ac 32 500 Rocks Set - 5 DEMONIC BASALT\n\u20ac 35 000 Plants Set - 5 DEAD TRUNKS\n\u20ac 37 500 Rocks Set - 5 CYBER STONES\n \u20ac 40 000 Plants Set - 5 GIANT BROWN ALGAE + 1 GIFT \n\u20ac 43 00 Rocks Set - 5 ANCIENT CANNIBAL STONES\n\u20ac 46 000 Plants Set - 5 MAGIC BAMBOO GROVES\n \u20ac 50 00 Rocks Set - 5 CELTIC SNOW STONES + 1 GIFT \n\u20ac 55 000 Plants Set - 5 GIANT MYSTIC ROSES\n \u20ac 60 00 Rocks Set - 5 DEADLY LAVA STONES\n\u20ac 65 000 Plants Set - 5 SCI-FI PLANTS\n \u20ac 70 00 Rocks Set - 5 ANCIENT DOLMENS\nDESCRIPTION of each PACKS\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STRETCH GOALS!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n SOME PRINTS EXEMPLES \n(more Pics in the UPDATES)\n PLANTS &ROCKS\nADD-ONS (SOME PRINTS EXEMPLES)\nTHE GIGA ADD-ON PACK!!!\n78 High definition Models with EPIC monsters, units, plants...

You can see some of my games and prototypes at www.GearLockGames.com. When I tell people that I design board games, they immediately ask questions about the design process. This is because they have an idea for the game, but they are not sure where to start.  After helping several people though this process, I decided to publish a book that covers the basic steps.\nYou will find that there are not a lot of books out there that just simply walk you through the steps on how to create a board game.  This book aims to remedy that issue.  In this book, you will find detailed information how to flush out your game idea, create a prototype, playtest the prototype to develop the game and finally how to get the game printed and out into the world.\nThe book also covers some basics on finding a publisher, self-publishing and how to use Kickstarter to fund your game.\n*New to the 4th Edition*\nThe 4th Edition provides step-by-step instructions on how to upload and play your game on Tabletop Simulator (TTS) and Tabletopia. They are both virtual board game environments that allow you and others to play the prototype of your game together. This is perfect for playtesting and a great way to pitch your game to publishers and reviewers without having to create expensive, physical copies of your game. Tabletopia has a free and paid version for board game designers. TTS has a cost but also has the advantage of helping you create engaging videos of your game. Each of the tiers and features are covered in the book.\nAbout the Author:\nAvid board gamer with a personal collection of over 400+ games.\nIndependent board game designer and publisher.

We've made a simple solution!\nBoard Game Clips holding together Formula D\nHave you ever been playing your favorite multi-board board game and someone knocks one of the boards out of place? Or you just can't get them lined up perfectly during setup? This can be extremely frustrating! These little clips will solve these issues and are designed specifically for board games! \n  How Board Game Clips Work\nBoard Game Clips are a simple, affordable solution to a simple issue.\nThey will snugly and temporarily clip together two boards or keep seams in boards closed with very minimal intrusion into the play surface and without noticeably marking or scuffing your board.\nBoard Game Clip helping to keep Terraforming Mars board completely flush!\n \n        These fit nearly all board games such as Cyclades, Formula D, Zombicide, War of the Ring; Or any other board with thickness from 1.75mm to 2.5mm. These have rounded edges so they won't scratch your boards and are created with a continuous bead of 3d printed filament on each layer so that they are very durable and will hold their shape and tension for many hundreds or thousands of clips and unclips. I will also ship an extra clip with each order just in case one does break!\nOur clips have been engineered to remain usable for thousands of clips and un-clips! PLA plastic is created from corn, cassava, sugarcane or sugar beet pulp.\n \n        While not quite big or strong enough to straighten badly warped boards, these will solve the issue of slightly warped boards! Simply put them at the seams of the boards to keep things flatter!\n  Rewards and Add-ons\n Base Pledge Levels \nThere are 3 base pledge levels:  Personal, Large, and Collection.  Early in the campaign, I realized this product was very popular and I found a way to provide less expensive shipping to much of the world so I created the OUTSIDE USA pledge levels for international backers, please use those if you are not in the USA.  All of the pledge levels include an equal number of the two standard variations of straight 2mm clips.\nBoard Game Clips helping a slightly warped Twilight Struggle board and keeping together War of the Ring! Also a shot of 8 clips you will get with a personal size order.\nThe narrow variation have a little more \"bite\" in their grip and don't intrude into the playing surface quite as much, the wider version won't squeeze your board quite as tightly but has a larger compression area, both provide roughly the same result and I find myself using both equally in different situations.  These clips are made for boards 1.8mm - 2.7mm thick and work great for nearly all games!\n    Add-ons\nStraight 2mm clips won't work for every game or in every situation obviously, so we have also developed some additional \"special\" clips which are available by over-pledging (adding additional money to your base pledge).  At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, I will be emailing everyone a backer survey where I will ask how many of each type of additional clip you over-pledged for.  Below is the cost of adding special clips to your order.  The cost per clip varies based on which pledge level you backed.\nIf you want to purchase any of these special clips, please follow the below instructions:\n1- Use the chart below to determine how much additional money to add to your pledge.\n2- Update your pledge to include this additional amount.\n3- When the campaign ends I will send everyone a reward survey, this will include questions asking how many (and what type of) special clips you purchased.  Please answer these and we will send out the correct amounts to you!  You can ask to receive any of the special clips in any combination you choose.\nBelow are descriptions of all of the special clips available for addition to your pledge.  All of these clips have been designed with the same principles in mind of functionality, durability, ease of use, flexible application, and leaving as little impact on your boards as possible!\n    90\u00b0 Corner Clip\n90\u00b0 Corner Clip holding together Game of Thrones the board game and it's expansion pieces.\nBy far the most requested special clip has been corner clips.  As you can see in the picture above from \"A game of Thrones\" these clips will come in handy in MANY different situations, it's so nice to have things stay put and look cohesive throughout the entire play session!  These clips will work for boards of 1.75mm - 2.25mm which covers almost anything you can throw at them!\n    120\u00b0 Hex Tile Clip  (2.5mm)\nOne of the hottest new games out right now is \"Rallyman GT\" it's a great game but wow are those hex tiles difficult to play on!  I've created these 120 degree clips specifically for this purpose!  Any other game that uses hexagonal tiles with 2.25mm- 2.75mm thickness will work great with this also, if you have another game in mind please let me know, I would love to hear about it!\n120\u00b0 clips holding together Rallyman GT!\n    3mm Straight Clip\nWith all the high-level productions being put out by publishers lately, many games are coming with dual-layered boards, most of these dual-layered boards are 3mm thick in total, these clips will hold these together and keep things in place.  These will work on any board from 2.8mm - 3.25mm thick.  I've heard from a backer that Barrage could benefit from these.\nTesting the 3mm straight clips on a typical dual-layered board.\n    1.5mm Straight Clip\nSome games just don't measure up!  Ok... maybe that's harsh, but plenty of great games have slightly thinner than \"standard\" boards.  Any board that is 1.35mm-1.8mm will probably benefit greatly from these clips, as these are the types of boards that warp easiest.\n    120\u00b0 Hex Tile Clip  (2mm)\nSame as the 120\u00b0 2.5mm clips, but for games that use hex tiles that are 2mm in thickness.  I don't have any examples but I'm assuming they exist!  =)\nBelow is a segment from \"Crowdsurfing\" on The Dice Tower; I sent Tom our clips and the guys discuss the product and the campaign.\n A Sample of Games and Which Clips to use:\n  Thank you!\nThank you to everyone who has made this project such a big success and please do not hesitate to ask any questions or voice any concerns you may have.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI foresee no risks in the Kickstarter or fulfillment process.

Many people may notice their package shows as \"delivered\" in the USA, this is simply a sorting facility that the post office uses for our package classification.  After this point, it seems that most packages have been going completely dark with tracking but they are eventually getting delivered.  I spoke with the postmaster at our post office regarding this, he says that he has seen delays of over 3 months in some cases.  This is due to the fact that there are basically no flights from the USA to Europe currently, so there are very few planes for mail and packages to get on to.  They are making their way over, but it is a MUCH slower process than normal and some packages just get physically buried under the backlog of things waiting to get onto overseas transportation for months at a time.  For this reason, I won't be investigating individual international packages for many months to come.  Many people have already contacted me individually with these concerns, I've told them this same information and the package has shown up for them.  So I'm asking international customers to please be patient, your package will more than likely arrive, and if it doesn't, we will address it together later this year.

THEY are the ones in control of the signal, and it\u2019s your mission to take them down!\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a game if it were that easy...\nThere are enemies hiding in your midst attempting to sabotage your progress, and even some of your own team may not be who they say they are. As a member of the resistance, it\u2019s your job to weed out the traitors and take them down before it\u2019s too late.\nLucky for you\u2026 you have these! Now put them on, or start eating that trash can. \nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 is directly inspired by the themes of the movie; it's rich and poor divide and the battle to control the system. The game involves collecting resources and banking them for use in the final assault, just like the end of the film.\nYour role will vary depending on if you\u2019re playing as a Human or an Invader. One will have you attempting to save humanity, the other will have you fighting to maintain your position as their overlords.\nBelow is a basic breakdown of the roles you fill to complete your mission.  \nHuman or Invader - either way, you\u2019re going to need your cunning, reasoning, and a trusty pair of Hoffman Lenses to win! \n\u201cI take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.\u201d\nThis is the exciting bit\u2026\nThe Hoffman Lenses have no need for apps, phones or a computer. Just like the movie, simply put them over your eyes to see the truth!! We\u2019ve worked closely with our production team to ensure that our art and design aesthetic works in a simple, real-world way.\nPlayers can use the lenses to inspect and uncover Invader interference in three ways:\n Uncovering hidden enemy players - Players will be able to risk their glasses and enter a PVP encounter. If successful, the winner will be able to look at the losing player\u2019s character card and see their true identity. The question is, will the others believe you?\n Uncovering enemy sabotage - Before assets enter the final assault stash, they will need to be deposited at resistance locations. As a human, it\u2019s your responsibility to check items with the glasses before they go to the stash. This will allow you to identify and discard any sabotaged cards! As an Invader, you\u2019ll need to identify the sabotaged items and sneak them into the stash- ready to thwart the final assault.\n Checking the billboards - Resistance hideouts have billboards (cards) to identify them. Each contains hidden messages from Invaders that they use to coordinate their raids. It\u2019s important to know where your items are and understand the risk of potential raids, otherwise, they may get confiscated.\nThe Hoffman Lenses are one of the most unique and exciting parts of the game. They are also one of your most valuable assets in preparing for your assault on Cable 54! Limited tokens dictate the number of times you can use the glasses, so you will need to be tactical with how and when you choose to put them on. Get it wrong, and you could be left unprepared for an emergency situation!\n Can a simple drifter rise to lead the resistance against the Invaders?\nCan a corrupt politician find redemption?\nCan a tired detective track down an elusive Invader-targeting serial killer?\nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 allows you to play as new and exciting original characters, as well as iconic ones from the movie, in a dynamic narrative-driven board game that is full of twists and turns. Each character is fully fleshed out with their own personal adventure that fits into the world of They Live.\nThese stories are told through a unique story deck for each character. The order of their deck is randomized, and how many cards it takes to complete your story depends on your success with each. This system means a different personal-story experience each time you play.\nThese carefully constructed stories have different endings depending on if you\u2019re playing as a human or an invader. Completing them is optional, but doing so will reward you with unique character items and special skills to aid in overthrowing the invaders, or sabotaging the resistance!\nHow your personal story works:\nEach player will start with an Awakening Card at the beginning of the game. This will set the scene, explain who you are, and tell the story of how you came to know about the Invaders (although... this may be a cover story). After the Awakening Card, it\u2019s completely up to you how, when and if you uncover the next part of your adventure.\nYou must successfully complete four randomized cards from your personal story deck to experience the ending and unlock your unique character item. However, just like in real life, if you mess things up you can't go back and change it.\n Each turn is split into 4 phases. The following diagram explains how each phase works: \nThe main game will involve the players looking at their cards and knowing if they are a Human or an Invader to assume the correct role. For obvious reasons, this doesn\u2019t really work for 1 player and could even mean outnumbered play for lower player counts.\n\u2018Blind Play\u2019 will involve the player or players controlling multiple characters. All taking part in the adventure without knowing their character\u2019s allegiance. You can enter PVP and engage your own characters, using the glasses to uncover the possible enemy within. If you do find a traitor in your midst, the game will take over control of the uncovered Invader and activate a separate Invader behavior deck.\nIf Invaders in your party make it all the way to the \u2018Final Assault\u2019 they will become active and produce significant debuffs to your character and engage with you in combat.\nThis mode is currently in the testing phase with additional behavior card art in development. \nTonight is the last stand for the resistance - the enemy strikes at dawn!\nThe game contains a ticking timer that progresses towards a fixed deadline. In order to win the game, you need to get to Cable 54 and start the 'Final Assault' before the clock hits midnight.\nThe 'Final Assault' contains three story-based trials that will need to be overcome to win. Doing so will require high-level players that have been developed throughout the game. You will also need a good stash of weapons, items, and allies to be victorious.\nEach of the three trials will test your skills and require you to spend assets on improving your chances of successful dice rolls. It\u2019s during this assault that enemy players are most likely to reveal themselves and spend their sabotaged goods on halting your progress.\nWith the correct planning, the right equipment, and a little luck, you have the chance to stop the signal once and for all, and live on in legend as part of resistance history.\nIf you fail, well, things will be a lot worse\u2026\n All of the other core rules are in our attached rulebook below. This includes details on combat (PVE and PVP), actions, stats, skills and more.\nThis is a continually evolving process in terms of explaining the game in a way that is suitable for public consumption. You will see this updated throughout the campaign, and after, concluding with the finished document before release and print. \nBase game components for the standard edition of the game.\n*Please note this does not include stretch goals unless stated, all numbers could increase through through further development*\n\nAdditional cards may be added for the 1-3 player \u2018Blind Play\u2019 mode. \nAndrew Aitcheson - Co-Creator\nMovie geek and game enthusiast, who has previously worked in the education field and has designed a number of teaching aids and games for adult learning.

We are aware of the huge amount of work it takes to produce and distribute within strict timescales even in normal circumstances. With the current climate caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19) disruptions and delays have become the norm rather than the exception. \n\nAction Taken \u2013 We have already factored in an anticipated amount of delay and slowdown into our production and the projected shipping dates are currently 3 months later than they would otherwise have been. If the delays that we have allowed for do not materialize then shipping will occur much earlier than the specified dates.\n\nRisk \u2013 The technology we are using for the glasses has not been used in board games ever before, does it work?\n\nAction Taken \u2013 The polarisation technology that we are employing is one that is currently in use in sunglasses already, it just has never been deployed for the purpose of identifying Invaders among us. We work directly with our factory (and not via a trading partner) which results in much stricter control for production. We have worked closely with the production team to develop the game technology and ensure that everything works as it needs to before getting to the point of Kickstarter.\n\nWe promise to keep you informed and updated as the project develops, highlighting any potential issues, but also keeping you up to date with the first looks and latest progress.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the factory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the factory, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfill your game you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after 14 days may be processed via PayPal or the payment reversed through your credit card at our discretion.

We have fully stretched the game to perfection unlocking 15 Stretch Goals along the way that have upgraded all of the components, added some additional backstory cards, some mini expansions, a solo mode and expanded the Art Forgery case into a deeper experience.  We are looking forward to supporting Lawyer Up with a bunch of new case expansions down the line!\nClick the 'Late Pledge' button above and you'll be able to pledge/pre-order via Gamefound. Remember, this option will only be available for a limited time so act fast!\nIf you miss the Gamefound.com pledgemanager, you can visit our online store at https://shop.rockmanorgames.com to place a preorder (or just buy the game if it's available)\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check the FAQ or our most recent Kickstarter updates before messaging us directly!\nMeticulously designed and developed by Samuel W. Bailey (Forbidden Stars, Talisman: Cataclysm) and Mike Gnade (Maximum Apocalypse, the Few and Cursed) over the last 4 years, Lawyer Up is an asymmetrical two-player courtroom drama card game where one player is the noble prosecution and the other the steadfast defense. Each game begins with the Discovery phase, where players draft vital evidence to support their case and bury evidence that might help their opponent. Next comes the Trial phase, where players call witnesses and play powerful arguments along with the evidence they drafted into their examination pools. To form a coherent line of questioning, players will need to chain together their cards by matching bias symbols. The player who can best examine the Witness by generating the most influence will spend the difference to sway the Jury to their side. Every game is different, but the lawyer with the best case and most convincing arguments will be sure to get the verdict they are after!\nThe core game includes the base decks for both the prosecution and defense along with all the other components (jurors, bias tokens, etc) you need to play any case of Lawyer Up.  The core set also features two unique cases to play: The Art Forgery Case and the Murder Case.\nThe Art Forgery Case is a shorter case (6 Witnesses instead of 9) that focuses on learning the arguments and procedures in the base Prosecution and Defense decks.  It is all about drafting the paintings from famous Dutch painters and using the right evidence to replay them from discard piles.\nThe Murder Case is your modern Law and Order murder trial.  Jessica Fairmount was found standing over her father, covered in his blood, but insists that she was only trying to save him. The wealthy socialite has a lot to gain with her father's murder, but did she do it? This case features major asymmetry between the Prosecution (who can lock jurors to their side) and the Defense. The Prosecution must get all the Jurors to believe she is guilty while the Defense only needs one Juror to believe in her innocence for reasonable doubt.  \nLawyer Up is divided into two phases, the discovery and trial phases.  The discovery phase is a drafting phase representing both attorneys working back at their offices going through all the evidence of the case. During this phase, players simultaneously draw 3 cards and add one card to their deck, one card to their opponents deck and bury the last card.  This means that every time that you play a case, your deck will be unique.\nPlayers will not only draft unique decks, they will also select their legal strategies and Witnesses.  The trial phase of the game is typically made up of 9 rounds of witness examinations. During this phase, players take turns calling witnesses and chaining together legal arguments fighting to win the witness and influence the jury.\nYou can only play cards from your hand that share at least 1 symbol with the card previously in your Examination.  You can't jump from legal argument to an emotional one, because that would confuse the jury.\nAs you win witnesses, the jury will be swayed more and more to your side.  Each case can have slightly different win conditions, but in general whoever wins the most witnesses will have the jury on their side and win the case.\nFor the first time ever, Rock Manor Games has two deep thematic expansions already developed and available as part of this campaign!  Each expansion offers up new mechanics and win conditions - while staying true to the drafting and easy to learn card play of the core game.\nBetween February 1692 and May 1693 more than two hundred people were accused of being witches in colonial Massachusetts. This case takes a look at this infamous time in America's history, where mass hysteria is taking hold of the judicial system.\nThe Witch trial features over 80 unique illustrations by Abigail Larson whose art beautifully captures the time period.  The Witch Trial does away with the jury and is instead lead by an angry mob who is ready to hang anybody they believe is a witch. The goal of the Prosecution is to hang 3 witnesses as witches before they run out of cards.  The defense is scrambling to keep the mob under control and prevent a full blown witch hunt!\nThis case transports you back to Atlantic City in the 1920s where Carmine Monacelli is put on trial for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act.  Carmine is accused of operating a network of criminals involved in bootlegging, murder, gambling and more - but he's a powerful man in AC so it's going to take more than some Federal Prohibition Agents to take down this Godfather. \nThe Godfather expansion features over 80 unique illustrations by Nabetse Zitro and introduces a Dossier deck. As players win witnesses, they are able to reveal or discard the top card of the Dossier deck.  The prosecution needs to prove Carmine's Mafia connections by revealing these Dossier cards while avoiding the powerful criminal activities such as \"Jury Tampering\" and \"Swim with the Fishes\" that the defense has shuffled into the deck.  \nWhile these expansions are planned for retail release, we plan on spreading out their release over a few months.  Kickstarter backers will get everything first! well before any of it enters retail and distribution.\n Tons more previews in the playlist below!\nRetailers \nWe love to work with retailers from all around the world. Brick and Mortar Retailers who back at our retailer pledge will receive an early demo copy of the Art Forgery case to promote Lawyer Up in their store.  The demo copy will be ordered shortly after the campaign ends and produced in the USA with the Game Crafter (most of the videos above feature such a prototype).  The shipping associated with this pledge is for the prototype only.  All orders for the actual game will be handled outside of Kickstarter.\nSomeone from Rock Manor Games will contact you after the Kickstarter to help you with your personalized order.  Retailers are NOT required to pay for their orders upfront, we simply invoice you for your order and ask that you pay the invoice before Kickstarter fulfillment commences (~6 months later).\nIf you're an online retailer or simply not interested in contributing on Kickstarter, signup as a retailer here. We will email you closer to our retail release so that you can get Lawyer Up into your store.\nGroup Pledges\nWe do not have a specific Pledge Level for Group Pledges and plan on handling this in our Pledge Manager.  If you have a group of friends and are looking to pledge for at least 6 copies of Lawyer Up, message us on our website at rockmanorgames.com/contact and select the Subject \"Group Pledge\".  You will need to make sure you pledge for at least 1 base game here on Kickstarter and then we will import you as a group pledge into the pledge manager after the campaign is completed.\nWhen our pledge manager is sent out via email, you will be asked to fill in your address and you will be charged for shipping at that time.  You must fill out the pledge manager and pay for shipping to receive your reward.  We know that high shipping costs are the worst, so we are offering a $5 shipping discount to all of our Kickstarter Backers. Here are our estimated shipping costs for this project. Keep in mind these are just estimates based on our 2020 shipping rates and costs could change based on a variety of circumstances.\n1: Lower 48 States\n2: Canada, Hawaii and Alaska\n3: Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, and Switzerland\n 4: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam \n 5: Rest of World does not include Afghanistan, Brazil, Bolivia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Russia, South Africa, Syria, Somalia, Yemen. \nWe have key fulfillment partners in the US, Canada, Australia, China and the EU and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT. We have typically shipped EU rewards from a German depot. For this campaign, it's possible we may ship UK rewards from within the UK if necessary We'll make this decision as we get closer to fulfillment, based on the fees/customs/taxes after Brexit has occurred.  If you have any specific shipping questions before pledging, please message us on Kickstarter.\nAbout the Team\nGame published by Rock Manor Games, owned and operated by Mike Gnade.

So I'm just not going to stress about it and we will see what happens. UK backers don't need to worry about it either, since the most I'll do is ask for some pity donations if I get royally screwed. I've never had to wait so long and pay so much for Ocean Freight.  It reminds me how much I hate this phase of the project, because all I can do is send emails and get increasingly frustrated.  The only positive to all of this, is that I've spoken to other publishers and this is a universal problem - one that is rumored to start clearing up after Chinese New Year.

I just received freight shipping quotes and importing in the UK is 10x more expensive than importing into the EU.  We're talking ~$25 per copy of the game big.  I thought it was a typo and they added an extra zero.  After talking to 2 different UK fulfillment partners, I have discovered that not only was the quote correct but it's the result of some BREXIT policy changes with VAT calculation that start January 2021.  TLDR your government requires us to prepay 20% VAT on the MSRP.  That leaves us in the predicament of either shipping everything from the EU (and having you deal with VAT/customs/import etc) or figuring out a way to invoice and collect the VAT fees for each UK backer and then shipping from within the UK.  I'm currently investigating ways to best handle this unfortunate reality.  I feel the best result would be to figure out a way to invoice everyone in the UK for the VAT based on their order so it can ship UK friendly, but we could also just ship from the EU and see how it goes (no one really knows with BREXIT looming).

Sharing news of the campaign Nets you guys even more free stuff and attracts new backers! \n Pictura - BoardGameGeek page \nHGG Facebook page\nPictura Facebook post\nPictura Tweet\n HGG Instagram page\n   You can read more about Vernissage here.\n You can read more about Crystal Palace here.\nAn easy to learn, hard to master set collection game with a wealth of strategic possibilities.\nGorgeously illustrated with over 200 unique designs.\n Featuring 180 historical works of art, each with accurate information about the painting and where it is currently exhibited. \nFrom 2 to 4 players with a duration of 20-30 min per player.\nIn Museum: Pictura, players take on the role of aspiring museum curators! Their goal: to acquire the most Prestige points in order to make their establishment the greatest in the world.\nThis is done primarily by assembling Collections of some of history\u2019s greatest paintings. The larger these Collections grow, the more points they\u2019re worth when organising Temporary Exhibitions, as well as at the end of the game. But that\u2019s not all. Savvy curators will also need to navigate the upper echelons of society, attracting wealthy patrons, exploiting the ever-changing art market and calling in favours where necessary...\nPainting cards are the main component of the game. Each of the 180 cards represents a historical masterpiece, along with the following information:\nThese cards are shuffled together at the start of the game and split into multiple decks in order to form the Art Market.\nThe structure of a turn in Museum: Pictura is simple yet players will regularly find themselves confronted with important choices that will determine how their strategy (and Prestige) evolves over the course of a game.\n\nAcquisition phase\nThe player\u2019s turn starts with the Acquisition phase where new Painting cards are acquired from the Art Market by drawing two cards from any of the decks.\nThe player must then exchange a Painting card from their hand with one of the four International Museums on the central board. In Pictura, Painting cards have no fixed value. Just like in the real world of art, the value of a piece is subjective and can depend on changing fashions and opinions, which is where Trend cards come in. These are used in multiple instances throughout the game, but in this case each of the four museums is attributed their own Trend card randomly during setup. This card represents what kind of Paintings that establishment is looking for.\nTrend cards assign a value -in Prestige points- to a certain Period (header colour), Style (icon) and Artist (number). When exchanging paintings you place a Painting card from your hand into an International Museum of your choice before taking another one from them. If you give them a Painting card with criteria present on their Trend card, you\u2019ll gain Prestige. If you take a painting card with one of those criteria though, you\u2019ll lose Prestige points.\nOnce the active player has performed their mandatory exchange, each of the other players may also exchange a card if they so wish.\nIt\u2019s up to players to navigate this constantly changing pool of available Painting cards, exchanging paintings so as to strike a balance between gaining Prestige and acquiring paintings that best suit their strategy.\n\nAction Phase\nOnce they have acquired their new cards, players may perform one of these three actions:\nExhibit Paintings\nThe core of Museum: Pictura, and your main source of Prestige, are the Collections of paintings that you\u2019ll be building within the halls of your establishment.\nEach player has their own Museum board, onto which they\u2019ll be arranging their Painting cards. In order to exhibit a card, you simply discard any other card from your hand to pay for it. Discarded cards can be recovered by performing an Inventory action. However, cards in your Discard pile can be taken by other players, so pay attention to what you discard!\nExhibited cards can then be arranged to form collections of Periods or Styles. The bigger these collections get, the more Prestige points they\u2019re worth.\n\nExhibiting a card into your museum doesn\u2019t earn points. However, there is a Public Trend card that changes each round and represents the public\u2019s current preference. If you exhibit a card with one of the criteria shown on that Trend card, you will gain Prestige points!\n\nPerform an Inventory\nIf your Hand is getting a little sparse, you may decide to perform an Inventory during your turn instead of placing cards. This allows you to take cards back from your Discard pile into your Hand. This is great way to replenish your Hand and prevent your opponents from getting your discarded cards!\n\nIt also allows you to draw a Favour card and refresh the Patron cards currently on the board.\nEven though this action doesn\u2019t (directly) earn you any Prestige, it is great for managing your Discard pile and getting back into the game with fresh resources.\n\nOrganise a Temporary Exhibition\nThe final type of action a player can take is to organise a Temporary Exhibition. In Pictura, your museum is always open to the public but you can organise special events, galas and private viewings which take the form of Temporary Exhibitions. When you perform this action you get to score one of your current collections. This will earn you Prestige as well as the advantages of one of six bonus abilities shown on your player board which can come into effect during or at the end of the game.\nHowever, each player can only do a Temporary Exhibition for each Period or Style once during the game. Additionally, the first player to organise an event for a Period or Style scores bonus Prestige points to represent their visitors\u2019 enthusiasm for something new! The next person to organise an Exhibition on that theme still scores that collection but gains no bonus points. However, after the second one, the public will lose interest and no more Temporary Exhibitions of that type can be organised.\nThis lends a timing element to these events - they can represent a lot of Prestige points but waiting until your collections reach optimal sizes could leave you without a public that\u2019s interested in them!\n\nFree actions\nOn top of performing one of the three mandatory actions, a player can also perform the following free actions during their turn:\nCall in a Favour\nFavour cards are one shot ability cards with a variety of effects. You start the game with one and can play one during each of your turns. More Favour cards can be acquired by gaining more Prestige, as well as performing other actions.\n\n Acquire new Patrons \nDuring a game of Museum: Pictura, you\u2019ll be able to gain additional Prestige by attracting the attention of influential Patrons! The Patron board will show what they\u2019re looking for. If you have the Paintings requested by one of these Patron cards exhibited in your Museum, they\u2019ll reward you!\n\nOnce they\u2019ve performed their actions, the turn is passed to the next player and so on and so forth until someone reaches 50 or more prestige points.\nThe end of the game is set off when any player reaches 50 or more Prestige. They finish their turn and then each other player has one more turn before moving on to final scoring.\nTo the Prestige they\u2019ve earned during the game players will also be adding the values of the collection in their museums, bonuses from their personal Trend cards which are chosen at the start of the game as well as points from your temporary Exhibitions and rewards for filling out your galleries.\nPlayers will also lose points if they have too many cards in their Discard pile, so managing it correctly during the game is important.\nThe player with the most Prestige points at the end of the game, wins!\nYou can find the full rulebook here\nWe also have a rules and playthrough video:\nPictura is part of the Museum \u201crange\u201d. Despite having certain mechanics and contents that harken back to its predecessor in a recognisable way, it has always been designed to be its own game with the goal of providing a fresh new set collection experience and not simply being an \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201cmore recent\u201d version of the original game.\nTherefore, despite its familiar appearance there are some significant differences from the original. You may have picked up on some of them whilst reading through this page but if you\u2019d like to know about all the new elements, then we\u2019ve prepared a video just for you!\n Don\u2019t have time to watch the video? Here are the main differences in a nutshell:\n-          The cards: Painting cards in Pictura work differently to the Object cards in the original Museum. They don\u2019t have individual values, so to place a card in your museum, you simply discard any other card, 1 for 1.\n-          Scoring Points: The way you score points during the game is completely different. In Pictura, you have a far greater variety of ways to score (and lose!) points during the game, from following Trend cards to organising Temporary Exhibitions and attracting Patrons. This gives you a lot more opportunities to consider during the game.\n-          The importance of timing: Although the original Museum had a certain element of timing to it, choosing the right time to perform certain actions in Museum: Pictura is incredibly important! Organising a Temporary Exhibition at the perfect moment can truly be a game changer. Keeping an eye on a fellow curator whose score is creeping perilously close to 50 is crucial too\u2026\n-          Optimising your Collections: Thanks to Temporary Exhibitions and your personal Trend card, it\u2019s possible to score a Collection more than once in Museum: Pictura. You\u2019ll need to plan your collections carefully to squeeze out every last Prestige point from the cards you place!\n-          Managing your Discard: In Museum: Pictura, managing your Discard is more important than ever before! Contrary to the first game, once a card has been discarded, performing an Inventory is the only way to get it back. On top of that, every card in your discard will lose you points at the end of the game, which can add up to a lot if you don\u2019t stay on top of it!\n English\nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish\n\nPictura has been in development since early 2019. After a studious research phase spent identifying all the paintings we wanted to have appear in the game we began testing the game extensively as the mammoth task of illustrating all the game\u2019s contents got underway.\nFast forward to 2020 and we have a game that is fully illustrated and tested. All other content shown during this campaign is also basically finished, some graphic and balancing tasks outstanding.\nApart from making some material upgrades, we\u2019ll be using the same manufacturer as the first Museum. With them having handled the original game, the pre-production and manufacturing Pictura should be a very smooth process.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done our best to keep the costs as low as possible. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nThe chart above shows the estimated cost of shipping the game to your region for each of the pledge levels. Please note that ordering multiple copies will increase these costs. For regions 1, 2 and 3 the shipping cost of each additional copy should be about 30-50% the first. \nFor RoW orders with multiple copies or particularly large orders in the other regions we will have to use particular courier services that willbe more expensive than usual. If this concerns you and you would like a more accurate quote of your shipping  you can message us and we will endeavor to provide you with one ASAP. \nNote that these costs are barring any unforeseen circumstances outside of our control. \nExact costs will be indicated during the pledge manager phase but we are confident that the numbers shown here are a very good estimation of the maximum final price.\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by March 2021. This may seem like a long time given the advanced state of the game, however, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\n\"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada. Please note that you may be liable for import duties for other destinations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first Kickstarter. This is HGG's eighth project so we are very familiar with the running and fulfilment of a KS project as well as where to look for any potential pitfalls. We currently have two other ongoing Kickstarter projects: Titan, and Museum Deluxe Version. Both are currently in pre-production. We are active on both pages, providing regular updates, answering questions and generally keeping our backers informed at each stage of the project.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating a March 2021 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to deliver before this date and/or ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR\n\nWe always welcome feedback and constructive criticism of our projects and games.

If the creators had included the demanded elements from the beginning, I would have no objection (they can be as historical or ahistorical in their presentation as they like), but I am disappointed by the increasing trend of KS creators allowing themselves to be pushed during/after campaigns into altering what they have already done to reward noisy commentary in the absence of actual evidence that it is going to significantly change the odds of getting the project financed.

Rumours abound, and an inside 'colleague' has hidden a series of clues within the pages of the otherwise innocuous furniture catalogue. Conveniently, they have left a website trail to help eagle-eyed shoppers solve the many puzzles, and see if they can uncover the mysterious goings-on before anyone else does...\n156 pages of gorgeous full-colour, original designs fill this deceptive catalogue.\n Background\nMatt and Stephen form The Escapages, a publisher of interactive puzzle books, all with a strong narrative theme. Whilst their books Miracle 47, Prisoner 7, Arrival,Escape The Compound and Vice Versa have become internationally-popular puzzle escape books, they wanted a much grander challenge. Enter flatpak.\nPuzzles are everywhere, as are catalogues. Early in 2019, an idea was formed - what if there was a puzzle book, disguised as a Scandinavian furniture catalogue, where there was a logic puzzle hidden on every single page? It would have to be a good length, use gorgeous full-colour photographs and images, look almost identical to other catalogues you may have on your coffee table and, most importantly, have a really strong narrative arc hidden within the puzzles. \n120+ logic puzzles are contained in the catalogue, all carefully hidden.\n Under the hood\nThis is a grand ambition, and we have released over 60 mock-up pages on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook as part of the play testing process. Having fully funded in under 36 hours, we are now keen to develop our catalogue even further, with your feedback and stretch goals.\nOn almost every page will be a logic puzzle of some sort, all originally created for flatpak. There will be number puzzles, anagrams, hidden words, morse, braille and some image clues. This will be supported online by our website, which will give 24/7 access to check your answers and help build the narrative. We also have a growing forum, and will add hints and clues to help you along the way. \nAll puzzles will help to reveal the gripping story, which you'll be desperate to uncover.\n Rewards & Stretch Goals\nWe have a whole host of fantastic rewards, from a physical copy of the catalogue, right through to the chance to name a product or even use a photo of your own furniture item in the catalogue. We also have a tier for people who want to buy two catalogues, and for catalogue/book combinations. We also have some incredible, and met, stretch goals.  \n Join the flatpaker community! Tape measure optional.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have spoken to several commercial printers, and have chosen one in the UK with a worldwide reputation. As well as having the narrative fully planned out, we have a functioning website to supply answers, and have built the frameworks for many of the pages already.

We know the importance of communication, and will update all our backers with all the juicy behind-the-scenes footage and detail that is so important.

He presented it as a collection of found documents --  correspondence, newspaper articles, journal entries -- painstakingly transcribed and compiled into the published book by his characters themselves. His experimental approach brings you directly into the story, and refracts it through countless points of view.\nDRACULA: The Evidence is an entirely new way to experience Stoker's masterpiece: through an actual physical research file full of ephemera, correspondence, clues and artifacts. It's the entire original text of Dracula, presented as a gorgeously designed and curated briefcase full of maps, letters, diaries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, and phonograph records. We've teamed up with Dracula expert and Bram's descendent Dacre Stoker to bring you the most immersive way imaginable to experience this modernist masterpiece of gothic horror.\n In our edition, you are not merely a reader \u2013 you are an explorer making your way through this archive of first-hand evidence, retracing this nightmarish story through the remnants it left behind: correspondence, charts and diagrams, memoranda, artifacts, photographs and much more.

Offset printed on fine archival uncoated paper. \nBorn in Ireland in 1847, ABRAHAM \"BRAM\" STOKER studied mathematics at Dublin's Trinity College and embarked on his longtime role as an assistant to actor Sir Henry Irving in the 1870s. He also began carving out a second career as a writer, publishing his first novel, The Primrose Path, in 1875. During this period, Stoker was part of the literary staff of The Daily Telegraph in London, and he wrote other fiction as well.\nStoker visited the English coastal town of Whitby in 1890, and that visit was said to be part of the inspiration for Dracula. Before writing Dracula, Stoker met \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, a Hungarian writer and traveller. Dracula likely emerged from V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry's dark stories of the Carpathian mountains. Stoker then spent several years researching European folklore and mythological stories of vampires.\nIn 1897, Stoker published his masterpiece, Dracula. While the book garnered critical success after its release, it didn't achieve peak popularity until well after its author's death.\nDACRE STOKER is the great grand-nephew of Bram Stoker and the international best-selling co-author of Dracula the Un-Dead (2009), the official Stoker family endorsed sequel to Dracula. Dacre is also the co-editor (with Elizabeth Miller) of The Lost Journal of Bram Stoker: The Dublin Years (2012). His latest novel, Dracul, a prequel to Dracula, released in October 2018, was co-authored with JD Barker and has been sold to Putnam in North America, Penguin Random House in the UK, and additional publishers in France, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Brazil, Serbia, Taiwan, Turkey, Vietnam, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Portugal, and Poland with film rights purchased by Paramount Studios.\nA native of Montreal, Canada, Dacre taught Physical Education and Sciences for twenty-two years, in both Canada and the U.S. He has participated in the sport of Modern Pentathlon as an athlete and a coach at the international and Olympic levels for Canada for 12 years. He is also an avid player and coach of the unique game of Real Tennis. In May of 2016 an athlete he has been coaching for the past 4 years, Camden Riviere, won the World Championships of Court Tennis. He currently lives in Aiken, SC, and together with his wife Jenne they manage the Bram Stoker Estate.\nHEADCASE DESIGN is an award-winning graphic design and illustration studio located in Philadelphia that specializes in publishing. Paul Kepple is its founder, owner, creative director, and lead designer. Paul and his team at Headcase have created ambitious and richly elaborate designs that immerse readers in the diverse worlds of Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, Twin Peaks, The Sopranos, and J.J. Abrams\u2019s and Doug Dorst's meta-novel S. They\u2019ve designed behind-the-scenes books for the hit Broadway shows Hamilton, Wicked, and Dear Evan Hansen, cinematic properties like Harry Potter and Star Wars, and art-centric biographies for music legends Geddy Lee of Rush, Courtney Love, and Eminem. In 2012, Headcase co-authored and illustrated the darkly humorous Zombie Tarot, which put Paul\u2019s vast knowledge of b-movies to good use and has sold over 40,000 copies. Their lavish touch is obvious in the artist monographs The Temple of Silence: Forgotten Works & Worlds of Herbert Crowley and MADNESS IN CROWDS: The Teeming Mind of Harrison Cady, both designed for Beehive Books. Their work has been recognized by AIGA, American Illustration, the Art Director\u2019s Club of New York, Communication Arts, Graphis, How, Print, and was an nominated for an Eisner Award.\nPaul is a life-long horror movie fanatic and Dracula enthusiast, and has spent many a childhood afternoon obsessively seeking out every Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee incarnation in existence.

At present, the union has made it clear that they do not ask for a boycott neither on behalf of creators nor backers (and it is a possibility that a boycott would actually be harmful to the union at this stage).\nAs we are a very small company currently completely reliant on the Kickstarter model, we have decided to proceed with launching this campaign. We understand our backers\u2019 decisions whether they decide to participate in our projects at this time or not, though we urge you to keep supporting small companies like ourselves and marginalized creators of all kinds who can only find backing outside of traditional publishing and fundraising platforms.\nNo form of collective action would disrupt our commitment to fulfilling all rewards for each of our ongoing projects.\n[Video production by Easton Carter Angle and Calvin Woodruff. You should hire them, they are amazing.]", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs the veterans of nearly dozen fully funded and fulfilled Kickstarter campaigns, Beehive Books founders Josh O\u2019Neill and Ma\u00eblle Doliveux know well the challenges associated with funding, printing, and distributing beautiful oversized art books. Between our various ventures, we have raised nearly a million dollars on Kickstarter, and rewarded backers of every campaign with very beautiful books and rewards.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all books, prints and ancillary rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money we need to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job. In fact, with such a substantial funding goal, the biggest danger is simply that we'll fall short of our ambitious aims.\n\nStill, there are more risks and challenges involved in making books with this level of production value than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. This is the most elaborate project we've ever undetaken, and problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict.

In addition to the typical suits you see on a deck of cards, the Western Tropic deck includes suits that remind you of each suit's abilities.\n Western Tropic uses a 5x5 grid that acts as a communal, but ever-changing set of cards that players use to create the best possible hand. Much like Texas Hold'em, each player has hole cards that are unique to them. But, the game uses an extra (third) hole card each round that can be traded in, to grant various actions such as moving your character around the grid, or changing the grid, altogether. \nThe player represented by the Pinkerton card below (top left) starts their turn with three of a kind (sevens). Burning their extra Diamond card allows that player to SWAP two cards on the grid during their turn. After moving one space over, the player's new community cards and hole cards combine to create a Full house.\nThe Kickstarter-only \"Founder's Edition\" of Western Tropic will come in a beautiful wood box created by Woodchuck USA. This Minnesota-based company not only produces high-quality wood products, but they plant a tree for every product sold! The custom box will feature the island of Western Tropic etched on top, and this reward will also come with 8 additional Joker cards that will eventually serve as the first expansion pack for the game. There's one other fun secret that comes with this edition that has something to do with the island featured below... \nShipping info (USA/International)\nPlaying Cards or Full Game $5/10\nFounders Edition: $10/Varies for international\nA very special thanks to the people who helped bring the game prototype, mechanics, artwork, and campaign to life:\n Card Design: Brooks Engel \n Character + Environment Design: Antonio Stappaerts \n 3D Rendering: Rachel Jones \n Rulebook Editor #1: Eli Lester \n Rulebook Editor #2: Patrick Morrison \n Map Illustration: Jog Brogzin \n Video Editing: Hugo Cabrera \n Video Capture: Nelson Valladares \n Video Actors: Jonathan Jordan, Michael Espinoza and Gizmo Kendall ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy previous 2 Kickstarter campaigns (raising nearly $40,000) were successfully delivered around the world early or on time.

Specifically, the factory has extended its employees' Chinese New Year break to keep them at home and prevent the potential spread of this disease, halting the operation of manufacturing in the meantime. My hope was that production on the game would begin before this, and prior to the situation escalating, but alas that hasn't happened and I am still am working to get a specific timeline on when things will resume.

Years of pollution has tarnished the landscape and the world\u2019s supplies of natural resources have dwindled to abysmal levels.The use of electric vehicles, solar technologies and other energy saving solutions have slowed the problem. Though, the long-term abuse on the planet by previous generations has been hard to reverse. Most Earthlings seem to have given up hope. The demise of a once great planet is in sight - and there seems to be nothing anyone can do about it. However, a group of optimistic explorers are taking a trek to Mars, which some believe may turn around their fate. \nIn search of knowledge these explorers hope that understanding the demise of alien populations can assist them with preventing or at least slowing down the rapid deterioration of the Earth. They\u2019ll need to replicate martian technologies, translate their languages and avoid gaining too much radiation along the way in order to end up with the most prestige and save the Earth as they know it.\n  In Ruins of Mars players are playing as explorers who are looking to decipher martian languages, learn and replicate their technologies, gain hourglasses necessary to perform certain abilities and ultimately gain prestige to win the game.     \nLanguage Track, Player Board and Hourglasses\nPlayers will place their rover at one of the five locations on the board and take their desired action, as well as any wrench bonus action a space may have. The exact benefits of their action will be based on the action tiles below the space.    \nCenter board and Action Tiles\n  The action tiles will shift every turn in a Mancala'esque fashion around the board. The tiles at the active site (wherever the rover is located) will be shuffled and randomly placed around the board starting with the active site and moving right until there are no tiles left (the board wraps around for allocation purposes).   \nAction Tiles Being Shuffled\n Players will have to balance their time. Replicating more advanced martian technologies requires a greater understanding of the martian languages. A player's character and some of their technology cards will also require hourglass tokens to activate their abilities and aid the player in their pursuit. \nDo you have what it takes to explore, uncover, and learn the Ruins of Mars?  \nIf you'd like to read the complete rules, download it below.  \n>>> Click to download <<<\nWe're activating a few social goals.

I've spent much of my life traveling the world to collect rare and fascinating objects. Over the years, and with the help of so many wonderful people, I've assembled an incredible collection which I am sharing with the world through a project called Mini Museum!\nExamining a Burmese amber sample after hours in the markets of T\u00e9ngch\u014dng, China\nThe Mini Museum is a personal collection of curiosities where every item is authentic, iconic, and labeled. It's carefully designed to take you on a journey of learning and exploration.\nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Small (13-Specimens) and Large (32-Specimens)\nEncased in the highest quality Lucite acrylic, the Mini Museum will last for generations. It is a truly awesome collection that makes a wonderful gift for the person who has just about everything, or for someone special you want to inspire.  \nFour Unique Collections for Tens of Thousands of Backers Around the World! \u2764\ufe0f\nSince our first Kickstarter project back in 2014, we've shared this journey across space and time with tens of thousands of people all over the world through four unique collections.\nThis time we've come back to share our first subject-focused collection: Mini Museum Age of Dinosaurs! \nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Large (32-Specimens)\nAge of Dinosaurs is a breathtaking collection paced across one hundred and eighty-five million years! There are 35 specimens in Age of Dinosaurs, making it our largest collection since the First Edition!\nBeginning with the near extinction of all life on Earth, we\u2019ll witness the struggle to rebound even as the surface of the planet tears itself apart.\nAdorned with feathers and scales, species will radiate and blossom in unparalleled variety, and by tooth and claw... life will find a way.\nYou will hold the largest creatures to ever walk the Earth and the most powerful predators of all time. Then, when we\u2019ve reached the end, we'll watch as life once more succumbs to a fiery cataclysm!\nSpecimens from Age of Dinosaurs - More Details Below!\nBelow you'll find a chart of all the specimens in the collection and the versions in which they appear:  \nAge of Dinosaurs Specimen List\nAs with past Editions, the Large and the Small will arrive in a handsome Display Box, protected by a Custom Microfiber Pouch. \nPackaging Elements from the Age of Dinosaurs Display Box\nEach Mini Museum also comes with a Certificate of Authenticity and a 160-page, hardbound book we call the Companion Guide. The Companion Guide is a starting point for learning more about the specimens in the collection, details about our process, and additional references so that you can continue exploring on your own!\nRaptor Storytime with the Companion Guide! (Raptor Cameo Credit: Atrociraptor marshalli from David Silva's Beasts of the Mesozoic Collection)\nGiving back to our backers who make each edition of the Mini Museum possible!\nDuring this campaign, we're offering the opportunity to back all three versions of Age of Dinosaurs (Large, Small, and Touch) with special pricing for every tier!\nSince we're talking about dinosaurs it seemed really appropriate to name the tiers after the three geological periods of the Mesozoic:\n Triassic  (Early Bird I):\nLarge $259\nTouch $259\nSmall $99\nJurassic  (Early Bird II):\nLarge $269\nTouch $269\nSmall $109\nCretaceous (Early Bird III):\nLarge $279\nTouch $279\nSmall $119\nAfter the campaign, the prices will return to our standard $299 for the Large and the Touch, and the Small will be $129. \nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Small (13-Specimens)\nOnce more, we are offering $10 worldwide shipping, so no matter where you are, shipping will cost just $10 for your Kickstarter reward!\nPlease Note: Shipping prices only apply to your Kickstarter rewards. Any add-ons purchased after the campaign will have standard shipping rates applied in line with past campaigns.\nImportant Information for Backers Outside the United States: As with past projects, the shipping price for your Kickstarter reward only includes the cost of shipping and insurance. The price does not include sales tax/VAT or any duties/customs fees that may apply.\nIndividual numbers will be exclusive to the Kickstarter version of the Touch and Large.\nEach Mini Museum is unique, but this time around we're going to make the Large and Touch a bit more special for our Kickstarter backers by limiting the laser-etched, individually numbered Large and hand-numbered Touch Mini Museums to backers of the campaign.\nAfter we finish the batches for our Kickstarter backers, all future Large and Touch Mini Museums will have \"LIMITED EDITION\" printed inside just as we do with the Small.\nMini Museum Age of Dinosaurs - Large (32-Specimens)\nThe Kickstarter version of the Touch will feature ALL 35 specimens in the Age of Dinosaurs Collection.\nThe Touch is a special version of the Mini Museum where all of the specimens are accessible for careful study.  When building the Age of Dinosaurs Touch, we noticed that we could fill all of the slots this time around so that's exactly what we decided to do!\nAll 35 Specimens from Age of Dinosaurs in the Touch!\nKickstarter Backers of the Touch will receive all 35 specimens from the Age of Dinosaurs collection in addition to receiving an individually numbered Certificate of Authenticity. After the campaign, the Touch will feature the same 32 specimens as the Large and will not have an individual number.\nDid you know we send Mini Museums and other items to schools around the world? We do and you can help!\nWe also have a new t-shirt design to support our Educational Donation Program!\nGet a sweet dinosaur t-shirt and help us send Mini Museums to kids around the world!\nThe shirt design features a custom illustration with specimens from the Age of Dinosaurs collection on a black t-shirt. Backers of other tiers will also have the opportunity to add shirts after the campaign.\nAll funds gathered from the t-shirt will be applied to our Educational Donation Program which sends Mini Museums and other specimens to organizations that work with children all over the world. Your support really helps!\nThank you for taking the time to learn more about Age of Dinosaurs!\nI hope you are as excited about it as we are! As always, we are grateful for the opportunity to share such incredible specimens and their stories with the world. Your kindness and enthusiasm is so inspiring! \n- Hans Fex, Creator and Chief Curator of the Mini Museum\nBrief details about each specimen in the collection can be found below, with even more information available on minimuseum.com!\nTHE GREAT DYING - c. 252,280,000 YEARS OLD\n\"Life has often been disturbed on this earth by frightful events.\" ~ Georges Cuvier, Discours sur les r\u00e9volutions de la surface du globe (1822)\nThe Permian-Triassic Extinction Event is the largest extinction event in the history of the planet. The chief catalyst of this extinction event is a series of massive volcanic eruptions known as the Siberian Traps. Over the course of 1,000,000 years, these flood basalt eruptions covered over 7 million square kilometers (2,700,000 square miles). [READ MORE]\nTETHYS OCEAN - HIMALAYAN SHALIGRAM\n\"The folded and crumpled deposits of this ocean stand forth to heaven in Tibet, Himalaya, and the Alps.\" ~ Eduard Suess, Austrian Geologist, \"Are Great Ocean Depths Permanent\" (1893)\nAt the beginning of the Mesozoic Era, the Tethys Ocean was bound by the great Panthalassa Ocean within the cradle of the supercontinent Pangaea. During the Jurassic Period, the shifting continents compressed the Tethys to form an equatorial seaway stretching from today's Caribbean Islands to what is now the Himalayas. [READ MORE]\nTHE BREAKUP OF PANGAEA - c. 200,000,000 YEARS OLD\n\"Our planet is a restless home.\" ~ Sean C. Solomon, Chair NASA Solid Earth Science Working Group\nPangaea existed as a single landmass for approximately 160,000,000 years. The breakup came after a series of powerful rifting events, in which strong pulses of magma forced continental plates apart at the seams, creating new crust and opening up the basin in which the Atlantic Ocean eventually took shape. [READ MORE]\nGONDWANA - ARAUCARIA TREE\n\"Imagine an observer approaching our planet from outer space, and pushing aside the belts of clouds which obscure our atmosphere to simply gaze for a whole day on the surface as it rotates beneath them... The features beyond all others most likely to arrest their attention would be the wedge-like outlines of the continents as they narrow away to the South. This is indeed the most striking character present on the map of our world, and it has been so ever since the chief features of our planet have become known to us.\" ~ Edward Suess, Austrian Geologist and the first to advance the theory of the Gondwana supercontinent in \"The Face of the Earth\" (1885)\nGondwana comprised the southern portion of Pangaea. As Pangaea began to break apart, so too did Gondwana, with the present-day continents of Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia slowly moving in different directions. [READ MORE]\nLAURASIA -  AMMOLITE GEM\n\"Three times during their reign of more than 300 million years, ammonites experimented with the most bizarre and startling shell shapes.\" ~ Wolfgang Grulke, author of \"Heteromorph: The Rarest Fossil Ammonites\"\nLaurasia, like its southern counterpart Gondwana, was part of Pangaea until driven apart by the rifting of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. This event also created the basin for today's Northern Atlantic Ocean. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR EGG - HYPSELOSAURUS\n\"I would go to museums and say can I open your dinosaur egg? Can I just drop them on the floor and look inside? And they'd say no.\" ~ Jack Horner, Paleontologist\nWhen thinking about deep time, we often find ourselves caught up in the nearly unfathomable expanses of millennia stretched end to end. Yet, here in this humble eggshell, we have a single moment captured for all eternity\u2026 the birth of an individual dinosaur. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR FOOTPRINT - GRALLATOR\n\"So strikingly did these tracks resemble those of birds, that they were familiarly spoken of as the tracks of 'poultry,' or of 'Noah's Raven.'\" ~ Edward Hitchock, \"Ichnology of New England\" (1858)\nImagine for a moment that you are standing along a muddy flat shoreline, looking out towards the horizon. The half-light of dawn is just within reach. You are alone here on this shore, but not for long. You hear the soft, wet sounds of feet slapping in the mud. The pace is steady but unhurried. You look through the shadows and there on two legs is a dinosaur! [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR SKIN - HADROSAUR\n\"Most of what is known about dinosaur skin comes from several exceptionally preserved hadrosaurid fossils.\" ~ Matt Davis, Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University\nWhen we think of dinosaur fossils we usually imagine bones and teeth, but fossilized skin and scale impressions have also been discovered, as well as the imprints of feathers. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR FOOD - CYCAD\n\"Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.\" ~ Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, M\u00e9ditations de Gastronomie Transcendante (1826)\nThe palm-like figure of the Cycad is familiar to fans of classic, paleoart paintings. The extensive presence of these gymnosperms in the fossil record presents a complex picture of this long-lived family of seed-bearing plants and their relationship with the largest creatures to ever walk the Earth. [READ MORE]\nDINOSAUR DUNG - COPROLITE\n\"The Mesozoic trend to sauropod gigantism led to the evolution of immense microbial vats unequalled in modern land animals.\" ~ David M.Wilkinson, University of Lincoln\nScientifically speaking, coprolites are fossilized poop. Over millions of years, minerals, such as chalcedony and quartz, replaced the original organic material. This process creates a rich, colorful matrix which allows us to study the diet and lifestyle of long-extinct creatures. [READ MORE]\n\nPLESIOSAUR - PADDLE\n\"Like a sea serpent run through a turtle.\" ~ William Buckland, Oxford University Geology Lectures, 1832\nPlesiosaurs were incredibly successful creatures. Featuring a long, snake-like neck and a stout body equipped with slender paddles, Plesiosaurs are one of the most readily identifiable of all ancient marine reptiles. [READ MORE]\nPLIOSAUR - BONE\n\"Pliosaurs were generalist predators at the top of the food chain, able to prey on reptiles and fishes up to half their own length.\" ~ Dr. Davide Foffa, Vertebrate Paleontologist\nPliosaurs had short necks and large heads with powerful jaws. With some species reaching lengths of 10m (30ft) or more, these apex predators dominated the oceans of their day, hunting a variety of prey including fellow marine reptiles. [READ MORE]\n\nICHTHYOSAUR - VERTEBRA\n\"I by no means consider it wholly a fish, when compared to other fishes, but rather view it in a similar light to those animals met with in New South Wales.\" ~ Sir Everard Home, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (June 23, 1814)\nIchthyosaurs were marine reptiles with streamlined bodies. They were air-breathing creatures with two nostrils situated far back on the top of the head, similar in shape to a modern porpoise. Ichthyosaurs likely fed on fish using their numerous sharp teeth and enormous eyes to locate prey in deep water. [READ MORE]\nMOSASAUR - TOOTH\n\"The Mosasaur used surprise and the thrust of his muscular tail to outrun his prey with a short burst of speed.\" ~ Michael J. Everhart, Oceans of Kansas\nMosasaurs were among the last of the great Mesozoic marine reptile lines. Their skulls were flexible and their jaws double-hinged. While this arrangement allowed a Mosasaur to swallow prey whole, the alignment of a Mosasaur's teeth with \"bony crypts\" to protect emerging teeth also suggests Mosasaurs likely crushed bones and shells as frequently as they tore into flesh. [READ MORE]\nBRACHIOSAURUS - FEMUR\n\"This then was the giraffe among dinosaurs...\" ~ Elmer Riggs (1903)\nBest known for their powerful silhouette, Brachiosaurus roamed western North America during the Late Jurassic. Their long necks reached upwards of 9m (30ft), sloping sharply towards muscular shoulders. [READ MORE]\nDIPLODOCUS - ANKLE\n\"It is pleasing to think that the first residents of Earth to exceed the sound barrier were not humans, but rather diplodocus sauropods.\" ~ Nathan Myhrvold \"Supersonic sauropods? Tail dynamics in the diplodocids.\"\nWith a whip-like tail, Diplodocus was one of the longest dinosaurs, stretching  33m (110ft) from head to tail. Balancing 10-16 metric tons across such a long frame required strong legs with semi-fixed ankles and toes. [READ MORE]\nCRETACEOUS AMBER - WITH INSECT (L) and ROUGH (S) \n\"A window to a unique, highly diverse Mesozoic microbiota worthy of intense exploration.\" ~ Dr. David A. Grimaldi, Curator, \"Fossiliferous Cretaceous Amber from Myanmar (Burma): Its Rediscovery, Biotic Diversity, and Paleontological Significance\"\nAge of Dinosaurs contains two different amber specimens from the Late Cretaceous Period. The Large features a small, polished bead of amber from the Hukawng Valley of Northern Myanmar (Burma) which also includes a small arthropod (insect, arachnid, etc). The Small version contains a fragment of rough amber from the ancient coastal deposits of the Black Creek Formation (North Carolina, USA). [READ MORE]\nATLASAURUS - BONE\n\"The description of new genera and new species of dinosaurs discovered recently in North Africa completely changed the vision we had.\" ~ Dr. Philippe Taquet, \"The Dinosaurs of Maghreb: the History of their Discovery\"\nDiscovered high in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, Atlasaurus was a specialized sauropod genus from the mid-Jurassic. Estimated at about 50ft (15m) long and weighing 15 tons, this sauropod had extremely long limbs paired with a relatively short neck. [READ MORE]\nAPATOSAURUS - BONE \n\"I saw eight of the tail bones in exact position. It was a beautiful sight.\" ~ Earl Douglass (August 17, 1909)\nApatosaurus is one of the best-known of all sauropods. In the public mind, this popularity is due to early confusion that led to the skulls of other sauropods being mounted on their skeletons under the name of Brontosaurus. [READ MORE]\nIGUANODON - BONE \n\"There was a period when the earth was peopled by oviparous quadrupeds of a most appalling magnitude.\" ~ Dr. Gideon Mantell, \"The Geological Age of Reptiles\" (1831)\nIguanodons were prolific herbivores spanning the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous Periods. These dinosaurs had a horny beak whose superficial resemblance resulted in their name (\"iguana tooth\"). [READ MORE]\nSTEGOSAURUS - PLATE\n\"A five-ton ballet dancer with an armor-plated tutu of flipping bony triangles and a swinging war club.\" ~ Robert T. Bakker, The Dinosaur Heresies\nThe plates and spikes of Stegosaurus are called osteoderms, bony deposits that form in the skin rather than growing as extensions of the skeleton. Lacking an anchor to the skeleton, some scientists believe that Stegosaurus's plates would provide limited mechanical protection. [READ MORE]\nTRICERATOPS -  BROW HORN\n\"The horns also had a real role in physical combat.\" ~ Andrew A. Farke, Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology \"Evidence of Combat in Triceratops\"\nTriceratops measured 29ft (9m) long and 10ft (3m) tall, with the head comprising nearly one-third the overall length. Studies of the incidence of lesions in the cranium and frill suggest that the Triceratops used its horns in combat and the frill was an adaptation for protection. [READ MORE]\nANKYLOSAURUS - ARMOR\n\"The armor are bones that form within the skin, just like crocodiles.\" ~ Ken Carpenter, Director USU Eastern Prehistoric Museum\nCovered in rows of bony plates and wielding a powerful clubbed tail, the Ankylosaurs are one of the most distinctive and successful of all dinosaur families. Various species of this sturdy dinosaur can be found on every continent on earth. [READ MORE]\n\nPACHYCEPHALOSAURUS -  DOME\n\"The domes could withstand considerable impact force at certain closing speeds.\" ~ Eric Snively and Andrew Cox \"Structural mechanics of pachycephalosaur crania permitted head-butting behavior.\"\nInstantly recognizable by their massive frontoparietal domes, Pachycephalosaurs were a group of bipedal dinosaurs that roamed the Late Cretaceous Period. [READ MORE]\nHADROSAUR - BONE\n\"Hadrosaurs grew rapidly, and quantifying their growth is key to understanding life-history interactions between predators and prey during the Late Cretaceous.\" ~ Lisa Noelle Cooper, \"Relative growth rates of predator and prey dinosaurs reflect effects of predation.\"\nHadrosaurs were a large family of ornithischian dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period. Related to Iguanodons, they are known primarily for their \"duck-bills\" which are in fact elongated rostral bone structures which give the appearance of a beak. [READ MORE]\nPTEROSAUR - WING BONE\n\"One of these strange animals, whose appearance would be frightful did they occur alive at the present day, may have been of the size of a thrush.\" ~ Georges Cuvier Th\u00e9orie de la terre (1821)\nSpanning more than 160 million years across the fossil record, Pterosaurs were a diverse group of flying reptiles that dominated the skies of the Mesozoic Era. [READ MORE]\nALLOSAURUS - VERTEBRA \n\"This genus may be distinguished from any known Dinosaurs by the vertebrae, which are peculiarly modified to ensure lightness.\" ~ Othniel Charles Marsh (1877)\nAllosaurus was one of the most dominant predators of the Late Jurassic Period. This large theropod is known for its powerful, three-fingered forelimbs, wide gape, and iconic \"hornlets\" over the eyes. [READ MORE]\nSPINOSAURUS - SPINE  (L) and TOOTH (S) \n\"Spinosaurus appears to have been poorly adapted to bipedal terrestrial locomotion.\" ~ Dr. Nizar Ibrahim, \"Semiaquatic Adaptations in a Giant Predatory Dinosaur.\"\nTopping out at just over 59ft long (18m), Spinosaurus is one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs ever discovered. Age of Dinosaurs contains two different Spinosaurus specimens. The Large features a fragment of a Spinosaurus vertebra which includes the neural spines. The Small includes a fragment of a Spinosaurus tooth. [READ MORE]\nRAPTOR - DROMAEOSAURID BONE\n\"You bred raptors?\" ~ Dr. Alan Grant, Jurassic Park\nKnown popularly as \"raptors,\" dromaeosaurids were a diverse family of feathered theropod dinosaurs. Like birds, dromaeosaurids had a global distribution and varied widely in size, from smaller than a modern-day chicken to large, powerful predators measuring more than 18ft (6m) in length from tooth-to-tail. [READ MORE]\nTYRANNOSAURUS REX - TOOTH (L) and VERTEBRA (S)\n\"We need to start thinking of dinosaurs as not just brutes and not just monsters, and not just things with sharp teeth and sharp claws, but as really active, intelligent, energetic animals.\" ~ Dr. Steve Brusatte (2018)\nMeasuring 40ft (12m) in length and weighing upwards of 14 tons, Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest and most powerful terrestrial predators in history. Age of Dinosaurs contains two different T. rex specimens. The Large features a fragment of a T. rex tooth, and the Small version contains a fragment of a T. rex vertebra. [READ MORE]\nDEATH OF THE DINOSAURS - DECCAN TRAPS and K-PG BOUNDARY\n\"The species extinctions prior to the generally assumed impact event implied by the Ir anomaly, and the long recovery period of the ecosystem thereafter cannot be explained by a single impact, but suggest that multiple causes may be responsible such as climatic changes, volcanism, a sea level drop, production of warm saline bottom water and the chemical consequences associated with increased salinity.\" ~ Dr. Gerta Keller, Princeton University (1988)\n\"Impact of a large earth-crossing asteroid would inject about 60 times the object's mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock; a fraction of this dust would stay in the stratosphere for several years and be distributed worldwide. The resulting darkness would suppress photosynthesis, and the expected biological consequences match quite closely the extinctions observed in the paleontological record.\" ~ Dr. Luis Alvarez and Dr. Walter Alvarez (1980)\nThe large-scale geological event known as the End-Cretaceous Mass Extinction had a profound influence on life on our planet. Three-quarters of all life perished in a geological instant, including all non-avian dinosaur species.\nWe mark the end of the Mesozoic Era with the physical evidence behind the two leading theories for the death of the dinosaurs: the flood basalts of the Indian Subcontinent known as the Deccan Traps and the K-Pg Boundary from the Chicxulub Asteroid Impact.

Carrying that load comes with a cost, and very little if any reward that I can see.

The updates will come when there's an update to give. I'm pretty sure there's nothing Jason and P&P would love more than to have this game on the market generating more revenue.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself. I've learned a lot from my experiences and from others in the business. The risk could be that I missed something or forgot about something, but that should really only affect me and not you. There could be delays to final delivery based on things I'm not aware of, but I tried to even buffer the delivery date with some extra time to allow for that.\nSo other than that, I'm hoping there are minimal risks!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Show support and stay informed", "descp": "Pledge any amount to join in the conversation in the comments, to stay informed on the project, or just to show your support.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["37 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 13 or more", "title": "Unlimited copies: PDF version", "descp": "A PDF version of the entire journal where you can print as many as you'd like!

Players race to reap the benefits of strategic colonies: Crete for fleets; Spain for mining; Carthage for wheat; Gaul for armies.

Sold to the highest bidder! Bid and bluff your way to purchase the most valuable real estate for the lowest amount of money, then turn around and sell those houses (and shacks and space stations) for cold hard cash.

Each turn, a card is turned over that increases the gold found in a temple or shows a hazard. Players can attempt to escape, keeping the loot that they've acquired, or stay in the temple, hoping for increased profits. As players escape, those in the temple will acquire bigger shares of each pile of gold found, but also run the risk of dying if the same hazard card is drawn twice. Up to eight people can play this game, so it works very well at parties and other gatherings, as players decide whether or not to stay or leave the temples. With quality components and a compelling theme, Incan Gold will be the first choice of large groups looking for a fun filled game.  \n Cornucopia $19 (msrp $26) -  Its Harvest Time! In Cornucopia, your goal is to fill your basket with a bountiful collection of fruits and vegetables while at the same time correctly predicting how long it will take you to fill your basket.

In either case, you want to complete your harvest as efficiently as possible to earn the most coins. Players can bet and win more coins by correctly predicting the outcome (success or failure) of their opponents\u2019 efforts to assemble their harvest, so players stay involved and engaged in the game even when it is not their turn!  \n Botswana $19 (msrp $26) -  On safari in Botswana, you might be able to spot lions, rhinos, elephants, leopards, and zebras, but in this game, you will spot them for sure! But can you guess which ones will be worth the most at the end of this safari? Play the right cards at the right time, collect the best animals, score the most points and win the game.

The remainder of this gem deck \u2013 with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors \u2013 is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing; and your challenge of course is to identify the one gem that is missing.\n Mus\u00e9e $19 (msrp $26) -  In this fast-paced card game, you collect impossibly valuable works of art and put them on display in your own personal art museum, the Mus\u00e9e.

Each gallery must be organized properly by exhibit number, but to succeed you must balance your passion for order with the need for public acclaim. \n XENON Profiteer $24 (msrp $30) - XENON Profiteer employs an innovative deck-deconstruction mechanism from designer T.C.

Following the amazing success of VPG's game set in the world of Jules Verne\u2019s 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, the first expansion pack, the Nautilus Upgrades, refit a tremendous number of games. Now, your Nemo\u2019s War team is going full steam ahead with two new expansions to enhance your adventures!\nThe second expansion pack for Nemo's War, Bold and Caring, features two new motives for Captain Nemo: Adventure and Humanist! As experienced players know, each motive is like playing a different game!\nAnswering the call to adventure, each Lull Turn provides 2 Actions and places one of the new Adventure tokens in the just-rolled \u201cdoubles\u201d Ocean. When the Nautilus performs a successful Search Action at that Ocean, you reveal and place its Adventure token. You can then go questing for that adventure and try to earn the big rewards it offers.\nWith the Adventure motive, you can also commence play with a new Nautilus Upgrade card: Diving Apparatus which assists you with all Test rolls for which you spend 2 Actions and helps keeps the Adventure Deck stocked with gemstones.\nThe Humanist motive sees Captain Nemo desiring to better the plight of the common people. Potentially starting with the Hospital Machines Upgrade card, it allows the Captain to parley with ships at sea using \u201cDiplomacy Attacks.\u201d\nAlthough Notoriety gains are a big problem, successful diplomacy allows you three courses of action: Further Diplomatic Relations, Create a Diplomatic Incident, or Gather Support for Your Good Intentions. Incitement cubes become \u201cGoodwill cubes,\" and the more nations that you parley with, the higher bonus score you can earn!\nThe third expansion pack, Dramatis Personae, provides your game with a neat stack of ten additional cards: nine new Adventure cards and one intriguing new Finale card.\nAmong the new adventures, you will learn more about your familiar crew characters, and meet interesting new characters via five new Keep cards, allowing them to assist you with their talents. Balancing out the benefits of these helpful cards are new Play and Test Adventure cards that will keep you riveted.\nAs for the Finale, we have naturally saved that for last:\nSet in the year 1870 of Jules Verne\u2019s classic novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, you assume the role of Captain Nemo and set sail in his amazing electric-powered submarine, the Nautilus.\nNemo\u2019s War is a single-player board game of underwater exploration and combat. You will search the oceans, combat vessels of all nations, brave the hazards of the seas, find mysterious treasures, behold and chronicle amazing wonders, and travel around the world in your quest for knowledge and vengeance.\nThis second edition of Victory Point Games' popular solitaire game from designer Chris Taylor is a greatly enhanced offering, featuring mass-production printing and amazing Ian O'Toole art and graphics throughout.\nDecision-rich, narrative-enhanced solitaire gameplay\nFour Nemo Motive objectives, three levels of difficulty, plus other gameplay options\nChannel your \"inner Nemo\" in an immersive strategy role-playing experience\nGreat references and quotations from 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas by Jules Verne throughout\nYou can take a look at the Nemo's War rulebook here!\nYou can also watch Alan Emrich give a demo of Nemo's War to Rob of Rob's Tabletop World here:\nBold and Caring Expansion Pack:\n2 Nautilus Upgrade Cards (Diving Apparatus and Hospital Machines)\n1 New Motive Tile: Adventure / Humanist\n2 New Treasure Tokens\n1 Diplomatic Attack Token\n9 Adventure Tokens\n1 Rules Sheet\nDramatis Personae Expansion Pack:\n9 New Adventure Cards\n1 New Finale Card\n1 Rules Sheet\nNautilus Upgrades Expansion Pack:  \n12 Nautilus Upgrade Cards\n1 Rules Sheet\nNemo's War Base Game Components:\n1 Game box \n1 Rulebook (available for download here) \n1 Epilogues booklet \n1 17\u201d x 33\u201d game board \n62 Adventure cards \n10 Nautilus Upgrade cards \n6 Character Resource tiles, 2 Motive tiles, and 1 Captain tile \n220 tokens and markers (ships, gemstones, etc.) \n12 Uprising cubes (10 black wood, 2 silver) \n5 dice (3 white and 2 black) \n1 Nautilus miniature\n9 Co-op game Officer cards\nCaptain Nemo\u2019s four different motives determine the type of adventure you shall have, and rewards you accordingly by varying the victory points awarded for the game's different tasks. Your motive also determines how much notoriety you can gain before being defeated as an international pariah.\nAdventure cards come in three basic varieties: Play, which are immediate occurrences that you must deal with; Keep, which are opportunities for you to take advantage of later, if you desire; and Test, which are obstacles and adventures that you must overcome, gaining their reward or suffering the penalty for failure.\nNautilus Upgrade cards represent different ways that you can customize the Nautilus on its voyage. These are available for purchase by spending the salvaged remains of ships you have bested in combat at sea. Depending on Nemo\u2019s motive for the game, some of these upgrades can be particularly useful in your quest!\nThe Character resources aboard your ship are worth considerable points, but sacrificing them to reverse an emergency situation might be a better strategy. Each of these supporting heroes can play their part only once, so carefully consider that before asking them to make their ultimate sacrifice.\nThe Ship tokens are each individually illustrated and represent historical ships at sea during the Age of Nemo (with a few interesting inclusions pictured here). Their attack and defense values are the large numbers flanking their names. Sending most of them to Davy Jones' Locker will increase your notoriety, but their yield in victory points and useful salvage for upgrades makes every ship at sea a target.\nPlease note! If you want multiple copies of Nemo's War or the expansion packs, they will be available in a pledge manager after the campaign has been completed.\nShipping will be paid through Kickstarter. When you select your pledge level, it will let you know your cost for shipping. Please note that we are absorbing some of the shipping and handling cost to keep that reasonable for you. We are shipping from multiple depots around the world so this campaign is Customs Friendly for folks in the US, Canada, UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.\nBulk Orders\nAnyone who would like to place a bulk order, such as retailers or distributors, should contact us directly at James@HitPointSales.com.\nThe following licensors have partnered with us and will be publishing Nemo's War: Second Edition:\nFrosted Games German language version: Preorder here\nMaldito Games Spanish language version: Preorder here\nNote that these publishers will have their own terms of service.\nReplacements  \nWe are always happy to replace defective or damaged dice, cards, or other components. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you. \nKickstarter Refunds\nIf you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping the unopened item back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\nShipping Policy\nPlease be precise when entering your shipping address! If your address is entered incorrectly and your package is delivered to the wrong address or returned to us a result, you will be responsible for paying postage for a reshipment. If you\u2019re not present to receive the package for a reason like being on vacation, having the wrong address, or have moved and you haven\u2019t notified us beforehand, you\u2019ll be responsible for paying the postage for a reshipment. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, GST, or other duties or taxes. We recommend checking the campaign's FAQ section on Kickstarter to see if your country is customs friendly or not.\nPledge Manager Policy\nAs we get closer to delivery, we will post an update here announcing an official closing deadline for the pledge manager. If you do not fill out your pledge manager by the deadline, we cannot guarantee that your shipment will be customs friendly and your shipment may be delayed. There is an additional 60-day grace period after the deadline where you can contact us to complete your pledge manager. If we still have not heard from you by that point, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill your reward and you may be issued a coupon code in lieu of a reward. If you do not think you will be able to complete the pledge manager by the deadline or the following grace period, please contact us beforehand so we can make arrangements for you.\nCommunity\nWhen this campaign concludes, we'll invite you to join our Crimson Courier and Life and Times newsletters. If you do not wish to join, no worries \u2013 just ignore the invite. If you're already on the list with the email you use in Kickstarter, you will not receive another invite.

While I can just toss them an an open area, that defeats the point of having specific sections for each group, plus there is plenty of room still to have widened the area to have enough space. Additionally the is no slots for the deadly sea ships. Since you were designing the insert from scratch and should have known about what tokens the game already had, you would have added a specific section for them. It feels like someone just threw it together with out any real plan or actually checking that everything actually fit. While usable, it is definitely not what I was sold. Additionally all the adventure cards in the expansion are a different color than the base game and are fairly noticeable where they are in the deck.

Dependent on final discussions with manufacturer.\nA thematic Roll and Write with DINOSAURS!\nPaths let people explore your park. Dinosaur enclosures are the main attractions! Enclosures need generators to keep them electrified and your visitors safe.\n\nAt the core of the game is a fun story of building a great dinosaur park!\nRacing for Visitor Cards adds tension and interactivity\nWhen playing with 9 or fewer players, you will compete for a different set of Visitor Cards with each of your neighbours. Which ones will you prioritise? Keep a close eye on what your opponents are doing, so they don't grab the visitors before you!\nDANGER MODE adds even more tension\nIn Danger Mode, the dinosaurs are trying to break out! You need to not only worry about spatial planning but also about the security levels and how much stress you place on each generator, as you try to keep the fences electrified and stop the dinosaurs from escaping!\nLIGHT MODE is an introduction, with meaty decisions\nWe strongly recommend everyone play Light Mode first. Not only is it a relatively simple introduction to the game, but there is already plenty to think consider. With 27 visitor cards to compete over, and 6 different special buildings, there's a lot of replayability.\nMillions of possible setups!\nWith a whole variety of Visitor Cards, Labs and Special Buildings, there are millions of setups for Danger Mode! Each time you play, you'll have to consider a new set of abilities and ways to score.\nPlayable with 150 players!!!***\nBy using a central pool of visitor cards, Light Mode can be played with a ridiculous number of players! Theoretically, you could use the 150 sheets of paper included to run a massive event at a convention!\nOr, if that's not enough, use 2 boxes for 300 players.\n*** - Final number depends on the arrangement with the manufacturer as it may be 150 double sided sheets (light vs danger mode) or two 75 sheet pads of paper for each mode.\nA complex spatial puzzle \nEvery square of your park is a valuable resource. Enclosures must be accessible to visitors. Each path you build should lead directly somewhere. Generators can be cleverly used for multiple enclosures! Special buildings make you think even more carefully about where your pens are. Every placement is critical!\nROLL the dice\nUse each die to draw one of 3 things: paths, a special building, or a dinosaur pen!\nPaths let you connect everything together. In DinoWorld, rather than using whole dice values, you use the pips. So to draw two straights and a T you need two pips for the straights, and another two pips for the T!\nSpecial buildings are different each game and offer you different ways to score!\nDinosaur pens are one of the main way you get points! Draw your fences, make sure you have the required number of generator connections, and then simply draw in your dinosaur! You just need to make sure you have a path leading into each of your new dinosaurs by the end of each round.\nAt the end of each turn, check if you've managed to complete any of the visitor cards next to you! If you have, you take those cards! You'll score them at the end of the game, and you've just denied points to your neighbour!\nThat's it! Ater 9 turns, the game is over. Hopefully, you'll have drawn a beautiful park where visitors can go to see exciting dinosaur clones!\nIn danger mode, the dinosaurs might break free! This time introducing a damage tracker, and a power outage phase.\nFor each dinosaur pen you build, the risk increases. Herbivores increase your threat by one, carnivores are doubly risky!\nYou can use security to mitigate the danger, but risky play (not using security) does have potential reward...\nAt the end of each round, roll the danger dice! Add your threat level, subtract your security and see if any pens are straining the generators too much! If they are, the pens will be damaged and be closer to a break-out!\nDanger mode also adds a variety of public use laboratories, which will give you different ways to mitigate the rules each game, for a limited use per type of lab.\nIn the deluxe and expanded edition of the game, it contains 2 new mini expansions and cards for an automa.\nNotably, this edition will not be available for general retail until 6 months after copies have been sent to backers! We will however may still sell it directly at conventions such as GenCon, UKGE and Essen and our own website.\nAquatic expansion\nFirst, we have the aquatic expansion (3 cards), which lets you fill that lake! The aquatic expansion has fixed numbers for the dinosaurs which are randomised at the beginning of each game. Each card dictates which dice spread is required to build a certain dinosaurs, so some cards may only allow one type of dinosaur to be built with one type of value on the dice, while other cards will allow an even spread of dice for all dinosaurs. \nThese dinosaurs are scored using a set collection mechanic, with the same, and different dinosaurs scoring (almost) exponentially.\nAviary expansions\nNext, we have the aviaries! Choose from a wide selection of awkward and fixed shapes that you will play with each game. Flying dinosaurs breed, so place them early enough that they can be filled! (Final card count 15-20 depending on final playtesting during the campaign)\nAutoma deck for solo players\nThe 1p Automa lets you play solitaire in a brand new way, making some binary decisions for an AI that competes with you for visitors and points. More details below....\nHow does the automa play?\nDesigned by automa creation specialist: David Turczi and further refined by Nick Shaw, you will play against a \"normal\" or \"hard\" automa. The automa has it's own deck with 16 double use cards. 12 can be used with the core game, while 4 can be added if used in conjunction with the aviary and aquatic expansions. The automa also uses an extra die so that each round you will be rolling 4 dice, allocating one to the automa, and the final 3 to yourself. \nHow does it work?\nThe automa will have one card drawn from the automa deck at the beginning of each turn. The card will be double use, with each side giving instructions of what the automa would do (and therefore score), if you choose that side. The side you choose will be dependent on the die you allocate to the automa - hence starving yourself of a particular value, and potentially gifting the automa valuable points if allocated without careful consideration.\nHow does it score?\nThe automa scores by using a set collection mechanic of units written on the cards themselves such as special buildings, dinosaurs and in hard mode, the security and generators. The trick is to allocate a die to the automa with careful consideration!\nA german version of the rulebook has been translated, while a french one is in the works. We hope to offer multiple languages through the Boardgamegeek page soon\n *The deluxe edition will not be available for retail purchase for 6 months after backers get their copies. We will however allow late pledges to allow those late to the party, to get this edition, right until we start shipping them out. So if most backers have received their copies in June, the deluxe edition will only be available the following January. Please note, Retailers who back this campaign directly, will also be treated as kickstarter backers - so there may be a small number of retailers who sell the deluxe version of the game.\nTo save on shipping costs you can order our popular and previous games: \nRuthless - a pirate themed deckbuilding game (\u00a323/$29)\nPocket Pharma - a pharmaceutical themed drafting game (\u00a321/$27)\nPocket Sub - an abstract strategy game of nautical warfare (\u00a316/$21)\nTo add these on, please use our pledge manager when it opens\nThe Pocket games mentioned above are the deluxe editions\nDice Hospital may be available in the future as an add-on, but will be available soon through all good FLGS's. \nAdditionally, we are likely to offer extra pads for people to purchase, again in the pledge manager. We think it'll be around \u00a36-8 if purchased along with a game through kickstarter/pledge manager. \nPlay along with Tom Heath by using the basic print and play files we've supplied!\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 10 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates. \nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment, so we can offer shipping within UK/USA at no additional cost!\n\nCosts elsewhere are shown in the approximate local currency. To double check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the tier and select your country. \nDue to previous shipping issues we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia). \nWe do not charge additional shipping after the kickstarter! You will not have to pay anything more!\nTransparency guarantee\nWith every game we have kickstarted, we kept backers informed of all the problems, issues, and - of course - good news as we get the games finished, manufactured and sent to your door. This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we try to do an update twice a week during a campaign, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over.\nGet it before retail\nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time or even early! Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we are in turn delaying the retail launch to put our backers first. Backers are always our priority. \nWorld class manufacturing\nFor this project, we are considering Longpack, who we have worked with several times in the past. We are also considering established Polish manufacturers (Trefl and Axel), who might be able to print and deliver the game in only 6 weeks. Ultimately, it will depend on the exact number of backers, and how many we print.\nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via Royal Mail. If Brexit has happened before the games are ready to be shipped, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\nmid-December: Submit Files to manufacturer \nJanuary: Manufacturing\nFebruary: Chinese New Year\nearly-mid March: Shipping from China to the UK begins\nMid-late April: Arrives in ports\nEarly May: Fulfilment commences \nlate May: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies. \nIf we do decide to use a Polish manufacturer, our timeline will be as follows:\nDecember: extra time for tweaks\nJanuary: Submit Files to manufacturer \nearly February: Manufacturing  \nearly March: Shipping from Poland to the UK \nmid-March: Fulfilment commences \nlate March: EU Fulfilment completed. \nearly May: fulfilment completed.

We\u2019ve created two new designs for our original 8 inch-Tentacle Kitty, as well as new plushies for some of the most iconic characters from the Tentacle Kitty comic. All of which you can proudly display, or cuddle, or cuddle and display. \nWhat is Tentacle Kitty? Tentacle Kitty is a kitty from another dimension. She just happens to have tentacles. She also has her own webcomic about her interdimensional adventures, which you can read here:\nTentacle Kitty Webcomic  \nWhat is special about our plushies? Some artists paint on canvas, others sculpt in clay. We create art through our plush. Not only are every one of our plushies a Limited Edition work of art, but they are also high quality and huggably soft. We like to call it art you can hug.\nWe\u2019ve pushed ourselves to create more epic designs year after year, and this newest Kickstarter is our most incredible yet. We hope you love our new plushies as much as we do.\n~Love John and Rae\nIt\u2019s easy! To get the plush, simply back the project and pick your reward. By backing, you pre-order First Edition Tentacle Kitty plush for a special, backer-exclusive price, and you will be able to choose goodies that are exclusively for this Kickstarter.\nWant additional plush or goodies? Check our ADD-ONS section at the bottom of the page to customize your reward. If you have any questions, head over to the FAQ.\nTentacle Kitty and her friends travel from dimension to dimension. Over time they have run into some rather interesting things. We would like to create some of those interesting things in plush form! Let\u2019s take a look at them, shall we?\nOh. Did I mention that the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth on the Cat-O-Lantern GLOW IN THE DARK?! Cuz they do.\nBoth kitties were created during our previous Kickstarters with the \u201cDesign Your Own TK Plush\u201d reward tier. They were so popular that we decided we\u2019d like to take them to production.\nWith a little begging, we were given the go-ahead from the backers who originally commissioned them. Now you will be able to get one, too!\n*Exclusive Backer Pricing $30 during the Kickstarter, will be $35 after.\n\n*Tentacle Kitty stands 8\" tall, 13\" from tip of ear to tip of the tentacle.\nTentacle Kitty\u2019s favorite food.  \nComes in three delicious colors. (Delicious to Tentacle Kitty, of course.) \nSmell like Cotton Candy. (Unscented version available.)\nWhen startled Cotton Candy Mice freeze and stiffen up, and look exactly like cotton candy on a stick.\nTentacle Kitty likes to pop them in her mouth, swish, and pop them right back out once their \u201cfloss\u201d (fur) dissolves. The mouse scampers off unharmed in its skivvies, leaving a happy Tentacle Kitty behind.\nWe are not responsible for any zombie outbreaks that may occur as a result of Cotton Candy Mice infestation. Also, even though these smell delicious, please do not eat them.\n*Cotton Candy Mice are 5\" long from nose to the tip of the tail.\nTentacle Kitty's grandpa, Cat Guru, came to Earth long ago but got horrible allergies. When he said his name it came out as \u201cCthulhu!\u201d... It was a HUGE misunderstanding.\n*Exclusive Backer Pricing: $45 during the campaign, will be $50 after.\n\n*From tip of ear to tip of longest Tentacle, Cat Guru is 28\" long.\nFabulous and Glorious\nRat Tailed Unicorns are interdimensional vermin.

We\u2019ve made it our mission to design original, high-quality, designer plushies since 2011. In the process, we have become one of the most popular indie plush brands at pop-culture conventions around the country.\nOur plush popularity has not gone unnoticed. We\u2019ve been commissioned to create exclusive designs for several conventions, including Emerald City Comic Con 2015, Emerald City Comic Con 2018, Denver Comic Con, Comicpalooza, and now New York Comic Con.\nWe have also worked with Dark Horse Comics to create a 96-page coloring book. Check it out here: Tentacle Kitty Coloring Book\nNote from John:\nWhen I created Tentacle Kitty for Rae, I had no clue that it would wind up being my career. Seven years in and I don\u2019t regret choosing this path. What keeps me going is the look on Rae\u2019s face when she cuddles a Tentacle Kitty, laughs at a comic, or lights up when I make something new.\nOn top of that, seeing all the fans of Tentacle Kitty, and those who are not yet fans, squee in excitement from seeing her at conventions\u2014it makes everything that much more satisfying. I especially enjoy the criers. I watch as they are overwhelmed by the pure cuteness of Tentacle Kitty and her friends. It's fun.\nAnyway, thanks for joining us on our continued adventures with Tentacle Kitty. I hope that we can brighten your life with TK, just as much as it has brightened ours.\nLove, John\nNote from Raena:\nI never thought that I would grow up to make plushies. As a child, it would have easily been one of my top three dream jobs, but as an adult? I never imagined it would be my destiny.\nWhen I was a kiddo, I had a HUMONGOUS collection of stuffed animals. I remember my mom keeping them in a refrigerator box, and one of my greatest joys was tipping it over and watching them tumble out, creating a mountain of colors and cuddliness. I would build a fortress out of them, complete with a protective wall, and act out all types of stories.\nAs I grew older, I gifted many of my beloved plushies to the people whom I loved the most. It was like giving them a piece of myself, and to this day I still feel that happiness in my heart when I think about it.\nWhen John created the illustrated version of Tentacle Kitty for me as a gift, I knew that I needed it in a plush. Thanks to ThinkGeek and family, we were able to make that dream a reality. Thanks to all of you, we have been able to grow and expand on that original design.\nSince John created Tentacle Kitty, we have built a world for her, including other characters and a story. I can honestly say I am living my truth, and I am excited to share it with you.\nLove, Rae\n Special Thanks: Jennifer, Kaelley, Stephen, Vikki, Natalie, and our Patrons!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere at Tentacle Kitty, we have been producing plushies for more than six years. We are confident in what we have designed, as they have had lots of real world hugging... errrr, \u201ctesting.\u201d\n\nThe two main risks for this Kickstarter are unexpected delays in manufacturing or shipping. With a project of this size, customs can sometimes also cause delays in shipping. If the project is highly successful, materials could also take longer for our manufacturer to obtain, although larger orders usually mean faster production. Overseas holidays can also cause a delay in either shipping or manufacturing.\n\nHowever, we have completed 2 successful Kickstarters and are working with established manufacturers with whom we have worked many times, so we anticipate a smooth roll out. \n\nIn any case, we will always keep everyone updated with all stages of production and shipping. \n\nWe are also always available through Facebook (www.facebook.com/TentacleKitty), and Twitter (@TentacleKitty).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Little One Mystery Bag Series 1", "descp": "What's inside?

In terms of costs it would only be a large sheet, same size as the manual, possibly folding to accomodate more, or even better a nice cardboard one like the quick rules included with the game.

We are made of starstuff.\" ~ Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980\nEach year nearly 40,000,000 kilograms (88.1 million pounds) of meteoritic material rains down on the Earth. Less than 1% holds traces of organic compounds, and within this tiny subset scientists sometimes come across even rarer material... amino acids, the building blocks of life. The oldest of these meteorites, carbonaceous chondrites, date to the formation of the solar system.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is composed of two special carbonaceous chondrites: Murchison and Jbilet Winselwan. Both of these meteorites are CM2 class carbonaceous chondrites, a class known to contain the highest density of amino acids.\n02. LUNAR HIGHLANDS (c. 3,200,000,000 years old)\n\"You develop an instant global consciousness... You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, 'Look at that, you son of a bitch.\" ~ Edgar D. Mitchell, Apollo 14 Astronaut\nIt might be hard to imagine volcanoes on the Moon, but the evidence of an active volcanic past covers our neighbor's cratered surface. The highlands of the Moon are the white areas we can see with the naked eye here on Earth. These regions are dominated by a range of intrusive igneous rocks which form as large plumes of magma cool and crystallize within the crust. The dark areas which are called maria (latin for seas) are basalts created during volcanic floods on the surface.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a handcrafted \"moon\" composed of fine-grained dust extracted from the NWA 5000 lunar meteorite - one of the largest lunar meteorites ever found.\n03. COPPER CRYSTALS (c. 300,000,000 years old)\n\"\u2026 I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality.\" ~ Ea-Nasir, Babylonian Merchant, 1750 BCE\nThe intricate lattice of native copper crystals reveals a story of deep geological processes lasting hundreds of millions of years. Stronger than gold but still soft enough to be shaped easily into tools, weapons, and decorative objects, this form of copper also played an important role in the development of human cultures across the globe as they stepped out of the Stone Age and into the Age of Metals.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from native copper deposits located near the city of Zhezqazghan, Kazakhstan. The earliest copper mining in this region dates back many thousands of years, crossing numerous cultures, with extensive trade routes into the ancient world.\n04. THE GREAT DYING (c. 292,000,000 years old)\nLife has often been disturbed on this earth by frightful events.\" ~ Georges Cuvier, Discours sur les r\u00e9volutions de la surface du globe, 1822\nKnown as \"The Great Dying,\" the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event is the largest extinction event in the history of the planet. The chief catalyst of this extinction event was a series of massive volcanic eruptions known as the Siberian Traps. Over the course of 1,000,000 years, these flood basalt eruptions covered over 7 million square kilometers (2,700,000 square miles). Massive carbon dioxide and methane releases caused runaway global warming, killing nearly 95% of life on Earth.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a basalt slab from the Kuznetsk Basin in southwestern Siberia. The Kuznetsk Basin is also home to one of the largest coal deposits on earth, a remnant of the global destruction caused by the Siberian Traps.\n05. PANGEA (c. 200,000,000 years old)\n\"Our planet is a restless home.\" ~ Sean C. Solomon, Chair NASA Solid Earth Science Working Group, 2002\nDriven by heat from the Earth's core, convection currents churn the solid silicates of the mantle, pushing and pulling the thin plates of crust, bringing continents together and tearing them apart in cycles which can last for hundreds of millions of years. Clusters of continents are known as supercontinents; the most famous of which is Pangea. The breakup of Pangea came after a series of powerful rifting events, in which strong pulses of magma forced continental plates apart at the seams, creating new crust and opening up the basin in which the Atlantic Ocean eventually took shape.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a polished diabase fragment from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province deposits of Eastern North America. The source rock was donated by the Luck Stone Quarry adjacent to the Manassas U.S. Civil War battlefield in Northern Virginia. The quarry is a magnificent location where it is possible to clearly see one of the rift valleys which tore through the ancient supercontinent and might once have become the Atlantic Ocean.\n06. DINOSAUR FOOD (Cycad)\n\"Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.\" ~ Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, M\u00e9ditations de Gastronomie Transcendante, 1826\nThe palm-like figure of the Cycad is familiar to fans of classic, paleoart paintings. The extensive presence of these gymnosperms in the fossil record led many early researchers to think of Cycads simply as \"dinosaur food,\" but the current thinking presents a more complex picture of this long-lived family of seed-bearing plants and their relationship with the largest creatures to ever walk the Earth.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a fossilized Cycad husk recovered on private land in Wyoming. Part of the Lance formation, this find dates to the Late Cretaceous Period, roughly 67,000,000 years ago\n07. PLESIOSAUR (Paddle)\n\"Like a sea serpent run through a turtle.\" ~ William Buckland, Oxford University Geology Lectures, 1832\nFeaturing a long, snake-like neck and a stout body equipped with slender paddles, Plesiosaurs are one of the most readily identifiable of all ancient marine reptiles. Biomechanical reconstructions suggest that Plesiosaurs moved through the water in the same way that turtles or penguins do, more like flying than swimming.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the paddles of two different Plesiosaurs, both recovered on private land but separated by vast distance in both time and location. The first specimen comes from the Lower Oxford Clay in Cambridgeshire, England dating to the Middle Jurassic Period, while the second comes from the Morrison Formation of Utah and dates to the Cretaceous Period.\n08. RAPTOR (Dromaeosaurid Bone)\n\"You bred raptors?\" ~ Dr. Alan Grant, Jurassic Park\nKnown popularly as \"raptors\", dromaeosaurids were a diverse family of feathered theropod dinosaurs. Dromaeosaurids also had long tails and an elongated \"sickle claw\" on the second toe. While this distinctive body plan suggests a link to birds, scientists are still unclear on the exact connection, though there is some evidence that smaller species could at least glide.\nThe specimen used in the Mini Museum was selected from several species recovered in both Morocco and North America. Like birds, dromaeosaurids had a global distribution and varied widely in size from smaller than a modern day chicken to large, powerful predators measuring more than 18ft (6m) in length from tooth-to-tail.\n09. MEGA CROC (Sarcosuchus Armor)\n\"How cheerfully he seems to grin / How neatly spreads his claws / And welcomes little fishes in / With gently smiling jaws!\" ~ Lewis Carroll, The Crocodile, 1865\nSarcosuchus was an enormous, crocodile-like, aquatic reptile that dominated freshwater rivers and lakes of the Middle Jurassic Period through the Early Cretaceous Period. With the largest species reaching nearly 40 feet in length (11-12 meters) and weighing close to 8 metric tons, Sarcosuchus feasted on a wide range of prey, from fish to land-dwelling dinosaurs.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment from a Sarcosuchus scute (dermal armor) recovered from the El Rhaz Formation in Niger. Recent studies suggest that the largest Sarcosuchus specimens may have taken up to 60 years to reach their full size.\n10. SABER-TOOTH TIGER (Smilodon Bone)\n\"If you think about it, Smilodon fatalis likely left their paw prints on what is today Hollywood Boulevard long before Marilyn Monroe left her handprints at the Chinese Theater.\" Z. Jack Tseng, Paleontologist of the American Museum of Natural History\nWith twin serrated canine teeth measuring 8 inches (20 cm) and backed by 600 pounds (275 kg) of muscle, Smilodon is one of the most iconic animals of the Pleistocene Epoch. Biomechanical models suggest that Smilodon hunted by relying on powerful neck muscles to sink their long teeth into prey as opposed to using bite force to crush the windpipe as cats do today.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a pair of Smilodon fatalis femurs recovered on private land in Florida. This species of Smilodon ranged across North America and into the western half of South America for roughly 1.5 million years, finally succumbing with other megafauna during the Quaternary Extinction Event 10,000 years ago.\n11. GIANT BEAVER (Castoroides Tooth)\n\"The rodents of unusual size? I don't think they exist.\" ~ Westley, aka The Dread Pirate Roberts, The Princess Bride, 1987\nEven though the beaver is among the largest rodents in the world today, it's only a fraction of the size of its extinct cousin, Castoroides. Popularly known as the Giant Beaver, Castoroides was about the size of a modern black bear, weighing roughly 220 pounds (100 kg) and measuring more than 7 feet (2.5 m) without their long, flat tails.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of a Giant Beaver incisor recovered on private land. While we might imagine Castoroides using these mighty teeth to fell enormous trees, their blunt ends suggest the Giant Beaver lived as muskrats do today, feasting on softer, leafy plants rather than building dams and lodges.\n12. DOGGERLAND MAMMOTH (Tooth)\n\"Doggerland was the real heartland of Europe until sea levels rose to give us the coastline of today.\" ~ Dr. Richard Bates, Geochemist, St. Andrews Universit\nDuring the Pleistocene, Great Britain was the northwest peninsula of the European continent. Bounded to the north by steep walls of ice, the land between was home to a steppe ecosystem full of life. Now lost beneath the waves of the North Sea, this phantom countryside is known as Doggerland and is now a fertile fishing ground which occasionally yields remains from a long vanished world of Neanderthals and megafauna like the woolly mammoth.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of a woolly mammoth tooth recovered from the lost world of Doggerland. The morphology of mammoth teeth and the distribution of mammoth remains suggests mammoths were predominantly grazers subsisting mainly upon grasses and sedges, a diverse biomass that the modern Arctic tundra doesn\u2019t approach.\n13. ELEPHANT BIRD (Aepyornis Eggshell)\n\"So why did the Elephant Bird disappear? I suspect it was these.... its eggs.\" ~ Sir David Attenborough, Attenborough and The Giant Egg, 2011\nThe Elephant Bird was the largest member of an extinct family of flightless birds native to the island of Madagascar. Some individuals stood nearly 10 feet tall (3m) and weighed upwards of 1,100 pounds (500 kg). These massive birds laid the largest eggs of any known bird species, with volumes approaching 1.9 gallons (7L).\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of an Elephant Bird eggshell, generously donated from the personal collection of renowned Australian art dealer and long-time supporter of Mini Museum, Hank Ebes.\n14. AMAZON RIVER\n\"Have I forgotten the Amazon, Earth's greatest river? Never, never, never. It has been burning in me for half a century, and will burn forever.\" ~ Naturalist John Muir\nWith headwaters located high in the Peruvian Andes, just 100 miles from the Pacific Ocean, the Amazon river gathers strength from over 1000 tributaries as it flows for more than 4,300 miles (6,900 km) across the South American continent. On meeting the Atlantic Ocean, this mighty river discharges 7.7 million cubic feet of water per second. The river's massive, 2.7 million square mile basin (7 million square km) is home to the Amazon rainforest, the largest collection of living species on the planet.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a small vial of Amazon river water personally collected by Hans near Iquitos, Peru. Iquitos has the distinction of being the largest city on Earth which is only accessible by water or air.\n15. STONEHENGE (Bluestone Quarry)\n\"The stones are great, and virtue they have.\" ~ La\u021damonn, Brut 1190\nOf the numerous megalithic stone structures found throughout the British Isles and Continental Europe, Stonehenge is arguably the most famous. This ring of iconic stones was likely set in place around 2,500 BCE as part of a series of monuments, burial grounds, and ritual sites built in the same area over the course of thousands of years. Recent petrographic studies have closely linked chippings from the dolerite bluestones at Stonehenge to the quarry located at Craig Rhos-y-Felin.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of dolerite bluestone recovered downstream from the quarry at Craig Rhos-y-Felin. Located on the northern flank of the Preseli Mountains near Pembrokeshire, the Craig Rhos-y-Felin quarry was an active site for thousands of years, with the earliest known human encampments dating to 8,500 BCE. \n16. MUMMY BEADS (1ST MILLENNIUM BCE)\n\"If people can write to each other across space, why can they not write across time too?\" ~ Ahdaf Soueif, The Map of Love\nFor thousands of years, artisans in Egypt and Mesopotamia created vibrant ceramics to echo the beauty of rare jewels. Once known by the Egyptian word \"tjehenet,\" or \"that which shines\", the rich colors and glass-like surface are thought to capture the visual essence of immortality.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a selection of mummy beads spanning several eras from the 1st millennium BCE. The beads were acquired from the former collection of Simon Ohan Simonian, an antiquities dealer in Alexandria, Egypt throughout the 20th century.\n17. ROMAN BATH (HYPOCAUST FLUE)\n\"Our ancestors did not think that one could have a hot bath except in darkness.\" ~ Seneca the Younger, Moral Letters to Lucilius Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, 65 CE\nFor much of Roman history, bathing was more than a matter of hygiene; it was a complex social ritual enjoyed by nearly every class. Grand public works served the public at large, while wealthy citizens also had their own smaller, private baths. When heat was required for these facilities, the Romans relied on an ingenious system known as a hypocaust.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a section of Roman Hypocaust flue purchased from a private dealer of antiquities. This section of flue was part of a much larger system which consisted of a raised floor pitched on stacks of tiles. A furnace at the base level fed hot air into the gap beneath the floor which circulated and then rose up through the walls of the bath.\n18. KNIGHT\u2019S SWORD (c. 14TH CENTURY BCE)\n\"Conquest I saw, enthroned in majesty / But with sharpened sword above his head / Suspended by a single thread.\" Geoffrey Chaucer, The Knight\u2019s Tale from Tales of Canterbury, 1387 CE\nThough many battles raged throughout the \"long 13th century\" of the High Middle Ages, scholars often refer to this century as a time of relative peace. This did not mean knights could retire on their estates. Eager kings looking to extend their authority, continued military campaigns to the Holy Land, and a growing professionalization of warfare all combined to keep the European knight reliant on the tools of their trade: horse, armor, and sword.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of a knight\u2019s sword dating to the late 13th / early 14th century CE (Oakeshott Type XIIIa, Grans espe\u00e8s d'Allemagne). For the last 200 years the sword was held in a private family collection in France until acquired by a private dealer of antique arms in the United Kingdom.\n19. AZTEC EMPIRE (OBSIDIAN TOOL)\n\"I also said that I had news of a great lord named Montezuma ... and that, counting on the greatness of God, I thought I would go see him wherever he was.\" ~ Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, 1519 CE\nThe history of human civilization in Mesoamerica spans thousands of years; numerous cultures connected by shared traditions in architecture, science, politics, religion, and warfare. Among the last in a long line, the Aztec Empire rose from an alliance of three city-states during a violent civil war at the beginning of the 15th century CE. This fast-growing empire came to encompass 80,000 square miles (207,000 square km) and more than 10,000,000 people. Aztec rule of the region came to an abrupt end in 1521 when the forces allied to the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s took control of the capital city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n. \nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of an Aztec obsidian tool acquired from a private collection. Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass which can be polished to create a mirror-like finish. The material is harder than steel yet so brittle that it can be easily fractured to create clean, sharp edges ten times finer than modern scalpels.\n20. LUSITANIA (Deck Chair)\n\"The best joke I've heard in many days, this talk of torpedoing.\" ~ William Turner, Captain of the Lusitania\nOn May 1st, 1915, the R.M.S. Lusitania departed from New York on a voyage to Liverpool with 1,959 passengers aboard, as well as munitions destined for the battlefields of the Great War. Though the Royal Navy had promised to escort the Lusitania for part of the journey, the escort never appeared. As one of the fastest ships in the world, this wasn't cause for alarm, but when the Lusitania entered Irish waters on May 7th it had to slow to navigate the foggy weather. A nearby German U-boat took advantage of this situation, torpedoing the ship twice which caused the hull to explode, and doomed 1,198 passengers.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from an oak deck chair which once graced the decks of the R.M.S. Lusitania. The chair was among the untold tonnes of flotsam and hundreds of bodies which washed ashore in Cobh, Ireland and was held on public display for decades. It was acquired at auction from Christie\u2019s London office in late 2016.\n21. WINSTON CHURCHILL (Fur Muff)\n\"Victory will never be found by taking the line of least resistance.\" ~ Winston Churchill, January 15th, 1940\nSir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill was a figure of tremendous importance in the first half of the 20th century. His long life straddled two very different centuries, a tumultuous period in which maps were redrawn and the world hovered several times on the brink of total annihilation.\nChurchill held an ardent belief in the pre-eminence of Great Britain, and this would often guide his decisions and fuel his seemingly bottomless need for action. These two aspects of his person led Churchill to take positions which are difficult to reconcile favorably today. Yet, it was precisely such qualities which made Sir Winston the resolute leader the United Kingdom required during the dark years of the Second World War.\nBy the end of his life in 1965, Churchill had served nearly 64 years in parliament. He held numerous positions, including two turns as Prime Minister. Today, the \"Bulldog of Britain\" is considered by many to be one of the greatest Britons in history.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a section of a faux leopard-skin hand muff used for many years by Winston Churchill. Churchill was known to suffer from poor circulation in his later years, and often made use of a muff to keep his hands warm. This muff was purchased at auction in 2016 from Christie\u2019s of London, and included a signed letter from Lady Soames, Churchill\u2019s youngest daughter.\n22. HOLLYWOOD SIGN\n\"Hollywood is a place you can't geographically define. We don't really know where it is.\" ~ John Ford, American Film Director, 1964\nFor nearly a century, the Hollywood sign has stood on the southern slope of Mount Lee overlooking the city of Los Angeles. The sign was originally built as a temporary advertisement for new homes in \"Hollywoodland,\" but later became a bright beacon for those seeking stardom, and a symbol for the entertainment industry.\nBy the late-1970s, the sign had fallen into such disrepair that a complete replacement was required. The reconstruction was financed primarily by private fundraising efforts led by Playboy Magazine founder Hugh Hefner. Hefner brought together an unlikely group of entertainers, from silver screen legend Gene Autry to theatrical shock rocker Alice Cooper, who each sponsored a letter in the new sign.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a two-piece fragment of the original Hollywood sign, salvaged during the 1978 reconstruction. It was acquired from the private collection of a retired Los Angeles sound engineer.\n23. MANHATTAN PROJECT (Shield Window)\n\"To the men and women of the Manhattan Project and to all who aided them in their yet unparalleled achievement.\" ~ General Leslie Groves, dedication of \"Now It Can Be Told\", 1962\nThe Manhattan Project was the codename for the research and development effort which allowed the United States to rapidly develop a series of atomic breakthroughs during World War II, including the first industrial-scale plutonium production reactor and the first atomic bombs. This enormous project involved over one hundred thousand scientists, engineers, technicians, and construction workers at more than 30 sites across the United States, including well-known locations such as Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, Trinity, and Hanford.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a leaded glass window installed in the T Plant (221-T) Plutonium Recovery Building at Hanford. Plutonium processed at the Hanford T-Plant was used in both the Trinity test on July 16, 1945 and in the \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb used over Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 1945. The yellow color of the glass is due to a high concentration of lead-oxide (up to 70%), which blocks blue and near-UV spectral frequencies, and also gives the glass its protective qualities.\n24. THE WHITE HOUSE (Brick)\n\"For the President\u2019s House I would design a building which should also look forward but execute no more of it at present than might suit the circumstances of this country, when it shall first be wanted.\" ~ George Washington, March 8th, 1792\nSince John Adams took up residence on November 1st, 1800, every U.S. President has called the White House home. Not surprisingly, each resident has endeavored to leave their mark. Still, no matter who the occupant might be at any given time, or the changes they\u2019ve made, the White House itself endures as a powerful symbol for the United States and the office of the Presidency.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment from a brick recovered during the extensive 1948-1952 renovation and expansion of the White House. This process generated an enormous amount of salvage material, some of which was used as landfill, but more attractive items became part of a popular public souvenir program designated by the Commission on the Renovation of the Executive Mansion.\n25. MUHAMMAD ALI (PUNCHING BAG)\n\"I know where I'm going and I know the truth and I don't have to be what you want me to be. I'm free to be what I want.\" ~ Cassius Clay, February 26, 1964\nIn 1964, a loud, handsome boxer from Louisville, Kentucky shocked the sporting world by beating the reigning heavyweight champion of the world. Ten days later, the new champion was introduced to the world by a new name: Muhammad Ali.\nBut Muhammad Ali was far more than a boxing legend. His conversion to Islam and association with the Nation of Islam became a lightning rod for opinion across the United States. Later, his opposition to the war in Vietnam and direct engagement with civil rights issues catapulted him into a world far beyond the ring. \nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a punching bag formerly used by Muhammad Ali. Known as a double-end or \"crazy\" bag, this particular type of punching bag is used to improve accuracy, speed, and endurance. The bag was gifted to a long-time sports commentator and friend of Muhammad Ali, and later purchased at auction by Mini Museum.\n26. CONCORDE (JET ROTOR)\n\"I've always thought of the Concorde as a magical object, a symbol, a miracle.\" ~ Andr\u00e9e Putman, legendary French Designer\nOn January 1, 1976, the Concorde became the first supersonic commercial aircraft in history. For nearly thirty years, these magnificent aircraft cruised at altitudes twice as high as their subsonic counterparts, twice the speed of sound, and with ticket prices twice the price of their most expensive luxury rivals. \nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment from a flown, high-pressure compressor vane, an integral part of the four turbojet engines that allowed the Concorde to cruise above Mach 2. Produced by Britain's Rolls Royce and Snecma Moteurs of France, the Olympus 593 Mk 610 were the most powerful transport certified engines in the world at the time of their introduction.\n27. ROUGH SAPPHIRE (Myanmar)\n\"Beauty is meaningless until it is shared.\" ~ George Orwell, Burmese Days, 1934\nDazzling and durable, sapphires are among the most popular gemstones in the world. They form very slowly inside cooling igneous and metamorphic rocks as metals seep into clear aluminum oxide crystals, changing their color. Traces of Titanium result in a blue hue while the presence of iron results in the color yellow. Any color except red is considered a sapphire, while red, indicating the presence of Chromium, is considered a ruby.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a rough sapphire from Myanmar's Mogok Metamorphic Belt, also known as the \"Valley of Gems\". Stretching over 930 miles (1500 km), this region has yielded some of the world\u2019s greatest rubies, jade, and sapphires.\n28. FIRST SPACE SHUTTLE (COLUMBIA FLOWN TILE)\n\"The Shuttle is to space flight what Lindbergh was to commercial aviation.\" ~ Arthur C. Clarke\nOn April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle Columbia roared to life on the pad at the Kennedy Space Center\u2019s historic Launch Complex 39A. Solid rocket boosters and Columbia\u2019s own engines delivered more than 6,600,000 pounds of thrust, lifting the crew of two and 4,500,000 pounds (2,000,000 kg) of dreams into orbit at more than 17,500 miles per hour (28,163 kmh). The successful launch and return of Columbia heralded a new age in space exploration.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of a mission flown High-Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation Tile (HRSI) that was once attached to the Space Shuttle Columbia. NASA disposition paperwork accompanying the tile indicates it was removed after Columbia\u2019s 7th mission, STS-61-C, which flew on January 12, 1986.\n29. HUMAN HEART\n\"The heart is of such density that fire can scarcely damage it.\" ~ Andr\u00e9s de Laguna, Anatomica methodus, seu De sectione humani corporis contemplatio, 1535\nMan has understood the importance of the heart since as far back as the Greek Dark Ages when physicians like Hippocrates of Kos theorized about its purpose. The human heart is the first organ to develop in vitro. It is made of muscle tissue that works twice as hard as the muscles that support movement. Over the course of an average human life the heart will beat 2.5 billion times, and at death the heart is one of the last organs to stop functioning.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a human heart recovered from a 74 year-old woman who passed away due to non-cardiac related natural causes. The heart was prepared by a laboratory which uses plastination techniques to preserve anatomical specimens for various exhibits and medical research purposes worldwide. Due to a mishap during preparation which caused a long tear along the surface of the left atrium, the heart was considered undesirable for most technical purposes.\nPlease Note: Additional information about all of the specimens and larger images of the Fourth Edition can be found on our website at minimuseum.com.\nThank you from Team Mini Museum!

As their car approaches the edge of the continent, the world outside the window seems to be unraveling ever faster as if somewhere beyond the horizon, the hollow core of civilization has finally caved in.\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag is the internationally acclaimed author, concept designer and artist behind Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood. His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world.\nNow, St\u00e5lenhag turns his unique vision to America in a new narrative artbook: The Electric State. With your support, these amazing images will turn into a top-quality narrative artbook, truly doing justice to the extreme attention to detail and quality of St\u00e5lenhag's work.\nThe book will also add St\u00e5lenhag's own texts to supplement the images, giving you an even deeper understanding of the universe of The Electric State.\nJust like Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood, The Electric State will be a thick, oversized artbook of over 120 pages with print, paper, and binding of the highest quality.\nThere will be two versions of the book - the standard edition (included in the ROBOT RUNAWAY reward level) and the limited edition (included in the SENTRE AGENT reward level and above).\nThe limited edition, with an exclusive and beautifully embossed cloth cover, is unique to this kickstarter and will never be printed again.\nThe Electric State - Limited Edition\n  Through this Kickstarter, you can get your hands on exclusive art prints of Simon St\u00e5lenhag's work.\nAt the DRONE PILOT reward level, you get a 50x70 cm canvas print, signed by Simon himself.\nAdditionally, we have the five ART COLLECTOR reward levels, limited to a single backer each, that include a unique artprint of an illustration from The Electric State. These top quality artprints in format 70 x 70 cm or 70 x 100 cm are printed directly on sturdy polystyrene board and each includes a rigid metal frame for easy hanging on your livingroom wall.\n  The Electric State kommer \u00e4ven att publiceras p\u00e5 svenska. I den backer-enk\u00e4t som f\u00f6ljer kan du ange vilket spr\u00e5k du vill ha boken i. Det g\u00e4ller \u00e4ven den begr\u00e4nsade utg\u00e5van.\n  The Electric State will be a top-quality artbook no matter what, with paper, printing and binding of the highest grade. The illustrations and the story form a unified work of art, that will not easily benefit from expanding. This means that this Kickstarter will not have a large number of stretchgoals, as we have a very clear vision for this book and we will not compromise on it in any way.\nThat said, we have a few stretchgoals - which have all been unlocked during the first day of the campaign! See below for more information on those. We will consider new stretchgoals to add - stay tuned!\nSTRETCHGOAL 1: ELECTRIC STATE ROADMAP - UNLOCKED!\nA full-color map of the alternate 1997 America depicted in The Electric State. The map will be included in the book for all backers, and printed separately as well at no extra cost for backers at the ROBOT RUNAWAY level and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 2: IN-WORLD AD FOR ELECTRIC STATE VR TECH - UNLOCKED!\nIf we hit this stretchgoal, Simon St\u00e5lenhag will create a fictitious advertisement booklet of four pages or more for the virtual reality technology present in universe of The Electric State, letting you learn more about it. The \"ad\" will be included in the book itself, expanding it for all backers at level DIGITAL WANDERER and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 3: IN-WORLD AD FOR ELECTRIC STATE DRONE TECH - UNLOCKED!\nIf we hit this stretchgoal, Simon St\u00e5lenhag will create a fictitious advertisement booklet of four pages or more for the robot drone technology present in universe of The Electric State. The \"ad\" will be included in the book, expanding it for all backers at level DIGITAL WANDERER and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 4: ART PRINT #1 - UNLOCKED!\nWe will print a separate high quality art print of one of the images in The Electric State. The print will have roughly the same size as a page in the book. The art print will be included at no added cost for all backers at the ROBOT RUNAWAY level and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 5: ART PRINT #2 - UNLOCKED!\nWe will print a second high quality art print of one of the images in The Electric State. The print will have roughly the same size as a page in the book. The art print will be included at no added cost for all backers at the ROBOT RUNAWAY level and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 6: SOUNDTRACK BY SIMON ST\u00c5LENHAG - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself will compose a short soundtrack for The Electric State (4-5 songs). The music will be in the same style as the score in the trailer video, which is also composed by Simon. The soundtrack will be delivered digitally to all backers at the DIGITAL WANDERER level and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 7: ART PRINT #3 - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, we will print a third separate high quality art print of one of the images in The Electric State.

I am so grateful to all of our backers and we're excited to come back to Kickstarter to share the all-new Third Edition with everyone. So let's get started!\nA Mini Museum is a handcrafted, limited edition collectible, designed to inspire learning and exploration. Every specimen in the Mini Museum is authentic, iconic, and labeled. \nLarge and Small Third Edition Mini Museums\nI've been collecting rare and fascinating objects for most of my life, ever since my father gave me my first specimens in 1977.\nFirst specimens from Malta and my father, Dr. J\u00f6rgen Fex (1924-2006)\nOver the years, I've been fortunate to meet many amazing people including scientists, museum curators, astronauts, and other adventurers. With their help, I've been able to assemble an incredible collection which I am now sharing with the world.\nThe full collection for the Third Edition of the Mini Museum contains 29 unique, carefully selected specimens. Each Mini Museum is artfully arranged, and encased in Lucite acrylic. As with our first two editions, this line-up of specimens will only be offered once.\nThe \"Large\" version of the Mini Museum measures 5\"x4\"x1\" and contains all 29 specimens in the Third Edition:\nLarge Third Edition Mini Museum (29 Specimens)\nThe \"Small\" version measures 4\"x3\"x1\" and contains 12 specimens:\nSmall Third Edition Mini Museum (12 Specimens)\nOf course, with a handmade product like the Mini Museum, there will always be variations. There may be tiny air bubbles, or a specimen may be shaped and sized differently. Specimens have also been known to shift or fragment slightly during acrylic casting. Such variations highlight the fact that each Mini Museum is handmade and absolutely unique.\nDetailed specimen descriptions can be found further down the page.\nIn addition to these amazing specimens, your Mini Museum will arrive in a handsome Display Box designed just for the Third Edition.  A Certificate of Authenticity will be included in the box and the Mini Museum will be protected by a custom, micro-fiber pouch. You'll also receive a special book with your Mini Museum which we call the Companion Guide.\nThe Mini Museum is an awesome collection to have and hold. To help you share the Mini Museum, we created a full-color book called the Mini Museum Companion Guide.\nPages from the New, Expanded Companion Guide\nFor the Third Edition, we're excited to announce that the Companion Guide will return to the hardbound version we used in the First Edition.  We've also expanded the content for each specimen to provide even more details. In many ways, this is our most ambitious project to date and we have so much to share!\nEvery specimen has its challenges and the Third Edition presented some of the most difficult situations we've ever faced.  Along the way we pushed ourselves further than ever before, creating miniature, handcrafted art pieces at a new level of detail.  I couldn't be happier with the way these amazing new specimens turned out.\nMacro image of the First Transatlantic Cable Specimen\nWith a full year of development behind us, we have so many amazing stories to share.  For example, in the underwater, time-lapse video below, we've compressed eight minutes of high-tech cutting time into just a few seconds. \nUsing high-energy, Electric Discharge Machining to create precise slices of a 14th century Samurai sword.\nThis is just one step in the lengthy process of creating the Samurai Sword specimen. This brief glimpse is just a sample of the effort and care we put into creating the Third Edition.\nAs with our last two projects, I'll cover many of the specimens in detailed project updates. From the incredible variation of life...\nThe many colors of the Dire Wolf Specimen\n ... to the unraveling of an Enigma.\nInterior of the WW II Enigma Rotor Specimen\nNew challenges and new friends...\nBaltimore Knife and Sword Smiths at work on the Viking Axe Specimen\n... not to mention incredible help from past Mini Museum backers!\nArchitectural work uncovering early 14th century Venice\nPutting together the Third Edition has been an epic adventure.  I can't wait to share it all with you! \nBirds of a Feather: Visiting the SR-71 at the National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center with the Third Edition SR-71 Specimen. Kind thanks to Layne Karafantis, PhD. and Curator of Modern Military Aircraft for allowing us to visit.\nBackers of our first two projects know how strongly I believe in Kickstarter. The support of this community is what's made the Mini Museum possible and allowed me to fulfill my life long dream of sharing my love of science and history with the world.\nMore than 10,000 Mini Museums shipped all over the world!\nTo me, this picture represents what Kickstarter is all about.  It's an honor to return once more to ask for your support for the Third Edition.  Thank you all so very much for taking time to learn more about our latest collection.  I hope you're as excited as I am to continue the journey.\nNow, it's back to work!\n- Hans Fex, Creator and Chief Curator of the Mini Museum\nSPACE GEMS (4,557,000,000 years old)\n\"On the basis of a modest conjecture, I have undertaken a dangerous journey. Yet, already I see the foothills of new lands.\" ~ Immanuel Kant, 1755 \"Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens\"\nCreated in the heart of an asteroid soon after the birth of the solar system, Pallasite Peridot is among the rarest and oldest gems. Pallasites are characterized by a unique matrix of the mineral Olivine embedded in solidified iron and nickel. This combination of two materials of contrasting densities is as surprising to science as it is beautiful to the eye.\nThe specimens in the Mini Museum are fragments of Peridot from the Jepara meteorite discovered in 2008 on the Indonesian island of Java. The original mass weighed 499.5 kg (1100 lbs) with a diameter of just 85 cm (33 in).\nOLDEST EARTH (4,374,000,000 years old)\n\"The only physical evidence from the earliest phases of Earth\u2019s evolution comes from zircons.\" ~ John Valley, Geoscientist\nZircons are quite common in the crust of Earth. They are shed through the process of erosion once igneous rocks reach the surface, at which point the zircons are incorporated into new sedimentary layers. In Western Australia, the rough, sedimentary layers of the Jack Hills formation contain the oldest zircons ever discovered. In addition to being the oldest known samples of Earth's crust, the zircons of the Jack Hills formation also contain water and the earliest suggestions of life in the form of biogenic carbon.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a small piece of the Jack Hills formation north of Perth in Western Australia. The specimen was purchased from Tom Kapitany of Crystal World and collected in accordance with Australia's cultural heritage and mining laws.\nGREAT OXYGENATION EVENT (3,020,000,000 years old)\n\"Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.\" ~ L. Frank Baum, author of the Wizard of Oz\nThe Great Oxygenation Event marks the buildup of oxygen in the Earth's early atmosphere. The evidence of this Great Oxygenation Event is found across the planet in the striking red, black, and silver colors of Banded Iron Formations.  With thousands of millimeter and submillimeter-thick layers, banded iron is the result of oxygen released in the early acidic seas by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Lasting more than a billion years, this process resulted in the semi-permanent oxygenation of Earth's oceans.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the Mid Archean Pilbara supergroup formation located in Western Australia. The estimated age is of this group is over 3 billion years old. The specimen was recovered by Tom Kapitany of Crystal World in strict accordance with Australia's cultural resource protection legislation.\nOLDEST RIVER (Finke, 400,000,000 years old)\n\"How the river has worn its way through a basalt range half a mile thick and 1,000 feet high is a mystery.\" ~ Charles Chewing, Sources of the Finke River (1886)\nThe sinuous Finke River in Australia has mesmerized human beings for thousands of years. Aboriginal mythology ties the creation of the river's curves to the Rainbow Serpent which shaped the entire landscape of Australia after the Dreamtime when the world was flat and still. These wildly meandering curves cut deep into the mountains and hills of Central Australia. This suggests that the river must be even older than those hills which formed roughly 300-400 million years ago during a mountain-forming event known as the Alice Springs Orogeny.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the bed of the Finke River. The river was free flowing when Hans collected the small sample, which is an unusual occurrence. We are greatly indebted to Hank Ebes for the generosity of his time in introducing Hans to the natural beauty of Australia.\nJURASSIC TREE\n\"Araucaria was targeted as commonly available nutritious food source by many high-browsing megaherbivores.\" ~ J\u00fcrgen Hummel, Professor for Ruminant Nutrition, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen\nOver the last 200 million years, the \"primitive\" look of the Araucaria hasn't changed much. Averaging 30-60 meters in height, these conifers feature straight, columnar trunks and branches covered in overlapping, scale-like leaves.\nIt should come as no surprise that scientists believe this conifer was a favorite food for long-necked sauropods.  Recent digestive studies suggest that Araucaria is capable of yielding a surprising amount of energy when fermented for long periods.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of Araucaria from Queensland, Australia located in strata dating to the Jurassic. The specimen was purchased from Tom Kapitany of Crystal World. It was collected in accordance with Australia's cultural heritage and mining laws.\nCRINOID (170,000,000 years old)\n\"It was the Law of the Sea, they said. Civilization ends at the waterline. Beyond that, we all enter the food chain, and not always right at the top.\" ~ Hunter S. Thompson\nSometimes referred to as feather stars or sea lilies, crinoids are members of an extended and very ancient family of sea animals known as echinoderms. An integral part of the explosion of complex life during the Cambrian Period, the symmetry of the crinoid's body plan is fascinating and beautiful.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the center of a crinoid stem, also known as a \"columnal\". It was recovered near Talsint, Morocco. The fossil beds in this region are from the Bajocian Age of the Middle Jurassic Epoch.\nSPINOSAURUS (Spine)\n\"Spinosaurus appears to have been poorly adapted to bipedal terrestrial locomotion. The forward position of the center of mass may have enhanced balance during foot-propelled locomotion in water.\" ~ Nizar Ibrahim, Paleontologist, University of Chicago\nTopping out at just over 18m long (59ft), Spinosaurus is one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs ever discovered. This family of semi-aquatic theropods also happens to be among the most surprising creatures in the fossil record. In some species, the spines in the namesake sail measure more than 2 meters in length, providing the framework for an impressive structure that would rise high above the water.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the Kem Kem Beds in Morocco. During the Cretaceous Period, this region was part of a vast river system. In recent years members of the Spinosaurus family have been found in many parts of the world including Europe, South America, and even Australia.\nANKYLOSAURUS (Bone)\n\"The armor are bones that form within the skin, just like crocodiles.\" ~ Ken Carpenter, Director, USU Eastern Prehistoric Museum\nCovered in rows of bony plates and wielding a powerful clubbed tail, the Ankylosaurs are one of the most distinctive and successful of all dinosaur families. Spread across more than 90 million years of the fossil record, various species of this sturdy dinosaur can be found on every continent on earth.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from Ankylosaurus dermal plates recovered by paleontologists working on private land. Large and oval in shape, these scutes are consistent with the armor that protected the neck and shoulders of Ankylosaurus from the sharp teeth of predators.\nMOSASAUR (Jaw)\n\"A swift and powerful swimmer over short distances, the Mosasaur used surprise and the thrust of his muscular tail to outrun his prey with a short burst of speed.\" ~ Michael J. Everhart, Oceans of Kansas\nIf we look first to the sea, the Mesozoic Era might not be known as the Age of Dinosaurs, but rather as the Age of Marine Reptiles. Beginning with the appearance of the dolphin-shaped Ichthyosaurs in the Triassic Period, the rising seas of the Jurassic Period led to a wide variety of large predators including the long-necked plesiosaurs and pliosaurs to the powerful Mosasaurs.\nMosasaurs ranged in size from 1.1m (3.3ft) to 17.4m (57ft). Their skulls were flexible and their jaws were double-hinged. While this arrangement probably allowed a Mosasaur to swallow prey whole, the alignment of a Mosasaur's teeth with \"bony crypts\" to protect emerging teeth also suggests Mosasaurs likely crushed bones as frequently as they tore into flesh.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the muzzle of a juvenile Tylosaurus proriger. This species typically grew to a length of 15m (50ft). The specimen was collected on private land in Western Kansas.\nSAN ANDREAS FAULT\n\"Big earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault are inevitable, and by geologic standards extremely common.\" ~ Lucile M. Jones, USGS ShakeOut Scenario\nOn the morning of April 18th, 1906, a powerful earthquake woke the city of San Francisco at precisely 5:12AM. Fires resulting from the quake destroyed 80% of the city, killing more than 3,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. It was as violent an introduction as one could imagine to the presence of the 28 million year-old San Andreas Fault.\nDisconcerting as this may be, the 1906 quake is not the largest quake possible along the San Andreas or even the largest that's occurred in the past. All along the fault's 1300km (800mi) spine, we can see the history of two continental plates grinding past each other.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum was recovered from the Tejon Pass, where the interface between the North American and Pacific plates are directly exposed and easily accessible. Each specimen is comprised of parts of both plates.\nMEGALODON (Tooth)\n\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" ~ Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Jaws (1975)\nThe Megalodon shark dominated the oceans of the world for over 20 million years. Reaching sizes upwards of 18m (59ft) in length, the largest Megalodon jaw reconstruction measures 3.3m (11ft) across and 2.7m (9ft) tall. Computer models suggest that a full-grown Megalodon had the most powerful bite of any known animal in the fossil record, somewhere between 11 and 18 tonnes or 25,000-40,000 pounds. This epic jaw was also lined with enormous teeth - 46 in the front row, to be exact, with 5 more rows waiting behind.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the fossilized tooth enamel of a Megalodon shark. The teeth come from the coastal rivers of South Carolina, one of the most popular regions for hunting Megalodon teeth.\nMOLDAVITE (14,400,000 years old)\n\"It reminds one of the strange ring mountains of the Moon, and it is easy to think that the origins of these as well as of the Ries Basin are due to the same causes.\" ~ Ernest Werner (1904), the first to suggest Ries basin origin is not volcanic\nFor many years, a pastoral region of southern Germany was thought to be the remains of an ancient volcanic crater. Imagine the surprise when it was discovered that the the N\u00f6rdlingen Ries Basin was in fact an asteroid impact site some 14,400,000 years earlier.\nIn an instant, a 1.5km wide asteroid released 2.4\u00d710^21 joules - enough energy to power the entire modern human world for more than six years. This tremendous blast gouged out hundreds of cubic kilometers of material and created created a complex array of materials, from new metamorphic rocks studded with impact diamonds to stunning, green gems called Moldavite.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from Moldavites found in the Bohemia region of the western Czech Republic. 99% of all Moldavites come from this region.\nGIANT SLOTH (Claw)\n\"I will venture to refer to him by the name of the Great-Claw...\" ~ Thomas Jefferson (1799)\nOften known for their great claws and ungainly appearance, ground sloths were a very successful family of mammals. The largest species evolved during the Pliocene epoch in the midst of a period of great migration between North and South America. This \"Great American Interchange\" lasted millions of years, beginning with island hopping and peaking as animals crossed freely over the newly formed isthmus of Panama.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the tip of an Eremotherium claw, discovered on private land and partially restored by George Heslep. Eremotherium stood roughly 4m tall (20ft) and weighed 3,000 kilograms (6,600lbs).\nDIRE WOLF (Bone)\n\"Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.\" ~ George R.R. Martin, Song of Ice and Fire\nThe real dire wolf was one of the most successful predators of the late Pleistocene epoch. Ranging from Alaska to Bolivia, this muscular carnivore fed on a wide variety of large prey including bison, camels, horses, mastodons, and mammoths... even giant sloths!\nYet, despite the dire wolf's advantages in size and numbers, it disappeared along with many other large species at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. Most scientists believe that rapid climate change played a major role in this large scale extinction event, but it would be difficult to ignore the introduction of humans to the Americas as the two species often sought the same prey.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the partial remains of a dire wolf found in Florida on private land.\nEGYPTIAN PAPYRUS\n\"Before we leave Egypt we shall also describe the nature of papyrus, since our civilization or at all events our records depend very largely on the employment of paper.\" ~ Pliny the Elder\nIn ancient Egyptian cosmology, the world began as dry land emerged from the primeval waters. The darkness of the world was filled with light, and there in the marsh the papyrus grew. From this creation myth, the humble papyrus went on to serve as the symbol of life in Egypt. It rivaled linen as a chief commercial export and evidence suggests this writing material was in use for over 5,000 years.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a selection of fragmented papyri collected over many years by a German dealer of antiquities.\nVIKING AXE (10th Century)\n\"Never before has such terror appeared in Britain as we have now suffered from a pagan race...\" ~ Alcuin of York, on the first Viking raids of 793\nMore than 1200 years ago the Vikings left the fjords of modern Scandinavia and set out to sea. Today, nearly every country in Europe has a story to tell of the Viking expansion and a complex history of their many societies is slowly being rediscovered.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a set of Viking bearded axes dating to 900 CE. We worked closely with the blacksmiths of Baltimore Knife & Sword to prepare the material for inclusion.\nSAMURAI SWORD (14th Century)\n\"\u590f\u8349\u3084 \u5175\u3069\u3082\u304c \u5922\u306e\u8de1 - Summer grass... all that remains of warrior dreams.\" ~ Matsuo Bash\u014d (1644\u20131694)\nThe Japanese sword is a symbol of unparalleled beauty and quality. Bound closely to the image of the samurai class, the blades are highly prized and honored by collectors all over the world. The history of these incredible weapons and the warriors who wielded them are intimately connected to the development of the Japanese nation and the culture of modern Japan.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is comprised of two parts. The first is from a Ko-t\u014d period katana circa the mid-1300s. It is a single-forged blade attributed to the Yamato Senjuin School. The second piece is a late-Edo period Kamishimo, including a sleeveless jacket known as the Kataginu and the trousers known as the Hakama.\nThe blade was selected with the generous support of Pablo Kuntz. Pablo is the owner of Unique Japan, a respected dealer of Japanese swords worldwide. While lovely, the blade has a number of micro-fractures that made it unsuitable, and potentially dangerous, as a collectible. The Kamishimo was selected to compliment the sword and was acquired at auction.\nVENICE (14th Century)\n\"I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs; A palace and a prison on each hand...\" ~ Lord Byron, 1812\nThe City of Canals, the City of Bridges, the City of Masks... The city of Venice has been known by many names and ruled by many hands. Yet, despite its legendary history at the center of a long-lived republic, it is the ever-present Adriatic Sea which has defined the fortunes of Venice, and it is to those waters that the city may eventually return.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from an early 14th century paving brick uncovered in the Cannaregio sestiere during a recent renovation. The brick was acquired directly from the architectural firm performing the renovation. We are extremely grateful for the assistance of Mini Museum Backer N. Lugato in identifying and securing this specimen.\nROUGH OPAL (Australia)\n\"Opals combine brilliant qualities of the most valuable gems and, above all, defy description.\" ~ Pliny the Elder\nOpal forms in areas where water comes in contact with sandstone and filters deep into the Earth, picking up more silica along the way. This silica-rich solution settles into cracks, natural fractures in the rock, or even into fossilized organic material. Under intense heat and pressure, most of the water evaporates leaving the silica behind.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is opalized fossil plant material from Lightning Ridge in NSW, Australia. Australia is the largest producer of opals in the world. The opal fields here date to the Cretaceous when Central Australia was home to an enormous inland sea, known to science as the Eromanga Basin.\nFIRST TRANSATLANTIC CABLE\n\u201cWhat hath God wrought?\u201d ~ Samuel F.B. Morse, 1844\nTen years after Samuel F.B. Morse sent the first telegraph message in 1844, the world was hooked on the new form of rapid communication. Yet even with this breathtaking progress, overcoming the Atlantic Ocean seemed an impossible task. Nearly two thousand miles of open ocean separated the closest two points between Europe and North America, and the depth along the route often exceeded two miles. Spanning this enormous gap would require the will of a person of immense vision and grit, and perhaps even a touch of madness.\nOn August 4th, 1858, after already suffering one failed attempt to connect the line, entrepreneur Cyrus West Field and the USS Niagara reached Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, connecting the first Transatlantic Telegraph Cable. Within days, messages began flowing between the two continents at a rate never before imagined. The world had become smaller in what seemed like an instant.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a section of the original Transatlantic cable carried aboard the USS Niagara. After the completion of the first line, the remaining cable was purchased by Charles Tiffany with the intent of selling souvenirs commemorating the linking of both continents. Stored for over 100 years, several cases of finished cable sections were located and later sold by the the Smithsonian Institution in the 1970s.\nALCATRAZ\n\"It looks like Alcatraz has got me licked.\" ~ Gangster Al Capone\nInhospitable and inescapable, the legendary Federal Penitentiary on Alcatraz Island played host to some of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century. Originally conceived as a concentration program to manage the most difficult prisoners in the federal penal system, the isolated and harsh environment of \"The Rock\" became a symbol of cold, impersonal justice, earning the prison it's infamous nickname.\nToday, Alcatraz Island is a National Park visited by over 1 million people each year. The island is also home to a rapidly growing population of nesting colonial seabirds, including cormorants, snowy egrets, and black-crowned night herons. The specimen in the Mini Museum comes from concrete salvaged by the National Park Service during restoration of the site.\nWWII ENIGMA (Rotor)\n\"There was nothing to stop the German U-boats until Alan Turing managed to break naval Enigma. If that hadn\u2019t happened, Britain would have been starved and would have lost the war.\" ~ Cpt. Raymond C. Roberts, Bletchley Park Codebreaker\nIn times of war, the struggle for information often means the difference between winning and losing. Yet few efforts to conceal and reveal information reached the scale or importance of the puzzle which surrounded the German Enigma during World War II.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the remains of several ruined, military-grade Enigma rotors. Each individual specimen contains fragments from the key components of the rotor, including: the notched \"thumbwheel\", the alphabet ring, and the core of the rotor which contained the wiring and contacts that enabled the system to function.\nFORDITE (Motor Agate)\n\"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants as long as it is black.\" ~ Henry Ford, 1909\nThe bright, jewel-like layers of Fordite are comprised of thousands of layers of automobile paint. Drop by drop, each layer represents a different vehicle as it passed through the paint booth in the factory. Heated to hundreds of degrees, the layers fused together to form one of the most beautiful and completely accidental man-made composites.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri. The plant opened in 1951 and since 1957 the 4,700,000-square-foot facility has been home to ten generations of F-Series Pickup Truck production, as well as many other vehicles.\nTHE BEATLES (Cavern Club)\n\"The Cavern... Do I have memories of the Cavern? Do I? Oh yeah.\" ~ Paul McCartney\nBefore The Beatles played for millions of viewers on The Ed Sullivan Show, the Lads from Liverpool put in thousands of hours in clubs and lounges across the UK, Germany, Sweden, and France. Yet few venues can be so closely associated with the earliest days of the Beatles as the original Cavern Club in Liverpool, England.\nFrom 1961 to 1963, the Fab Four played 292 shows in the Cavern Club. The club was demolished in 1973, but the bricks were saved. In 1983, a selection of bricks were auctioned for charity and the remaining bricks were used in the rebuilding of the Cavern Club on the original site. The specimen in the Mini Museum comes from one of those original bricks, purchased at auction.\nSR-71 (Blackbird)\n\u201cNothing had prepared me to fly that fast\u2026\u201d ~ Air Force Colonel Jim Wadkins\nThe SR-71 was built for speed and stealth. Setting records as the world's fastest manned aircraft, the SR-71 easily cruised at more than three times the speed of sound. \nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of a \"turkey feather\" from SR-71 61-7972. It was purchased from Daniel Freeman, Supervisor and Chief of Metals Technology for the 9th Reconnaissance Wing I.\nThe turkey feathers are overlapping flaps which surrounded the exhaust of the SR-71. Opening and closing according to the pressure output of the afterburner, they are considered one of the hardest working parts of the aircraft. SR-71 61-7972 was retired in 1990 and is currently on display in the Smithsonian's Air & Space collection at the Udvar-Hazy Center just outside Washington, D.C. During the delivery flight from Los Angeles, the aircraft flew coast to coast in just 67 minutes.\nPEL\u00c9 (Soccer ball)\n\"I close my eyes, and I can still see my first soccer ball.\" ~ Pel\u00e9\nLike many Brazilians, Edson Arantes do Nascimento has been known by many names. He was called \"Dico\" by his family and \"Gasolina\" because he was so fast, but the one name that really stuck was Pel\u00e9. The name Pel\u00e9 has no actual meaning in Portuguese, but the life of the greatest soccer player of all time has been anything but meaningless.\nFollowing the incredible early success of winning the 1958 World Cup, Pel\u00e9 went on to score 1283 career goals and played on two more winning World Cup teams (1962, 1970). Those who met him on the field used words like \"flawless\" and \"magical\", sowing seeds for the legend that would lead to yet another nickname - \"The King\".\nSince retiring from play, Pel\u00e9 has travelled the world promoting soccer and serving as an inspiration for millions of people. His lasting legacy is one of peace and sportsmanship.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a vintage leather football owned by Pel\u00e9 and acquired by auction in London. This personal auction was the most lucrative sale of football memorabilia in history.\nCHARLES & DIANA (Royal Wedding Cake)\n\"Only do what your heart tells you.\" ~ Princess Diana\nThe marriage of HRH Charles Windsor, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer was an international sensation. Watched by an estimated 750,000,000 people around the world.\nYet what seemed to the world like a beautiful story would become much more complicated as the years passed until their divorce in 1996.  Just one year later, on August 31st, 1997, Lady Diana died in a car crash while fleeing the paparazzi in Paris. On September 6th, 1997, more than 2,500,000,000 people watched the funeral held at Westminster Abbey. Diana was just 36 years-old.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a piece of the royal wedding cake, a traditional fruit cake with cream cheese frosting. The layers of the official cake took 14 weeks to prepare including an identical twin held in emergency reserve. For display, each cake was sliced and placed into individual monogrammed boxes. These prepared slices were then placed into larger, hand-painted boxes and finished with sugar paste icing to form the decorated layers of the cake.\nSTEVE JOBS (Turtleneck)\n\"I want to put a ding in the universe.\" ~ Steve Jobs\nBeginning life as the adopted son of working-class parents, Steve Jobs rose to the height of global business. His companies revolutionized several different industries and his countercultural vision reshaped much of the modern technological world.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a swatch of fabric from a black mock turtleneck owned by Steve Jobs. One of the earliest examples of what would eventually become Steve's trademark style, this turtleneck was worn by Steve at the 1991 PC Forum gathering. The turtleneck was sold by his personal assistant and purchased at a public auction.\nSPACE STATION MIR (Cosmonaut Food)\n\"Looking into the station I could see a lone ray of light shining through the port widow and outlining the dining table. It was the only time Mir looked warm, inviting, and spacious.\" ~ Jerry Linenger, NASA Astronaut on his arrival at Mir\nOften considered the world's first successful community in space, the space station Mir (\u041c\u0438\u0440) operated in low earth orbit from February 20th, 1986 until final reentry on March 23rd, 2001.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a selection of mission flown food prepared for the space station Mir. The menu includes items from both Roskosmos and NASA, including pork goulash, sausage, bread rolls, rice, tinned salmon, and hot cocoa. Each Mini Museum contains a \"complete meal\", with two dishes (carbohydrate and protein) along with a serving of hot cocoa.\nThank you so very much for taking the time to learn about the Third Edition of the Mini Museum!

I found traveling to be a tiring task and never quite found the perfect solution for really being able to rest on a plane or in a car.     \nFor years I searched to find a solution for forward head motion but nothing on the market seemed to work. I also designed many prototypes for travel pillows and blankets but nothing worked as it should.  All were too bulky and none solved the forward head motion issue. \nThe simple solution came to me while traveling on a plane to visit a friend.  When I arrived back home, I sat out to create my simple and effective design and wallah... the Nod Travel Pillow was born !\nI am very excited to bring this product to Kickstarter and see people everywhere enjoying real rest and comfort as they travel to their destinations all over the globe. This simple yet revolutionary designed product will soon change the way the whole world travels.\nThank you for your support of the Nod Travel Pillow and I hope you find yourself more comfortable,rested and refreshed on your next adventure.\nWishing you safe and restful travels,\nPaula Blankenship", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already aligned our resources for manufacturing the Nod Travel Pillow and have done our very best to mitigate the risks and challenges for this project and to realistically estimate delivery of your rewards for this campaign to everyone in a timely manner.

The only additional artwork that needs to be finished will be from stretch goals and pledge rewards. This will allow us to ship Jail Break as soon as possible. \n\nThe game itself has been play-tested for over an entire year with demo games being run from California, throughout the Midwest, and all the way to Florida. We know that Jail Break is ready for production. \n\nWhen the campaign is successful, we will immediately order sub-components from our distributors (dice, pawns, etc...) and will push for stretch goal card artwork and finalization of added game play mechanics. \n\nKnow that Paper Street has been proactive in making sure that the risks for production are extremely minimal if you choose to back this project.

This time, players take the roles of paleontologists in the late 1800's, competing to find the most lucrative dig sites, find the best bones and build the most unique dinosaurs for the world's most prestigious museums. \nThose were cutthroat times and these otherwise reasonable scientists did whatever it took to stand out from their peers. Sabotage and other notorious acts were not uncommon.\nPlayers are paleontologists collecting bones and building dinosaurs for the most prestigious museums. Each turn, in addition to collecting bones, players will select various actions to perform. Some actions will gain players notoriety - secret tokens ranging in value from 1-3. Notoriety is revealed and added to players' scores at the end of the game. But the player with the most notoriety is called out and their notoriety is subtracted from their score!\nBuilding dinosaurs using the discovered bones gives players a chance to unleash their creative side. The size and shape of your creations are limited only by your imagination!\nNote: While the art for these components is largely complete, the layout and graphic design is not.\nGame Board \nThe game board consists of the dig site hexes where bones are placed at the start of each round.The green and orange hex rows on the top and bottom are for 4- and 5-player games respectively. During the Field Phase, players move their paleontologists around the board collecting bones from the various sites (hexes). \nThe top of the board contains tables to track rounds and the values for different museum categories (size, ferocity, uniqueness, etc.).\nA scoring track outlines the board.\nBones\nBones are wooden 'sticks' in five colors that are placed in a drawstring bag. At the beginning of each round, bones are drawn from the bag and placed on the board hexes. Each color represents a different type of bone as shown in the following diagram (from the player screen). \nThere are 210 total 'bones' in the game.\nPlayer Screens\nPlayers build their dinosaur masterpieces behind their screens - safe from the prying eyes of their paleontologist opponents.\nThe inside of the screen gives tips on the different bone types/colors and which bones are used for the various museum categories.\nThere are five screens in the game - one for each player.\nNotoriety Tokens\nSome actions players take (dynamiting dig sites, stealing bones, etc.) gain them notoriety tokens. These tokens have values of 1 through 3 and are kept secret until the end of the game.\nPlayer Tokens\nEach player has a wooden meeple to represent their paleontologist on the board and a wooden cube of the same color to track their score. See the stretch goal before to upgrade these components.\nMiscellaneous Tracking Cubes\nCubes are used to track museum categories and the current game round. There is also a stretch goal to upgrade these cubes into dino meeples.\nDinosaur Bonus Scoring Cards\nPlayers can build their dinosaurs however they choose, but can score bonus points by matching the build on the selected bonus cards.\nThe Great Dinosaur Rush is played over three rounds. Each round consists of two phases - digging and building.\nDig Phase\nDuring the dig phase, players move their paleontologists over the board collecting bones, publicizing by adjusting museum categories and taking actions - sometimes notorious ones!\nActions include\nPublicize - Move a museum category up or down (same as standard publicize action)\nDonate - Discarde 1-3 bones back to the bag and lose a notoriety token of that value\nPublish - Draw a bonus dinosaur card (but be careful - unfulfilled cards at the end of the game are negative points!)\nNotorious actions gain players notoriety tokens and include \nSabotage - Take two notoriety tokens and place one under an adjacent dig site (space). If another player lands in that space, or passes over it, they take that token. Keep the other token for yourself.\nDynamite - Add three bones from the bag to your pile. Return any bones in your dig site to the bag and take a notoriety token.\nSteal - Take a bone from an adjacent dig site and place it in your pile. Take a notoriety token.\nBuild Phase\nDuring the build phase, players secretly build a dinosaur behind their screens using the bones they collected during the dig phase and on previous rounds. After all players have finished, the dinosaurs are revealed and scored based on different categories such as ferocity, size, length and uniqueness.\nPlayers score based on where the museum category is.\nIn the above example (again, not final art) the Length category (tail + spine) is worth 7 points for the player with the most bones, 4 to the player with the second most and 2 for the player with 3rd most. Ties are friendly (because nothing else in the game is friendly).\nFull rules for The Great Dinosaur Rush and more details on the game can be found at apegames.com/rush.\nHere are some of our favorite dinosaur pics from Gen Con and playtests:\nOkay, that last one isn't a strictly legit dino per the new game rules, but it's still pretty cool looking and shows how creative players can get!\nCheck out the APE Games blog for lots more dinosaur pictures.\nHave you played The Great Dinosaur Rush at one of our convention events and have some pictures of your own? Submit them at info@apegames.com and we'll feature them in future updates!\nFather Geek\nThe Great Dinosaur Rush is a great family game. So, Father Geek was one of the first reviewers that came to mind. To our great pleasure, they gave the game their Father Geek Seal of Approval!\n\"If you enjoy games where creativity and critical thinking are blended together, where an opponent is but one more aspect of the game to manipulate, and dinosaurs, then do sit down and play The Great Dinosaur Rush.\"\nFather Geek reviewers secretly building their dinosaurs\nYou can see more at the Father Geek site.\nThe Cardboard Republic\n\"We were particularly impressed with the uniqueness of the blended mechanics, we moved forward and have given it our game preview endorsement, the Seal of the Republic.\" - Ryan LaFlamme\nWe're thrilled and proud that Cardboard Republic enjoyed the game to the extent that they gave it their Seal of the Republic.\n\"Make no bones about it: The Great Dinosaur Rush is a splendid example of game design that is familiar enough to be easily learned while still finding ways to tread into new territory.\"\nRead all about it on the Cardboard Republic site.\nBoard Gamers Anonymous\nBoard Gamers Anonymous featured The Great Dinosaur Rush on their podcast, episode 93!\nRollin' Dice\nIt was really fun talking to these guys at Essen Spiele about The Great Dinosaur Rush and other new APE Games. You can see the YouTube interview here.\n$20,000 - Paleontologist Cards - UNLOCKED!\nLike several previous APE Games (Anathema, 1955, Rolling Freight), The Great Dinosaur Rush is loosely based on actual historical events. The Paleontologist cards bring to life the personalities of the time. Each card provides a special bonus for the owning player as well as historical text describing the influence the character had on the Bone Wars. \nThere are fifteen different 3\"x5\" paleontology cards. Each contains a special ability that the player gets for that game, a portrait and historical information for the character.\n$24,000 - Pith Helmet Meeples -UNLOCKED!\nWe'll upgrade the standard player meeples to have pit helmets! \nNot Available in retail games! These meeples won't be available in the retail version of the game, but Dino Rush backers will get them at no extra charge! (APE Games will sell these at conventions and from its website.)\n175 or More SPIRITS Backers - UNLOCKED! \nIf we reach at least 175 backers at the $34 SPIRITS BACKER level plus $75 ARCHAEOLOGIAN + SPIRITS levels, all Dino Rush backers (pledging $34 or more) will receive two special new promo cards created by APE developers Jonathan Madison and Shawn Macleod. For free! \n Not final promo card art.\n$28,000 - Dinosaur Markers - UNLOCKED!\nThe black cubes in the game will be upgraded to wooden dinosaur-shaped markers!\nNot Available in retail games! These meeples won't be available in the retail version of the game, but Dino Rush backers will get them at no extra charge! (APE Games will sell these at conventions and from its website.)\n$32,000 - Larger Game Board - UNLOCKED!\nWe got a lot of input from folks who've played the game that while the current game board is perfectly functional, it would great if it could be larger to showcase the great art by Mr. Cuddington. The board art IS really nice, so we're making the board larger with this stretch goal!\n750 Backers - All Linen Components - UNLOCKED!\nIf we get 750 total backers or more, we'll upgrade the board, cards and box to have a linen finish!\n$36,000 - Notoriety Token Bag (locked)\nWe currently play that all of the notoriety tokens are dumped on the table and turned upside down as part of game setup. This causes additional clutter on the table, and it adds a bit of setup time.\nThis stretch adds a second drawstring bag into the game for the notoriety tokens. Now you can keep the tokens in the bag between games, and draw one secretly without looking when performing notorious actions, cutting out both clutter and setup time!\n$44,000 - Second Game Map - (locked)\nWouldn't it be great if you could flip the game board over and have and have a different game experience? We've been testing an alternate game board layout, and the artist Mr. Cuddington is set to do the art at the start of December!\nFuture Stretch Goals\nWe have a few more ideas and will unveil info on these as the goals get closer. I think you'll like them!\nDinosaur Bone Upgrade?\nWe talked about making the dinosaur bones more bone-shaped but discarded the idea for a few reasons. First, there's a lot of game art that uses the current bone shape (wood sticks). To redo all of that would set back the schedule. Also, what shape IS a dinosaur bone? All different shapes and sizes, of course. The game needs for all of the bones to be the same size/shape so that they cannot be distinguished by touch while they're in the bag. Third, the bones fit together nicely as they are, for instance putting two bones side-by-side to create double-wide bones.\nDid you miss the Spirits of the Rice Paddy Kickstarter? Now you can get both games as part of The Great Dinosaur Rush Kickstarter and save 15%!\nSpirits of the Rice Paddy will ship to you in early 2016 (January) and will include the solo game components from the Spirits Kickstarter project. Shipping is free in the U.S.!\nFor more information about Spirits of the Rice Paddy, see apegames.com.\nHello everybody! My name is Scott Almes, your friendly neighborhood designer of APE Games' upcoming title, The Great Dinosaur Rush.  \nThe Great Dinosaur Rush is a very personal game for me, as when I was a kid I had a strong desire to be a paleontologist. Although I later decided on engineering (and game design!) I never stopped being fascinated with dinosaurs. However, as I grew older, I started to learn not only about the dinosaurs themselves, but also the people who discovered them. It didn't take me long to discover one of the most fascinating periods in scientific history: The Great Dinosaur Rush.\nThe Great Dinosaur Rush, also known as the Bone Wars, was a period in the late 1800's of intense fossil hunting. Two men led the charge: Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Both men started off as friends, both being driven by a desire to become the best and most well known paleontologist. But, after knowing each other for a short time, that same drive that founded their friendship would turn them against each other. The vast bone pits across the U.S. simply weren't big enough for the two of them.\nWhat resulted was one of the most infamous scientific feuds in history. These gentlemen scholars would slander each other in the press, sabotage bone bits to prevent the other man from digging there, bribe fossil hunters to divert bones to their attention, hire spies to keep track of their rival, and another other dastardly deeds to stay ahead. Even their respective employees would get into fights. There was an incident in Montana where their fossil hunting teams threw rocks at each other to keep the others away. Their rivalry was nasty until the very end. Edward Drinker Cope donated his body to science and asked that his brain cavity be measured and compared against Marsh's to prove that he was smarter. (This was, of course, at a time when brain size was thought to relate to intelligence) The feud would bring shame on the profession for a long time.\nNow, that's the theme I drew on for the game, but the gameplay isn't quite that nasty. It's just the background, and the play is perfectly suitable for families. In the game, players dig for dinosaur bones and assemble skeletons to show off at the museum. There's a simple market mechanism that's used to determine what the museum is looking for, and a streamlined set of instructions for how players can build a dinosaur. The dinosaur building is one of the most unique elements of the game. Besides a few rules, players are free to build their dinosaurs in any way they want. The museum defines different ways to score, but there's a lot of room for freedom in the game.\nHowever, a game with this theme must relate to the intense rivalry of the times, and that is fulfilled by the \"notoriety\" mechanic. When you are digging for bones, you can take powerful actions like digging with Dynamite or Slandering, but you must take a notoriety token when you do so. The notoriety has a random value on it, and the player with the most notoriety at the end of the game will lose points due to their infamy.\nI'm very proud of this game. It offers some unique gameplay experiences, as well as offers a glimpse into a time in history that is not well known. I hope you enjoy the game.\nHappy Digging,\nScott\nAbout the Artists\nAlso known for creating the art of Steampunk Rally, which was an instant hit on Kickstarter in Fall 2014, duo illustrators David Forest and Lina Cossette know a thing or two about making pretty games. You'll usually find them nested in their little countryside studio, seamlessly combining their talent under the name Mr. Cuddington. \nWhile APE can produce small games, like this year's Arcadia, without outside funds, we rely heavily on Kickstarter to produce bigger games like The Great Dinosaur Rush. Simply put, without you, Dino Rush won't get made.\nKickstarter is also a bellwether for games. Is The Great Dinosaur Rush as awesome as we think it is? You tell us with your pledge - or not!\nShipping is always tricky with Kickstarter projects. The price almost always goes up before the project ships, making it really hard to predict what to charge.\nThat said, we're keeping shipping FREE in the U.S. even though the trend seems to be to start charging a nominal amount as part of the project. \nWe lost considerable money on international shipping for our last Kickstarter, Spirits of the Rice Paddy, and cannot afford for that to happen again. We love our international backers and are keeping shipping as inexpensive as we can.  We will use a fulfillment company with warehouses in various global geographies.\nAlso, take heart that our games always find their way into distribution worldwide. So, if you find you cannot back us, you can get the game in your friendly local game store when it comes out.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAPE Games has successfully run and delivered all of our Kickstarter projects.

Each player takes on the role of an inventor and member of the eponymous Society of Eccentric Inventors. In their boundless wisdom, the Society has decided to put together a friendly competition to determine the greatest inventor among their ranks. To win that fine honor, inventors must manage their resources and eccentricities and watch out for spies, as each inventor creates remarkable inventions to impress and outdo his or her fellow Society members.\nAt the start of the game, each player chooses a specialty laboratory card. There are five specialty laboratories to choose from, each featuring a different inventor with a unique scientific specialty. Players can build supplemental laboratories and hire assistants and spies. Players assign their inventor and assistants to their own laboratories, and assign spies to opponents\u2019 laboratories.\nAt laboratories, players take actions to research (or draw) inventions and develop (or add) resources. Inventions are completed with different combinations of resources. Successfully completing inventions rewards players with esteem, and the player with the most esteem at the end of the game is the winner. Also, each completed invention gives a player a special ability to aid his or her quest to be crowned the greatest inventor.\nAlthough building inventions is the primary method esteem is earned, eccentricity and award cards present ways to score extra esteem. Meanwhile, incident cards represent life\u2019s random (and not so random) occurrences and alter play in interesting ways.\nThe Society of Eccentric Inventors Draft Rule Book (PDF, 5.79 MB)\nPLAY\n\nThe Society of Eccentric Inventors includes the following game components in each box:\nThe following upgrades will be added as more people back this project:\nYou may have noticed that the funding goal for this project is lower than many other tabletop game projects on Kickstarter. One reason it is set low is because all costs associated with game design and artwork for The Society of Eccentric Inventors have already been paid for by Mono Opti Games. Therefore, the primary purpose of this project is to fund the printing and shipping costs.\nAnother reason the funding goal is set relatively low is because printing will be handled by Print & Play Productions, a print-on-demand (POD) printer. For many tabletop games on Kickstarter, the funding goal is set high enough to cover the minimum orders required by traditional printers, often thousands of games. However, with a print-on-demand printer, a minimum order can be much smaller.\nA big advantage of working with Print & Play Productions is that they are based in the United States, while many traditional printers used for tabletop games are located overseas. The close geographic proximity between Mono Opti Games and Print & Play Productions significantly reduces the time frames required for proofing, printing, and shipping The Society of Eccentric Inventors compared to an overseas printer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter project has its own risks and challenges. Although we are a first-time creator, Mono Opti Games has been a backer of many tabletop game projects on Kickstarter.

It has been thoroughly designed, playtested, and balanced. The artwork is nearly finished and the game is almost ready for the printer. Without you, the backers, it can go no further. As such, we pledge to make the funding, production, and fulfillment processes as open as possible, and we are here to address any questions or concerns you may have.\n\nWe can\u2019t do this this without you.

Roll up! Come and see the greatest flea circus on Earth! Death-defying aerialists, mysterious magicians and jovial jugglers \u2013 Circus Flohcati has them all!\nCircus Flohcati, is an exciting, push-your-luck card game from famed designer, Reiner Knizia. During the game, players will attempt to collect all the acts required for a gala show that will be the toast of the town. But be careful! Risk too much and any ringmaster can go bust!\nWill you be cautious or cavalier? Will the audience flock, or will they flee?\nCircus Flohcati was first published in 1998 and has been released in various editions. Unfortunately, it has been out of print since 2006. Grail Games has worked hard to create a new version of this fun, fast game from Reiner Knizia (the designer of Samurai, Medici, Ra, etc.) for today\u2019s audience. With artwork by Heiko G\u00fcnther (Glory to Rome, Tesla vs Edison, The Dice Will Flow), we are asking for support to fund the production of this new, English language edition of the game for gamers and families to discover anew.\nPlease note that Grail Games only has the right to sell Circus Flohcati in certain English speaking countries. Therefore, only backers from the following countries may back the game: USA, UK, Canada, Australia & New Zealand.\nWhen you pledge your support for the game you will be receiving a classic Knizia design with the following improvements:\n\u27bc High quality cards and manufacture, \n\u27bc All new artwork (see below for more info),\n\u27bc Some small rule changes to bring the game in line with Dr Knizia\u2019s original vision. \nAs the game was re-printed by different publishers, some rule changes crept in over time. This edition will return the game to its originally designed rules set. The \u201cchanges\u201d include:\n\u27bc The \u201cRequest one attraction from an opponent\u201d card is no longer \u201crequest an attraction of a certain colour\u201d and instead, the attraction given is selected by the opponent who is giving up the card.\n\u27bc Ending the game with a \u201cGala Show\u201d will score that player a bonus 10 points.\n(To read the full rule book to the new edition, please see the \u201cHow to Play\u201d section, below.)\n\u27bc 80 Attraction cards, with the values 0 \u2013 7 in ten colours\n\u27bc 9 Action cards, 3 of each kind\n\u27bc A rules booklet\nAn example of each of the card types in the game!\n ...and here's a close-up of the Magician! Stay tuned to our upcoming campaign updates for more info and images of the splendiferous art!\nThe cards... will be 59mm x 91mm and 310gsm ivorycore card stock (unless we meet certain stretch goals \u2013 see below).\nThe box\u2026 will be 110 x 110 x 50mm and made with strong 1.5mm thick card.\nThe game is:\n\u27bc For 2-5 players\n\u27bc Ages 7 and up can play\n\u27bc About 15 minutes long\nShould we exceed our funding goal, the following improvements will be able to be made to the game. Thanks to your support, every copy of Circus Flohcati, now and in the future, will have the chance to include\u2026\nEach set of attraction cards will receive an extra depiction of the circus act being portrayed. This means each suit of eight cards will have two different illustrations on four cards each.\nEach set of attraction cards will receive an extra depiction of the circus act being portrayed.

This means each suit of eight cards will now have four different illustrations on two cards each. Nice!\nWant a beautiful, textured feel to your cards? Reaching this stretch goal allows us to print the games' cards on linen finish card stock.\nIvorycore card stock has a terrific thickness and \u201cspring,\u201d however, having the chance to print the game\u2019s cards on blackcore card stock would really give your circus a sense of class! This is the highest quality option our manufacturer provides.\n\u2026We hope to have the opportunity to announce more stretch goals as the campaign continues!\nIn Circus Flohcati, players try to complete sets of circus attraction cards before the game ends. A player begins her turn with several face-up cards to choose from. If she doesn't like them, she can draw another, but if she turns over a card that matches the suit/colour of one of the face-up cards, she loses her turn. She can continue drawing until she decides to take one, or if the drawn card makes a match.\nThere are two main ways to score points: During a player\u2019s turn she can combine three cards with the same number and lay them down in front of her. Such sets will be worth 10 points at the end of the game; additionally, the highest card from each suit left in her hand contributes its face value to her score.\nThe game ends, either, once the deck of circus acts is depleted, or when a player is able to perform a \u201cgala show,\u201d laying down one card of each suit to the table. These cards will score for her as above, but the player who ends the game in such a manner will also score a bonus 10 points.\n>> CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE COMPLETE RULEBOOK! <<\nOr, watch this How to Play video:\n (Please note this game was played using an older edition of the game.)\nThe earlier editions of Circus Flohcati have been enjoyed for many years.

Probably the game that they request the most is: Circus Flohcati.\u201d\nRead the rest of this truly delightful review by Ender\u2019s (then) 6 & 4 year old daughters here. \n\u27bc Lincoln from \u201cGame Night!\u201d says:\"Fun and quick with a nice amount of tension in your decisions. One of my favorite fillers.\u201d\n\u27bc The Dice Tower's Zee Garcia says:\n\"A cute and ultra-simple card game of set collection and pushing your luck. Easy to play, easy to teach, and over in about 15-20 minutes. This is a great filler.\"\n\u27bc Stephen Glenn (designer of Balloon Cup, 1st and Goal, Rattlebones, etc.) says:\n\u201cRanks just below 6 Nimmt as the best, light multi-player card game. Great tension for such a minimal design.\u201d\n\u27bc Phil Walker-Harding (designer of Sushi Go!, Cacao, Archaeology, etc.) says:\"A classic little card game that combines push-your-luck with set collection. Quick, easy and fun. Clearly the inspiration for the recent popular mobile game Dead Man's Draw.\u201d\n\u27bc BGG admin Chaddyboy says:\n\u201cGreat, light filler, with push-your-luck being the main appeal. Essentially, this is a set collecting game where you can either take one of the face-up cards, or flip cards until you find what you want. However, if you flip a card of a color that is already on display, you lose your turn completely. Good tension between going for a better card or busting!\u201d\n\u27bc The Gamer Nerd says:\n\u201cThe two basic strategies are to suck up the low point cards and get sets of 3 for 10 points each, or focus on getting the high cards and ending the game. Of course a hybrid approach of these two strategies works as well. There is tension as you press on for a better card, which is fun. \u201c Read the rest of the review here. \n\u27bc BGG User jm100 says:\n\u201cI consider this game a complete success for what it tries to achieve \u2026 I was extremely impressed with how fun and engaging the gameplay turned out to be. For those who like light card games, it\u2019s probably an essential purchase.\u201d Read the rest of the review here. \n\u27bc BGG User maksum says:\n\u201cI would say that Circus Flohcati should be in any collection of casual or family gamers. Likewise any serious gamer that likes to have lighter fillers around should have a copy on hand. I am just amazed how the designer pulled off a game with such simple rules and gameplay that provides such fun elements as press-you-luck, great decision making, memory, and enough luck to keep it light and interesting.\u201d Read the rest of the review here. \nAll pledge levels include all shipping costs! Because we use a fulfilment company that is down the road from our manufacturer\u2019s warehouse, shipping costs are severely reduced.\n* Those backers who pledge for copies of our previously released games will receive these approximately a month after the campaign ends. Circus Flohcati will ship after its manufacture is complete in April, 2016.\nPlease note that Grail Games only has the right to sell Circus Flohcati in certain English speaking countries. Therefore, only backers from the following countries may back the game: USA, UK, Canada, Australia & New Zealand.\nIt is possible for backers to increase their pledge amount to receive more than one copy of Circus Flohcati. To do this, simply increase your pledge by $19 for each extra copy you would like. This cheaper cost comes from the reduction in shipping prices per copy when multiple games are shipped in one package.\nFor example, to receive two copies of the game at the ROLL UP! ROLL UP! pledge level, simply increase your pledge to $40. For three copies, pledge $59. (That's $19.66 each!)\nTo add-on extra copies of One Zero One, Too Many Cinderellas or Matcha, please message us to let us know. Our stocks of these games are very limited, and if we have any left we will quote you your new pledge total.\n* Those backers whose pledges include copies of our previously released games will receive these approximately a month after the campaign ends.

On the way, you certainly expect to meet zany side show ladys, dodgy magicians testing how far they can push your gullibility, amazing acrobats working on the edge of certain death and a few other spectaculous characters, all in a fake-vintage (a.k.a. \"retro\") look. Hey. I'd like to work on a game with that theme.\nShortly after David approached me to do exactly that, a fellow designer told me how a collector from the Netherlands had given roughly 3 cubic meters of old wooden poster print letters into her care, to catalogue, sort, and use them as she pleases. Knowing my fondness of \"untidy\" typography, she asked if I would be interested in printing me off some of those. I was.\nAnd surely I had some fun there. With logo and general layout finished, we only had to find a solution for the \"fleas\" part of the theme. Luckily, putting flea heads onto all characters turned out a lot less creepy than anticipated (and indeed even more silly than I had hoped). Oy, long story short.\nI am having massive fun working on the new artwork for this game. David leaves me about any freedom a creative could wish for, all the while giving valuable feedback and input. Or maybe he is just incredibly smart in the ways he manipulates what I think I would like to do. Either way, the result is the same; It feels great working on this new edition and I am quite looking forward to the finished game. Even if you guys will not make the additional artwork stretch goals, I might finish them all the same, for David to decide what to do with them (Hehe...)\nThe Mike Line, published by Grail Games, is a collection of small-sized games that pack a punch. They offer depth and replayability for gamers and non-gamers alike, despite having few components.\nCircus Flohcati will be game number 5 in the line, which already includes One Zero One, Elevenses, Too Many Cinderellas and Matcha.\nMore information on the other Mike Line games can be found on www.grail-games.com or by watching review videos such as these\u2026\n\u27bc ONE ZERO ONE review by Bower's Game Corner:\n\u27bc ELEVENSES (currently SOLD OUT) review by Board Game Brawl:\n\u27bc TOO MANY CINDERELLAS review by The Dice Tower:\n\u27bc MATCHA review by The Dice Tower:\n\u27bc Follow Grail Games on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook!\n\u27bc Visit the Grail Games and Dr Reiner Knizia websites!\n\u27bc Visit Circus Flohcati on BGG for videos, forums, photos and more!\nGrail Games is a card and board game publishing studio located in Sydney, Australia.

See Update #10 for details on how to vote.\nBackers have been voting on content for 12 cards during the campaign.\nWe finished the artwork for the first 8 selected cards during the campaign, ...\n... and the artwork for the other 4 will be revealed in Update #13.\nJames Edgcomb, BoardGameGeek reviewer \u2014 \"I really enjoyed this game. It plays fast, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s easy to pick up. ... Your choices are not easy, and there is more strategy than I would expect from this style of game.\" (link)\nWorld's Fair 1893 is an area majority and set collection game for 2-4 players that plays in about 40 minutes. On your turn, you send a supporter to one of the fives areas and collect all the cards next to it. Choose carefully to collect the cards you need and also beat out your opponents for control in the various areas:\nMain Exhibits - Influential Figures - Midway Tickets\nThe main exhibit cards could earn you the most points, but only if you have the supporters you need in the matching area to get the exhibits approved into the fair.\nFavors from the influential figure cards will increase your supporters in the areas and help you approve the exhibits you've already collected.\nThe Midway ticket cards for the fun and profitable attractions score you a small number of points and move the game forward.\nYou can download and read a draft version of the full rulebook:\nIf you want to play World's Fair 1893 to see if it's a good fit for you, you can use our print-and-play (PnP) files to make a prototype. It requires 16 sheets of card stock to assemble:\nErik Dewey, Indie Cardboard \u2014 \"There is interconnectedness to everything in World\u2019s Fair 1893 which keeps the gameplay strategic [and] increases its weight beyond what you might expect.\" (link)\nScot Eaton, designer of Blend Off from Thunderworks\n\"The best [at Gen Con] was definitely World's Fair 1893. I was blown away. This is a unique blend of card drafting and area control/influence that had me engaged every step of the way! ... I'll be a day 1 Kickstarter backer.\"\nAgent Emme, BoardGameGeek reviewer (link)\n\"I was eager to try World's Fair 1893 because I had visited a special exhibit on the topic at the Chicago Field Museum last year. ... [It] lived up to my expectations. ... I was excited about the choices, and I like area control games that aren't super vicious.\"\nViking Ship - Tesla's Experiments - Olden Fruit Farm\nBrandon Nall, Brawling Brothers podcast (link)\n\"World's Fair 1893 is an elegantly designed game of area control and set collection that is certain to delight the masses. This has quickly risen to be a favorite for me to introduce people to our hobby because of its simplistic rules and complex mastery. Brilliant. Elegant. Fluid. World's Fair 1893 is a game that everyone should have in their collection.\"\nChris Kirkman, State of Games podcast (31:27-33:05, 1:46:00)\n\"It's easy to get into, and it has really good choices in it. ...

The game [pulls] you back in, making you want to play it back to back to back.\"\nChris Leder, designer of Roll For It! from Calliope Games (link)\n\"World's Fair is simply amazing. The gameplay is accessible and smooth, the theme is implemented in a perfect way, the art is gorgeous, and the wealth of strategy is immense. ... This is a truly unique and enjoyable game.\"\nApproval Tokens - Leader Medals - Midway Coins\nAnitra Smith, The Family Gamers (link)\n\"We loved this game. The artwork is beautiful, the cards are detailed, and the mechanics are relatively simple once we had played a few turns. ... World\u2019s Fair allows for plenty of competition, but also rewards second-place finishes, so it mostly avoids winner-take-all, cut-throat game play.\"\nPunching Cardboard, podcast episode (21:00-59:17)\n\"A lot of games could really learn something from [World's Fair 1893 about] flow. ... It goes around the circle and before you know it, the Ferris wheel has gone around, and you're scoring your first round. ... Fantastic. ... We just kept wanting [this game] to come out. ... It's a really good game.\"\nStart Space Podcast, Episode 58 (24:45-26:45)\n\"Playing this game was a really, really good time. ... What Ticket to Ride did for route building, what Carcassonne did for tile laying, I think World's Fair 1893 is going to do that for area control games. ... A really good, solid game.\"\nMoorish Palace - Bertha Palmer - Daimler Quadricycle\nMaurice Fitzgerald, Club Fantasci (link)\n\"Combining several different mechanics into a solid, lightweight euro, Foxtrot Games and designer J.

We previously raised funding on Kickstarter for two games, Relic Expedition in 2013 and Lanterns: The Harvest Festival in 2014.\n\u2014 About the Game Designer \u2014\nJ. Alex Kevern is a board and card game designer, best known for the recently released Gold West from Tasty Minstrel Games. During the day, Alex works as a Strategy Consultant for a Fortune 500 company. Alex lives in New York, where he enjoys playing sports with his wife Sara and throwing the frisbee for his dog Boomer.\n\u2014 About the Game Producer \u2014\nRandy Hoyt, as co-owner of Foxtrot Games, develops and produces board games, including the award-winning Lanterns: The Harvest Festival. He lives in Dallas, Texas with his wife and two young sons. He works as a web developer at a software company in his day job, and he will be handing the official communication for this campaign.\n\u2014 About the Artists \u2014\nBeth Sobel is an illustrator from Bellingham, Washington with an MFA in Painting from Savannah College of Art and Design. She illustrated our game Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, as well games from Stonemaier Games, AEG, Fantasy Flight, and more. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, reading, and a weekly board game group.\nAdam McIver, owner of The Cre8tive Dept, works full-time as an artist and graphic designer in the gaming industry. His work can be seen in games from Crash Games, Dice Hate Me Games, Green Couch Games, and more. He lives in Cincinnati.\n\u2014 ORGANIZER \u2014\nFor the ORGANIZER pledge level, we contribute $8 towards shipping costs for all backers. All rewards will ship from within the United States, and for backers in the United States this contribution covers all shipping costs. An additional amount will be added for backers in other countries: \n\u2014 DOUBLE ORGANIZER \u2014\nWe offer a slight discount on pledges for multiple copies of the game. For any number more than one copy of the game, you should use the DOUBLE ORGANIZER pledge level. The pledge amount will be automatically calculated for two copies, but you can pledge an additional amount for additional copies. Here is a chart showing the total pledge for multiple copies:\nFoxtrot Games would not exist without the amazing support and enthusiasm from our Kickstarter backers. It has been so rewarding to have so many of you join us to publish this game, Relic Expedition, and Lanterns, to interact with you on BoardGameGeek and Twitter, and to meet some of you in person at conventions and at game stores.\nAndrew Brooks, Lanterns backer \u2014 \u201cTo me, the ideal of what Kickstarter can achieve is a community of people supporting a vision they believe in and want to become a reality. Being a part of the Lanterns campaign and seeing the joy it brought to many (including the creators) proved to me that this ideal is still possible.\u201d\nThe Fisherman - Electric Fountains - Windmills\nThis project contains a number of items that might typically be added only as \"stretch goals.\" However, we are including these all right from the start: to reduce the risk of new artwork delays, to give you the best value we can, to thank you for backing early and for joining us for the full campaign experience, and to show you how much we believe in this game: \nUpgraded cards (310 gsm, linen finish)\nMore variety in Transportation card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Manufacturing card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Agriculture card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Fine Arts card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Electricity card art (7 new illustrations) \nMore variety in Midway card art (27 new illustrations)\nWooden Ferris wheel car marker (custom)\nFerris Wheel Car Photo \u2014 Ferris Wheel Car Marker\nWe are fortunate that our previous game Lanterns: The Harvest Festival did well on Kickstarter and has continued to sell well since. This has given us some profits that we can afford to put into World's Fair 1893 to include these additions right from the start \u2014 while still keeping the project's funding goal low.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing thousands of board games is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. There are a lot of steps in the process, and delays or setbacks could happen at any one of them. We have successfully navigated this process twice before.

Great customer service and communication. Thanks for an awesome kickstarter experience Foxtrot games!\"\n\n\u2014 Terry Wrightsman: \"WOW! The February 18th update was great.

A sophisticated and highly thematic deck that take inspiration from the tragedy of Macbeth by William Shakespeare, The Tudors and the history of human ethics.\nThe deck illustrates the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek to gain power through activities related to the underworld and dark faith. Furthermore, Indictus is a visual depiction of deception, ethical treachery and shadowy immoral shortcuts. Get off your moral high horse and start double-dealing.\nMonumental design that doesn't reveal itself as a deck of playing cards at first glance. You have to turn it to see the minimalistic pips in the layout. The two editions walk the same path to some extend, but I really want them to part ways in the finish by the use of unique embossing, foil and finish.\nClick to see high resolution album\nFor the Pristine edition my aim is to have it come across as a restoration of the original, antique Indictus deck. A re-make with beautiful, yet delicate updates to the tuck pattern. \nMonarch's orb on left side and pentagram on right side of tuck\nClick to see high resolution album\n                                                        The Antique edition is meant to appear as the original, heavily weathered Indictus deck of the Late Middle Ages. There's plenty of wear and tear in the design to make a really interesting embossing for this one. My aim is to have you feel the weathered condition of the tuck.\nMonarch's orb on left side and pentagram on right side of tuck\nClick to see the online album in HD\n                       Golden metallic ink accents utilised for the two-way and highly detailed designs, with microscopic differences in the layout to set them apart. There's a lot of spiritual and iconic symbolism going on here. Twisting in and out you'll locate royal scepters, orbs, pentagrams and a double headed snake finding its way towards the crown. Most noticeable you have the white and black borders between the two.\nThe decks are essentially identical when it comes to the number cards, courts and aces, only with minor cosmetic deviations in appearance. Displayed here below is a mix between the two decks for optimised comparison.\n\nThe indictus court cards are represented by 4 'hands', 4 queens and 4 kings. They are all in a perfectly aligned two-way design and accompanied by old latin phrases (that all start with an 'A').\nClick on image to inspect the cards in high resolution\nCard faces are clean and have rich ink application for the Pristine edition. For the Antique edition the faces are all the same, except for the weathered feel that has the black ink slightly faded. The 'dirt' layer on these cards is also in a two-way design, so no odd surprises there.\nThe illustrations are drawn in hand by Marksbart, but modified and converted to appropriate line art by me, so I can\u2019t take full credit for these. What I can do, though, is relay all positive comments to him and pay him for his talent - which I already did!\nFREE matching boxes are added to your rewards if you pledge for 6 or 12 decks. Both the half brick (6 decks) and the full brick (12 decks) are represented in the two editions, Pristine and Antique. The ornaments and details will be as close to the foil gold as humanly possible within the limitations of CMYK manufacturing. \nWant an all exclusive, one-of, box with your name implemented to the box design? You can have that by grabbing the SUPREME or ULTIMATE pledge tier.\nThe Jokers are identical for the two editions, so you are not missing out on any of the symbolic imagery. What do you think the deck is trying to say here?\nHere's also a great opportunity to feel the delicate differences of the face cards between the two editions. Which one is your favourite?\nSoft to the touch, the branded satin pouches are ideal for the storing of your Indictus decks or to be used as exclusive gift packaging. The deluxe satin pouches are manufactured in black and have gold foil icons hot stamped to represent the theme and style.\nNo additional shipping costs involved for this add-on\nThe pouches are manufactured specifically to hold one deck of poker sized playing cards. Grab two pouches to your pledge for great savings. Though it might seem odd to protect your worn Antique edition deck from further dust and scratches you have to admit that it really takes it to another level. \nYour choice of pouch version will be settled when project has ended\nSignature specifications are settled in the project survey\nI'll be signing and dating the decks with a white sharpie either on the intact cellophane or on the tuck itself (after removing the cellophane). The choice is yours, and I'll just lead the pen to where you want it to go. Also, if you don't want all your decks signed just let me know.\nIndictus Pristine edition uncut sheet\nUncut sheets come in 2 variations like the deck itself:\nPristine and Antique edition. Feel free to add as many as you want.\nPlease note the arrangement of cards is still work in progress.\nPreview. Layout is subject to final tweaks\nDealer coins have 2 sides representing the darkness and the divine light.\nThe coin feature all four latin phrases found within the deck itself.\n\nClick here to see a video on how you manage your pledge.\nPlease note that the signature add-on comes FREE with the SUPREME and ULTIMA pledge tier.

I have in-depth knowledge on printer companies and the strengths and weaknesses of each. I am an avid backer and know how things work. Take a look at my BIO to see more details and a personal rambling.\nCatching a breath of fresh air (and a carrot) out in the open\nThrough Indictus I hoping to tell a story of the shadowy union between the deceptive underworld and the european monarchy of the late middle ages. Betrayal, deceit, double-dealing. A deck of moral value, wealth and virtue that carries a message for subjective interpretation.\n\nIndictus will only be made with your support to help cover the costs of setup fees, proof charges, printing, design, freight, shipping and the time to create the 54 original pieces of art. I am launching this deck on Kickstarter as an artist, a cardist, and an active fan of the crowdfunding concept. Let's do this together and create something unique!\nAll artwork is basically complete and awaiting the result of Stretch Goals for final touches. I've set a plan to have all rewards delivered by February 2016 and here's how I am going to make it happen: \nAll decks will be printed by NPCC during October and shipped to me before December starts to be really cramped up with Christmas shipping. Then, as global postal service conditions have settled back to normal conditions I am going to start my fulfillment. This should allow all parcels to ship and transit without much hassle during January. If everything goes according to plan the decks should be well delivered to all backers by mid February. In other words I've made a plan with buffers and some wiggle room.\nPhoto of the backside of the Antique tuck box (click to see more images).\nI require top service, manageable production/import costs, and an efficient production flow. NPCC is the obvious choice for me for this deck project and I have a good communication with them. Working with NPCC will allow a great mix of above mentioned aspects\nI've tested the quality of their cards. Do you know their Branle deck? You can expect the same quality feel with Indictus. If for some obscure reason our cooperation fails, I will simply turn towards another printer and ensure the best possible deck quality and fulfillment for all backers.\n\nPresented artwork is subject to minor tweaks and updates, inspired by backer feedback and comments. Constructive criticism and feedback is very much appreciated as I love sparring on design.\nPhoto of the actual deck quality (click to see more images)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not my first kickstarter and I know how things work.\nAll presented features have been technically confirmed, and formally quoted by NPCC prior to launching this kickstarter.\n\nI've spent several months researching, designing and budgetting. However, obstacles can arise unexpectedly. Potential set-backs include production delays, shipping and sourcing issues. That being said, I feel extremely confident in my tested suppliers and the conservative timeline I've chosen. Buffers are added to the development plan because I'd love to deliver all rewards as promised, if not before.\n\nAs an experienced graphic designer, I've brought many complex products to my audience on time and with great feedback. There's nothing more important for me than getting your rewards delivered on time and as advertised.\n\nI have a long and extremely positive track record with the shipping company, Deutsche Post/DHL. However, 'force majeure' events do happen from time to time and this project budget does not allow expensive ensurance contracts in relation to unsuccesful shipping.\n\nPlease note that customs MAY carefully open your deck(s) during shipping and thus break the factory sealing/cellophane. These are standard procedure checks to make sure that the parcel contains what it says. This project budget does not allow me to replace any such inspected decks with a new ones, and I hope for your understanding in such event. I am not to be held responsible for damaged, lost, unclaimed, opened or destroyed parcels. Shipping is handled with Deutsche Post and sent without tracking ID.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Volume III: Culminus", "update_content": "Dear backer of Indictus\n\nThere's a good change that you already heard these news via my Dominus project, but I just wanted to make sure that all my supporters got the news that volume III in my Light versus Darkness series, Culminus, has now launched on Kickstarter.\n\nCulminus Playing Cards was funded in 6 hours and reached 3 stretch goals in 48 hours with the help from more than 400 backers!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Uncut reserves", "update_content": "Dear backer of Indictus\n\nThanks for all the positive and encouraging comments in my inbox!\n\nI've been counting the uncut sheets I have left from this project, and I still have 5 of each edition left.

We remembered all the wonderful things about each other and kept talking and hanging out. \nLast month we asked you if you would be interested in some new Vermillion Lies material. You said \"YES!!!\"\nThis April we met in New Orleans, Louisiana and started to write and record some new songs. We sang together real nice. We played guitar, synthesizer, and weird percussion.

(A One Hit Kill.) It draws from traditional card games like gin and poker, along with European-style games like Catan and Ticket to Ride. We classify it as mid-Atlantic.\nOne Hit Kill is easy to learn and fast-moving: no hit points, no mana, no need to consult the rulebook. Its simple rules allow for surprisingly complex strategy. We\u2019ve playtested it with ages 8 to 78. Everyone quickly gets it, experienced gamers and newbies alike. \nThe game was created by John August and the team that brought you Writer Emergency Pack, with illustrations by amazing artists who\u2019ve worked on top fantasy games. \nTo get the game first. We'll be shipping One Hit Kill to Kickstarter backers in September. This may be your only chance to get the game in 2015.\nTo shape the future of OHK. From Magic to Munchkin, great games evolve based on their early players. With expansion packs, forums and Maker's Kits, we want you to help chart the course for One Hit Kill.\nTo support Kickstarter projects that ship. We're the same team that created Writer Emergency Pack, which shipped months early to the delight of backers. Here's a selection of what they wrote:\nWe think One Hit Kill might become your new favorite game, so please help us make it a reality.\nThanks!\nA game of One Hit Kill usually takes about 10 minutes, so you can squeeze in a few rounds at lunch \u2014 but it\u2019s also perfect for game nights with friends.\nWe recruited 30 players of all levels to try out an early build. Here\u2019s what they wrote afterwards:\nWe had an amazing experience launching Writer Emergency Pack on Kickstarter last year. For a few months, it was the most-backed card project in Kickstarter history. That momentum let us scale up in ways that would have been impossible otherwise. This year Writer Emergency Pack will be in 2,000 classrooms, 50 countries and several major retailers, including Amazon. \nOne Hit Kill is a very different project, larger in scope in several ways. \nFor starters, we\u2019re bringing in amazing artists to illustrate 82 cards. We also have a vision for the future. In addition to the core game, we\u2019d love to release expansion packs on a regular schedule so the game can continue to grow and evolve. \nSome of our first expansion packs may include Pirates & Zombies, Lovecraft & Austen, and Apocalyptacular! Each one changes the game in exciting ways, opening new strategies and keeping the game fresh. \nIn order to offer expansions, we need a sizable base of players from the start. That's why our future goals are based on backers, not dollars:\n                     And something brand new:\nYou can make these goals happen by hitting achievements. Some couldn't be easier.\nOur Facebook page loves Likes: facebook.com/onehitkillgame\nOur Twitter feed will reward your following: @onehitkillgame\nFor Vine videos, you can use #onehitkill and #portaltonowhere hashtags to mark them.

He\u2019s written seven movies including Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Frankenweenie. He\u2019s the co-host of the Scriptnotes podcast, creator of Writer Emergency Pack, and surprisingly good at Labyrinthspiel. \nDustin Bocks illustrated all of the Component cards, and created the class icons. He knows an astonishing amount about the Harry Potter universe. \nNoah Bradley is well-known for his illustrations for Magic: The Gathering and many other fantasy games. You can find information about his upcoming project The Sin of Man on his website, along with articles and videos for aspiring artists.\nMatthew Chilelli composed the amazing music for our video. He has punched fewer than two grizzly bears.\nSimon Estrada is an illustrator and character designer who has worked on projects for Hasbro, Saban and The Jim Henson company. For us, he designed the Scriptnotes tour shirt and a yet-to-be-released animated short. You can find his portfolio at his site.\nStuart Friedel is a master playtester and shipping ninja. His father, Lee, is a dentist. \nChristina Hess works as an illustrator and designer in the publishing industry.

We\u2019ve printed sample decks and playtested it with a bunch of strangers of all backgrounds and experience levels. We know it\u2019s fun. \n\nWe have our artists on board. They\u2019re amazing, and we have a schedule for getting stuff done. \n\nWe also know how to print things. We\u2019ve made and shipped 18,000 Writer Emergency Packs, using printers both in the U.S. and China. \n\nDespite our best planning, problems may still arise: printing delays, Kaiju monsters, gamma ray bursts that knock civilization back to the Stone Age. But short of global catastrophe, we should be okay. We've built in contingencies for budget and schedule that should get us through. \n\nThere's a chance we won't reach our funding goal. That would be a bummer. We would reevaluate and figure out how to do this better. \n\nThere's the chance the response could be so large that we are overwhelmed with orders. We\u2019ve been talking a lot with our friends at Exploding Kittens about their experience, and will benefit from everything they\u2019ve learned. \n\nBottom line: If stuff comes up, we'll fix it, and we will tell you.

Another thing that isn't exactly specified (even though you guys were very specific in the rules on what the discard pile is for), do the remaining players get a final chance to build their weapon on the game ending turn? Short answer, hack it. And I see below some people are going after all the weapons cards to try to make a match with whatever they already have in their hand starving other players of available weapons cards. Hack it, instead set a limit. Say 2-player no more than 10 weapons cards allowed per player, 3-player max 7 weapons, and 4-player max 5 weapons. In a 4-player game if you draw 5 weapons, at that point you got to build one of them.

It is most suited for players aged 12-93. Estimated game time is 25-35 minutes.\nGAME CONTENTS\n1 Faux Book Container\n111 Cards (15 Town Hall, 36 Tryal, 59 Playing, 1 Moderator Script)\n1 Thirty-second Hourglass\n1 Instruction Manual (Includes character biographies)\n14 Circle Tokens\nWELCOME TO SALEM\nWho needs a game closet? Hide Salem on your bookshelf.\nThe year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. \"Salem\" takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.\nThe game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.\nPlayers can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.\nPlayers, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, \"Witch\" or \"Not a Witch.\"\nDuring gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all \"Witch\" Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.\nPlayers can also use green and blue cards such as \"Alibi\", \"Stocks\", \"Matchmaker\", \"Asylum\", and \"Scapegoat\" to help or hurt their allies or enemies.\nAs players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, \"Night\", forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate and the Constable chooses someone to potentially save. The other black card, \"Conspiracy,\" forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise \"Conspiracy\" may soon have the whole town turned evil.\nBefore long, accusations will be flying, and screams of \"She's a WITCH!\" will wake the neighbors. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.\nTHE GAME\nTOWN HALL CARDS\nAll cards are top-quality 310gsm ivory core (premium)\nTRYAL CARDS (note the old spelling)\nPLAYING CARDS\nFAUX BOOK, HOURGLASS\nFaux Book is the game container and closes magnetically.\n TESTIMONIALS\n\"Salem is an awesome group game and never gets old! Every game you assume different roles, and with the design of the game, things are constantly changing. Right when you think you know who the witches are, cards start getting passed around. The game Salem requires strategy and teamwork. You will really get to know your friends.\" -Jayson Jensen, Computer Guy\n\"Salem has just the right amount of challenge so that it makes you think and strategize at how to win. Anyone who likes Mafia or games that involve moderately sized groups of people playing to the death will love this game! It's a great game to play with a good group of friends at a party or after dinner. Super fun and I totally recommend it!!\" -Mary Nichols, Music Major\n\"Your friends may become your enemies, your enemies may become your friends, but you can never be sure. Besides being a ton of fun to play, Salem is also a visually stunning game which sets it apart from other mystery games. I give it 5 stars.\u201d -Ben Nielsen, Social Media Guru\n\"What an incredible game! I want to play it over and over again because each game presents new and exciting challenges. I love that it accommodates a small group of friends in addition to a big crowd which makes it perfect for any event. Once the game is over, you won't be able to stop talking about it.\" -Whitney Jensen, School Teacher\n Salem News:\nhttp://boardgaming.com/news/board-games-on-kickstarter-mar-26\nhttp://breacher18.com/killer-kickstarters-april-2015/\nhttp://initiativetabletop.com/2015/03/30/guest-post-kickstarter-preview-salem/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SalemCardGame?ref=hl\nhttp://www.purplepawn.com/2015/04/crowdfunding-highlights-21/\nhttp://geekdad.com/2015/04/kickstarter-salem/\nhttp://trollitc.com/2015/04/kick-the-box-april-6th-2015-edition/\nhttp://www.sweetkickswithbricks.com/sweet-kicks-with-bricks-40-salem\nhttp://sameroomgaming.tumblr.com/post/116998449969/mafia-and-werewolf-re-imagined-in-salem\nhttp://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/4/2/6/42672290425aa393/DTN393-DiceTowerNews-Episode393.mp3?c_id=8806282&expiration=1429421492&hwt=75727e7bc98d2cfe8e5ceffa8edfcc7e \n  http://www.gameskinny.com/d4z5s/interview-with-designers-of-witch-trial-game-salem\nHOW TO PLAY\nRules Note: Full instructions and further clarifications are included in the Game's instruction manual. Of our hundreds of play-testers, each felt that the game was very easy to learn and each felt quite knowledgable of the rules after their first game.\nModerator Note: Since we hit our $55K stretch goal, tokens have been added to each game, allowing for each game to be played with, or without a Moderator.\n GAMEPLAY DEMO\n Demo Note: Here we show 4 players, although up to 12 players can play. The demo does not show the use of tokens, since these were recently added as a stretch goal to better accommodate games without a Moderator. The tokens do not change gameplay.\nThe video may not show this clearly, but at the beginning of the game the witches see who each other are when the Black Cat is played. They also see each other when they eliminate someone during the Night. A big part of the witches' advantage and deception comes from their extra knowledge about who everyone is. \nTokens are used in the Night rounds to indicate who was killed, and who was saved.\nStrategies: The townspeople try to find the witches based on how people are acting (some people are good liars, some people are not!), how people are treating each other (since the witches have a secret alliance with each other), who people are playing cards on, whether witches themselves choose to confess after the Night, etc. Players can also analyze who was given the black cat and who was killed during the night and why. Also, since the first law of Salem says that you can never play a card on yourself, the only way to play the game is with allies. You can't win the game without trusting someone else. So a lot of the game is about you individually choosing who to place your trust in. \nThere's also an element of the shell game involved- if I am a witch, would I put my witch card closest to my neighbor or near the middle? Did I move the Tryal card I got from Conspiracy to a new location in front of me or keep it in the same spot? Where should I put my Witch card so that my neighbor will be most likely to grab it during Conspiracy and join me as a witch? \nThere's also an element of deck management. If everyone holds on to their cards, then when the deck runs out and the discard pile gets re-shuffled, Night and Conspiracy are going to happen again very soon, since the new deck is so small. It's in the townspeople's best interest to move quickly. It's in the witches' best interest to run through the deck and hold on to their cards.\nIn Mafia/Werewolves the only data points you have are how people are acting. In Salem, you have more data points to go off of, since you can analyze how people are acting, and what cards they are playing on who. There's also a hint of logic with tracking the Tryal cards as they move around the circle. As a person's Tryal cards get revealed, and they keep coming up \"Not a Witch\", they develop a stronger and stronger alibi and become a less desirable target.\nFeel like we missed something?

Mechanics\nGrowing up, I always loved playing \"Mafia\" at family reunions. It was the best kind of game- one that involved reading other people and hiding your own role from people who knew you very well. It was a challenge. Over time I grew frustrated over several aspects of the mafia game. There wasn't an official structure to the game, the game always required a moderator, someone always had to die right at the beginning, rounds could drag on forever, there was no way to partially accuse someone, etc. Salem aims to right these wrongs while still bringing forth a new game that captures the essence of the Mafia spirit. \nWe have also enjoyed games such as \"Bang\", \"Ticket to Ride\", \"Betrayal at House on the Hill\", and \"Werewolf\" and have brought the best parts of each of these games into \"Salem,\" while also adding completely new game mechanics. Every round of play-testing led to more and more tweaking, adding, and eliminating. We're very happy with the end result.\n2. Theme\nHalloween has always been my favorite holiday. Something about the theatricality and intent to frighten just seems to heighten the stakes. We felt that the Salem Witch Trials captures this feeling perfectly. The old Protestant strictness, the spooky northeast, and a cast of characters that has been studied and been made larger than life through pop culture take this game beyond the mechanics and into the imagination. \nFor whatever reason, \"witch hunting\" has become a common phrase in our everyday life, in news stories, and in politics. We felt that using the most famous example of witch hunting would naturally lend itself to a game like this one. The accusations, defenses, and instinct of self-preservation that can be found in the history of Salem seemed to be the perfect setting for our game.\n3. Design\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and the graphic design from Holly will take you into the world of Salem, just as a piece of literature, music, or film would do. We used a lot of browns and textures, to make it feel like entering a world of dirt roads, wooden churches, and town squares. \nNote the crosshatch design patterns on the bonnet and dress.\nFor the characters and card illustrations, Sarah employed a crosshatch method to give the characters dimension while still retaining the texture consistent with the game. In the graphic design, Holly used Old-Style fonts, reimagined the city seal of Salem, and used a 17th century quilting pattern across many of the card backgrounds.\nWHAT WILL THE KICKSTARTER FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nIf we reach our goal, Holly and I will be able to pay for the manufacturing  and shipping of the first edition of faux books, card decks, hourglasses, and instruction manuals. We already have our manufacturers (Yifeng Packaging, Panda Manufacturing) lined up and ready to go! We just need to raise the funds and say go!\nThis first edition will turn one of our long-loved projects into something that our friends, families, and backers can enjoy.\nFOR ALL GAME RETAIL STORE OWNERS:\nWe understand that demand for Salem in game stores will be very high right when the game first gets into the hands of our backers. If you would like to reserve the right to purchase Salem copies at a special retail rate, please send me a direct message that includes your store website, email, and how many copies you'd like me to hold for you.\nA couple of weeks before we ship games to our backers, I'll make sure that you still want the games you've reserved, take payment, and ship them to you soon after we've shipped the games to backers.\nTHE CREATORS\nGame Creation and Graphic Design by Travis and Holly Hancock. \nIllustrations drawn by Sarah Keele.

Is there a plan put in place for none witches on the brink of losing ( have one or two trials left) to not scramble like mad just to become a witch themselves ( deliberately try to draw/exchange cards with known witches in the hope of becoming a member of team witch just so they can win the game as a member of team witch. As I know for me personally if I were playing a 4-5 player game and I was a non witch with only 3 or fewer trials left and it looked like I was going to lose, I'd be trying like mad to swap trail cards with people I had a good idea were witches in hopes of getting a witch card so I could join the winning side. Is there perhaps a way like a special character type (ie a priest) That can potentially cleanse a witch. Like perhaps during the night phase after the witches select their target, and the constable selects theirs, the priest then selects a player to cleanse (with the condition being unlike the constable a witch cannot become a priest and the priest ignores witch card. That way there is always at least 1 non witch. As like I mentioned extremely rare in 7-9 player games, almost impossible in 10-12 player games unlikely in 5- 6 player games, I can see 4 player games where players try to break the game and all try and become witches just so that they can all win.

All 9 Stretch Goals Unlocked! (See below)\nHave you ever dreamed of building a super awesome treehouse? Now it\u2019s time to live that dream! In Best Treehouse Ever, players compete to build the best treehouse in the neighborhood. Players will outfit their treehouse with the coolest rooms, all while making sure their tree doesn't tip over\u2026and that their rooms are the most impressive at the end of the game. Building takes place over three weeks/rounds, and at the end of the third week the winner will be the player with the best treehouse ever! \nImage enlarged to show detail.\nEach round, players use card drafting and spatial reasoning to add 5 new rooms to their treehouse. Players must pay attention to the other treehouses being built since they will take turns determining which types of rooms score for everyone at the end of each round.\nGame set-up for a 4 player game at the beginning of Round 2.\nBest Treehouse Ever is small box card game that appeals to a wide audience. This game will satisfy gamers and families looking for a quick, easy-to-teach experience that provides player interaction on every turn.\nBest Treehouse Ever is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up and plays in about 20-30 minutes. The game is designed by Scott Almes (Tiny Epic Kingdom, Tiny Epic Defenders, Tiny Epic Galaxies, Harbour, Kings of Air and Steam, and Martian Dice).\nHere's a super fun stop-motion how-to-play video from Stikfa-mations by Greg Cornell:\n And check out this how-to-play video from Rich Mullholland's Treehouse in South Africa:\n Kickstarter Promo Pack Contents:\nClick images below for full content!\nClick the image to see Rahdo's Runthrough!\n\"There's a little story that's being told. You really feel a nice sense of accomplishment. And it's very different and unique.\" -Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through\n\"What really makes the game, though, is the scoring. Although you can use the scoring rules for younger players, I think the Game Changers are what really make the game fascinating and they add a nice strategic element to the game beyond just finding the best place to put rooms...this is another cute game that\u2019ll be fun for both your kids and your adult gamer friends. Even if you don\u2019t win, you\u2019ll have fun putting together a crazy treehouse anyway.\" -Jonathan Liu, Geek Dad\n\"The cool thing with this game is not only does it look good, it plays good. For me, I feel that it appeals to a wide spectrum.\" -David Taylor, To The Table\n\"Drafting is one of my favorite mechanics, Scott Almes is one of my favorite small game designers, and Green Couch Games is slowly becoming one of my favorite publishers. Put them all together and you have Best Treehouse Ever - a light, family friendly card game that fully immerses you in its quick and charming game play. It has quickly supplanted Sushi Go as our family\u2019s drafting game of choice. Don\u2019t miss a chance to fulfill a childhood dream! If you\u2019re a fan of fun, I highly recommend you check out Best Treehouse Ever.\" -Dan, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Best Treehouse Ever is an easy pitch for anyone who likes enjoyable filler games, a nice spatial puzzle, and who has a little bit of imagination leftover from their childhood. One step above others in its grade, Best Treehouse Ever makes simple drafting enjoyable by forcing quick and easy, but still meaningful decisions about card placement and scoring bonuses. The total package blends together to make a vibrant and heartfelt game that is difficult to play just once.\" -Buns, League of Nonsensical Gamers\nListen to Green Couch Games founder, Jason Kotarski interviewed on the League of Nonsensical Gamers Podcast here!\n       \"Overall, Best Treehouse Ever may very well be one of the best fillers to come out since 2013\u2019s Sushi Go!. It has that \u201cclassic card game filler feel\u201d of No Thanks, Bucket King, Coloretto, For Sale, and of course Sushi Go. Not only does it have like classic feel vibe, but it has the same brightly colored art and light theme as some of those as well, adding all the more to that \u201cclassic filler feel.\u201d \" -Ryan Sanders, The Inquisitive Meeple\nYou can also read Ryan's interview with designer, Scott Almes here!\n\"Best Treehouse Ever is a nice little step up from Sushi Go: lots of drafting, with some nice scoring strategy thrown in. It's got a great learning curve, streamlined mechanics, and it packs a lot of fun into a great theme! I'm a big fan!\" -Jeremiah Isely, Theology of Games\n\"As the kids get older and family time gets crunched, short and fun filler games become more and more valuable. Best Treehouse Ever fits the bill. I have no idea how much longer my kids will love this game. But they do so love it. So I do, too.\" -Scott Firestone, Theology of Games\n\" I feel the game is a great game for the first or last of the night or while waiting for another group to finish. I also see it being a huge hit with families.\" - Ken Grazier, Geek-Craft\n\"Best Treehouse Ever is a fantastic, lightweight family game. It\u2019s easy to teach, fun to play and at the end you are left with a feeling of accomplishment. You\u2019ve actually built a treehouse right in front of your eyes!\" -Brandon Kempf, What Did You Play Last Week Podcast Thing (listen to the podcast here!)\n\"This game is great! We all absolutely loved it. We were able to squeeze in a game while packing up our house to get in ready to sell and still felt we had a fun.\" -D. Eric Ortega, Board Domination\nRead Board Domination's interview with Scott Almes about Best Treehouse Ever here.\n                                              Listen to Jason and Andy from the 20 Minutes of Filler Podcast chat with Scott Almes here!\n\"I've played the prototype of this game and it is AMAZING! Light, but thoughtful and (of course) looks outstanding!\" -David Palomares, BGG User\n\"Best Treehouse Ever! - an amazing card drafting game...Seriously, look at that art and try not to grin like an eight-year-old at a toy store. I feel like Phineas and Ferb when I play this!\" -Chris Leder, game designer of Roll For It! and Trainmaker\nMore info and reviews available at BoardGameGeek.com\nAs we get closer to our funding goal, we'll be announcing some sweet STRETCH GOALS to keep the party going. We have plans to add value to Best Treehouse Ever that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components, including more great art, and increasing replayability with added game content.\nWe have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our first campaign for Fidelitas, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.\nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.\nUNLOCKED! Adding linen finish to the game cards gives a great tactile dimension and polished look to the product making your Treehouse just a wee bit fancier! We shot past our funding goal to $16,500! Upgrade activated!\nUNLOCKED! These Bonus Cards add a new layer to gameplay! Intended as a variant, hidden goal cards will provide a new challenge and lots of extra replayability when adding this 6 cards mini-expansion to every copy of Best Treehouse Ever.\nUNLOCKED! We get to put the talents of Adam McIver to work once again to add more rooms to the Treehouse! 12 additional rooms will add more of the fantastic art that helps make this game so special. Instead of 24 unique rooms and 3 copies of each in the deck, we'll be looking at 36 rooms with only 2 copies of each. \nUNLOCKED! We will upgrade 4 of the wooden octagon tokens to custom acorn meeples to use for the Balance Markers! Everybody likes custom wooden bits, right? These little things will add a whole new level of cuteness/thematic integration to the game components.\nUNLOCKED! Advanced Bonus Cards! These add yet another small twist on the gameplay of our little game; 6 new cards but you get more points for building them higher in the tree! These cards will be delivered in a plastic sleeve outside the box and will not be included in the retail version of the game. They may become available later on at conventions and online, Kickstarter backers get them first!\nUNLOCKED! At $37,500 every Treehouse Room in the game will be unique! That's double the amount of cards currently in the game. 72 rooms of Treehouse fun! \nUNLOCKED! 4 more cards added to the promo pack (available first to our awesome backers before anybody else) will open up new scoring possibilities! For this variant, players will be able to choose from 2 additional Game Changer Cards (2 copies of each will be included) types; 1 that will allow a player with the least amount of a specific room type to be the only player to score that type, and another that allows a player with the most of a room type to be the only one to score it.\nIt would be nice if the kids actually had a way to get into the treehouse! Adam will spend some time adding ladder illustrations to the Starting Tree Cards! Each ladder will match one of the player colors!\nUNLOCKED! These are going to be cool! And we're working on a couple different ways to use them! They'll be included in the Promo Pack with the Advanced Bonus Cards and Advanced Game Changers that will only be available to Kickstarter backers at first!\nIf you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the Rules PDF RIGHT HERE! \nThe rules are hosted on BoardGameGeek and will require a free account to download. But if you like games, BGG is the place to be so head over there now to get plugged into the world-wide gaming community! \nIf you've read the rules and are still on the fence please check out free the Print & Play version of Best Treehouse Ever! This way, you can try the game out and if you like the experience then come on back to pledge for a full production copy! \nWe believe in this game and know that if you give it a chance you'll see the love and attention we've put into developing it for game tables around the world. So get on board and give it a go! See for yourself if Best Treehouse Ever is for you. \nBest Treehouse Ever is available world-wide and all copies will ship from within the US! Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location.\nAdded Shipping: US-$3, CA-$9, Everywhere Else-$12\nNote: International Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. However, this campaign is CUSTOMS FRIENDLY. The low price point and small box for this game should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1-2 copies. We have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor and we must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail. We are saying THANK YOU to our early adopters on Kickstarter by offering the game at a price below MSRP ($20) and adding some extra content at no extra charge (when we reach STRETCH GOALS, of course).\n Scott Almes is the designer of the successful Tiny Epic series (Gamelyn Games), as well as other hits such as Harbour, Martian Dice, and Kings of Air and Steam.

And so far I have been able to avoid delays and common pitfalls by paying special attention to the following areas and building on previous experience:\n\nArt and Design. The art and design for the game is well on it's way to completion so we'll be ready to print shortly after the close of the campaign. I wanted to show you I mean business by paying for the art and design upfront!\n\nPlaytesting and Reviewing. Best Treehouse Ever has been tested by many different groups and has been played at Unpub. I have sent out more than 30 prototypes to reviewers around the world. I want to earn your trust by providing you with a solid product that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by folks from varying backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nPast Experience. This is only the second Kickstarter project I've run for Green Couch Games but I have helped with several other successful campaigns. Also, having spent many years working in retail and customer service, I understand the importance of treating backers with respect and following through with projects.\n\nOf course, there are always unexpected circumstances that pop up, but I PROMISE to communicate every step of the way and do my best to use creative problem solving meet the challenges head on.\n\nThank you so much for giving Green Couch Games a chance. As a small company, I truly can't do this without you. I will do my best to thank you by creating great little games that you love to play.\n\nSincerely, \nJason Kotarski, founder of Green Couch Games\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Last call for Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun is into the last HOURS of our Kickstarter campaign. \nBack it here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2005228768/best-treehouse-ever-forest-of-fun-by-scott-almes"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun now UK and EU Friendly!", "update_content": "Alright!\nBest Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun is now UK and EU Friendly!\nI've been hunkered down at the Green Couch Games Command Center trying to find a better solution for our UK and EU friends.

Every train has to start with an engine and a train car. Will you take it easy and make a small train, or push your luck and reroll the dice to build a mighty train? Choose carefully, because if you can\u2019t add to your train after rolling or finish the train with a caboose, you derail, and your turn ends! More details in the Overview Section.\nTrainmaker is designed by Chris Leder, who is quickly moving up the ranks in the industry with his hit game Roll For It! by Calliope Games and his upcoming City of Gears by Arcane Wonders. \nWhy Pledge Now?\nDiscount - By backing Trainmaker you will get your copy at a nice discount. The MSRP for Trainmaker will be $25, plus you are getting a $7 shipping credit (Free Shipping within the U.S.). That means that by pledging now, you will save more than 35%.  \nBackers First - We have made it a priority in the past, and will continue to in the future, to ship games to backers before we open up sales to the public. It is only fair that those that helped make the game happen get their copies first!    \nYour Feedback - We value your thoughts and ideas. Honestly it is what keeps us coming back to Kickstarter. Getting customer input before manufacturing is an invaluable asset to us!  \nStretch Rewards - By backing Trainmaker you will actually affect the outcome of the final game. The more we raise, the more that can be approved or added. See the \"Stretch Goals\" section for more details.  \nWe Simply Need You - Your continued support will allow us to pay for a large print run of what we feel is a fantastic product and help us ship it all over the world.\nTrainmaker will now be manufactured by Panda GM. Panda GM is the industry standard in board game manufacturing. Our choice to use them is a direct reflection of my desire to make Trainmaker the absolute best it can be. \n If we fund, we promise that Trainmaker will be a thrilling and rewarding experience for you and your family and friends. However, if we overfund, we will be able to expand the game in both quality and quantity. You see, the more we raise, the more units we will be able to manufacture. This equates to a lower unit cost. These savings WILL be added back into the game in the form of additional content and better-quality components. Below are these additional goals and rewards:\nAll Aboard is a quick solo game designed by Chris Leder. It is played with the train meeples and dice from the game. Chris is known for his one card game designs as he had a successful one released with Roll For It! last year.\nLawmen vs Robbers is a two-player game designed by Jonathan Gilmour, the designer behind the hit Dead of Winter. It plays a bit like Liars Dice, but with each player in the role of either Lawman or Robber. Each having their own distinct powers. Will include 2 all new role cards with all new artwork.\nThis will include a nice linen finish on the box itself.\nRail Tycoon is a 2-5 player game designed by Stephen Avery, the designer behind the hit Nothing Personal. In Rail Tycoon players will use almost all of the games components in a new way. This is a dice driven and card melding good time! Will include 5 all new tycoon cards with all new artwork.\n7 Custom-Molded Dice\n40 Station Cards 300gsm Unlocked!\n12 Contract Cards 300gsm Unlocked!\n6 Custom Train Engine Meeples Unlocked!\n2 Reference Cards 300gsm Unlocked!\n2 Piece Setup Box\nBONUS All Aboard Mini Game designed by Chris Leder!\nInstructions \nTrainmaker will mark the second game in our Small Box Series, with the Award-winning Dig Down Dwarf as the first. Our goal is build up a nice library of smaller games with a variety of mechanics and themes that all play big!\nTrainmaker is a 2-6 player game that takes roughly 20-30 minutes to play and is enjoyed by players ages 8 and up.\nThe object of the game is to collect either one of each station type, or to complete your hidden contract. The first player to do so declares victory!\nAt the beginning of play, each player receives two random Contract Cards. They choose one and then discard the other from the game. This contract is the player's hidden objective for the game and is a separate and secret route to victory.\nThen the game begins as players take turns rolling dice in an attempt to secure Station Cards.\nPlayers may go after additional Station Cards on their turn if they are willing to begin a train with two engines instead of one! If they do so, and take a Station Card, they can re-roll all the dice used to create that train and go after another Station Card. It is possible to clear the table of all three available Station Cards on one turn if you are lucky and take a few risks!\nLastly, many of the station cards offer the player \"Discard Powers\". A player may discard an owned Station Card during their own turn to invoke a special \"one time\" power like re-rolling all their dice, or setting a die to a particular side. These powers offer the player a way to take further risks and make more choices during play in order to win. \nPrint & Play Files and Rules Download Link\n >>>Link to Lyris Laser Studio<<<\nAbove are some pictures of the prototype of the box from Lyris Laser Studio. As you can see the craftsmanship is very nice! The picture in the bottom-left illustrates one of our \"small box series\" games fitting perfectly into the box with plenty of room for goodies!\nWhat is the Outlaws Expansion?\nThe Outlaws expansion introduces 3 bandits to the Station Cards deck. These jerks spend a round robbing players of one of their dice if they happen to roll the train car the outlaw wants to rob! But to counter this, 6 new Station Cards are added and each has the passive U.S. Marshal ability to protect the player from the bandits. The bandits are smart enough to move on to easier prey. \nWant to customize your pledge? You may add on any of the following items to your pledge by simply increasing your pledge amount by the dollar amount indicated next to each item. Example: You have pledged at the $46 level, but want to add two roll-up game mats. Simply add $36 to your pledge for a total of $82. (46 + 18 + 18 = 82). Worldwide Shipping is included in these prices! \nYOU MUST BE A BACKER AT THE $20 LEVEL OR HIGHER TO ADD-ON ANY ITEMS! THE AMOUNT OF AN ADD-ON MUST BE ADDED TO YOUR PLEDGE BEFORE THE KICKSTARTER ENDS! THANKS.\nWe will gather information from you during the survey in regards to which items you pledged extra for.\nCrits Happen\nBower's Game Corner\nAll Us Geeks \nFather Geek Review Click the image below!\nInquisitive Meeple Interview Click the image below!\nGeek-Craft Review Click the image below!\n                                                                                                                    Support us proudly by brandishing our Trainmaker KS Avatar!\nThe cost of shipping Trainmaker is factored into the pledge levels for U.S. Backers. I wanted to explain the shipping costs to everyone, so that you can see exactly where the numbers came from. Below is a nice chart that shows the dollar amount you need to add to your pledge depending on where you live and the shipping credit that is applied at each level. Whatever the cost is to ship within the U.S. becomes a credit that is applied to Canadian and International shipping. Example: It costs $7 to ship one copy of the game within the U.S. and it costs $15 to ship the same package to Canada, so $7 is taken off the cost for Canadian Backers, thus you only have to pay $8 and not the full $15.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur goal is to make a quality product and we understand the challenges of doing so. Our focus is to stay engaged with both our manufacturers and backers to keep everyone on the same page and informed.

Sometimes an issue can cause a delay, and while delays are typically avoided, producing the the best product is always our end goal.

Example - first roll, I roll double engines and get 2 dice that match the cars I need. Second roll I roll some more train cars that I don't need, plus a caboose to finish my train.

There were quite a few stops along the way and I would doze off only to jump awake as the train would slow for the next stop. Except, of course, the stop in Bristol ... I had fallen asleep and didn't even budge when it stopped there. Luckily, a kind older gentleman woke me and asked if I had been waiting for Bristol.

LOVECRAFT PORTRAIT PRINT!\nDAGON is a short story written by H.P. Lovecraft in July 1917 and one of his earliest published works. The story is the testament of a tortured, morphine-addicted man who plans to commit suicide over an incident that occurred early on in World War I when he was a merchant marine officer. It's an amazingly powerful and visceral story whose concepts and creatures directly connect to Lovecraft\u2019s later and far more famous Cthulhu works.\nDAGON will be adapted and drawn by Ben Templesmith, New York Times best selling comic book artist who is Co-Creator of 30 DAYS OF NIGHT with Steve Niles and FELL with Warren Ellis, as well as Creator of WORMWOOD: GENTLEMAN CORPSE, THE SQUIDDER, and WELCOME TO HOXFORD. This story has preoccupied and haunted Ben since he first read it 20 plus years ago, a time before he\u2019d published any of his own work or knew that he ever would.\nDAGON will be a limited run 8.5x12\" 48 page (BOOK NOW UPGRADED TO 72 PAGES) hardcover graphic novel. We're also offering a slipcased \"OBELISK\" edition of DAGON that we think is going to be awesome! The OBELISK edition includes:\nan exclusive book cover\nan exclusive slipcase cover\nembossed, numbered, and signed bookplate\nThis year marks the 125th anniversary of the birth of H.P. Lovecraft. He has been a huge influence on so many writers and artists, including Ben. DAGON was the first H.P. Lovecraft story that Ben ever read, and it has been his dream to be able to adapt DAGON in a graphic novel format, to be given a large amount of space to control pacing and truly convey the mood and depth within the tale while having complete design and production control of the book in creating a real experience. It finally feels like the right time to try and do this.\nSo for this Kickstarter, we\u2019re asking you to help make this possible!\n3-6-15 UPGRADE --> Every copy of the DAGON OBELISK edition will now come with this FREE 8.5x11\" \"The Thing Below\" print that'll be embossed and signed by Ben!!\nThe Thing Below\n3-6-15 UPGRADE --> Every copy of the DAGON book, whether it's the regular hardcover edition or the slipcased OBELISK edition, will now come with this FREE DADON bookmark!!\nDAGON bookmark\n2-11-15 UPGRADE --> Every copy of the DAGON book, whether it's the regular hardcover edition or the slipcased OBELISK edition, will now come with this FREE 8.5x11\" portrait print of H.P.

Join us at writeremergency.com to learn more about what's happening with Writer Emergency Pack.\n---\nWriting is hard. You're constantly trying to figure out what word comes next. \nCreative writing is even harder. When you're working on a story, you're not just trying to decide what word comes next, but what idea comes next.\nIt's easy to get stuck.\nI know what that's like because I'm a screenwriter. I'm lucky to have had ten movies produced, from GO to BIG FISH to FRANKENWEENIE. I also host a popular podcast about film and television called Scriptnotes.\nOver the years, I've had conversations with hundreds of writers, both on the podcast and around the lunch table. No matter what genre or medium, all writers face story problems. Plots that plod. Characters that don't connect.\nEvery writer has her own techniques for pushing past these problems -- little nudges and prompts to help get the story clicking. \nWriter Emergency Pack is a curated collection of some of the most useful suggestions I've encountered. It's by writers, for writers.\nThe Cards\nWriter Emergency Pack contains 26 illustrated cards, each featuring a different idea for getting unstuck.\nThe notion of using cards to help you write isn't new. Writers have long used tarot cards, looking for meaning in the illustrations, or decks like Oblique Strategies, with its koan-like prompts (\"Repetition is a form of change\").\nThe ideas in Writer Emergency Pack are designed to be less abstract, and more immediately useful. They're specifically tailored to people writing fiction, from novels to scripts, poems to plays. \nThe cards focus on story, character, and conflict.\nFor each illustrated Idea card, there's a matching Detail card with more specific suggestions. And on the back, you'll find tips to try.\nDetail cards (front)\nDetail cards (back)\nGive One, Get One\nOur goal is to get these packs into the hands of as many writers as possible \u2014 both the backers of the project and young writers just learning their craft. That's why we are committing to donate one deck for each backer deck we send out.\nWe're based in Los Angeles, so our initial outreach will be with programs we can visit to see what works. Ultimately, we want to send these packs all over the world. We've identified several youth writing programs we'd like to work with -- but we want your suggestions as well.\nIf you know of a creative writing program you'd like to recommend, tell us about it in the Comments section. Links and instructor names are especially helpful. Most important is your personal experience about why this particular program is so good.\nAs we learn more about how the Writer Emergency Packs are working for students, we'll be updating the Education page on writeremergency.com with tips and suggestions for using these decks with classes and after school programs.\nWhy Kickstarter\nI mostly make digital things, like apps and podcasts and websites. In the digital world, it essentially costs the same to make ten or 10,000 copies of something. It's just bits. \nWith physical goods, each unit has a real cost. When we printed demo versions of Writer Emergency Pack, each deck cost a lot. Some of that was for the paper and ink and cutting, but a lot of it was setup fees.\nThose setup fees are largely fixed. If we printed 100 rather than 10, each deck would cost less. If we could print 500, they'd suddenly be affordable. \nYou'll find lots of excellent playing card projects on Kickstarter, and this chart explains why -- making cards scales really well. As long as you can print enough at once, it's viable.\nAbout the design\nRyan Nelson designed Writer Emergency Pack, drawing inspiration from publications of the 1950s -- handbooks, manuals and field guides with strong, bold typography. (In our case, Univers.)\nWe asked David Friesen to illustrate the cards. Each one is clever and packed with details. You'll be looking at these cards a lot, so we wanted them to be fun.\nWe also have some Kickstarter exclusives, including:\nYou can read about these two special perks in our update.\nHow This All Works\nFor many of you, this may be the first Kickstarter project you've backed. So here's a quick explanation of the process.\nKickstarter isn't a store, but you can think of it as a way to pre-order something that doesn't yet exist. \nWhen you pledge money, you pick which reward you want. For example, when you pledge $19, you get one Writer Emergency Pack.\nIf you pledge higher amounts, you can choose to get additional packs and other bonus stuff.\nOnce you've chosen, Kickstarter will send you to Amazon Payments, where they'll record your pledge. They don't bill you yet. They only charge you money at the end of the campaign, and only if we reach our funding goal ($9,000).\nYou can modify or cancel your pledge at any time until very close to the end of the campaign.\nOn the podcast, I've described Kickstarter as a way of bending the universe slightly. It's a way to make something happen that otherwise wouldn't. \nBy backing Writer Emergency Pack, you're causing these cards to exist. Thank you.\nKeep coming back for updates. You can also follow the project on Twitter @writeremergency and reach me @johnaugust", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPRODUCTION\n\nAll of the artwork and text is finished. We printed two runs of demo decks, which turned out great. We tested them with professional writers, students and teachers. The feedback has been terrific.\n\nDespite our best planning, problems may arise: printing delays, earthquakes, gamma ray bursts that knock civilization back to the Stone Age. But short of global catastrophe, we should be okay. We've built in contingencies for budget and schedule that should get us through.\n\nThere's a chance we won't reach our funding goal. That would be a bummer. We would reevaluate and figure out how to do this better.\n\nThere's the chance the response could be so large that we are overwhelmed with orders. If that happens, we'll figure out how to add staff or work with a fulfillment service to get these shipments out. (There's actually a card in WEP named \"Stack of Needles\" which is about exactly this curse of success.)\n\nBottom line: If stuff comes up, we'll fix it, and we will tell you. You're backing this project because you want to bend the universe in a slightly better way. You deserve to know the highlights and hiccups along the journey.\n\nSHIPPING\n\nOur company (Quote-Unquote Films) has shipped thousands of shirts and USB drives for the Scriptnotes podcast. We're good at it. \n\nWe've studied lots of other card-based Kickstarter projects to gather tips on fulfillment. Here are some things we've learned:\n\n-> We need good addresses.\n\nWhen funding concludes, we will be sending out a survey to get your mailing address. We plan to ship these in March, but it could be as early as mid-December. So PICK AN ADDRESS THAT WON'T CHANGE. If you're in college or moving a lot, that might mean sending it to your parents or a work address.\n\n-> International shipping is expensive.\n\nFor deck-based projects, current consensus seems to be that USPS is the best value, even overseas. But we wish it were cheaper. One suggestion: Buy in bulk. If you know several people who want decks, pool your money and buy at a higher tier (i.e. Elite Dolphin Squad or Ocean Rescue Task Force). That way, you'll only pay shipping once.\n\n-> Mistakes will happen.\n\nPackages will get lost or stolen or held in customs. One good thing about these decks is that we're making a lot of them. No matter what happens, we'll be able to sort it out if you just contact us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Writer Emergency Pack, one year later", "update_content": "Exactly one year ago, we launched this Kickstarter for Writer Emergency Pack.\nOn that first day -- November 3, 2014 -- we brought in 464 backers and raised $14,055, surpassing our $9,000 goal for the entire campaign.\nWe were incredibly excited.

Thank you!!! \nVye has grown in quality and quantity since we first launched this kickstarter. The Kickstarter edition of Vye will now come with 110 linen finished cards, 125 wooden cubes, and a rule book, all in an upgraded awesome box. YOU made that happen.\nIf you missed out on the Kickstarter of Vye, but would still like to order it, you can do so at our company website: www.SandHatGames.com \nThank you all again for the support and we\u2019ll keep you updated on the development of the game as things progress. \nJoe, Doug and Vince of Sand Hat Games\n\u201cVye is a kingdom building game at its most beautiful state.\u201d Across the Board Games\n\u201cWould I recommend Vye? Without hesitation. It\u2019s a fun and highly competitive card game of positioning and timing.\u201d - Father Geek\nVye is an area control game that plays quickly across an ever increasing, and oftentimes contentious board, usually taking less than half an hour. The game is made up of 110 beautifully illustrated cards and 125 wooden tokens in 5 different colors. It has been favorably compared to Carcassonne, Fealty, Robber Knights and Go.\nVye is a game for 2-4 players, competing to build the largest kingdom... before the Inevitable Empress is drawn.  \nBelow is a quick \"How to Play\" video we put together for all of you. \nTo play, you take five cards and lay them out as the unconquered lands of Vye. Players choose a color and put their matching house, and tokens in front of them. When played, each family member in a house claims neighboring cards with a unique trait. You\u2019re dealt four cards and during your turn you can play from either your hand or from family. Playing your cards strategically enables you to capture your opponent\u2019s lands and control the largest kingdom, thereby winning the game. Will you see your kingdom fractured or will you remain united and claim the kingdom of Vye before time runs out?\n\"Vye shines with its original artwork and design and is a terrific game to introduce to new gamers.\" Across the Board Games\n \u201cDo play Vye the first chance you get and enjoy the challenge of capturing territory in an ever-shifting land dispute for power and control!\u201d - Father Geek\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun playing Vye and we\u2019ve gotten a lot of great feedback and comments about the game. So much so that we wanted to give all of you the opportunity to try out our \u201cpre-release edition\u201d for free. Download the Print and Play of Vye below and if you like it please consider showing your support.\nDownload the Vye print and play kit here\nVye includes 60 Land cards, 20 Family cards, 24 special cards, 3 legendary cards, and an Inevitable Empress card. It also includes 5 different sets of colored wooden tokens (125 total) all in a beautifully designed box.\nUpdate: Collector's Edition Box - $75 (Early Prototype)\nHere's an early sample of the Collector's Edition box and tokens created by Lyris Laser Studio.\nFor more of an update on the Collector's Edition, check out Update #10.\nUpdate: Release Party V.I.P. ($60) \nWe have some more information regarding the \"goodie bag\" that comes at the V.I.P. pledge level.\n For more of an update on this pledge, check out Update #11.\nAll stretch goals are designed to add variety and mix up gameplay to keep you on your toes (as you Vye for control of the kingdom)! All stretch goals will be included in every copy of Vye.\nOur first stretch goal is to upgrade our standard, and totally acceptable, card stock finish to the much more impressive linen finish. This gives the cards a thicker more durable feel.\nWild Lands: Vye is a magical place and sometimes lands don\u2019t take form until the moment of choosing. The Wild Lands are 4 new bonus cards you can add into the deck. Wild Lands take on the aspect of a neighboring land when played.\nWinter's Vale: High in the mountains of Vye, is a place where the snow never melts, called Winter's Vale. Winter's Vale is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of a game.\nSinkhole: The world of Vye is falling into the earth. Giant, unexplainable sinkholes are swallowing up the lands of Vye making areas unpassable. Sinkholes are 4 new bonus cards you can add into the deck. They are placed on top of any existing land card. No kingdom can ever control that space again.  \nFoxwood Marsh: Seeing the Foxwood Marsh, you might wonder why anyone would want to claim this foul smelling place for their kingdom. The creatures who live here are smarter, and more cunning than any animal should be. Some believe there is a Fox King at the heart of the bog ruling his minions with an ancient language only he remembers. The Foxwood Marsh is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nCatapult: In the battle for the kingdom of Vye, sometimes it helps have reach. The families have brought their own weapons of war onto the battlefield. Catapult adds 4 new cards to the game. Each player adds a Catapult next to their house at the start of the game and plays it as they would a Family card. The Catapult allows you to claim a land previously out of your reach.  \nHungry Seas: The seas of Vye are ripe for conquering. It takes a boldness and bravery to sail these treacherous waters against the leviathans that call it home. The Hungry Seas is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nFortress: Command your ever-expanding kingdom with the indomitable Fortress. Providing you with a strong foothold in the contested lands of Vye, your Fortress can never be captured by your enemies and provides the lands surrounding it an imposing garrison. Fortress adds 4 new cards to the core set. Played from your sideboard along with your other Family cards, Fortress is sure to bring an exciting new dimension to your Vye games.\nThe Amber Jungle: What lurks in the remote depths of the Amber Jungle? Keep close watch as you explore the reaches of this newly discovered country, for predators known and unknown surely stalk this vibrant jungle land. The Amber Jungle is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\n Undermine: Divided realms will be reunited with the powerful Undermine card. While you own Undermine, you may count the score from two of your kingdoms instead of one. Undermine adds 4 new cards to the core set and is sure to bring earth-shattering dynamism to your Vye games.\nDrover Reach: The pastoral reaches of Vye are perfect additions to your burgeoning realm. Drover Reach is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nThe Lost City: The Lost Cities are thriving meccas of culture, influence and power. Long ago the inhabitants chose to remove themselves from society, learning to bend the minds of men to avoid their cities. However, you have found them and claimed their city as your own. The Lost City cards are 4 new bonus cards you can add into the deck. If they are in your largest kingdom at the end of the game, they increase your overall power.\nOnyx Coast: Ancient castles stand vanguard over the realm known as the Onyx Coast. Their origins lost to time, these long-abandoned strongholds would be perfect conquests for your kingdom. Onyx Coast is a new set of 4 land cards you can add to a game as a replacement for existing lands or to extend the length of the game.\nHouse of the Entangled Soul: Just who are these upstarts? Do they presume to divide your kingdom and take it for their own? Or will they be allies in your quest to rule Vye? The House of the Entangled Soul is a set of 4 new Family cards and 25 black tokens you can use in place of an existing family or to expand your Vye games to 5 player slug-fests! \nThis stretch goal also unlocks an additional Catapult and Fortress card for the 5th family as well as 25 additional custom wooden tokens for the Collector's Edition version of the game.\nEarthquake: The earth beneath your kingdom\u2019s feet is not as stable as you might think. A sudden shift in the ground can cause lands you once controlled to slip away to a different part of the kingdom. In its place is a new land and potentially a new kingdom has appeared.\n Sanctuary: There\u2019s a place in Vye, where even enemies coexist. This land is protected by the rulers of Vye and safe passage is always granted. The inhabitants are the castaway children of the houses - bastard sons and moon daughters. Though these children are not allowed in their own kingdoms, no house is willing to shed blood here, for fear that it would be their own.\n Necropolis: All things must die, but you can control who goes first. Watch how a kingdom\u2019s forces, once powerful and mighty, turn to dust with the touch of the Necropolis.\nVye was created by three video game developers. We\u2019ve spent our careers working on games such as inFAMOUS: Second Son, Diablo 3, Warhammer Online, City of Heroes, WildStar and more. Vye was developed in between two of those jobs. We wanted the perfect opener to getting hired: a game you could actually play in the interview, rather than just our resume of previous game experience. We knew the game would need to be quick to learn in order to immediately win over our audience of skeptical game developers. We never imagined that we\u2019d create such a fun and beautiful game. Vye is that game and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you.\nVye is in the final stages of development. The core game is solid and fun. We\u2019re final testing some of the bonus cards to make sure everything flows smoothly. The art is being completed, with only a few cards remaining. We have our quote from our manufacturer and have determined how we\u2019re going to fulfill orders when they come in.\nAll that remains is getting your support to make Vye a reality. If we hit our funding goal, we\u2019ll be able to do a minimum print run of the game for you, the backers, and get Vye into game stores. We hope you\u2019ll show us your support and back us.\n  The three of us, Joe, Doug, and Vince, make up Sand Hat Games. We are a small company dedicated to making beautiful games for everyone to enjoy. Our professional background is in video game development, where we\u2019ve spent years designing, writing and generally creating a lot of different games (Diablo 2, Diablo 3, City of Heroes, inFAMOUS, WildStar, and Warhammer Online). \nAt home, we\u2019ve worked on different projects from pen and paper RPGs to card and board games. Vye marks our first attempt to come together and produce something for everyone at Sand Hat Games, LLC. We hope to continue making gorgeous games that you love to play. Thank you for your support.\nIf you're interested in ordering multiple copies and are curious about what to add for shipping, please follow this handy chart below. If you are ordering multiple copies of the game please remember to add the proper shipping into the cost of the pledge. If you would like to add an additional copy or copies to an existing pledge, use this chart to determine how much extra to add to your pledge.\nSponsor Names\nOne of the amazing things about Kickstarter is that it allows the many to make the dreams of the few come to life. At the $100 and $125 pledge level we offer backers the chance to sponsor a card, much like a piece of art in a museum. The Kickstarter edition of Vye will display the sponsor names on the cards (See example below). The names are integrated well with the rest of the card making them both elegant and unobtrusive to players.\nWhen you zoom in, the name looks like an etched glass plaque that\u2019s been screwed into the card. It makes the card look like a museum piece.\nWe\u2019re confident this will look elegant and we are testing it with actual cards to make sure the quality is up to our standards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThankfully, Vye as a game is pretty much done. That leaves the hard part - printing & fulfillment. \n\nPrinting: We're going with Magicraft for our printing service. They have been great to work with and have a long list of games they've printed. \n\nFulfillment: At the current printing level, we're planning on doing the fulfillment ourselves.

We began talking with our printing partner, BangWee, to gather cost and timeline information, and tried to figure out how much of our game we could alter for the second printing. We knew that, at a minimum, there were some rulebook changes we wanted to make and we wanted to do something, if possible, about the serious problem we were having with the token colors. The cost of the changes both in manufacturing and time started a larger conversation about what changes a second printing of Vye really needed. We identified a number of core things about the game and its components that we felt needed change and realized that, if we made all of the changes we wanted, not only would we produce a better game than the already great game we had made, but that there would be enough changes that we needed to starkly identify it as different from the first edition. Thus, the second edition was born. We had our list of design, art, and production changes, we chose a chunk of time for the production of the list, and we began working through the items meeting weekly to discuss our progress."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Second Printing!", "update_content": "Greetings and salutations, my fine crowdfunding affectionados.
