We have been awarded the prestigious CES Design & Engineering Honors by the Consumer Electronic Association not once but twice, both for storage products. This is our 2nd Kickstarter project. Our first Kickstarter project, CloudFTP, also a storage product, was the 3rd highest funded Kickstarter technology project when funding ended and named by Stuff Magazine as one of the \u201c10 best Kickstarter technology projects\u201d. We are also the technology provider for another successful Kickstarter project called CameraMator.\nDaniel Chin is the Founder of Sanho Corporation. An electrical engineer by training, Daniel has a hand in all of Sanho's products which include: HyperDrive \u2013 Portable digital data storage products for Apple devices, digital cameras, memory cards HyperJuice \u2013 External batteries for Apple MacBook, iPhone, iPad, iPod, USB products HyperShield \u2013 Cases and stylus pens for Apple devices HyperThin \u2013 World thinnest HDMI cables HyperShop \u2013 Official Online store A serial entrepreneur, Daniel also founded another company EastGear.com in Singapore, where he was born, He came over to the U.S. in 2005 and currently resides in San Francisco Bay Area, California with his wife and 2 young kids.\nValerie Chong is the COO of Sanho Corporation. An mechanical engineer by training, Valerie oversees production and operations of the company.\nThe Design\nPrototype A: How nice would it be to be able to simply connect a USB flash drive into the iPhone or iPad to transfer data without going through iTunes, the computer or the Internet? That was how the idea for iStick was born, back in 2011. The first prototype was rather rudimentary. It was basically sticking a 30-pin connector (the original iPhone/iPad connector) at the other end of a USB stick. It was promptly rejected by Apple because the design was ambiguous as there is a possibility that the user might use the product like a cable and connect both ends at the same time, giving unpredictable results.\nPrototype B: A sliding switch was added to the design to allow only one connector (either USB or 30-pin) to be exposed at any time, preventing wrong usage. Certification with Apple would continue for 2 more years.\nPrototype C: The old 30-pin connector is replaced with the new Lightning connector to become the current design and we finally obtain Apple MFi certification for the iStick in 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is without their risk and challenges but we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Kickstarter. We are also no strangers to Apple accessories, storage products or even Kickstarter.\n\nWe have been working on the iStick for about 3 years and have since built many stable prototypes and a fully functional universal iOS app. We recently just got Apple's approval to use the Lightning connector on this product and to list the iStick app on the Apple App Store. The iStick is now MFi certified to work with the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.\n\nThe iStick that you see in the above videos are real, working prototypes with an actual fully functional iOS app.\n\nWith your support, we can bring iStick to iDevice users worldwide. We are ready to enter mass production and your contribution will help to fund:\n\n- Mass production tooling \n- Large component order\n\nWe are confident of meeting (if not beating) our August 2014 ship date. Our previous \"CloudFTP\" Kickstarter project was featured by CNN Money as one of the few Kickstarter projects that actually ship on time.\n\nWe have sufficient components to manufacture about 10,000 units now. Beyond that, we may face long lead times especially for the components related to the Apple Lightning connector. Your strong support will give us the needed affirmation to place a larger component order and start mass production earlier.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "Get 25% OFF NEW USB-C Power Hub for Nintendo Switch & More!", "update_content": "Our largest-ever Cyber Monday Sale with 30% off sitewide"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "Exclusive 50% OFF offer just for our backers!", "update_content": "Our largest-ever Black Friday Sale with 30% off sitewide"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #84", "update_userinfo": "Last Day!

The one thing it definitely isn't is a play in which Poly Bunker Sings. In fact, Poly Bunker isn't even in the play. \nABOUT THE SHOW\nThe play consists of three short vignettes. The first gives us a glimpse into the lives of four people who live together in a polyamorous household, and experience all the pleasure and (mostly) pain that comes along with it. That's Poly.\nThe second vignette explores what happens when we lock two people in a bunker with little to do but \"get to know\" each other. If Rod Serling and Harold Pinter had a baby, we hope it would look something like Bunker.\nFinally, a wide-eyed hillbilly from Amite County, Mississippi sings her way through the mean streets of Los Angeles hoping to find her dreamboat, Tom Hanks. With original music composed and performed by Rana Rines as the innocent Darlene (pronounced Darlin') we wrap up the show with Sings.\nSo there you have it. Poly. Bunker. Sings.\nFor more info on polyamory, start with this article.\nWHY WE'RE HERE\nWe have the script (we wrote it). We have the actors (we hired \u2018em). We have the venue and four dates in June. What we need now is a little help to fund the show. The money we raise will help with many things, including marketing, prop acquisition, set pieces, and venue rental for rehearsals and performances. But MOST importantly - it will help us pay our actors, musicians and crew!\nRana Rines and David Harper, the creators of the show, would like to point out that they aren't paying themselves. Writing and producing and performing this show in the Hollywood Fringe Festival will pay us in one of life's most valuable currencies - joy. But paying the people who work long and hard to help us put this show on its feet is important to us, and you can help make that happen.\nDISCLAIMER - YAY!\nAnd now for the part at the end of the commercial where we show tiny print and talk really fast: None of the perks include transportation to or from Los Angeles.

We have come to Kickstarter to get your help getting our film made as our film is gaining momentum. We are a Bay Area production looking to do something epic, ambitious, foolhardy, and above our pay grade as we navigate the indie film world with this piece of material.\nSYNOPSIS\nWhy tell when we can show?\nPlot: Joel Carrero, late 20's/early 30's, is newly-wed to Sabrina, a former model with a sweet heart. Victims of a troubled economy, they do all they can to make ends meet and find some place in the world. Joel works with his best friend, Eric, at a job he hates with a hardass for a boss, Frank.\nThat job, of course, being a professional hit man. \nOne day, Frank asks an unusual favor: beat up, interrogate, and disappear a cop who's been blackmailing them. Joel is reluctant but agrees to the plan. However, Joel gets more than he bargained for when he meets the cop, Mitchell. Secrets are learned that threaten to take down everything that Joel has built but Frank won't let him just walk away. In retaliation for not doing his job, Sabrina is KIDNAPPED and Joel beaten down. He gets away but what else is there to do but revenge?\nORIGINS\nBack in May 2012, I came across a contest sponsored by Linkin Park via www.genero.tv where you do a music video for their song \"Burn It Down.\" The winner gets prizes and I decided to jump headfirst into the project. I decided to craft a storyline about Joel and his life as a hit man and the revenge that follows after his wife is kidnapped.\nAfter a whirlwind 2 day shoot, we had some amazing footage and worked on it right till the last minute of the deadline.\nThe video didn't win the contest but got me such a big reaction from friends, collaborators, and new associates that it wasn't something I could just ignore. 3 months later, I decided to start writing a feature length version of the music video and see where it goes. I started getting more and more into it as it started to resemble the types of movies I loved growing up. Looking to finally break into doing feature films after years doing music videos and shorts, I decided to make it my debut film.\nAll told, it was a music video entry that ultimately didn't win but became the perfect proof that I could pull off a movie like this. Lemons into lemonade!\nTHEMES\nConceptual character poster\n\"WAR PATH\" is a film about choices. Secrets. Cause and Effect, the consequences of every action you take and how it impacts the ones you love. It's a film about the economy and how it doesn't just affect \"civilized\" people. Even more than the rest, it's a film about flawed people trying to find their place in the world and escape the shackles of their lot in life.\nTONE\nGrowing up, I (Casey de Fremery) adored gangster and crime films. Goodfellas, The Godfather, Mean Streets, Narc, the movies about guys who made their way by force and not conforming to how society functions. They were on the fringes but they were vicious and the consequences of their actions always left a mark on me, showing that crime doesn't pay.\nEven so, I am not approaching this as my attempt to ape Scorsese or tell an Italian Mafia story. I want to make a story that isn't about an ethnic crime syndicate, this is an island of misfit toys. There are brutes who are ruthlessly effective and trainees who basically answered the job ad. They're in an industry that is dying (no pun intended) due to RICO and the crippling effect of the FBI and are trying to make ends meet.\nThe aim is to make a gritty crime drama but with humor, drama, a bit of action, a fast pace, and to get you thinking when it's over. My aim is to make a movie for the audience by a guy whose been in those same seats before.\nSimplified: Breaking Bad meets Killing Them Softly and has a baby with a middle name of Cormac MacCarthy.\nTHE CAST\nYou can't make it without the actors. I wanted to put the network of actors I've collected over the years to good use while also including fresh faces. The material has attracted some of the best talent I've seen in the Bay and we've only just started some of the big casting.\nGARY NEIL (Our Happy Apocalypse) as JOEL CARRERO\nThe main character of the film. He's a talented man in a business of death but trying to find his place in the world now that he's married. He is selfish and tries to hide the true extent of what he does to the outside world but doesn't want it to be his legacy.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3603702/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\nERIK SUNDQUIST (Criminal Minds) as ERIC DALEY\nOne of the lead roles in the film. Eric has been a longtime best friend of Joel and under his father Frank, runs one of Frank's criminal enterprises: hits and extortion. He's got a short temper, he's naturally competitive, and will be the first to hit on your girlfriend but he has a good heart. Unlike the majority of his employees, he actually loves his job and that leaves a lot of very unfortunate victims.\nLIZ CLARE as SABRINA CARRERO\nJoel's wife Sabrina, a former model Joel met at a bar randomly one night. Like Joel, she's a girl trying to find her place in the world despite there being no clear. She knows her husband is up to no good but she's a woman with secrets of her own and everything collides!\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3577579/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\n LISSA KEIGWINN as ELENA\nAn old flame of Joel from life before Sabrina, Elena was previously another killer in the employ of Frank Daley. She was cast out once her relationship was made public and true to form, the boy's club sided with Joel. Things deteriorated between her and Joel but she makes her living selling guns and other weapons of war. Tough but vulnerable, she wants out but things never go according to plan.\n MICHAEL UIMARI as FRANK DALEY\nFrank is Joel's boss/agent, who runs the overall business and handles the client side of the syndicate. Short tempered, gruff, and to the point, he has high ambitions to retire on a high note but leaves the hit man side of the business to his son, Eric. \nCOLE PANTHER (Absolution) as MITCHELL\nA detective with the local police, Mitchell is one of the few actively assigned to take down Frank's criminal syndicate. That alone could make a career but Mitchell's not in it for the glory. More than just about anyone else, he's playing the long game and poses just as much a threat as anyone in Frank's employ.\nDIXON SCOTT PHILLIPS (Hero Punk) as BENOIT\nAn old associate of Frank, Benoit is a domesticated middle man in a high power law firm. A gambler and routine customer to Frank's debt collection business, he's always on time and prompt. To Frank, he's a gateway to a lucrative contract for higher paying work. To Benoit, Frank's his main connection to his past life and a source for the dirty work of his employers.\nJEREMY JONES (Hero Punk, 8: The Movie) as IVAN \nIvan is the de facto bodyguard to Frank and never needs a command repeated when it's time to protect his boss. \n JOHNNY GILLIGAN as ABBOT\nAbbot is an elite criminal within Frank's employ but puts on his best poker face whenever around social situations. He's calm and collected, follows orders, but is always willing to listen to the highest bidder. A true wild card.\nCARL SCHREIBER as DENNIS\nDennis is a relatively new boyfriend for Elena, seen as a rebound by everyone but himself. In a film full of psychos, criminals, and sociopaths, Dennis is one of the more straight-laced guys out there. A banker by day with indoor hobbies, he's one of the few who's shocked at discovering who Elena knows and what she's capable of...\nDAWAYNE JORDAN (Fruitvale Station) as WESLEY\nIn a film full of crazed and skilled hit men, Wesley is more along the lines of the new frat guy, the pledge, who's trying to prove himself and show his superiors what he's made of. But going from 'newbie who is constantly hazed and exploited' to 'respected employee' comes at its own cost.\nMYLES WEBER as OWEN\nOwen is being portrayed by Myles Weber, noted Buzzfeed writer, actor, and stand-up comedian. Owen is the head of security at the syndicate but can just as easily be found surfing youtube when the others aren't looking. He got into this due to loving the crime films of his youth but this isn't a job for the meek.\nCREW\nCasey de Fremery (Writer/Director)\n\"Welcome to Jurassic Park.\" \nAfter that immortal line from Jurassic Park, Casey de Fremery came to the realization of what he wanted to do with his life. Born from a carpenter father and a truck driver mother, films became the highpoint of any week he was able to see them. From seeing his first film Jurassic Parkonward, he delved into any screenwriting or director book he could find and started his career in high school at the birth of the DV camera movement in 2003. Friends and relatives became actors and crew as he continued learning his craft through trial and error. After a number of years, he began to rise up the ranks with standout music videos and developing his own award-winning short films. His work includes elements of comedy, dark satire, and occasion tragedy, never staying within one genre or style of filmmaking. 7-9 years total working in the film business and \"War Path\" is his feature length debut!\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3621260/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 \nFerguson Sauve-Rogan (Cinematographer)\nCasey's partner in crime on this adventure, Ferguson is an accomplished filmmaker himself. A graduate of SF State, he works on a variety of commercials, music videos, short/feature films, and other ventures. He was also the writer/director of the feature film \"Return to Nowhere\" and director of \"Writer's Cramp.\"\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3864413/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\nChloe Tokuno (Producer)\n\"War Path\" isn't just a boy's club! Chloe is our very talented uber producer hard at work making this film a reality! In her own words:\nIn 2003, after graduating high school, Chlo\u00e9 followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps and began modeling for prestigious clients such as Sacs Fifth Avenue and Nike. While continuing her education with a degree in English Literature, she found a love for the runway, walking for Oscar de la Renta, Zac Posen, and Carolina Herrera, among other courtier designers. Chlo\u00e9\u2019s modeling career took her from San Francisco to Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago. Working with top Photographers and Directors gave her a deep appreciation of advertisings production side. Eventually Chlo\u00e9 began producing still and motion shoots for Monkey and Snake Advertising and Big Buddha Productions. Word traveled of Chlo\u00e9\u2019s capabilities behind the camera. She has produced fashion, medical and utility campaigns for television, radio and internet. Chlo\u00e9 has supervised and co-produced print and motion advertising campaigns in Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Poland and Korea. Beside producing commercials, small documentaries and music videos, Chlo\u00e9 is also media planning, media buying and Ad Directing for still and motion. Chlo\u00e9 has also co-published a sold out, limited edition fine art book set, printed in Germany by Cantz Printing for her Japan based client, MIKI Foods of Japan. Currently, Chlo\u00e9 is Executive Producer of a San Francisco based full length feature film.\nDANIEL KAUTZ (GAFFER)\nDaniel Kautz Isaac is a graduate from SF State who specializes in a number of film production roles, some ranging from gaffing, gripping and even the mocking of star wars prequels. Daniel Kautz has worked on 5 feature films including Star Trek Renegades, Return to Nowhere and Prep School. He is currently now in the process of finishing his own short sci-fi epic titled Jalopy.\nhttp://kickingitforward.org\n'The Epilogue'\nWhile the movie was being written, I took the opportunity (given by Syndicate Studios) to craft a short film supporting the film, titled \"The Epilogue.\"\nPlot: Joel Carrero wakes up, bloody and dazed, in the middle of a giant desolate landscape. A mysterious TV advertises that he's in Heaven but how could this be? Is this a dream? Is he dead? And why can't he remember how he got there?\nThis is a very personal film for me and deals with a number of heavy topics. The film utilizes the same characters from the music video and takes place after the feature film. The trailer is embedded so check it out! But keep in mind that just because Joel and Sabrina Carrero play a big part in the short, this by no means implies they survive War Path. Not by a long shot\u2026\nThe Epilogue is currently in submission for various film festivals and premiered at the San Jose Short Film Festival in October. It was an Audience Favorite and got great responses at the various screenings that took place.\nSo Why Kickstarter?\nKickstarter has become a valuable resource for filmmakers to reach their audience, draw attention to their work, and get projects made that might've otherwise stayed as a pipe dream. As the cliche goes, it takes a village to raise a child and movies are no different in that regard. I wrote the script and will see it to every stage of production but I'm just one person and need a talented cast/crew to fully realize the film. Less movies than ever are being produced and the ones that do tend to belong to billion dollar toy franchises. Making something different isn't always possible but Kickstarter provides a gateway.\nWe are asking for your help with this film but feel so confident in it that what you get for donating will feel like a great cause. We are a fully independent crew that is trying to make something with a great story, engaging characters, and leave you feel like you went through an experience.\nTHE KICKER\nThe kicker is that we must raise the amount in our campaign cycle or else we don't get a dime, endangering the production. It's all or nothing so we want to do all we can to make this a reality!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nThe film is one we are looking to have as $30,000 (or more. More is good) and have raised about $18,000 thus far. We've been budgeting and have a way of doing it for that budget for production and starting it up for post production. We are a lean and pragmatic production with much of the script written based on locations we can get, props we can get for low or no budget, and nothing that is impossible.\nWe are scheduled for a 20 day shoot but getting more than our target goal will allow us to get more shooting days, get additional gear rentals, help with additional post production costs, and brace us for any left-field emergencies. There are inescapable costs like food for the cast/crew, gear, gas money for the cast/crew, and certain locations. We run a tight ship and we've had dozens of years combined of running low/no budget shoots but not making them feel like their budget. \nREWARDS\nYAY! You've donated! Charity is awesome but we want to give you a lot for your money no matter what tier you're at for more than just the film. On the right side of this screen is a list of rewards based on how much you donate and the perks of each one. We are a very open group so going as low as $1 grants you access into the production and can follow the progress as we go. One night, I might get the urge to post a clip from the film but only the backers would have the private link to watch what we've put together.\nIf you go higher up the chain, DVD's, blu rays, and all sorts of ways we want to give back are found. A copy of the film is a given but you can be onboard first hand as a War Path-ian as production and post production continue on for the next year and a half. We have some very unique awards on hand that can't be bought after or replicated, ways to contribute that can find their way into the film beyond just a credit card charge. \nNOTE: Every tier has its own designated letter assigned to it, i.e. A, J, M, etc. Each tier you donate at gets you all of the other perks below it as well. So if you donate $100, you will get the $100 prize, plus all the other tiers below it like the DVD, blu ray, shout outs, etc. Exceptions are the times when the quantity is limited.\nMISC VIDEO:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny independent film carries its own trials and tribulations. By its very nature, the budgets could always be better, the food could taste better, certain locations might try to get you for more money, etc. Pre-production is always tough and main production is always an uphill battle. Thankfully, everyone involved has gone through those trials before on other projects and lived to tell about it with amazing footage to show for it. I (Casey) have a favorite film I directed that had three main actors cancel the day before but made it work due to a lot of quick thinking and improvised methods. There's always trials but our collected experience will allow us to get through it.\n\nThe post production will be tricky and lengthy but is where the biggest magic happens. Once the film is done, there never are guarantees about the ultimate fate of it. We will be submitting for film festivals we have connections to, distributors we know, and utilizing a very active online campaign. No matter what happens though, our backers will get what they pay for and if it takes off, everyone can say they had a part in it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Digital link here and download to come!", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nSo it\u2019s been a minute and apologies for the radio silence over the last several months.

Wear is a high fidelity directional analog microphone that is significantly lower in price than existing hearing aids. This microphone can be used with any pair of headphones, has a volume control, is rechargeable, and comfortable to wear.\nred metal case\nlimited edition wood/metal case\nSurface mount Wear\nPLAY\n\nOur Development Process\nWe've been developing this technology in our Brooklyn Studio for the past two years.  Wear incorporates a low profile micro-miniature, patent pending, directional microphone technology that creates a 6 foot zone which captures, focuses and clarifies conversations in noisy environments, while reducing the effects of extraneous noise. \nLatency (delay) imposed by digital signal processing is detrimental to the hearing impaired due to lip sync (lip reading) difficulties. For that reason we used an analog circuit design with no measurable latency. We incorporate a technology using a beam-forming array of 10 microphones that create a circular 6 foot zone. Acoustic waves generated in that zone (coherent) reach the microphones at the same time so they are amplified. Sounds from further away (non coherent) reach the microphones at different times are not amplified. This creates a near field to far field signal level difference of 10 to 11 db. That 10 db level difference improves the intelligibility of near field conversation. Our research over the past two years has allowed us to reduce the size of beam forming arrays to unprecedented small form factors in a lightweight package using low power. All of this is done without digital signal processing while maintaining hi fidelity sound quality so that the directional microphone can also be used for general recording applications as well as an assistive hearing appliance.\nWear is not a replacement for a hearing aid.  Wear is designed to be used when an individual is interested in having a quality conversation in very noisy environments like family get togethers, restaurants or meetings. Wear can also be used as a commentators microphone eliminating the need to hold a microphone during an interview and other high quality audio recording applications.\nVersion 1 Through-hole Wear in an Altoids Tin\n Press releases:\nhttp://typewell.com/blog/posts/wear-it-s-at-typewell-transcriber-develops-new-assistive-device", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGuarantee\n\nDefective parts will be on us, but improper usage of Wear will not be covered.\n\nManufacturing plan\n\nWe will take 6 months to complete the engineering and design for the case of the microphone and charger.  We will source all the materials required for production and begin to make first run samples using vendors and production houses in the USA. We anticipate that all manufacturing will be in the USA.  \n\nTesting Plan\n\nWe are planning to use our already completed pre-production prototypes to conduct testing on individuals with various levels of hearing loss in order to fine tune the functionality and maximize performance of our directional microphone, Wear.\n\nFuture plans\n\nOnce the roll out of Wear is successful, we plan to identify, design and fabricate other low cost products to help people improve quality of life. We are currently developing our next version of the directional microphone.

That's right...if we meet our goal, this library will become free for all to use, absolutely royalty free!\nThe sound you hear in the main video was an actual recording of the suppressed firearm system you see in the video. It gives you an idea of just how great the real deal is even with not-so-great recording equipment. In 192kHz with a seven microphone setup and a high-quality field recorder these sound effects will be a dream! Interspersed throughout the page are pictures taken during the demo recording session.\nCheck out our interview on asoundeffect.com!\n *CORRECTION: The Tascam DR-680 only records 2 Channels in 192kHz, not 4 Channels.\nGreat Sound is a Great Opportunity\nSound is one of the most looked-over elements in independent film making. Sound can make or break the quality of a film. In particular, gunshot sound effects are often neglected for several reasons. First, when you aren't filming a real firearm, you can't record it. Second, you may live in a state or country where particular firearms are illegal or hard to legally obtain. It's also not convenient to acquire a safe range location, the proper safety equipment and all the gear and know-how necessary to record your own sounds. Lastly, the internet does not have much to offer when it comes to high fidelity recordings, let alone a variety of types and calibers with authentic mechanism sounds, and even the few quality libraries currently available are usually bundled and cost hundreds of dollars.\nMic Setup Take 2\nThere is one other sound which some might consider to be the holy grail of firearm sound effects. The suppressed gunshot. In essentially every single film big and small the sound of a suppressed firearm is completely fabricated. One reason is that most people have never heard a real suppressed firearm so the viewer has nothing to compare the sound in the film against. Another reason is that silencers are illegal for civilians to possess in several states, and in order to legally buy a silencer an individual must undergo an extensive background check, wait for paperwork to pass (sometimes as long as eight months to a year), and pay a $200 transfer tax in addition to the actual item which can cost between $400 and $2,000. Regardless of the reasons, authentic silencer sounds are not widely used, i.e. nonexistent, and we plan to change that. And let us tell you if you haven't watched the main video yet (SPOILER)...the real deal sounds incredible!\nRecording for Posterity\nUse it Like You Know it\nThere is another element to firearm sound effects: proper application. Home many times have you seen a film where the bad guy points his pistol at someone and you hear some sort of cocking sound, even if the weapon has no external hammer or safety (like a Glock)? Considering that not many people have ever used a silencer, or any kind of firearm for that matter, it is important to help people understand what it sounds like to operate, disassemble, and even hold a firearm. For a silencer, there is an entire process to prepping and using it, and everything matters, down to the type of ammunition you shoot through it. As an additional resource for this sound library we will also provide useful information and videos concerning the proper application of these sounds which will walk you through the process of assembling and using firearms in a realistic manner.\nFamiliarization and Safety Brief\nMade for Maximum Customization\nWhen it comes to creating an extensive collection of firearm sound recordings we don't want to stop with just high-enough quality recordings. We want these sounds to be used for anything and everything. Recording all our sound effects in 192kHz enables a whole range of flexibility for anyone wanting to time stretch, perform granular synthesis, or manipulate the sound in any other way. Also, when firing an unsupressed firearm the gunshot tends to be so loud that it is nearly impossible to isolate any of the more subtle sounds. With the two suppressed firearms at our disposal we can record the sound of a bullet traveling through the air and bullet impacts without the massive volume of the actual gunshot smothering these finer sounds.\nShooting Lanes and Downrange Setup Planning\nReward Details:\n$1 \u2013 And you get it all. All the sounds for all the guns. Think of this as more of a \"donate\" button.\nGoing beyond the funding goal means more recordings as listed farther down on the page!\nRecording the Marlin Model 1895. The Zooms had a really hard time with the volume on this one. Recording levels had to be turned way down.\nThe Firearms:\nThe following are the firearms we will be recording for this project. By recording, what exactly do we mean? Basically, if it is physically possible to make one of these guns create a sound by firing it or moving any of the working parts, we'll be recording it. Loading and unloading. Safeties. Triggers. Magazines. Slides. Every single click, scrape, and bang. For firearms such as the 1911, this means nearly fifty unique sound effects, not including gunshots.\nAdding a little oil makes quite a difference both visually and aurally.\nIf we greatly surpass our goal, we will even throw in some recordings of medieval weapons: the spear, the sword, the bow, and the crossbow. Note: the sound of medieval-style bolts and arrows flying through the air is absolutely wonderful. Another option is renting threaded barrels for various firearms already on the list in order to record them with the silencer attached.\nThe photographer abandons his camera and takes up a different kind of shooting.\nNow, back to our segment on using sounds. How does a filmmaker who has perhaps never use a firearm know how to utilize all these sounds (pistols such as the 1911 can produce up to fifty distinct sounds)? That's just another one of the many advantages we will offer you. We will be creating tutorial videos (as mentioned in the project video) that will sort of walk you through the way these guns function, the sounds they make, and more. Think of it as \"Using Guns and the Sounds They Make for Dummies.\"\n Click HERE to see an example of the sounds we will record of the Walther PPQ!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSound design:\n\nThe sound produced by a gunshot is very complex. The weapon's mechanism, the gases expelled from the muzzle and the receiver, the bullet passing through the air, the \"sonic crack,\" and impact all produce unique textures important to producing the right sound from the right perspective. One of the most significant sounds a firearm produces comes from the reverberation from the environment. This sound not only places the gunshot in a real space, but it tends to bleed into the other aspects of a gunshot, making them difficult to manipulate. One of our challenges is to isolate the different events of a gunshot so they can be customized to fit the needs of any project.\n\nObserving the law:\n\nWe have taken great care and will continue to be conscious of and abide by all laws concerning firearms in the state of Michigan. Silencers are 100% legal to own in most states, including ours, and the silencer we are using was acquired legally by one of the members of our team. All shooting and recording will be done on property which we have permission to use.\n\nSafe firearm practice:\n\nFor any project which uses firearms, safety is paramount. We will only record at locations designated for shooting and all project members have been firearms-educated and will practise safe firearm handling. Hearing protection is a must for unsuppressed firearms; being exposed to a single gunshot can cause permanent hearing damage. All those Hollywood movies which have everyone running around shooting short-barreled automatic weapons in the fully-automatic fire mode? The very next scene should be those tough guys sitting on the floor holding their ears and hollering at each other uselessly. In addition, eye protection is recommended when using semi-automatic suppressed firearms as particle, gas, and lubricant blowback is a possibility.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Our Final Update", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWith our presence on Facebook, Twitter, and our new Kickstarter campaign, we are sending you our final update for The Firearm Sound Library.

Thank you all so much! If you're in the San Francisco area, please join me in celebrating the completion of funding this evening!\nSee the collection as I scan it on Tumblr\nMore information at WalterKoessler.com\nI have a hundred page photo album with nearly a thousand photos my great-grandfather Walter Koessler took in World War I. It's in pristine condition, beautifully preserved by my family over the last hundred years in Southern California. They've even saved the negatives\u2013 untouched, crisp and unfaded \u2013and a box of stereographs from the war and the early 1900s.\nThis album is a real treasure. Trained as an architect and conscripted into the German Army directly from the classroom, Walter became an officer in the reserve artillery battalion and he took advantage of many unique opportunities to record his experience on film. He captured the haunting experience of building and living in the trenches, the sunlight pouring in through the broken windows of bombed churches, and the clouds through the wings of biplanes as an early aerial reconnaissance photographer. After moving to Los Angeles to work as an art director in films, Walter made this album. The story the book tells begins with a pack of young men playing at war and ends with their crushing realization of what war really means.\nThese photos have captivated me for nearly two years, even after paging through them hundreds of times. It's an unbelievable, rare and intimate story, a deep look into the first world war you can't find anywhere else.\nThe images deserve to be seen and appreciated in the context of their whole story. They're compelling on a digital screen, but having spent many hours with the originals, they are significantly better on the pages of a book you can explore as a physical object. If I can find enough supporters and meet a minimum order requirement for this ambitious project, I will create a book from this album at its original size with my notes in the margins so you can have this full experience with history too.\nSaint Quentin Cathedral, August 1917 (Walter Koessler) - October 2012 (Dean Putney)\n\"When Dean first shared this discovery with me, I knew he'd found a rare family history treasure \u2014 but I don't think I, or he, or anyone realized at first what a treasure of shared world history this collection would turn out to be. It's such an amazing story: a time capsule from an ancestor, finding its way to the hands of a young man who works in the digital world. I'm glad Dean is able to preserve it, and I'm happy to see it shared with the world.\" - Xeni Jardin, Boing Boing\nAs seen in:\nWhat I'm doing\nI want you to experience this part of our shared history. I've done a lot of research about the photos in this book and Walter's journey. I even went to France to attempt recreating the photo above. This project means a lot to me and I've spent a lot of time working on it.\nMy goal is to scan and archive each image in the book, make an annotated version of it in its full form, and share that with all of you. I've already begun this process by posting some of the pages and their photos on Tumblr. I also want to print these images in a book roughly the size of the original, with space for my notes and closeups in the margins so I can share my research.\nDigital images are neat because they don't take up space, you can zoom in closer than the eye can see, and they are easy to share. But the images in this book belong together, not separated or in a mishmash online. They deserved to be printed, held and spent time with. They're a priceless, rare look into forgotten age that you'll come back to again and again.\nThe book itself will be available in high resolution PDF form and as a high-quality offset printed, casebound 11\"x17\" coffee table book. I've rejected vanity press for this project because it's absurdly expensive at nearly $1 per page, and it greatly limits the sizes at which you can print. Each book would cost over $150 and the quality would not be worthy of Walter's work. I've begun researching the best ways to do photo printing, found a printer, priced it, checked paper samples, and begun laying out the book. These are going to be really beautiful prints, with a fold out page in the back for the large aerial panorama. A collector's item for sure and much higher quality than a vanity press could deliver. Here's a blank copy of the book's actual materials, this is the size and format I'm making it at:\nI need supporters to help me approach a 1000 copy minimum order quantity so I can move forward. When ordering a book from the non-early bird levels, you'll also receive a print from one of the book's photos.\nI'd also love to get people following along as I scan images so they can spot things I wouldn't normally see and share their expertise. The Internet has been invaluable in identifying military equipment, locations, people and much more. For backers $25 and above, you'll receive access to high resolution images of prints and negatives as I scan them so you can see my progress and pitch in if you'd like. Definitely get in on at least on this level, this stuff will knock your socks off.\nThe goal here is to have rewards dated for December 2013 in your hands before Christmas. I cannot guarantee that will happen (see Risks and Challenges section), but if I meet my funding goal I will do everything I can to meet this goal.\nI hope that this project will make you consider the stories in your life. How do you create and record new ones? How do you review the ones you've already made? How do you preserve the stories from your family? Go make those stories something you can share, can't ignore or forget, and want to spend more time with.\nHigh level rewards\nFor those of you particularly interested in early 20th century photography, military history or World War I specifically, I have some very special rewards for larger backers.\nStereoscopic View-Master\nWalter took fifty nine stereoscopic photos throughout the war. These show military equipment, biplanes, and possibly a crucifixion in 3D when seen through the proper viewer. I'm planning to make classic View-Masters and reels of the best ones to make viewing these images easy and fun! You'll also receive digital versions of the stereograms in anaglyph magenta/cyan and side-by-side formats. I'm expecting to be able to include four reels of six images for each backer here, but I may be able to make more if there are enough backers at this level. Here's an example of one of the 3D photos as an animated GIF:\nTriptychs or panorama\nThese photos are incredibly detailed, and as I've been scanning the prints and negatives I've found nuances and hidden bits you can't see in a small image. Walter took photos that tell stories, and I'm curating a few triptychs for this. These may change in the future as I find more negatives, but here are some mockups of possibilities. You'll receive options from me if you back at this level.\nTrenches\nChurches\nThe back of the book will include a fold out copy of this aerial panorama Walter took, with annotations of trench and front positions. This reward level will have an option to receive a print of this panorama instead of a triptych. The book board will be removed in this image.\nPrints from the original negatives\nI've started experimenting with printing photos in the darkroom using traditional photo enlarging and processing techniques from the original negatives I have, and the results so far are exciting. \nAs I work with these images, get better and larger paper, and learn more about enlarging them, these photographs are only going to bring you closer to the day they were shot. Walter's negatives are pristine and clear, and he took many wonderful photos. Printed large, they show details you just can't see with the naked eye.\nI won't be making many prints. The negatives are nearly a hundred years old now, and I'd really like to put them back in storage. But for the few of you who want a beautiful and rare art print from the original negative, this is a great opportunity to get one made for you. Few people have negatives from this era, and I doubt anyone besides me is crazy enough to actually print from them now. Sizes to be determined, but at least 8x10, and I will provide a series of images for you to choose from.\nVisit from me, showing of all the materials, and discussion\nI want to make these photos available for the hardcore enthusiasts to see first hand. It's so much fun sharing the story and images with people, and I could talk all day to the ones who are most interested. So let's do that.\nAt the highest tier, I'll fly out to your gallery, museum, club or organization with all the materials I have. We can spend a day discussing them and going through everything. I've limited this to five so that I can prevent undue stress on the album and materials, but I've priced it relatively low so that small but determined clubs still have a chance of organizing a meeting. Can't wait to meet you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. It's been a long time in the making because I believe this is a deeply important thing to share and share right. Here are some points I expect may present challenges and how I intend to reduce the risk behind them.\n\nI have never written or published a complete book before. Fortunately I am getting excellent advice from print designers and publishers who do this regularly. Since I work for major online publishers (boingboing.net, Kevin Kelly and others), many of my friends have made books and print products before, and the printer I've chosen comes highly recommended by the publisher of Coilhouse Magazine, so I'm confident that I'm in good hands. I've already begun the layout of the book, received financial quotes and checked paper samples. I've set out a timeline from now until I plan to ship, and I'm ready to commit to it. I've given myself a substantial time buffer between each stage of the process to prepare for things going wrong.\n\nI expect shipping physical product to have some unforeseen hangups. I have first-hand experience in seeing this done, but I have not done it myself. I've consulted with experts in retail shipping to make sure my timeline and goals are reasonable. International shipping is particularly risky and troublesome, but I've already begun pricing it out and preparing for it. I am hiring help with packing and shipping once the books arrive to make sure this goes smoothly.\n\nPrinting large numbers of photos is new to me. I've priced this out, done test prints, and begun learning more about printing from negatives. I've got experience printing high quality photographs, and I've connected with SF Photoworks to print the reward images. I've done test prints at RayKo Photo and I'll be working with them to create the best traditionally processed prints from the negatives I can. I've been working with photos for years, but I've never printed them in large quantities, so this is an area I'm actively learning more about to get the best results.\n\nAlthough unexpected production challenges will undoubtedly arise, I've spent a year and a half and plenty of my own money on this already, and I will not give up until you get your rewards. I look forward to you joining me in reliving history through First Lt. Walter Koessler's photo journal of World War I.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "From Grandma's closet to the museum walls!", "update_content": "Dear friends,\nJust about all rewards have been shipped to backers!

For you folk unfamiliar with the term \u201caudio drama,\u201d it\u2019s like a talking book but better because instead of one narrator it\u2019s an entire world come alive with characters, sounds, and music. There is no visual stimulation, so it fully engages a listener\u2019s imagination. Our target demographic is 8\u201314-year-olds and anyone who enjoys great stories well told. Wonder, excitement, adventure\u2014it\u2019s all here in Iliad House. With this campaign, we're going to fund the show's 4-episode pilot series!\nWhy call it Iliad House? Well, we\u2019ll just leave with you with this: The Iliad by Homer is an ancient, epic poem about a war among gods and kings. Iliad House is also about a war, but instead of flesh and blood it is against the principalities of this present darkness. We\u2019re going to explore some rather intense subject matter and stories, but in a fun, funny, and engaging way that offers real answers and hope.\nFourteen-year-old orphan Jesse Davidson lives with his emotionally-distant and peculiar uncle Christopher Portalis in the Iliad House, a mysterious old mansion on an island off the east coast of the United States.\nJust when Jesse is finally getting used to living on the island, he discovers that the old abandoned train he and his friends have been using as a clubhouse for the past year can actually move\u2014through time! \nThey get caught up in a series of adventures fraught with temporal distortions, political intrigue, secret societies, and supernatural battles, all as they try to cope with the daily pressures and craziness of adolescence.\nWhile traveling through the future and the past, they learn hard truths and secrets about themselves, and that there is forgiveness and redemption available to all who desire it. And, as Jesse and his uncle come to understand each other, Jesse begins to see that there is much more to Iliad House, and to why he and his uncle are there, than anyone realizes.\nJesse Davidson\u201414\nOrphaned, redheaded, lanky, a bit clumsy, he is always going where people tell him not to go, and doing what people warn him against, and attempting things he has no business attempting. He does these things for fun, and adventure, and to escape boredom, and to prove his mettle and worth. But mostly he does them to, as he puts it, \u201cfind an answer.\u201d An answer to what, he is not certain. He only knows that all of his life, he has felt as though something was missing, something important, and he needs to find out what it is.\nChristopher Portalis\u2014mid-30s\nJesse\u2019s genius uncle. If not exactly a recluse, he\u2019s the closest thing to it. Tall, lean, a good looker, Portalis holds PhDs in philosophy, history, and theoretical physics, and taught those subjects along with natural and revealed religions at the Patriot Heritage University. But then came a higher calling\u2014a life\u2019s mission, if you will\u2014that brought him to Iliad House.\nStu Martin\u201414\nJesse\u2019s good friend. He\u2019s a brain-trust physics wiz who wins all the science awards and rides around on his own self-built, electronic-computerized scooter. But Jesse soon realizes that there\u2019s more to Stu than just gadgets and tech.\nCassandra Wilson\u201414\nAnother of Jesse\u2019s friends. Pretty, wild-eyed, disheveled, she claims to see the future. Jesse finds her equally annoying and amusing. (And she kinda scares Stu, but that\u2019s nothing new.) Her attitude is mostly a cover, though, because, like Jesse, she\u2019s looking for something important, but she doesn\u2019t know where to start.\nMrs. McKenzie Emily Delanie aka \"Mrs. McEd\"\u2014mid-50s\nThe housekeeper for Iliad House. Widowed, Scottish, stout, she is a cross between Mrs. Doubtfire and Marilla Cuthbert from Anne of Green Gables, which is to say, she is stern, strong, kindhearted, or loving as the occasion warrants, and sometimes all four at the same time. She\u2019s the closest thing to a mother Jesse has ever known.\n\"The Butler\"\u2014?\nA robot created by Professor Portalis. It helps him with quick answers and analysis, as well as providing him with his cloak, his pipe, and a nice strong cup of Earl Grey. The Butler is a combination of Iron Man/Tony Stark\u2019s Jarvis, and Marvin the manic-depressive paranoid android from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. He is Spock to Mrs. McEd\u2019s McCoy, which is to say, most of the time they don\u2019t get along. (His name has yet to be determined, but one fantastic person will get to name it by choosing the Name the Butler reward level!).\nThe Cast\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Phil\u2019s work in previous shows (*cough*Adventures in Odyssey*cough*Jungle Jam and Friends*cough*), you\u2019ll recognize a lot of the cast of Iliad House.\nFor example, the famous and wonderful Katie Leigh, who plays Connie in Adventures in Odyssey!\nAnd, well, Phil Lollar!\nDid we say that we are excited about some of the awesome talent that we have?\nFirst, our concept artist is Cliff Cramp (check out his sweet website). One of our favorite ways to tell our friends about Cliff is to grab a Star Wars Blu-ray set and hand it to them. \"Cliff did all that cover art, and he is doing the art for Iliad House.\" We love having him involved.\nOur musician is a cool guy too. Justin R. Durban (also has a sweet website) is best known for his work scoring music for film trailers for movies like James Cameron's Avatar, Pixar's Brave, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He did the Iliad House theme music, and we can't stop playing it in our heads.\nSo, what exactly does this project fund? The answer is a 4-episode pilot series of Iliad House, to be distributed by CD and online!\nTo do that, we need to pay for at least five key things:\n1. Excellent actors who will play Jesse, Cassandra, Stu, and, of course, Professor Christopher Portalis.\n2. Custom music to help build the tension, mystery, and whimsy.\n3. Vibrant sound design to bring the story to life.\n4. Replicating CDs for distribution. (They make great stocking stuffers, hint hint.)\nWe want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and we plan to be the best stewards we can be of that support.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe decided to use Kickstarter because we want a direct connection with you, our audience. We want to give audio drama fans a chance to decide if they would like to hear a story about a boy with a crazy mysterious uncle. Of course you do, but Kickstarter lets us (and you) be sure. Iliad House is an independent project by Phil Lollar and a small team\u2014there is no sea of middlemen\u2014it\u2019s just us telling great stories and giving them directly to you. Without you, what's the point?\nWhen we say, \"independent project,\" we mean REALLY independent. Iliad House is a completely new, original show, unaffiliated with Focus on the Family or Adventures in Odyssey, or anybody else except me (Phil) and my team at Guess What, LLC.\nAs you may have noticed, we have put some serious thought into the rewards that come with the different backing tiers for this Kickstarter. You can get get downloads, CDs, digital art, music, autographed stuff, limited edition numbering, the ability to name characters, and even a chance to party with Phil at Disneyland. (Most of us have been to a Disney park with Phil, and it is a blast, except Phil is constantly hearing a voice in a ride and saying, \"I know that voice actor. I think he owes me a lunch . . .\")\n\nRegardless, we put a lot of thought into the prizes, and they are awesome, so check them out. Once we have successfully completed the campaign, we plan to have the last of the rewards delivered to you by February 2014! (Of course you will start receiving the rewards as fast as we make them and get them out, so keep your eyes peeled!)\n\nBut here is some really cool stuff. If we reach some of our stretch goals (goals past our minimum Kickstarter funding requirement) EVERYONE benefits.\n\nIf we surpass our minimum funding goal of $15,000 and reach our stretch goal of $20,000, we'll make 2 additional episodes. If we surpass that and reach our stretch goal of $25,000, we'll make 2 more episodes (for a total of 4 additional episodes!). Even better, anyone who gives $20 or more to the Kickstarter campaign will get free digital copies of these additional episodes because we know that we will only achieve these stretch goals if you help spread the word.

Feel free to read the update about Iliad House's next step, and then follow the link above to the next campaign when it launches early September 2013!\n*******************************************************************************************************\nTo support Iliad House, just click the GREEN button to the right of the screen. All you need is an Amazon account, and you will only be charged if we meet our goal by August 31!\nFor the latest news and information, follow us on Facebook and Twitter! And if you'd like Iliad House to happen, be sure to SHARE and TWEET us out to your friends!\nIliad House will be an ongoing, independent audio drama, clocking in at about half an hour per episode. For you folk unfamiliar with the term \u201caudio drama,\u201d it\u2019s like a talking book but better because instead of one narrator it\u2019s an entire world come alive with characters, sounds, and music. There is no visual stimulation, so it fully engages a listener\u2019s imagination. Our target demographic is 8\u201314-year-olds and anyone who enjoys great stories well told. Wonder, excitement, adventure\u2014it\u2019s all here in Iliad House. With this campaign, we're going to fund the show's pilot mini-series followed by the first full season of 12 episodes!\nWhy call it Iliad House? Well, we\u2019ll just leave with you with this: The Iliad by Homer is an ancient, epic poem about a war among gods and kings. Iliad House is also about a war, but instead of flesh and blood it is against the principalities of this present darkness. We\u2019re going to explore some rather intense subject matter and stories, but in a fun, funny, and engaging way that offers real answers and hope.\nFourteen-year-old orphan Jesse Davidson lives with his emotionally-distant and peculiar uncle Christopher Portalis in the Iliad House, a mysterious old mansion on an island off the east coast of the United States.\nJust when Jesse is finally getting used to living on the island, he discovers that the old abandoned train he and his friends have been using as a clubhouse for the past year can actually move\u2014through time! \n\"Jesse Discovers the Train Engine\" by Cliff Cramp\nThey get caught up in a series of adventures fraught with temporal distortions, political intrigue, secret societies, and supernatural battles, all as they try to cope with the daily pressures and craziness of adolescence.\nWhile traveling through the future and the past, they learn hard truths and secrets about themselves, and that there is forgiveness and redemption available to all who desire it. And, as Jesse and his uncle come to understand each other, Jesse begins to see that there is much more to Iliad House, and to why he and his uncle are there, than anyone realizes.\n\"Jesse Arriving at Iliad House\" by Cliff Cramp\nJesse Davidson\u201414\nOrphaned, redheaded, lanky, a bit clumsy, he is always going where people tell him not to go, and doing what people warn him against, and attempting things he has no business attempting. He does these things for fun, and adventure, and to escape boredom, and to prove his mettle and worth. But mostly he does them to, as he puts it, \u201cfind an answer.\u201d An answer to what, he is not certain. He only knows that all of his life, he has felt as though something was missing, something important, and he needs to find out what it is.\nChristopher Portalis\u2014mid-30s\nJesse\u2019s genius uncle. If not exactly a recluse, he\u2019s the closest thing to it. Tall, lean, a good looker, Portalis holds PhDs in philosophy, history, and theoretical physics, and taught those subjects along with natural and revealed religions at the Patriot Heritage University. But then came a higher calling\u2014a life\u2019s mission, if you will\u2014that brought him to Iliad House.\nStu Martin\u201414\nJesse\u2019s good friend. He\u2019s a brain-trust physics wiz who wins all the science awards and rides around on his own self-built, electronic-computerized scooter. But Jesse soon realizes that there\u2019s more to Stu than just gadgets and tech.\nCassandra Wilson\u201414\n\nAnother of Jesse\u2019s friends. Pretty, wild-eyed, disheveled, she claims to see the future. Jesse finds her equally annoying and amusing. (And she kinda scares Stu, but that\u2019s nothing new.) Her attitude is mostly a cover, though, because, like Jesse, she\u2019s looking for something important, but she doesn\u2019t know where to start.\nMrs. McKenzie Emily Delanie aka \"Mrs. McEd\"\u2014mid-50s\nThe housekeeper for Iliad House. Widowed, Scottish, stout, she is a cross between Mrs. Doubtfire and Marilla Cuthbert from Anne of Green Gables, which is to say, she is stern, strong, kindhearted, or loving as the occasion warrants, and sometimes all four at the same time. She\u2019s the closest thing to a mother Jesse has ever known.\n\"The Butler\"\u2014?\nA robot created by Professor Portalis. It helps him with quick answers and analysis, as well as providing him with his cloak, his pipe, and a nice strong cup of Earl Grey. The Butler is a combination of Iron Man/Tony Stark\u2019s Jarvis, and Marvin the manic-depressive paranoid android from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. He is Spock to Mrs. McEd\u2019s McCoy, which is to say, most of the time they don\u2019t get along. (His name has yet to be determined, but one fantastic person will get to name it by choosing the Name the Butler reward level!).\nThe Cast\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Phil\u2019s work in previous shows (*cough*Adventures in Odyssey*cough*Jungle Jam and Friends*cough*), you\u2019ll recognize a lot of the cast of Iliad House.\nFor example, the famous and wonderful Katie Leigh, who plays Connie in Adventures in Odyssey!\nAnd, well, Phil Lollar!\nWe'll be announcing more cast members throughout the campaign!\nVerity Island\nThe adventure takes place on a small island off the eastern coast of the US not terribly far from the landing place of John Smith and his colonial adventurers.\nRecreated Native American Village on Verity Island\nFort Verity\nOriginally inhabited by Native Americans, Verity Island is now a sleepy place of wooded trails generally looked down on by the inhabitants of Verity City just across the Prudence River Bridge. The city folk think that the people of Verity Village are too strange and \"the wrong sort.\"\nModern-Day Verity Village\nSome say that the oddness of those who live on the island dates back to the building of the train depot in the woods while others say it goes back even further to the glory days of Fort Verity whose ruins still guard the island's north shore. The funny thing is, the strange folks in Verity Village are normal compared to the even more unusual Professor who has taken up residence down past the rock formation on the southern tip of the island in a mysterious place called Iliad House.\n\"Christopher Portalis in His Study\" by Cliff Cramp\nQuick version: This all started in late 2012 at a conference where many of us, including Phil, were teaching audio drama production to middle and high schoolers. After a few days, we found that we really respected each other and decided to create a new audio drama together. Thus, Iliad House and our partnership, Guess What LLC, were born.\n\nWe\u2019ll share more about the rest of the Guess What team as the campaign progresses, but we'll start with Phil Lollar, the creative director, showrunner, head writer, and overall audio drama maestro. He has co-created, written, and worked on a ton of stuff. Adventures in Odyssey, Jungle Jam and Friends, Little Dogs on the Prairie\u2014read his bio for more!\nDid we say that we are excited about some of the awesome talent that we have?\nFirst, our concept artist is Cliff Cramp (check out his sweet website). One of our favorite ways to tell our friends about Cliff is to grab a Star Wars Blu-ray set and hand it to them. \"Cliff did all that cover art, and he is doing the art for Iliad House.\" We love having him involved.\nOur musician is a cool guy too. Justin R. Durban (also has a sweet website) is best known for his work scoring music for film trailers for movies like James Cameron's Avatar, Pixar's Brave, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He did the Iliad House theme music, and we can't stop playing it in our heads.\nSo, what exactly does this project fund? The answer is a pilot mini-series and then the first season (12 glorious half-hour episodes) of Iliad House, to be distributed by CD and online!\nTo do that, we need to pay for at least five key things:\n1. Excellent actors who will play Jesse, Cassandra, Stu, and, of course, Professor Christopher Portalis.\n2. Custom music to help build the tension, mystery, and whimsy.\n3. Vibrant sound design to bring the story to life.\n4. A website so you can download the newest episodes.\n5. Replicating CDs for distribution. (They make great stocking stuffers, hint hint.)\nWe want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and we plan to be the best stewards we can be of that support.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe decided to use Kickstarter because we want a direct connection with you, our audience. We want to give audio drama fans a chance to decide if they would like to hear a story about a boy with a crazy mysterious uncle. Of course you do, but Kickstarter lets us (and you) be sure. Iliad House is an independent project by Phil Lollar and a small team\u2014there is no sea of middlemen\u2014it\u2019s just us telling great stories and giving them directly to you. Without you, what's the point?\nWhen we say, 'independent project,' we mean REALLY independent. Iliad House is a completely new, original show, unaffiliated with Focus on the Family or Adventures in Odyssey, or anybody else except me (Phil) and my team at Guess What, LLC.\nAs you may have noticed, we have put some serious thought into the rewards that come with the different backing tiers for this Kickstarter. You can get get downloads, CDs, digital art, music, autographed stuff, limited edition numbering, the ability to name characters, and even a chance to party with Phil at Disneyland. (Most of us have been to a Disney park with Phil, and it is a blast, except Phil is constantly hearing a voice in a ride and saying, \"I know that voice actor. I think he owes me a lunch . . .\")\n\nRegardless, we put a lot of thought into the prizes, and they are awesome, so check them out. Once we have successfully completed the campaign, we plan to have the last of the rewards delivered to you by February 2014! (Of course you will start receiving the rewards as fast as we make them and get them out, so keep your eyes peeled!)\n\nBut here is some really cool stuff. If we reach some of our stretch goals (goals past our minimum Kickstarter funding requirement) EVERYONE benefits.\n\nThis is how stretch goals work: We reach a benchmark and we throw a party! For example, let's see what happens if we raise $150,000 on Kickstarter. After we complete the pilot mini-series and the first season, we will make a special prequel of the professor's awesome back story and sell it on the Iliad House website (all the fans win!). Even better, anyone who gives $20 or more to the Kickstarter campaign will get a free digital copy of this prequel because we know that we will only achieve these stretch goals if you help spread the word. So tell your friends!\n\nHere are our official stretch goals:\n\n$150,000\u2014Three-episode prequel for the Professor Portalis's backstory! Everyone who pledges at $20 or above gets a digital copy!\n\n$200,000\u2014The second season of Iliad House. Everyone who pledges at $20 and above will receive a digital copy!\n$250,000\u2014Everyone who pledges at $20 or above will receive a deluxe digital map of the mysterious island! $45 or above will receive a deluxe physical map of the island!\n\n$300,000\u2014The third season of Iliad House. Everyone who pledges at $20 or above will receive a digital copy!\n$350,000\u2014Phil Lollar and the cast will do a live recording of a very special episode! The event will be in LA at a to be determined date and will be live broadcast online around the world!\n\n$400,000\u2014Yes, we\u2019ll totally do a fourth season if we reach this stretch goal. But if we get to $400,000, we\u2019ll also unveil part of our master plan hinting at a huge development to come after the end of the third season. Get the campaign up to this level, and we\u2019ll tell you what that is. Otherwise, we\u2019re keeping our lips sealed on this one.\nCheck out the coverage Iliad House has received so far!\nPress\nCrossMap\nChristian NewsWire\nChristian Post\nChristian Today\nSmashing Interviews Magazine\nSEK Voice\nWND\nPodcasts\nAudio Theatre Central\nBlimey Cow\nVoxy Ladies\nBlogs\nAdventures in Odyssey Blog\nAIO Update\nCranach\nEncounter Gospel News\nGeneration Joshua (part I, II, and III)\nHeavy Laden\n\nLooking for Overland\n\nOdyssey Scoop\nPreschoolers and Peace\nRaven's Landing", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe good news is that that we have an awesome team! Phil clearly is the creative genius who has inspired millions of kids with his previous work. But the rest of the core team is pretty fantastic. We have two people who run large budgets, a radio producer, three members who have worked extensively on feature films, and someone who has coordinated projects of up to 2,000 volunteers/staff in 15 different states all crammed into five days. \n\nThis team is impressive because of their broad experience. Between them they are marketers, actors, bloggers, published authors, carry extensive social media experience, and distribute products all over the country. \n\nWhile the audio drama business is new to some of us, and all creative projects face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, we have a team that excels at problem solving. We have also already begun to write the scripts and have access to a great studio, which will help minimize risks due to cost and cut down delay in the delivery of the final product\u2014which is key to the success of a creative project. We are convinced that with your help, we can do this if you fund this project and spread the word to your friends.

I am RAISING FUNDS to bring the FIRST EDITION of the BARFFUS Doll to the world and to children in need. With your help JillJoy will be able to complete production and begin working with non-profit organizations actively engaged in helping children.  JillJoy needs to raise $28,000 to accomplish this production.  It is Jill's dream to give children a toy that can teach and/or remind them that they are loved and are connected to the divine.  In a world full of fashion dolls and baby dolls Jill sees a need for a new kind of doll, one with values and gifts of the heart.  The BARFFUS Dolls have their eyes wide open, learning from experience and a big fat smile, knowing that they are never alone and troubles pass.  This 1st edition BARFFUS Doll wears a heart with the message \"Be~Now\" inviting parents, teachers and care-givers to utilize it's heart message to teach kids what it means to be \"present\" and how to find peace by living in the moment with acceptance.  The BARFFUS Doll is also very fun to hold, cuddle, sleep on and it absorbs tears nicely.  BARFFUS has many messages and stories to share and many charities to contribute to... but it starts with the success of this campaign and accomplishing the production of this 1st series of dolls. \nWhy is it called a \"BARFFUS\" Doll?  Answer at the bottom of the page.\n\"The Story of Barffus\" is the True Story of the Barffus doll and myself. I (Jill) am the \"grateful young girl\" in the story and I am the designer and owner of JillJoy and the BARFFUS Brand.\nTHE STORY OF BARFFUS\nThere once was a Grandma, so bursting with joy, she made up a rag-doll a friend and a toy.  She called the doll \"Barffus\" her own word for happy... the look on his face some might even call sappy.\nWith a big hug goodbye, a smile and a poem, Grandma knew Barffus doll would love his new home. With his wide-eyed smile Barffus flopped into the arms of a grateful young girl with her own kind of charms.\nHugging and dancing Barffus smiled so hard, they rode in the car and they played in the yard.  Barffus listened and watched with a stillness admired and his bright quiet smile made her feel calm and inspired.\nThen a MIRACLE happened, one night, it seemed, when the girl and her Barffus doll had the SAME DREAM.... While in their garden, a beautiful sight, each gave the other a bit of their Light!\nIt was more than a dream 'cause they each had intention, to live on in each other and ask the best questions.  Like; why are we here? Where were we before? Are we just this body or are we much more?\nAs the young girl grew older she felt it was truth... that we are MUCH more and there's more we can do.  Like See Beauty and blessings, Give Thanks for creation.  Invite peace, love and clarity and Hear Inspiration.\nSearch inside and out, look for truths you can treasure.  Let patience and charity be part of life's pleasure.  The quest for us all is to care for each-other.  Be still, love yourself and connect with earths mother.\nTune in to your heart-brain, recognize presence.  Feel peace in each moment and come to your senses.  Barffus has a Mantra to help you endow. Ponder and practice;  Be in the Now !  (c) ~JillJoy\n\"The Story of Barffus\" will be included with every doll sold.\n  Rewards:\nThe first reward is a digital download of the Barffus Theme song: \"Rainbows\" by: Megan Joy.

ONLY 30 Teeny and 10 Big Dolls OFFERED!\nBARFFUS wants to serve as MASCOT for the enlightenment of  humans, reminding you of your divinity and give gentle suggestions of ways to find the calm in the craziness by being present in the moment with simple acceptance, and a smile.  (Not always easy, but always bringing peace when accomplished.) BARFFUS also wants to help bridge the gap between religions, cultures, races, gender and all forms of hypocrisy, expectations, stereo-types and judgement.  BARFFUS wants people to Discover their Dreams and Give them life! \nA LITTLE MORE BACKGROUND:\nI have made many prototypes and custom dolls over the past three-four years, some I have donated and others sold, all having landed into the arms of children (and adults) with loving adoration.\nAs interest and demand increased for the custom BARFFUS Doll, I began feeling overwhelmed with the inability to make dolls fast enough and with the level of quality and skill needed to meet my own standards and local interest.  So my vision for BARFFUS grew even bigger. My dream, however, is not to be a seamstress, It is to design and give life to the BARFFUS Brand and create it's messages of love and light, from my heart, using the Barffus Doll as a mascot.  After much research and development of the doll and the \"brand\" I began looking for a reputable manufacturer to produce the First edition BARFFUS Doll.  This task alone was quite a challenge but with that mission now accomplished... production of the First Edition of the BARFFUS Doll has already begun and production is scheduled to start end of August.  \nAlong with the design of the doll I have been working on every other aspect of business and marketing for The BARFFUS Brand, such as;  Design Patent & other legal stuff, writing messages and poems (to become childrens books) such as: \"The Story of Barffus\" and \"Barffus Is, Wants & Thanks\", Barffus Brand accessories and rewards for this fundraiser and the lyrics to our theme song: \"Rainbows\"  (Co Written with Megan Joy and John Feldman), Logos, Trademarks, Copyrights and the Rewards for this project.  \nThe Be~Now 27\" doll design has been in the making for over a year.  I \"see\" them sitting in your homes and places of business, in the arms of children, teens and even adults.  They love to ride in the car and I have even seen a newborn/premie smile at a Barffus Doll (SEE PICTURE at the very end). \nRE-CAP...   This is the 1st Edition of BARFFUS dolls and accessories!  With your support BARFFUS will begin it's journey of life on this planet.\nWith successful funding JillJoy will...\nBring the BARFFUS DOLLS & Inspirational Messages to the world.  Starting with fulfilling every Kickstarter Reward!\nEvery BARFFUS DOLLS will find a loving home and spread it's good energy to all who find  magic in it's energy and meaning in it's messages   : )\nIf this fundraiser exceeds it's goal JillJoy will:\nPay back creditors for money lent to initiate production! : ) YES!\nHire a professional to make an exceptional WebSite for BARFFUS, and its Fans and supporters (Many groovy and interactive ideas have been discussed and would love to be accomplished!) My current website was created by me using \"IWeb\" however my computer hard-drive was replaced and all files have been lost and can not be accessed or edited anymore... I'm already looking for solutions...  barffus.com\nBegin development for the 2nd release of the BARFFUS with new messages & accessories and... books, music, videos,  games, apps, artwork, kits and of course all containing helpful messages  and tools for joufull living.  The possibilities are endless and are have already begun : )\n\nTHIS PROJECT IS DEDICATED TO MY GRANDMA T\nJill & Iona... BARFFUS Life Givers\nNOTE: A Special THANK YOU to my beautiful Granmother, Iona, who made me a \"Barffus Doll\" when I was a child that, for me, was a friend and a toy reminding me always that I was loved and I too could be a reflection of love and joy and share it with others... THANK YOU GRANDMA, I LOVE YOU!  This project is dedicated to you and every grandmother who aspired to share her love, life and wisdom to the children in her life!  YAY for Grandma!\nTHANK~YOUS: I need to give a BIG THANK YOU TO:  Megan Joy & Quinn Allman, My Parents (Ron & Carolynn Tranmer), Ryder Corkery, Landon (& Ariel) Moser, Colby Knudsen, My Siblings and their families, Abey Baraghoshi, Kathryn Miles and all of MY and Megan's friends and Family who helped with the music video and slide show!!!

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!\nNewborn (premie) Smiling at Barffus doll\nThe Same Child, different Barffus doll.\nWhy is it called a BARFFUS Doll? This is a loaded question. The first answer is because that's what my grandmother called it when she gave it to me. I remember thinking the name sounded like \"Barf\" and I didn't understand. She said it was because she knew a goofy looking man who was always smiling and his last name was Barfuss (spelling unknown) and the doll reminded her of him. As I child actively engaged in going to church and sunday school and primary I had learned not to judge people by how they look or what their name is and that we are all the same in gods eyes. The name of the doll gave me the opportunity to look past the \"gross\" name and see the beautiful gift therefore transforming my perception of the word from \"gross\" to \"awesome\". I continue to use this skill in life, of changing my perception, and it has served me well.\nTHANK YOU! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMany risks and challenges have already been taken and overcome. Payment to initiate production has already been made. Production is scheduled to begin at the end of August. Completion of production is estimated to be middle of October. As far as the quality and finished product for the 1st Edition Be/Now Series BARFFUS DOll... I had the finished samples (1 boy and 1 girl) for a few weeks and played with them and took the pictures for this project and I am very happy with the quality and craftsmanship (the factory needed me to send them back to finish the final details... adding the Be/Now heart and Barffus Tags to then begin production). It took a few changes and alterations getting to this point (over a year's worth) but the sample dolls are beautifully made and the manufacturer has been great to work with. \nOther risks and challenges may present themselves in the process of production and shipment (this is my first go-round in this arena so I don't have experience but I do have support from others who do have experience and I have done a lot of research and preparation). I already have a freight company that I am working with and have preliminary pricing and time frames. At this point everything seems to be on track. If I meet my goal the dolls should be ready for shipment by middle of October and then the Shipment of dolls should arrive by end of October- start of November. This should give me enough time to have the Be-Now Series dolls shipped out by end of November. \n\nAs for all of the other (CUSTOM) rewards (made by me) I expect to have all items shipped out, no later than the end of November. I will work diligently to meet all delivery goals, I am surrounded by talented people standing by to help me in any way I need... I have loads of support. \n\nIf you have any questions, concerns or advise for me I would love to hear from you.\n\nTHANK YOU!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "jilljoy\nFirst created \u00b7 9 backed\nBorn & raised in Utah.

Here\u2019s how you can stay in the loop regarding future product launches, feedback surveys, beta tests and promotions:\nSubscribe to the Peak Design Newsletter\nFollow us on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and Instagram\nMedia & bloggers \u2013 if you\u2019d like to run a story, let us know!\nTHANK YOU TO OUR AMAZING BACKERS\nThank you, thank you, thank you. We hate clich\u00e9s, but we\u2019d be doing you an injustice if we didn\u2019t say that we literally couldn\u2019t do this without you. And yes, we know that is a somewhere between a double and quadruple negative. We don\u2019t care \u2013 we\u2019re excited and we freaking love you folks.\nThis is more than just designing new products to help photographers carry their cameras. This is a way of running a business, and ultimately for the Peak Design team, a way of living our lives. Our Kickstarter backers, many of whom supported us during Capture v1 and Leash/Cuff, make it possible for us to spend our time doing exactly what we want to do: design rad photography gear and enjoy putting it the hands of people who appreciate it. The funds generated from this campaign will support the research, design and development of newer, better solutions to problems that camera owners face. As we do this we will continue to look to you, our most die-hard, passionate supporters, for feedback and direction.\nOnce again, thank you for your generous support!\nQUESTIONS? ANSWERS IN THE FAQ!\nWhether you're a new backer or existing backer, we've got a massive (we're talking laughably long) FAQ at the bottom of this page. We bet you'll find you'll find an answer there!\nWHAT IS CAPTURE?\nWe believe Capture is hands-down the best way to carry your camera. The beauty of it lies in its simplicity. Capture is a compact metal clip that lets you carry your camera on any backpack strap, belt or bag. Its unique quick-release system keeps your camera rigidly secure, yet instantly accessible with the click of a button.\nCapture Camera Clip v2: Carry your camera on any backpack strap, belt or bag.\nCapture frees you from cumbersome camera straps and holsters and lets you go anywhere and do anything with your camera safe and in reach, making sure you never miss another shot. Whew, it feels good just typing that.\nAlong with Capture v2, we're launching 2 new accessories:\nPROpad\u2122 gives you extra stability and comfort when carrying very heavy cameras with Capture.\nPOV Kit (formerly called the GoPro Mount) lets you mount GoPro and point-and-shoot cameras on Capture to take POV video.\nSO WHAT'S NEW IN CAPTURE V2?\nBack in 2011, Peak Design launched the original Capture Camera Clip right here on Kickstarter. We\u2019ve spent the past 2 years building our team and reinventing our solution from the ground up, incorporating feedback from our thousands of awesome backers and customers. Here's a high level look at what is new in v2...\nTo walk you though the big new things one by one...\nThere's a Standard and Pro version now: Hobbyists and beginners have different needs than serious pros and adventurers, hence 2 versions of our clip. Read the \"Capture vs. CapturePRO\" section below to learn more.\nBeautiful new ergonomic shape: The new Capture looks sleek and stunning - but the new shape is more than just eye-candy. We\u2019ve redesigned it to give you total comfort no matter where on your body you wear it. We also redesigned the clamping bolts to make them easier to screw down, even if you\u2019re wearing gloves.\nLighter and slimmer: We\u2019ve trimmed the fat, making our (already compact) product lighter, slimmer and more unobtrusive. See FAQ for size specs.\nBetter security features: We created 2 new secondary locking systems to give you more security options. A safety lock has been added to the quick-release button, giving you a quick and easy way to prevent accidental release. For maximum security, the all-new twist lock tightly clamps your camera in. The new twist lock also stabilizes your camera if you\u2019re using Capture as a tripod clamp. Wait - did we just say you can use it as a tripod clamp?\nThat\u2019s right, it works as a tripod clamp too (PRO): CapturePRO has a \u00bc\u201d tripod mounting hole in it\u2019s back plate. This means you can put it atop your tripod or monopod and have a fully functioning quick-release clamp for your camera.\nWorks with more tripod heads (PRO): CapturePRO comes with one of our three PROplates. These plates offer compatibility with more tripod heads (ARCA and Manfrotto RC2) and camera types (SLR and Compact Mirrorless). See the FAQ for info on choosing a plate.\nWorks with sling straps (PRO): Capture, equipped with the standard plate, is designed to work with Leash and Cuff using our micro-anchor attachment system (see FAQ). CapturePRO, equipped with one of our PROplates, works with Peak Design straps as well as classic sling-style straps made by companies like BlackRapid\u00ae. PROplates feature a special load-bearing D-ring that lets you attach your sling strap directly to your camera when you\u2019re not using Capture.\nCAPTURE VS. CAPTURE PRO\nHere's a look at Capture, CapturePRO, and the different quick-release plates that you can get with them:\nCapture\u00ae is a simpler, less expensive camera clip for folks who just need a better way to carry their camera. CapturePRO\u00ae is the full-featured all-aluminum Cadillac of camera clips - designed to meet the strength and compatibility needs of serious photographers. Both clips are designed to carry cameras of any size. CapturePRO\u00ae just has a bit more functionality:\n\nWHAT CAN I GET BY SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT?\nIf you to like go places and do things with your camera, you'll get a big fat treat. In addition to Capture v2, we've got some amazing new accessories. Behold:\nCapture\u00ae: The standard entry-level version of Capture has a glass-reinforced nylon backplate and comes with our standard quick release plate (see FAQ for details). Pre-order at the $50 reward level.\nCapturePRO\u00ae: Our flagship professional version of Capture features an all-aluminum body and comes with one of 3 PROplates. It can be used as a tripod head and is compatible with multiple tripod systems, as well as sling straps and hand straps (see FAQ for details). Pre-order at the $65+ levels. Also, note the limited \"Naked Edition\" early bird specials!\nPROpad\u2122: This accessory (for all versions of Capture including v1) provides additional support and padding for folks who want to use Capture with heavy camera/lens/battery grip combinations, or those who are just looking for maximum comfort. Projected delivery in September. Included at the $95+ levels, or you can order it \"a la carte\" for $20 by selecting the $1+ reward.  This may seem obvious, but note that the PROpad is only useful if you have Capture.\nPOV Kit: We formerly called this the \"GoPro\u00ae Mount,\" but we've renamed it because it we've broadened it's capabilities. This accessory lets you use Capture as a rigid, positionable video-capture mount for your GoPro\u00ae, or other brand POV camera, or your point-and-shoot camera. This means you can take POV video from any backpack strap, belt or strap-like object.  The GoPro\u00ae Mount is best suited for Capture v2, but works with v1 too.  Projected delivery in October. Included at the $95+ levels (except the Early Bird Special).\nLeash & Cuff (not pictured above): Leash is our quick-connecting, uber-versatile camera strap. Cuff is our quick-connecting minimalist wrist strap. We launched these straps on Kickstarter in 2012. Included at the $150+ levels.\nWHAT ARE THE REWARD LEVELS?\nWe would love your support, and created reward levels based on what we think you'd love to get in return for your generosity. See the FAQs for information on adding individual products to your reward a la carte.\nPROPAD: USING CAPTURE WITH BIG OL' CAMERAS\nGot a heavy camera/lens/battery combo? Watch this video to see how PROpad\u2122 + Capture is the ultimate carrying solution for you:\nBased on feedback from our customers with super-sized rigs, we\u2019ve developed a supportive pad accessory that makes Capture an ideal solution for even the bulkiest of cameras. We call it the PROpad\u2122, and whether you have a large camera/lens/grip or you just want extra comfort when carrying your gear all day, this is the accessory for you.\nPROpad\u2122 allows you to side-load or top-load your camera into Capture when you wear it on your belt, and it can be worn on your backpack strap as well. PROpad\u2122 is constructed from super-tough Hypalon and has a gel-like compression-molded EVA foam back pad. We expect PROpad\u2122 to be ready to ship by September.\nPOV KIT: USING CAPTURE WITH GOPRO & POINT-AND-SHOOTS\nWant to know what the POV Kit is all about? First, watch this video.\nIf you can attach a DSLR to any strap or belt, then why the heck shouldn\u2019t you be able to do that with a POV video camera? Well, we\u2019ve got good news for you. Soon, you\u2019ll be able to use Capture (any version) to mount your GoPro\u00ae camera directly to any backpack strap, belt, or strap-like substrate to capture point-of-view video in exciting new ways. This accessory will also let you take POV video using other brand POV cameras, as well as point-and-shoot cameras. We plan on having it ready to ship by the beginning of October.\nMAKING CAPTURE\nWe care immensely about the quality of our products. 8 different materials go through 15 different transformation processes to produce 26 different parts for Capture v2.\nThis video gives some insight into how these raw materials are processed and assembled to become Capture. It also shows how closely we work with our manufacturing team in Wuxi, China to bring Capture to life. We filmed all of the footage in this video during a recent week-long trip to Wuxi to hash out our final production process for Capture v2, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed filming it.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT, SHIPPING, AND TIMING\nWhen this campaign ends on August 23rd, all backers will get a survey sent via email. We'll ask you to provide your shipping address, and you'll also specify which quick-release plate you want (if you pre-ordered CapturePRO\u00ae) and which items you want from the a-la-carte menu. Until then we don't need any shipping info from you - so just sit back and relax. You deserve it!\nWe have every intention of shipping Capture\u00ae and CapturePRO\u00ae starting shortly after our funding campaign ends, no foolin'. That means most of you will be receiving your rewards in the month of September, international backers maybe early October. Leash\u2122 and Cuff\u2122 will also be shipping immediately after the campaign ends.\nThe PROpad\u2122 and POV Kit might take a little longer to ship. We're still finalizing our supply chain for those products. We don't want to hold up shipping of Capture, so for that reason these accessories may ship separately. So you might get your rewards in 2 shipments. We won't make you wait too long though - we should have them ready to go in October.\nIf you've chosen one of our limited Naked Edition early bird rewards, your CapturePRO Naked Edition units, your reward should be on it's way! If you haven't gotten a shipping notification from us, please check your Kickstarter messages immediately.\nWe kindly ask international backers to add a single $15 amount to their pledge to cover shipping. If you have questions about international shipping, please see our FAQ.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupply Chain Risks\nHoly smokes, have we learned a thing or two about our supply chain over the last two years! One of the main ingredients in making Capture V2 an outstanding product was improving our supply chain by selecting the right manufacturers, the right materials and the right processes. We can't even begin to convey how monumental of a task this has been, but the short and sweet answer is that it's paid off - we have a high-quality product, and we have a much higher confidence in our ability to build lots of them, and do it on time. But, things can still go awry. A supplier may slip a deadline or their machines might break down or they might run out of a certain type of paint. Those things would delay fulfillment.\n\nDesign Risks for Future Products\nPROpad\u2122 and the GoPro\u00ae Mount are not quite as far along as Capture V2. PROpad\u2122 has a complete design but we still need to create packaging for it. the GoPro\u2122 Mount is getting a couple small tweaks to the final prototype. We anticipate these products being ready in September, but it could take a bit longer if we have to do any major redesign work. Highly unlikely though.\n\nActs of God\nWe're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, God forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

Digital download only.\"\nWhat's the story about?\nSet against the backdrop of a great war Carbon Grey follows twin sisters Mathilde and Giselle Grey, members of a noble family dedicated to protecting the Kaiser of Mitteleuropa, as they struggle to reconcile duty with their own beliefs and ambitions. When the Kaiser is killed a vast conspiracy is uncovered, centered around a prophecy made long ago by Gottfaust, father to the Greys and hero of Mitteleuropa, that the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey \u2013 will one day spark a revolution.\n  Summary\nThe sisters of the Greys; descendants of Gottfaust \u2013 Godlike hero of the nation\u2019s Golden Era. For over three hundred years their family have protected and counseled the Kaiser, ruler of the Prussian Empire. The sisters are beautiful, wise and deadly; bred for purity and groomed to achieve perfection.\n\nThrough generations there have always been three \u2013 one for Strength, one for Grace and one for Wisdom.\n\n\nBut this is a different time.\n1913. At the beginning of the industrial age a great war is raging. As the myth of glory in battle is cut to ribbons on the frontline of Mitteleuropa twin sisters are born; Mathilde and Giselle. One of these two sisters is the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey, prophesied by Gottfaust to bring about a renaissance, and restore the nation to glory.\n\n  Both are flawed; imperfect in different ways. Giselle is disobedient, stubborn; but her faults are hidden. Mathilde does not share the physical perfection of her sisters, something she cannot hide. And an exposed flaw can be exploited.\n\n\nThis war is a diversion, orchestrated by the ruthless Queen, Raisa Vasilyeva. She conspires to manipulate Mathilde, twisting Gottfaust\u2019s prophecy to turn sister against sister, all to gain possession of the Stone, the source of Gottfaust\u2019s Godlike power.\n\n  When the Kaiser is murdered Giselle must run, traveling west across the scorched battlefields of Mitteleuropa on a mission to deliver a mysterious letter into the heart of enemy territory. Pursued by the sisters and hunted by the enemy Giselle must discover the prophecy\u2019s true meaning before the Cossack queen harnessed the power of the stone to rewrite history itself.\n\n  Carbon Grey has been a labor of love for my friends and I. We have been working on and off with this project for over a decade. It is a dedication born of passion, perseverance and hard work, and the belief that one day we'll complete this journey. Now that day is finally here.\nLast year we successfully launched and executed our first Kickstarter project to fund the second volume of Carbon Grey. We couldn't have done it without the support of the community.\nWe're now reaching out to the Kickstarter community again to help fund the final chapter. It will be a two issue mini-series published by IMAGE Comics.

We also wanted to do something with Superheroes in the future. Hero Punk is a dystopian, hard sci-fi superhero film that -- we believe -- the studios would never make.\nIf you are a fan of CHRONICLE, BLADE RUNNER, DARK CITY and THE MATRIX, you'll probably like Hero Punk. If you read comics and graphic novels like PREACHER and TRANSMETROPOLITAN, you'll almost certainly love Hero Punk. We are fans of those comics and we believe it shows in our film.\nCheck out our Kickstarter updates or Hero Punk website for storyboards!\nStyle of Hero Punk\nHero Punk takes place in a dystopian, cyberpunk future. It is a combination of a style called Steam Punk -- along with a present which has nano-bots, bio-enhancements and gene therapy.\nHero Punk Timeline\nThe world stopped innovating on all public fronts sometime around 2002 and factions developed which built weapons, vehicles and clothes from other, discarded items in the world. Because of this, the world looks like something between the 1800s and 2042, with modern weapons and clothes, combined with very intricately designed items.\n1942 - the government decided to eradicate any mutant abilities and eliminate any trace of superheroes. The Nazi\u2019s and the US worked together to put mutants in concentration camps, where they were exterminated for the greater good of the world.\n1962 - mutant rights activists began to protest and a new world government was formed and its ruling body, the UNITED NATIONS COUNCIL, outlawed lethal force against mutants.\n1970s - factions developed, with \u201cheroes\u201d on one side, \u201cnormals\u201d on the other. German and US scientists went to work synthesizing the enzyme to suppress special abilities.\n1988 - no mutant abilities exist, due to the enzyme (and airborne pathogens). All water on earth is laced with harmless, microbial enzymes. All air has pathogens.\n1990 - technology catches up with science. Bio-tech weapons, fusion reactors and enhanced humans were beginning to emerge. An unmanned ship crashes on earth, carrying a message. The message is deciphered and wide-spread panic causes the planet to band together. The message was simple; WE ARE COMING.\n1995 - along with the threat of annihilation by a potentially hostile alien species, the Government started to make attempts to colonize space, attempting to build large bio- domes, which were called \u201cSpheres\u201d.\n2001 - Fusion reactors explode and kill over 2 billion people. The UNITED NATIONS COUNCIL makes the choice to halt all space exploration, ban all fusion technology and prepare for the possibility of alien invasion by setting up the \u201cARMORY\u201d. The world revolts, the police are useless.\n2031 - Deveaux forms The Enclave, a kind of secret project to save humanity, with loose ties to the government.\n2040s - Lane, an ex-bounty hunter with a troubled past, begins to pull together his own team to save the world; The Resistance.\nAbout The Creator\nKanen is the creator of this show is the founder of Scruffy.TV and the host of That Post Show (the most popular post-production podcast on iTunes). He has a history of web and Hollywood successes, including the original THAT MEDIA SHOW (now The Scruffy Show) which helped launch Glee star Darren Criss and then starred Morgan Cullen and Austin Scott.\nHero Punk: The Film\nWhen finished, Hero Punk will be made available online for a small fee (around $10) and will also be distributed on Netflix, iTunes and/or Amazon as a full-length feature, available for rent and purchase.\nWe are actively seeking other distribution channels, such as Redbox and Walmart.\nWe've even had a little press already!\nSo far...\nIn late January, 2013, we shot the first half of Hero Punk on a large (over 1,100 square foot) green screen stage in a studio in San Francisco. We assembled almost a hundred actors and we shot on the BlackMagic Cinema Camera. We have confirmed with BlackMagic Design that we are the first feature film ever shot on this amazing camera!\nBlackmagic even wrote about us.\nSince then, we've shot more of Hero Punk and we're in the process of finishing all our shooting, which will be complete in April/May.\nOur total out of pocket cost for Hero Punk is around $55k so far. This Kickstarter campaign will help us raise the money needed to finish shooting pick-ups and several new scenes for Hero Punk and will pay to complete the editing, visual effects and sound design for the film.\nRemember, our goal is our minimum required to complete Hero Punk.\nHero Punk is over 80% green screen with 3D backgrounds. We've shot some of the film in practical locations, but these account for a small percentage of the final film.\nThe Crew\nWritten by Kanen Flowers, Hero Punk is a labor of love that started in 2008. It is being Directed by Kanen Flowers, with help from Paul Del Vecchio and Patrick Johnson.\nKurtis Lee Hermes - Assistant Director\nDrew Bishop - Audio Engineer\nManual Salas - Audio Engineer\nSky Tallone - 2nd Camera and Behind The Scenes\nOlly Quinn - On-Set Editor\nKristin Martin - Audio Editor\nMatt Christensen - Colorist\nJohn Osteen - Editor\nCarolyn Stampeen - VFX Coordinator\nCory McElrea - Grip\nGameli Anumu - Grip\nColton Coate - Grip / PA\nDoug Birnbaum - Grip\nJady Brooks - Script Supervisor\nMichael Morgan - Script Supervisor\nKendell Evans - Wardrobe\nJonathan Reisfield - Makeup\nKayla Franz - Makeup\nMolly Gazay - Makeup\nStar Symmetric - Makeup\nAaron Cook - PA\nMary Wieczorek - PA\nMelissa Wan Wen - PA\nJesse Muick - PA\nSamantha Alvarez - PA\nSteven Emerson - PA\nThe Actors (and their Characters)\nJamil Vaughn plays Lane, the Leader of the Resistance. He was a Bounty Hunter and a thief until 2032. Jamil's nickname during Hero Punk was \"Vaughn Diesel\", because we were reminded of Pitch Black when we saw him in his gear, barking orders to the Resistance.\nDamien Jade Warren plays DEVEAUX and leads the ENCLAVE. He developed bio-weapons and nano-technology for the government. Is perceived as a villain by the Resistance, because of his Machiavellian choices and his creation of The Courier. Former CEO of a billion- dollar company who still has ties to the government. A kind of Sherlock Holmes meets Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle Corporation.\nRyder Darcy plays Caleb, The Conduit, who has the ability to counteract the pathogen(s) which suppress the mutant abilities. Anyone who is around him starts to regain their mutant ability. This lasts -- if The Conduit is alive. \nJeremy Jones plays Simon, the Holographic Avatar. He is the \"Jarvis from Iron Man\" character. A rogue program, created by PALMER, Simon has the facts and helps LANE and the RESISTANCE survive. \nSherman Koltz plays Palmer,  the wise man, who may also be completely insane. Fueled by anger, his dialogue can be abrupt and confusing. Palmer curses constantly. PALMER created SIMON, along with several technologies used by the everyone in Hero Punk. \nChris Morrell plays Palmer when he's younger. He works for a crappy data entry firm. Later, he gets a job with the Government and builds \"The Kite\" and other technologies.\nNatalie Dickinson plays Fade. She is the fighter in the Resistance and she can summon a kind of force-field when needed, along with other powers.\nDialy Paulino plays Rhea, she's beautiful, European and charming. She joins the Resistance with Caleb, who she is dating.\nKatie Whitcraft plays Shaw. She joins the Resistance, along with Fade, Caleb and Rhea. When her powers manifest, she learns to \"teleport\". If she\u2019s near Caleb, she can transport at will. She can also heal people, sometimes.\nKeagan Weathington plays \"The Courier\". He has enhanced abilities, all technology-based. Has tattoos which come to life. Wears a near impenetrable spider- mesh body armor to protect his chest. All his weapons have a slow-death neuro-toxin on them. \nConstance Hasapopoulos plays Madam Assange, the Leader of the free world and the third \"elected\" president of the New Government. The people trust her, because she's right and fair. The fear her because of her massive power. She has a scar on her face from an explosion years prior. \nAlfonso Godinez plays Langley, Deveaux's right hand. He is very serious about the Enclave, but has a sense of humor. He's good at getting into places and carries a small satchel and a gun on the other side. He keeps a leather folio, with a lock pick set. \nSyra MacCarthy plays Shifler. She's addicted to Eastwood (it\u2019s a drug). She has part EEL DNA to help her move, survive in cold water for long periods and have better vision in dense fog or smoke. Sniper rifle bad-ass. \nDixon Phillips plays Ramsey and runs the DELTA ARMORY. Originally from Memphis -- he fights to hide the accent he would have had. Ramsey is in charge of orbital stations, like Epsilon Six, which are scheduled to be online in mid 2042. \nMike Guerra plays Harkness. He spends time in the street and commands the DELTA ARMORY ground troops. He\u2019s also Ramsey\u2019s advisor and friend.\nOther Stuff\nThe more money we raise, the better Hero Punk and the visual effects and sound and color will be. If we meet our minimum goal (of $28,500), it will be about eight months. Our stretch goal of $42k will allow us to finish by Oct/Nov of 2013. Anything more will help us finish a bit sooner and have a better finished film.\nAnything over our stretch goal will allow us to start pre-production for the second film in the trilogy, HERO PUNK: PART II (and, believe me, we'd be dancing around the living room of our respective houses, listening to \"Walking on Sunshine\", while drinking cheap champagne and belting lyrics like we don't care who our neighbors are... that's how much we'd appreciate it).\nWe will be posting interviews, behind-the-scenes and much more over the next weeks, including interviews with Kanen (the director), Paul Del Vecchio (the co-cinematographer), Patrick Johnson (the co-cinematographer), Jamil Vaughn (who plays Lane) and much more.\nThank you!\nThanks for reading this long message.

Or worse, running out of juice while on an important conference call (or at the climax of a movie).   I had tried all the battery case add-ons and even a few of those $100.00 remote batteries, and was always left disappointed.  It seemed that they made their predictions in some kind of perfect world lab.   I set out last year to figure out what would make the perfect remote charging battery back up unit and I think I have landed it with my product.  \nFirst off we did real world load testing on tons of different battery systems and chemistries.  We selected lithium polymer and lithium Ion as our battery chemistry mostly for the quick charge times, length of idle charge holding and lifetime cycling strength. I personally think this is the best battery you can get and I have yet to have one let me down. \nAll The Models next to an iPhone 4S for comparison\nNext we had to find a way to package it that was traveler friendly, would not make the TSA think you are a terrorist and would work with all those existing cables I already had.  We discovered that having a USB with 2.1A output to charge tablets really made charging faster, so we had to fit that in.  I will admit the first few designs were a little clunky and failed to meet the aesthetic standards we set out to match. (Think Radio Shack Project Box and Duct Tape) The final three products however I think are really slick. They are all smaller than even the smallest paperback book.  The largest one, Destination  measures in at 3.75 x 5.25 and is only 5/8th of an inch thick and our smallest model, Adventurer, is 2.55 x 3.9 and is 3/4 of an inch thick. \nWe included some flashy-blinky LEDs to let you now how full your tank is...and then I realized they wasted power and annoyed some of my friends that I had asked to evaluate the prototypes.  So, we went a head and added a push button to check your batteries charge... it will light up indicating the level of charge (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and then turn off, not wasting precious milliamps and annoying your airline seat-mate. (I still like the Rave in a Box idea...but lost out to cooler heads).  The unit will flash status while you are charging it... since you recharge the power banks by plugging them into your computer's USB port anyway I thought the light show was a bonus. (if you don't like it flip if over) The following YouTube video shows you how easy it is to charge your devices and the batteries.  These are pre-produciton units off the production tooling!\nLastly we found a supplier of universal cables that supported a bunch of different mobile phones, gaming devices, tablets and digital cameras.  We negotiated what we think is a great price for these and decided to package our batteries with the whole kit.  Out of the box, with the included cables, you can charge: Iphone 3-4s, Ipad, PSP, Nokia, Micro 5 Pin USB, Mini USB, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG. Of course it will work with your existing cables too, but if you ever save someone who lost or forgot their cable, think of me...\nPlugs included with Universal Adaptor\nI have three models to offer you: \nOur 6600mAh version, the Adventurer ($30.00 reward), will charge an iPad from 20% to full one time or charge an iPhone, or similar mobile phone, 3-4x from zero to full.  (these are our real world tests, not theoretical numbers) The best results were at room temp, about 70F or 25c.  Charging time from zero to full for the battery from USB is about 6 to 8 hours.  You can expect a lifetime of over 500 charging cycles. \nThe Adventurer, Single USB, 6,600mAh\nOur 10,000mAh version, The Destination ($65.00 reward), has enough juice to recharge an iPad from zero to full about 1.5x.  Or your iPhone, or similar mobile phone, 6-8x from zero to full. (these are our real world tests, not theoretical numbers) The best results were at room temp, about 70F or 25c.  A full charge for this battery, from zero, is between 6 and 7 hours from a USB connection. This unit has a sleek brushed aluminum chasis that looks like a baby computing device from our favorite fruit company. The aluminum case helps with heat dissipation during charging and costs quite a bit more to make than the plastic case, but the heft and quality are impressive. (and it looks really cool sitting next to a MacBook or iPad)\nThe Destination, Dual USB, 10,000 mAh\nOur biggest capacity version, The Expedition ($50.00 reward), is a whopping 11,200mAh Lithium Ion battery that will charge your iPad 1.5x and your iPhone 2x on a single charge. Or you could charge your iPhone almost 10x from zero to full! This is our first use of Lithium Ion and we are very impressed.  An additional benefit of LI-Ion is only a 4-6 hour charge from empty to full form our Mac Pro Tower USB connection! This unit is in a high-impact polymer case and comes Black or White.  Best performance bang for the buck, but unfortunately this new battery will not fit in our existing brushed aluminum case. (YET!).\nThe Expedition, Dual USB, 11,200 mAh\nHere are photos of The Expedition and The Adventurer in Black\nBlack Destination for Reference\nI have made it through the prototype and pre-production phase with my own savings and the help of my manufacturing partners, and if I want to  keep making $500.00 one-offs I am set, but to get to full production I need to raise the funds to go into mass production, hire a web guy to build a direct sales site, and find a community of people who have had a chance to own and use the product to tell everyone how awesome it is! We have already completed FCC, CE and RoHS testing and certification. Once the project funds we will be  able to deliver production units within 4-6 weeks!  \nI am a solid-state lighting guy by trade.  I have spent all of my working life either selling LEDs or designing LED systems for everything from on/off indicators to parking garage luminaires.   This is not my first product, but the first one I am doing all by my onsies.  Whether you chose to support my project or not I would love your feedback and input on how we can make an even better remote battery solution! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk I have is not raising enough to create a full production run with my contract manufacturer in Shenzhen, China.

Read all about it here.\nUpdate: Halo Co-Creator Chooses LiveCode to Build Graphic Novel Experience\nThis is such an amazing new iOS app that we wanted to share details here.\nWhat is this Kickstarter Campaign About?\nHave you ever had an idea for an app but don\u2019t know how to code?\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to code but found it too difficult?\nHave you ever been frustrated by how long it takes to write an app?\nAre you frustrated with the current state of computer science education in high school?\nDo you want to help establish coding as a new form of literacy?\nAre you interested in a better way to write software for your company?\nIf you answered YES to any of these questions, then we need your help.\nIn 1987 Apple created a program called HyperCard. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, all you need to know is that tens of millions of end user programmers used it. It was the easiest and most popular end user programming environment ever created, before or since.\nLiveCode is like a next generation version of HyperCard. It is used to create #1 one app store apps, real-time flight booking systems and control satellites. It is used to create simple one off apps and utilities to solve day-to-day problems.\nThere are some things it can\u2019t do \u2013 yet. This project is to create a next-generation LiveCode.\nOur vision is that this new next-generation LiveCode will be free and open source.\nIt will run on every popular platform and device.\nIt will let you write programs in English.\nAnd by being open, its English language programming will be extensible to any computing problem out there. That's a world first.\nIf you couldn\u2019t code before, LiveCode is the answer. If you\u2019ve used the existing version of LiveCode before and it didn\u2019t do everything you needed, this next-generation version has you covered.\nWhat is LiveCode? Our story.\nComputer Science Students Love LiveCode\nAlmost a quarter of secondary schools in Scotland are now teaching with LiveCode.\nEvery school that has used LiveCode for more than a year has seen a doubling of uptake in advanced computer science classes!\nBy supporting this project, you\u2019ll be helping create a version of the platform even more suitable for teaching.\nIt will be free for schools and universities worldwide.\nWe believe that computational thinking and programming is a key form of digital literacy and that enabling a new generation to write interactive software is critically important in today's economy.\nStudents use LiveCode to create games and apps for their own smartphones and tablets. Although the LiveCode language is easy to use, it is a sophisticated and complete programming language suitable for teaching all aspects of computational thinking needed for this age group, even including advanced concepts for older students (e.g. arrays, parameter passing by reference). \nThe open source edition of LiveCode will be free and available to schools globally. Read more about LiveCode in Education.\nWhat is your money going toward?\nWe need to raise \u00a3350,000 to fund an experienced team to do this right.\nWe will re-engineer the whole platform so it is easy for the community to contribute to the code base. Did you know that Linux only took off after a version of it was created that was modularized with a kernel? We\u2019ll be doing the same to LiveCode. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about this here.\nWe will introduce a new technology called \u201cOpen Language\u201d. With Open Language, the more technical members of our community can create English-like words and phrases to enable everyone to write programs that use any aspect of a computer or device. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about that here.\nWe will introduce a new visual editor designed around today\u2019s usability standards. The editor will be open. The more technical members of our community can create simplified versions of the editor for tablets or primary schools.\nHere is a screenshot of the prototype:\nWhen Will it Be Completed?\nWithin a month of the campaign closing we will launch the Community Edition with the source code. That version will have the source code as it is today. This will provide everyone who has made a pledge access to the platform.\nOver the following few months we will be hard at work on the main goal of creating the next generation of the platform. We will restructure the code into modules that plug into a new kernel and deliver this version for testing over the summer. Once that is complete the community will be able to contribute to the source code easily.\nTechnical Summary of Kickstarter Deliverables\nWe are going to use the Kickstarter funding to deliver the next generation of the entire LiveCode language and visual development environment. To do this we need to do some packaging and updating, including:\nPacking the source code into community-friendly modules\nOptimize the execution engine and some older components\nAdd a clean architecture to allow new language plugins to be developed\nCreate a new, beautiful graphical front-end for building your apps\nThe scope of these tasks is considerable. We will be reorganizing some half a million lines of C++ code, running on six platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and Server, into straightforward modules that plug into the new kernel. We will be porting our English-like syntax into a new uniform virtual machine layer and adding a way to let the community add its own syntax. Another team will be working on re-designing the visual editor in parallel to make the platform even easier to get started with and use!\nWhile we will be making the code base available in its current form immediately, these important changes will take the platform to the next level, and make it much easier for the open source community to make contributions. At the end of this we will have a beautiful, consistent and openplatform.\nStretch Goals\nWe have designed the project to be flexible and there is so much more we can add to the new Open Source platform.\nWe have some truly amazing stretch goals - features for students, for gamers, for commercial companies and more. Supporting our stretch goals will let us deliver the future to you much faster. Example stretch goals include a brand new multimedia layer, new sprite capabilities and support for additional platforms!\nWe have goals covering virtually every enhancement request our customers have ever made, so please stay tuned.\nWho You Will Be Working With\nThe LiveCode Team - click to learn more about us\nRewards\nEvery pledge you make is so important to the success of this exciting project and we have developed fantastic rewards to thank you for your support.\nEveryone who contributes more than \u00a312 ($20) will get a complete set of LiveCode Training Academies where you can learn everything you need to know to create your own app or game.\nThe pricing in euros and US dollars is an estimate and your actual conversion rate may vary slightly.\nPlease Make a Pledge.

Help us reach our stretch goal for P&A (prints and advertising). Thank you!\nTHE STORY\nCHEATIN' is an animated adult tale of love, jealousy, revenge, and murder \u2013 full of nudity and violence, but also with my surreal sense of humor. The story is inspired by the work of James M. Cain (\u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d, \u201cThe Postman Always Rings Twice\u201d). CHEATIN' marks my 7th animated feature film.\nI've always enjoyed using watercolors in my illustrations, and now, for the first time, I can employ my painterly sensibilities to the treatment of my animation. This loose, almost impressionistic style has never been seen before in my films. Thanks to this new aesthetic and a beautiful, full-length musical score, I believe CHEATIN' will be a breakthrough for my career! Unfortunately this style is very difficult and time-consuming to complete.\nI am an artist and take great pride in my status as an independent filmmaker. I don't work with big production houses and I draw every frame myself. Including my Producer and Art Director, my studio employs 10 artists who need to digitally clean, paint, and composite over 40,000 animation drawings. We have an editor, composer, and sound designer working out-of-house, making the total staff under 20 people \u2013 quite small compared to the thousands on staff at large animation studios such as Pixar or Disney. For these reasons, it's very difficult to raise funds for this project, and that's why we need your support!\nWith your help, we hope to complete this landmark film by next September \u2013 just in time to qualify for the Oscars!\nThank you for your support!\n- Bill Plympton\nEXCLUSIVE KICKSTARTER VIDEO UPDATES\nI will be posting exclusive Kickstarter videos once a week until the end of January.

I did not squander my money on drugs or a fancy home. I went from 1967-1994 before I saw my first royalty check. The music giants I recorded with only paid me for 7 of my albums. I have never seen a penny in royalties from my other 10 albums I recorded. Our hit song was licensed to over 100 films, TV & commercials without our permission. One major TV network used our song for a national commercial and my payment was $625 dollars. I am now 72, trying to live on $1200 a month. Sweet Relief, a music charity, is taking donations for me. Only the 1% of artists can afford to sue. I am the 99%.\u201d\nThe music industry may have screwed Lester Chambers for decades, but we the internet public can right their wrong.\nThanks to the open internet (things we fought for against SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, etc.), sites like Kickstarter and other innovations that are being worked on by entrepreneurs right now, we have the opportunity to do right by artists and cut out those who'd mistreat them. We have the opportunity to create solutions that will support artists in the digital world.\nThe Chambers Brothers\nLester Chambers is putting together a new album titled \"Lester's Time Has Come.\" With this project, we have the opportunity to support not only the awesome work of a storied and talented musician, but we have the chance to stand up against the tyranny of the record industry.

All the times I sat hoping and wishing I could make another record had finally come true. In this record I promise to have some of the worlds GREATEST songs from your past and some Great New songs for your new year to come!\"\nRead more about Lester in his interview with Vice.\nFather & Son\nEven with a daunting list of illnesses and a life of hardship at the hands of the music industry, Lester is not a beaten man, far from it, and it's clear that his son is a big part of that.\n\"My son, Michael Dylan, said 'Dad don't worry. I'm never gonna leave you. Always stay by your side.' He slept on the floor with me....

Barrie into a graphic novel that is as true to source as possible. The original story is one of the most beautiful novels I've every read, and has always been a huge inspiration to me. I feel current adaptations leave a lot of the original story left untold, or have fundamentally changed story elements. Therefore I feel doing this Graphic novel is a terrific way to highlight the fantastic original story of Peter Pan in it's entirety. I also intend to further explore Peter Pan and Captain Hook's backstory by adapting parts from J.M Barrie's The Little White Bird  ( prequel to Peter and Wendy) and a little known information given by Barrie about Jas. Hook into the story. \nI also would like to create something that parents can share with their children. It's my hope that creating something children can also experience will encourage reading, creativity, and appreciation of classic tales.\nThose that have not read the novel may not realize just how much deeper and more involved the original story is. I don't want to give away all the differences between present adaptations and source material, but I promise it will be worthwhile to experience them if you are a Peter Pan fan like I am.\n                              (click image to see larger)\n2 page spread preview (unlettered) This part adapted from \"The Little White Bird\"\nI am not a Peter Pan expert, I am just a person who is a lifelong fan who loves the story.  I'm so looking forward to starting this project, and to highlight J.M. Barrie's masterpiece to the best of my abilities.\n                              (click image to see larger)\n                              *   *   *\nWhy we need funding....\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to get VOLUME 1 (of 3) completed, and set the groundwork for the rest of the series. I will be adapting and penciling the artwork, while my husband, Ray Dillon, will be tackling inking, coloring and lettering. Ray and I previously worked on the New York Times Bestselling adaptation of Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn Graphic Novel by IDW. You can see some at our work on TLU HERE.\nI am focused on Volume 1 of Peter Pan right now because I don't want to keep backers waiting for over a year for the whole series to be completed before they receive their reward.\nUpon first sight, $48,000 seems like a lot of money. However, Kickstarter campaigns are not straight donations and in reality a campaign costs a lot  of time and money to fulfill rewards ordered and manage correspondance. So only part of the money asked for actually go towards creative production of the book. \nProduction costs- We are the entire creative team for the book, and if you break down what funding we'd get for the 90 pages of full production work we'd create, the rates break down to less than we would get paid elsewhere. I didn't even include funding for the time to adapt, letter, design, create promotional images, covers, pin ups, take care of the Kickstarter, or work on the sketchbook. In short; we are not becoming rich by any means with this campaign. Our only intent is to be able to work on Peter Pan, and be able to survive through it!\nKickstarter/Amazon Fees - Roughly 8%-10% of final funding\nTaxes -  self employed rates apply\nProduction of books - These rates vary depending on amount ordered, but takes up a nice chunk of funds\nShipping & shipping supply - Another large chunk, depending on amount shipped\nBuffer Amount - This should be included in ANY Kickstarter. This includes money aside for dropped pledges, lost books, refund requests, and any errors and miscalculations.\n                              *   *   *\nHow Kickstarter Works...\nKickstarter is unlike regular online ordering experiences in that you are not just buying an item for precise arrival, you are joining us in our personal adventure to complete this project. You'll be with us for both the victories as well as the bumps and difficulties, all culminating in receiving the final product which we have all given so much to achieve. Kickstarter is more about supporting ideas, people, and projects than it is to receive an item right away. Just so you're aware of everything before you join us in Neverland! :)\nStep 1. Create a Kickstarter account, and determine payment method\nStep 2. Decide which Reward you'd like, taking special note of any shipping estimates.\nStep 3. Wait and see what happens! If our campaign is successful by December 20th, then your card will be charged and your reward is secured. If our campaign is unsuccessful, then your card will NOT be charged.\nStep 4. (optional ;) ) If you would really like to see this project succeed, then the most helpful thing you could do is help spread the word! Tweets, facebook posts, blog posts, whatever you want to do to help, we would eternally appreciate it!\n                              *   *   *\nRewards...\nWe are aiming for September 2013 for delivery on most rewards. Please consider this includes an overestimate of about 4-5 months for research and production, 1 month for design, 2 months for printing, and 1 month for shipping.\n***Christmas 2012: For those who order Peter Pan: Vol. 1 as gifts, you will have access to a printable certificate on December 20th featuring new Holiday Peter Pan artwork. It will certify the recipient that they have a copy reserved for them for when the project is completed next year. They will also get a password protected URL link to visit to see the same previews and updates you receive as a Kickstarter Backer! :) Merry Christmas!\nUnless noted otherwise, ALL rewards include your name listed in the \"Honorary Lost Boys and Girls\" section of the book, as well as access to Kickstarter Exclusive previews and updates!\nTYPES OF REWARDS \nPeter Pan: The Graphic Novel - Vol. 1: This will be a hardcover, 100 page, full color graphic novel. The story will be about the first 3rd of the original story, as well as extra bits from The Little White Bird and, if space allows, a small peek at an adaptation of little know information given by J.M. Barries about Captain Hook. For bonus material I hope to include an interview with Christine De Poortere, Peter Pan director from the Great Ormond Street Hospital, as well as a brief biography spotlighting their relationship with Peter Pan.\nPeter Pan: The Companion Guide: A sketchbook sized 90 page booklet that includes ALL the penciled artwork for Volume 1, as well as thoughts and notes on the adaptation process by me!\nSigned/Sketch/Artwork Copies: These copies will require longer processing time as to have time to create the artwork on the interior cover :) Signed copies should be much faster.\nCameo Reward: This reward will require a photo and release of likeness form signed. I will send you a scan of your cameo when finished! :) Note: I probably won't have time for any revisions, but I'll do my best to make sure it's right!\nPage to Yourself Reward: Please contact beforehand to be sure we can print what you have in mind! :)\nEvent/Hooks Revenge Reward: Contact if you have any questions!\n*NEW* Penciled Page Reward - You'll receive one penciled page from the Graphic Novel. These pages are 11 x 17 and will be chosen at random (though if you have a requested section of the story, let me know and I'll try to accomodate!) HERE is a sample of my penciled work: Note - this sample is a 2 page spread. Your will be getting a standalone page\n*NEW* Tinker-Doodle Reward - (YES I noticed I typed \"dairy dust\" instead of \"fairy dust\" in the reward listing, and NO you will not be getting powdered milk with your reward! :p ) Here is the Tinker Bell Doodle to expect in the companion guide (though it may slightly vary)! There are slight gold \"fairy dust\" accents.\n                              *   *   *\n  Great Ormond Street Hospital...\nBefore J.M. Barrie passed, he relinquished all rights and profits to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in England. His hope was that Peter Pan's success would forever serve to help children in need. The novel version of Peter Pan is now in public domain, however I am determined to keep to the spirit of Barrie's gift. If somehow this series (Volume 1 and onward) becomes successful upon regular publication, it is my goal to benefit GOSH in some way. It is only right. \n                              *   *   *\nJOIN US ON THE ADVENTURE!\nPeterPanComic.com | Twitter | Facebook\nA VERY special thank you to Peter Mellini and his store, Nostalgic Book & Comics for helping us get this Kickstarter up and running!

Please add $5 to your total pledge for international orders.  And we will ask for your color preference and shipping address at the end of the campaign!\nThanks for checking out the Sunskis! We\u2019ve received a ton of support getting this far and we\u2019re really excited to finally share all of our hard work with everyone. We\u2019re bringing back some incredible vintage sunglasses that were nearly lost to the pages of history. There are only five pairs left on the planet, which is why we\u2019re here on Kickstarter\u2014to save these sunglasses from extinction! The new shades are stylish, polarized and contagiously fun to wear. \nWith your support, we'll be able to bring the Sunskis back, and you can be the first to wear these awesome shades in over 25 years! \n- Tom & Michael\nThree years ago, Tom returned from a surf trip in Australia with a curious souvenir tucked away in his carry-on.  Hiding among the sandy remains of his journey were a few pairs of colorful sunglasses called Sunskis. These vintage Australian shades haven\u2019t been made in 25 years, and Tom\u2019s few pairs turned out to be the last Sunskis of their kind. \nWe think Sunskis are a wonderful design treasure that shouldn\u2019t be lost, so we\u2019ve put our product design experience to the work over the past six months preparing the Sunski revival with improved craftsmanship for all to enjoy. Our updated Sunskis feature polarized lenses and hand-polished polycarbonate frames, all wrapped up in the original, vibrant design. The end result is the perfect blend between timeless style and modern sunglasses technology. \nIn 2009, Tom went to Australia on a shoestring budget surf trip. With a tent, a board, and a duffel bag, he made his way up and down the eastern Australian coast riding waves, making great friends, and accidentally stumbling across the Sunskis. \nWhile visiting family in the tiny coastal town of Forster, Tom found Sunskis in a mom-\u2018n-pop surf shop right by the beach. A handful of pairs were out on a small sidewalk table, and they really caught his eye. They were like no sunglasses he\u2019d seen before, so he bought the remaining pairs and wore them for the rest of his time in Australia. They quickly became his most coveted surf trip accessory, alongside his surfboard and tent.\nWhen Tom got back to the States, he started wearing them at home and people immediately began to ask about the shades. Since everybody wanted a pair for themselves, we started doing some research about the Sunskis to try to find out how to get more for our friends. We had to wait until the Australian summertime to call the seasonal surf shack in Forster, but after speaking with them we discovered they were sold out completely. We then tried to track down the original manufacturer, but that company went out of business more than 20 years ago.  With nowhere else to get Sunskis, we decided to use our own product design experience to bring these incredible frames back to life. \nThe new Sunskis will combine the best of the past and the present. We\u2019ve taken the timeless design of the original frames and rebuilt the Sunskis using the latest in cutting edge sunglasses manufacturing. Check it out!\nThe Sunski lenses are made from multiple thermally fused polycarbonate layers. The center layer contains a horizontally polarized film to cut glare from reflective surfaces and water. The colored layer contains a bi-gradient-tint film with a variable Visible Light Transmission rating of 12% at the edges and 18% in the center, making them ideal for environments which involve both strong sunlight and strong reflected light\u2014such as on the snow, at the beach or on the water. The flash mirrored layer heightens contrast and blocks 100% of all UVA, UVB and UV400 ultraviolet rays, far surpassing US ANSI Z80.3-2001 regulations. The final layer features a clear and durable scratch-resistant layer to keep them looking great no matter what you throw at them.\nThe frames are made from injection-polycarbonate plastics that are hand-polished and assembled. The construction material is the lightest and most durable available on the market, while the elasticity of the arms provides a universal fit for the wearer\u2019s face. It\u2019s also transparent and neon and awesome. The aluminum composite hinges feature a molded pin that is part of the frame material, preserving flexibility while heightening durability.\nOur biggest goal with this Kickstarter project is to get Sunskis out into the world so they can be enjoyed again. As a result, the rewards for your support are pretty simple: you get Sunskis! We\u2019re also offering two awesome t-shirt designs (available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles) celebrating the Kickstarter launch. If you choose a reward that includes a t-shirt, you can pick what style and size you would like at the end of our Kickstarter campaign. \nEvery rewards tier will include a handwritten thank you card and an invitation to our launch party in San Francisco. After that, we have a few options to choose from, all of which will get you at least one pair of polarized Sunskis. Check them out here, and alongside the campaign to the right. All U.S. shipping is free, but if you are an international friend, please add 5USD to your pledge. \n$5: The handwritten thank you!\n$30: One pair of Sunskis (any color)\n$50: One pair of Sunskis (any color) & a t-shirt\n$60: Two pairs of Sunskis (any color)\n$80: Two pairs of Sunskis (any color) & a t-shirt\n$120: All four colors of the Sunskis & a t-shirt\n$250: 12 pairs of Sunskis (3 of each color) and a t-shirt, ideal for retailers and sunglasses mavens! \nThat pretty much sums it up.

We created Antigua Leather after being captivated by the quality of craftsmanship produced by leather artisans in Guatemala.\n\nWe built a relationship with a small group of exceptional artisans in Antigua, Guatemala who have honed their skills for generations, and together designed and crafted these beautiful products. We have combined traditional manufacturing methods while still maintaining style and functionality, to create products that can withstand the strenuous life of a traveler while suiting the needs of a student or businessman.\n\nYour Contribution:\nOur goal is to start this project by bringing handmade, authentic leather bags and cases from Guatemala to Kickstarter backers around the world. Kickstarter funding will cover the production costs and shipping.\n\nOur designs, production and shipping plans are finalized and are ready to go into action the moment our project is successful. \n\nThis project represents an excellent and beneficial opportunity for the Kickstarter backer, as our backers will not only receive one of our excellent leather products, but will additionally be supporting a new opportunity for hardworking, talented artisans in Guatemala.\n\nThe Products:\nMany \"high end\" designer bags on the market are only exceptional in price, not durability or design. Antigua Leather bags offer impeccable design and construction at a fraction of the price of a designer bag. Our motto: Pay for the bag, not the brand. These bags are durable, beautiful, and are fashioned from natural, pure leather instead of highly processed or synthetic materials. Antigua Leather presents to you three high quality, stylish items made specifically for the modern electronics you use everyday.\nThe Antigua Leather messenger bag is designed for modern laptops and tablets. We offer a 13\",  15\" and 17\" option to house your laptop and iPad with room to spare. Our iPad and iPhone leather cases provide a safe way to protect your device with a simple, durable leather sleeve.\nOur bags are designed in a minimalist style with the traveler, student and professional in mind. These bags will endure the daily stresses of the trail, and the office, while showing off a unique, authentic and timeless style.\nConstructed of full grain 3/16\u201d thick leather, the durability of these bags is one of their strongest assets. They feature alloy buckles and thick, sturdy stitching. These bags are tough and we are confident it will stand up to your high demands. The leather is rugged and will resist crumbling and tearing far better than most highly processed leathers on the market, but will also conform to your body shape and become more pliable with use.\nEach bag will be inspected for quality by hand before it is delivered. Quality, craftsmanship and backer satisfaction is our number one priority.\n\nWhy Antigua Leather?:\nComing from a world dominated by big-box stores and the convenience of cheap, disposable products, we wanted to break the trend of cheap, mass-manufactured goods. \n\nWe focused on providing cases for modern electronics that form the daily toolset of the modern student and businessman. We have worked closely with the artisans to design these high quality, unique products for the modern market. \n\nWe created a great line of tough, stylish bags that combine the craftsmen\u2019s traditional workmanship and quality with modern needs for durability, style and functionality. We hope you will support our vision and support this project. We look forward to sending you a unique, hand-crafted, quality leather case that will last you for years to come.\nMaking a Pledge to Antigua Leather:\nThank you for choosing to make our project a reality! Over to the upper right hand side of our project page, there are several different pledge tiers available with Rewards.\nIf you choose to pledge for the Bundle Pack, that includes one 15\" or 13\" Messenger Bag, one iPad sleeve and one iPhone sleeve, we added a discount if you order all three of our products together rather than individually.\nLastly, as you may have noticed, the Antigua Leather Signature Messenger Bag comes in two colors; Light Brown and Dark Brown. The iPhone and iPad cases come in three different colors; Light Brown, Brown, and Dark Brown.\nImmediately following the conclusion of our successful campaign, we will request your shipping address and also your preference for color.

Starring Jodelle Ferland of Silent Hill and Claudia Christian of Babylon 5, the film is the debut feature effort of Films by Neptune, a dynamic new production company based in San Francisco. Red will be distributed by RSquared Distribution.\nThe Film\nBased on the classic fairytale Little Red Riding Hood, Films by Neptune's Red follows teenage Rowan as she moves to San Francisco to live with her grandmother. But when unforseen circumstances force her to stay in a hotel instead, she tests her newfound independence out in the city, falling in with an older man who seems too good to be true. Are his intentions for her good? And if not, can she get away before it's too late?\nThe Cast\nLeading our cast as Rowan is Jodelle Ferland, star of Case 39 and Tideland, and recently featured in Twilight: Eclipse as the vampire Bree.\nClaudia Christian also stars as Marlena, a woman with a mysterious connection to Rowan.\nJoining Jodelle and Claudia is James Russell, star of 476 AD and festival hit short film The Crustacean Crisis.\nThe Crew\nWe have a fantastic crew of experienced Bay Area filmmakers working on the film, including Ben Einhorn and Wes Warfield on camera, Randy Hall on sound, Rachael Bell handling production design, and Alex Neil heading post-production.  Our writer and director is Danielle Colman, and our lead producer is Benjamin Yennie.\nWhy should I support Red?\nFor starters, \"Red\" is the finest example of independent film at its best.  Our shooting budget is tiny, but our cast and crew are world-class.  We started with a fantastic script, and that drew together a talented and dedicated team of actors and filmmakers, each of whom is bringing a unique voice to the production.  Every crew member has spent hours and hours working - so far for free - to give \"Red\" the level of detail and richness that it absolutely deserves, and it's poised to be an unforgettable experience on screen.\nMore importantly, \"Red\" deals with an incredibly relevant social issue: the issue of trust, and how that trust can be betrayed.  The lead character, Rowan (played by Jodelle), has to navigate a difficult new city in which no one is quite who they appear to be, and when she mis-judges whom she can trust, she finds her life hanging in the balance.  The mis-use of power and abuse of trust is something that real people go through every day: in fact, during our last Kicktarter campaign, one of our crew members found herself in a situation very close to what Rowan experiences over the course of the film.  We want \"Red\" to be more than just an entertaining film: we want it to be a story in which people with similar experiences can find an honest, respectful portrayal to which they can relate, and a cast of characters who can give those experiences voice.\nHow Kickstarter Works\nKickstarter is a platform for filmmakers and artists like us to raise funds from our audience: people like you. Anyone can pledge to the project, and in return we keep you informed about our efforts, and send out incentives and rewards once the money is raised. You can pledge any amount you like: for $1, you get access to exclusive updates from the cast and crew, and for $10,000, we'll fly the director, producer and a limited-edition DVD or Blu-ray of the film out to your location for a private screening party. In between, we're offering downloads of the film, special edition DVDs and Blu-rays, and replica production art, props and costumes from the film itself. Have a look to the right to see what we're offering at different pledge levels.\nPromotional buttons, available at the $7 pledge level\nTo help out, click on the amount you'd like to pledge, and Kickstarter will guide you through the process of selecting your reward and setting up your payment. Your card won't be charged until the end of the campaign, and only if we raise our goal. For more information, have a look at the Kickstarter FAQs.\nSPECIAL REWARDS\nRowan's and Marlena's gowns from the party scene, each available at the $750 pledge level. Designed by Roman Voytko Barosse.\nIn addition to rewards ranging from signed posters up to a personalized premiere party, we're also offering a limited number of special rewards, which will be actual items used during filming.  Keep an eye out throughout the campaign for these unique rewards!\nIsn't $25,000 kind of low? Is that enough to make a feature film?\nIn order, yes and sort of. $25,000 is only a fraction of our full budget, and it's not enough to make the whole film. But what it is enough to do is take care of a few key things that will persuade our other investors to come on board. Firstly, we'll be using the money to attach an actor to the lead male role and round out our amazing cast. We'll also use the money to kick pre-production into high gear, so that by the time we get to shooting we'll be ready to put something truly incredible on film.\nWhat happens if you don't reach $25,000?\nAbsolutely nothing. You don't get charged, we don't send out the incentives, and we go back to more traditional methods of trying to get the film financed. Unfortunately, that makes it anyone's guess whether we'll be able to get the film made at all.\nWhat happens if you raise more than $25,000?\nThat's the real question, isn't it?  $25,000 is only the very beginning of what we need to make this film, but our last campaign told us that we have enough fans to make that goal.  If we can succeed at that early in the campaign, then we want to use that success to push ourselves to raising even more money for the film!  Once we get close to $25,000, we'll start adding stretch goals so you can see exactly what we need to progress with different parts of making the film.  The more we raise on Kickstarter, the less we have to raise from investors, and the sooner we can go into production!\nLinks\nFind out more by going to the following links:\n\"Red\" on IMDB\nOur homepage\nOur Facebook page\nOur Twitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Hello backers", "update_content": "Hi backers,\nIt looks like Producer Ben has been posting some updates without running them by me, so I thought I'd clear things up some.\nIt is true that the project has been sold to my personal production company, Sognetto Films.

We will organize after-school programs at the center so children can learn how to knit and keep this tradition alive.\nEach pair of socks gets us one step closer to the knitting center.\nWe plan to open the center in time for winter, giving the women a place to knit when the weather turns cold. By sending Bloc Socks as early holiday gifts to your friends and family, you can help us give an early New Year's present to the knitting women of Patalenitsa.\nThe Debut Line of Bloc Socks (all except Valentina available at 45 $ level)\n1) The Dayko embodies the Bloc Sock style philosophy.

We plan to offer the style in a range of colors for both women and men, including tan and gold.\nToepa\n3) The Burgas is our indoor-outdoor model. The cable-knit, ankle-length slipper is thick and rugged enough to handle wood floors as well as the great outdoors.\nBurgas\n4) We named Sofia after the capital of Bulgaria, and this feminine indoor-outdoor slipper features a classic web pattern and a deep rose color.\nSofia\n5) The calf-length Zora has stolen the spotlight with her rings of bright color and tiny heart-shaped openings.\nZora\n6) Kalina is Zora's darker, more subtle sister. She's knit with more texture, deeper colors, and traditional bordering.\nKalina\n7) The feminine Meeka features a traditional pattern with a raised plume in front and two bands of purple woven around the ankle.\nMeeka\n8) Varna has a name that comes from the sea but a pattern that comes from the leaves of Bulgaria's autumn trees. Here she is in traditional brown and tan.\nVarna\n9) The Sebas, like the Dayko, is a versatile, ankle-cut slipper. It features a traditional weave pattern in front and alternating rows along the sides.\nSebas\n10) The Nadya is a delicate house slipper with a distinguished collar at the ankle opening. Here we have it in gold and bronze.\nNadya\n11) Valentina takes a traditional Bloc Socks pattern up to the knees.

All you need to do is choose how many MiniDrives you want, and we will collect your choice of model (i.e. the Nifty MiniDrive Pro, the Nifty MiniDrive [Air], or the Nifty MiniDrive Retina), as well as your choice of color and shipping address in our email survey at the end of the campaign.\nUPDATE - MiniDrive for the Retina MacBook Pro now available: See Update #2 for details.\nIMPORTANT: The MiniDrive does not come with a MicroSD card - that must be bought separately and can be easily acquired at almost any online or high street consumer electronics retailer :-)\nNOTE: A couple of people have pointed out to us that we have mixed our terms a little. To clarify; when we refer to the MiniDrive increasing the \"memory\" of your computer, we mean the storage space, not RAM. Sorry for any confusion that this might have caused!\nTHE PROTOTYPE\nThe main difference between the prototype and the production model is that we change the casing material of the body from mostly aluminium to an engineering plastic.\nThe front of the MiniDrive (the bit can be seen when the drive is inserted into the computer and is used for removal) will still be machined from high grade aluminium to ensure the fit and finish matches the MacBook.\nNote 1: The MiniDrive is really easy to remove from your computer - you just stick a paper-clip through the specially designed eyelet at the front of the device to pull it out!\nThe first time you use a paper-clip you can use the front of the drive to bend the paper-clip into a little hook - then you have your very own MiniDrive removal tool! Macgyver would be proud.\nOr, if you are not the paper-clip kind; if you can help us get over $500,000 pledges before the end of the Kickstarter campaign, we will be sending one of these out free with every MiniDrive we ship:\nThe Nifty Tool - Specially designed for removing your MiniDrive\nSee our updates for more details on the Nifty Tool!\nNote 2: The devices shown on all videos are the prototypes we made to test the concept - the appearance of the production drives will be as close to the following pictures as possible:\nNifty MiniDrive - for the Macbook Air\nNifty MiniDrive Pro - for the Macbook Pro\nNote 3: Pink and blue are special editions for our Kickstarter supporters, and will not be initially offered after the Kickstarter campaign.\nWHAT IS THE NIFTY MINIDRIVE?\nThe Nifty MiniDrive is an easy to use device that allows anyone to quickly and simply increase the available memory in their MacBook computer, as well as providing a set and forget back-up solution. \nThe Nifty MiniDrive + MicroSD Card\nTHE STORY\nIt all started with the MacBook Air. We wanted to create an easy way to add memory to the MacBook Air, without having to rip it open with a torx screwdriver.\nThe easiest way to do that of course is to use an external hard disk drive, but as that is not really integrated with the computer we thought we could do better.\nThe MiniDrive is designed to be an integrated solution to that problem by using the SD card slot in the 13\" MacBook Air.\nWhile a normal SD card, which sticks out by about 1cm from the body of the computer when fully inserted, the MiniDrive is designed to sit completely flush with the body of the MacBook, becoming a semi permanent part of your computer.\nWe made our first protoype by 3D printing our design out of plastic before building a smalll batch of working prototypes that we had indiviually precision machined out of aircraft grade aluminium\nPrototyping the MiniDrive\nWe also developed a simple way of removing the MiniDrive from the computer by hooking a paperclip through our specially designed eyelet at the front of the device.\nTHE PRODUCTS\nWe are proud to announce the launch of not one but two products; the MiniDrive and the MiniDrive Pro.\nThe MiniDrive and the MiniDrive Pro have been designed to fit securely into the SD slot of the MacBook computers.\nThe MiniDrive in the Macbook Air\nThe MiniDrive Pro in the Macbook Pro\nBy utilising standard micro SD cards the MiniDrive can add plug in and forget memory to your computer.\nThe MiniDrive & MicroSD Card\nThis gives you the extra space for the things that are most important to you - holiday snaps, music, movies and any documents you may need with you, wherever you go.\nTHE MINIDRIVE AS A BACK-UP SOLUTION\nOne of the cool things about Micro SD cards is that they are practically indestructible - in fact a major manufactuer of them claims their cards can survive under the sea for over 24 hours, withstand 1.6 tons of force, and are impervious to magnets and X-rays.\nTherefore, when combined with the Nifty MiniDrive, this makes them perfectly suited as a primary back-up disk.\nAs the Minidrives are designed to stay in your computer without getting in the way, a daily back-up  of your critical files may be set up and then happen automatically without having to remember to plug anything in.\nThen if you happen to spill coffee on your computer or drop it down the stairs, or some other disaster strikes you will not be forced to re-do days, weeks or even months worth of work, or even worse lose memories in the form of photos, or videos that may be irreplaceable.\nTECH SPECS - Micro SD cards\nAll MacBook Air and Pro computers from the mid 2010 refresh onwards have a Secure Digital Extended Copacity, or SD XC card reader in their SD card slot.\nThis format can support a Micro SD card of up to 2TB - roughly 2000GB in size. The largest capacity Micro SD card available to put in a MiniDrive today is 64GB which would already increase by 50% the capacity of an entry level 13\" MacBook air.\nOf course we are excited to see what the memory manufacturers will be doing in this highly active market in the near future.\nTECH SPECS - Nifty Minidrive\nFor us it is critical that the finish and quality of the drives match the computer for which they have been designed for.\nThis is particularly true for the aluminium front of the MiniDrive, as this must become as much like the computer it sits within in order to truly become part of it.\nTo achieve this we will be putting the aluminium of the MiniDrives through the same kind of rigorous anodising process that the Macbook Air and MacBook Pro go through themselves.\nBut of course, it is not just how good it looks that counts, but also how well it works, and to ensure reliability and longevity we have selected components that have been tested to be reliable for over 10,000 insertions and removals of a Micro SD card as well as coating our main connectors with immersion gold to enure the connection to your MacBook does not degrade over time.\nTHE MANUFACTURING PLAN\nThe money we raise on Kickstarter will help us pay for the tooling needed to commercially produce the MiniDrive, as well as the cost of materials themselves.\nAlmost all of our manufacture and assembly is done in the UK, using high quality local expertise in machining and manufacture. The exception to this is the circuit-boards which are printed and assembled in China by a UK based company, as the UK, sadly, does not seem to have facilities to print 0.4mm circuit board.\nManufacturing schedule:\n- End of Kickstarter campaign\n- Up to 20 days for funds to clear (yes 20!!)\n- Week 1: Order placed for the MiniDrive injection mould to be made\n- Week 1: Order placed for machined fronts for MiniDrive & MiniDrive Pro\n- Week 1: Order placed for PCB manufacture & assembly\n- Week 3-4: Machined fronts sent for finishing and anodising\n- Week 5-6: Finished machined fronts received and checked. \n- Week 5-6: Finished and assembled PCBs received and tested.\n- Week 4-6: Tooling for injection mould finished + first 50 sent to check for mould finalisation.\n- Week 6-8: Final injection moulded components delivered\n- Week 7-8: MiniDrives assembly and testing.\n- Week 9: MiniDrives dispatched.\n- Week 10: MiniDrives arrive\nBased on above - expect shipping at the end of October/start of November.\nWHERE WE ARE\nSo that's the MiniDrive, we have finished the design and made the prototypes, and we're just about to start production. But we need your help to get the MiniDrive into your computer.\nWe hope you'll join us, thank you!\nFollow The Nifty MiniDrive on Twitter! @NiftyMiniDrive\nFor high resolution images: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ncgtu5tyv2dmc44/h_VXQS3piU", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Lessons learnt, a big thank you and some information if you are thinking about starting out!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nSo, it has been a long journey to here. We have learnt so much in creating Nifty, and I hope that you, in following our progress, have also had a chance to see some of the difficulties and complexities inherent to creating a hardware startup.
