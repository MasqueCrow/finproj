This means I cannot accept pledges from certain countries as I'm required to charge VAT for them by law.  All purchases from the Etsy shop will receive the same freebies as those on Kickstarter so you won't miss out on anything! I'm sorry for the trouble.  \nThere are two things that have been a constant in my life: my love for wolves and the stars - and I like to think that I'm not the only one.\nIt's probably a bit strange to describe wolves and the vast unknown universe we live in as comforting but that's exactly what I'm going to do anyway. This pin set features wolves accompanied by words that have brought me great comfort in the past, helping me through some rough times.\nThese 4 'wise wolves' are also joined by their tiny chongus siblings who are just here to look cute and round. Because sometimes 'just cute' is needed. \nIn case you wonder why I'm only charging 200 GBP for this many pins - I will be investing some of my own money in this project so you won't have to worry about your favourite design not getting unlocked! \nThis campaign is pretty straightforward. Once the funding goal is hit all pins will be unlocked. At the moment I have no plans of making additional stretch goals but if we go well over the funding goal that may change!\nThe 'Wise Wolf' pins are all 8 GBP and the Tiny Chongus(es?) are 7 GBP.  If you buy 4 or more Wise Wolf pins you will receive 1 Tiny Chongus pin for free. \nOnce the campaign finishes you will be able to select which pin(s) you'd like to receive (that includes any freebies!) via a survey. \nIf you would like to get any additional pins check out the add-on section. You can see it when you pledge and after you pledge it will show up if you go to select 'edit your pledge'. If you have any trouble with add-ons please contact me and I will get in touch with you to get it sorted :)\nAll the pins will be hard enamel with gold plating but the sizes are different so please make certain to check those out.\n\nWise Wolf Pins\n I *said* no stretch goals, but with the overwhelming support on this project I decided to add one more pin after all.  As long as we keep the total above 2100 GBP this pin will be unlocked too!\nTiny Chongus\nPlease keep in mind that the pin colours may look slightly different on the final product than they appear on your screen. This is due to screen calibration, as well as the way enamel pantones are mixed. Additionally small changes may have to be made to the designs for production. \nIn a perfect world I would expect the timeline from the KS going live, to the pins arriving, to look like this:\nMay: KS goes live!\nEnd of May: KS finishes.\nJune: KS funds come in so production can start!\nJuly: Expected to see first pin samples.\nAugust: Pins should arrive with me and are quality checked.\nSeptember: Rewards are sent out.\nAs discussed in the Risks and Challenges there may be delays but I promise you to keep everyone in the loop if this arises.\nAll pledges of 3 or fewer pins will be sent out in jiffy bags. All pledges of 4 or more pins, and any including prints, will be shipped in small cardboard boxes. Suffice to say I will make certain all pins will be carefully packaged to protect them on their journey to you. I will notify everyone when shipping starts.\nPlease keep in mind that I'm located in the UK and that shipping to addresses outside of the UK can take up to 8 weeks to arrive due to ongoing pandemic.\nYour rewards will not be sent with track and trace by default.

Finally I would like to address that due to the worldwide effects from covid cargo space continues to be extremely limited. I do not expect this to improve before the end of the year. It is possible this may delay the shipment of the pins to me, but I would not expect this to be more than a couple of weeks of delay and I have already taken this extra time into account on the timeline.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Tiny Chongus", "descp": "1 x Tiny Chongus Enamel Pin\nINCLUDES:\nTiny Chongus Enamel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["10 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "One Howl", "descp": "1 x Wise Wolf Enamel Pin\nINCLUDES:\nWise Wolf Enamel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["59 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Two Howls", "descp": "2 x Wise Wolf Enamel Pin\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Wise Wolf Enamel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["32 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a323 or more", "title": "Three Howls", "descp": "3 x Wise Wolf Enamel Pin\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Wise Wolf Enamel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a331 or more", "title": "Four Howls (and one tiny yip)", "descp": "4 x Wise Wolf Enamel Pin\n1 x Tiny Chongus Pin\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 Wise Wolf Enamel Pin\nTiny Chongus Enamel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["37 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "Five Howls (and one tiny yip)", "descp": "5 x Wise Wolf Enamel Pin\n1 x Tiny Chongus Pin\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Wise Wolf Enamel Pin\nTiny Chongus Enamel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["19 backers", "Add-ons"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "We made it!

That means that you can slap a design on to their website and put it up for sale right away. No start up costs and no planning whatsoever. It also means you don't get to assure the quality of your product, nor your print. It means you have no idea who made your clothes nor the conditions in which they are manufactured. It means you are likely sending out products to customers with your design on it that are poor quality and badly made. It means you're limited to making whatever they are capable of printing on.\n\nAt Nomad Complex, we don't do that. We refuse it.\n\nEvery piece of clothing we put out passes through our hands from start to finish.

Living in the Pacific Northwest I'm always looking out at it admiring the mountains, tall trees and greenery of the land. Beauty can come in many forms, and with this I felt the desire to explore more materials and methods of creating unique collectible and enjoyable nature designs.  It's time to explore wood pins and washi tape.\n\nTaking on the task of creating pin designs that work well in wood - one that has proven to be a challenge beyond what I've done in enamel and metal pins so far - I'm excited to finally reveal this year's collection!\n\n\nWhy Wood?\nAs a renewable resource the idea of wood pins speaks to me from a place of environmental health and represents not only my love for nature but a greater appreciation of it. I wanted to create something that holds that bond to the wood element, but still has the magic of dragons. \n\nWashi Tape\nWashi is a type of versatile decorative tape made from natural fibers like hemp and bamboo, is biodegradable, can be written on and is easily torn by hand.  It doesn't leave behind a sticky residue so it can be used to decorate pretty much anything! It's the perfect combination of a usable eco-friendly item and artwork in one.\nEach washi tape design was painted in watercolor and Inspired by scenes and plants of the Pacific Northwest. It includes Creeping Dogwood, Fir Tree branches, River Rocks and Fern, and Mountain Forest. Scroll down for images of these.\n\nAll other stretch goals have been hit! To give us a final push to the finish,  a holographic sticker of \"Crescent\" will be added free to every pledge if we can reach $10k. Time to share widely so we can reach this freebie! We're already so close :)\n\n\n\nThe Limited Edition Pin - Gold Leaf \nActual Photo\nI had a concept of wood and gold that I couldn't get out of my head for many months. In January I started researching how to do it, and through many multiple (and many failed) trials, tests and prototypes I finally was able to achieve my vision! \nThis year I'm taking a very hands-on approach to creating the Limited Edition pins. Because of the nature of the wood and gold leaf, each pin has several steps needed to achieve the final look - gold leaf applied to the moon and then a layer of clear lacquer to seal it in and intensify the grain of the cherry wood with shine.\nActual Photo\n Because the process of applying the gold leaf and seal is lengthy, the pins this year will be limited to only 50, and will be priced at a level that reflects the amount of hands-on work needed to make them. Please note that because of the nature of the materials and that they're hand embellished, there *will* be small imperfections. This also means that each and every LE pin will also be slightly different and unique!\n\nAbout the Limited Edition Pin - \"Luna\"\nExtra large 2.5 inches from nose to tail (vertical) and 2.25 inches wide\n3 pin posts with butterfly clasps\nMade in the USA of cherry wood\nHand-applied gold leaf and lacquer finish\nComes with signed and numbered backing card, given in order of pledge - the earlier the pledge the lower the LE number\nLimited to only 50!\n\n** If you wish to receive a Limited Edition pin AND  any open edition pin, you must pledge to the Limited Edition tier (since they are limited), then use the add-on section to add extra pins or washi. See the bottom of the page for more details. Remember you can edit your pledge at any time while the campaign is running.\n\n\n The open edition wood pins \nActual Photo\n This year I'm offering a set of large wood pins with a few enamel pins in addition to unlock. The wood pins are bigger than the enamel pins which give them more impact and show greater detail. All wood pins have been physically proofed to make sure everything is just right. Each wood pin will have 3 pin posts and come with butterfly clasps. Because each piece of wood is unique, there will be slight differences in grain and color between pins.\n\nAll pins will have their own matching backing cards that perfectly compliment their design. You may also opt out of backing cards during the survey if going green is your style.\n\nA NOTE ABOUT SIZES: All colored enamel pin designs offered are created within a 2x2 inch square, (except Happy Lucky Dragon is 1.25 inches) while the wood pins are created based on the longest side being 2.5 inches. Because of the manufacturing process, some pins may feel heftier or larger than others due to how wide or narrow the design is, and the wood pins are naturally lighter than the enamel and metal  designs.\n\nThe Happy Lucky Dragon pin is a bit smaller than the usual 2 inch pins, but I felt this size difference would be important to create something even a more casual pin wearer and dragon lover could wear every day! The Rose Gold plating is the first to be released with three more colors to unlock.\n\n*The Distill dragons with rainbow metal are soft enamel with clear epoxy added to give the appearance and feel of hard enamel pins. \n\n\n\nTo start, there are only three reward tiers to keep things simple! You will be able to add any unlocked open edition pin or washi tape set to any of the tiers. You can edit your pledge at any time while the Kickstarter is running by coming back to this page,  and you will not be charged for anything until the campaign ends on May 8th. During the 'checkout' part of your pledge you will see the option to add as many pins as you like at the special $13 price - specific designs will be chosen during the survey once the Kickstarter campaign is over.\n JUST ADDED: A pre-built tier for the full set of open edition wood pins! You can still add extra pins and washi to this tier.\nWashi tapes are 15 mm wide and come in rolls of 10 meters long. Individual rolls will be available for $4 each, so the set will get you a discount for all four. Additional sets are $15.\n\n\n HOW TO ADD PINS OR WASHI TO YOUR PLEDGE \n1. Select a reward tier and your shipping country and press Continue.\n2. In the next step you'll see the tier you chose plus a list of add-ons you can select! \nYou will also be able to add more pins, single washi rolls and any surprise items in the survey after the campaign is over via Backerkit - there's no way to miss out on getting the pin(s) you want, so don't worry! The survey is how you will choose which open edition pin design(s) you want. You may choose from any of the unlocked open edition designs pictured in this campaign and from past campaigns, see the full list below.\n\nAs a 2021 Kickstarter special to help kick off the wood pins, the first pin of any style is $15 and all additional pins are only $13! You can add pins to the washi tier as well, and the washi will count as your first \"pin\" of $15. \n\n***NOTE: Limited Edition pins are not available for add-ons, so if you wish to get a Limited Edition pin AND any other pin(s), you must pledge to the Limited Edition tier and then use the add-ons section during checkout for extra pins.\n\nAdd-ons cannot be added onto the \"Pledge Without Reward\" tier because it does not collect an address or shipping.\n\nNo extra shipping charges no matter how many pins you add! Shipping is a flat $5 for US and $15 for international.\n*Shipping countries include: USA, Canada, Germany, Austria, Australia and Norway.\n\n\n\nSHIPPING FOR INTERNATIONAL BACKERS\n*Due to extreme fluctuations in shipping rates and the added complexities of VAT, this Kickstarter will only be shipping to select countries.  I deeply apologize for this inconvenience and will be setting up a temporary shop on Etsy later this year for shipping to the UK. All open edition pins will be available for world wide shipping on the main website later in 2021 as well.\nI am not responsible for any customs, duties, taxes or other fees that may be added to the package as these are set by the countries they are shipped to. These fees are the responsibility of the recipient. Items returned to me due to being unclaimed at customs will not be reshipped without additional shipping charges. Please expect extended shipping times to countries outside of the USA.\n\nTimeline\nMay 8th - Kickstarter Ends at 8 pm Pacific Time\nMay 12 - Surveys go out via Backerkit\nMay 24-27  - Should receive Kickstarter funds by this time\nMay  - Order pins as soon as funds received and at least 80% of backers have responded to surveys so I know how many of each pin to order.\nPins should arrive around 4 weeks after ordered.

This year I will be using a different manufacturer than last year due to the extremely high level of defects in the pins. I have already seen pins from this new manufacturer so I am confident that there will be few issues.\nThere is always the possibility of slow downs on the manufacturers side of things, or hiccups with shipping. Any and all updates will be shared so you know exactly what's going on.

We got you.\nLeyendecker but lesbians? We've got that too.\nSuccessfully funded in only two hours, and stretch goals all reached in five hours!\nKickstarter marked us a project they love and we've been featured in the Mary Sue and Fangirlish!\nMock-up of the front and back cover of the book\nOur hard cover art book will be in full color, filled to the brim with beautiful reimagined works of art from Ancient Greece to 20th century Rockwell. \nA mock-up of the book's interior, featuring Aadorah's finished piece and Blackdistraction's WIP\nThe cover has been beautifully painted by Shouty (Shouty_y), reimagining Fragonard's The Swing as a new stunning piece! We've gathered over 60 artists from around the world and each is creating a new piece of art for us.\nOur wonderful artists!\nOur campaign graphic design was created by our very own Floh (FlohGna) who is also illustrating a piece for the book. Thank you Floh!\nThis is our second project - we successfully ran Lady Tarot Cards last year (2020), reaching all of our stretch goals and more with nearly $40,000 raised. Quite a few artists from the cards have come over to work on this book too and we're thrilled to have them back.\n(Small note: we are out of the tarot cards - we ended up selling them all! We are not planning a reprint at this time as it would take over 500 orders to consider it which is basically an additional KS campaign!)\nSome of our tarot cards!\nOur tarot cards with their foiled sides and their tuck box\nOur Book\nMock-up showing the book's cover\nOur book will be 8.5x11 inches and have a soft matte touch hardcover and filled with over 60 different works of art from over 60 artists! This is an ongoing project with art still being created - some designs may change but the overall feel will of course be the same.\nAll orders of the book will now include 1 holographic print from cleocatart - their piece is based on Leighton's The Fisherman and the Syren.\nMock-up of the interior, showing Vicky's WIP and Pien's finished piece\nThe Merch\nOur merch pack and the shiny bits!\nEach merch pack will have:\n 1 sticker designed by karlovycross (design coming soon based on Le Flirt a La Rose by LeClerc) (this might end up being a glitter or holographic sticker too!!!!)\n 1 metal bookmark designed by mayticks featuring Hades and Persephone, Theseus and a Fury, and Orpheus and Eurydice!\n 3 holographic art print 6x9 inches of fidisart's piece based on Mucha's Flirt and two more yet to be determined!\n 3 random postcards from a selection of art from the book\n Your choice of 1 of 3 acrylic charms designed by rosefinchie and renstrapp! Rose  designed two charms: one with cave hand paintings and one with Artemisia Gentileschi. The cave painting design is being workshopped into possibly being glow in the dark, and Artemisia is a clear charm!

This tier includes the books and merch PLUS a limited edition linograph print from Mayticks of her version of Klimt's The Kiss (A3 size - 29.7 x 42 cm, 11.75 x 16.5 in). We have 25 prints available!\nArt book (digital and physical), Merch, and 1 print - $150 (plus shipping)\nMayticks' lino prints!\nWe will be using BackerKit for this project and you'll get emails from them later on about shipping addresses. You'll also get a chance to add-on any additional items and a few leftover merch choices from Lady Tarot Cards. Finally, you'll be able to pre-order more copies and merch through there before we launch our online store - when the store launches, the prices will no longer have the discounted KS prices you find here!\nReminder: Kickstarter doesn't charge you unless/until we get funded - that means your card won't be charged until May! You can adjust your pledge or cancel it until May 5. We of course hope you won't cancel a pledge, but understand that things are very tough right now.\nThis book will not be reprinted - this is a one run deal and we'll order enough to cover the KS orders, our pre-orders in the store, and enough to stock the store for a while. After we run out, that'll be it!\nOur Stretch Goals\nGraphic showing our unlocked stretch goals!\nALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED ON DAY ONE!!!\nAt $35,000, all the books will have a soft touch matte hardcover!\nAt $40,000, all merch packs will include your choice of 3 acrylic charms, designed by rosefinchie and renstrapp!\nRenstrapp is creating a keychain design with Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace as girlfriends, and rosefinchie designed two charms: one with cave hand paintings and one with Artemisia Gentileschi. The cave painting design is being workshopped into possibly being glow in the dark!\nAt $45,000, all merch packs will include an embroidered patch designed by Mayticks! Her patch features Hades and Persephone...and some innocuous pomegranates.\nAt $50,000, all merch packs will include 3 holographic prints (1 from fidisarts and 2 others), and all physical orders will include 1 holographic print from cleocatart - their piece is based on Leighton's The Fisherman and the Syren.\nNEW STRETCH GOAL!\nThis campaign has surpassed all of our hopes and is firmly in the WOW category! We're announcing a new stretch goal for $150k - a solid 3D metal keychain featuring Mayticks' Hades and Persephone design!! This would be included with every merch pack, and available for purchase as an add-on after the campaign in the Backerkit survey. Let's get to work sharing this around so we can get these bad bois unlocked!\nMayticks' design for the keychain\nMayticks' keychain!\nThe Timeline and Funding\nOur timeline is of course dependent on a lot of things, including but not limited to: artists finishing their work, products being made in a timely manner, shipping to us with minimal delays, packing and shipping everything (it's just the two of us so it might take a few extra days!), and then shipping out to you!\nIdeally, our timeline is as follows:\nApril - May - Kickstarter campaign runs and the funds get sent to us in May\nMay - June - Artists complete their pieces\nJuly - August - We compile everything and get things sent to production. Some of the merch is already ready to go - the biggest work will be for us to format the book for print to ensure the highest quality images.\nSeptember - November - A nice big window for us to receive and send out the goodies, ideally BEFORE the holiday postal rush.\nWe will be keeping everyone up to date with updates as we go through the process, especially when we receive products in the mail! This is going to have some really amazing things created and we can't wait to be able to show you.\nOur funding process covers the products, shipping, and all the taxes/fees, and everything else is used to pay our artists and mods!\nWe've been through this rodeo before so we know some backers forget or miss the backer survey when we ask for your address. It is your responsibility to make sure your email is correct so we can send you important updates and messages! We will hold your pledge goodies for six months after we send out the last call message, and we will try our absolute best to get in contact with you - we don't want anyone to miss out. After that six months, we will no longer hold your goodies and cannot offer a refund - we have a very small apartment and we need the space!\nShipping\nWe will ship anywhere in the world in sturdy cardboard mailers. We are not responsible for lost or damaged packages, and many will take a long time to get to you especially for our international friends. We are also experiencing a much higher volume of orders than we expected so even with the help of a few friends, our packing/sending process will take a little longer - please be patient with us :)\nWe CAN ship to the UK, even with the new VAT rules, thanks to the project being a book! Shipping is expensive right now with many countries/postal carriers adding extra surcharges to their rates - please be aware of that when you click through to the shipping options. Most packages are $15/30 for domestic (USA) and international packages.\nWe are not responsible for any additional customs/duties on packages. We will be declaring them as printed matter/books/postcards/bookmarks/etc as appropriate and we of course hope there won't be any issues - the labels will not include any indication of LGBT content.\nOur digital book can be emailed easily to anywhere anytime! (after, of course, it's made and ready to send out this fall!)\nAbout us!\nNova and Mali have been married for a few years now and spend most of their free time working with their endless cycle of rescue foster kittens! They ran a successful project during 2020 to create nearly 800 decks of tarot cards and sent them all over the world.\nPhoto of Mali and Nova from their wedding photos", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk, assuming we get funded, is timing. Our timeline is a best guess - things can go awry with quality control and shipping to us, causing delays.

The pins are set around 5x5cm (2x2 inches) but the size may vary accordingly to each design.   \n The pins will be hard enamel pins. Hard enamel pins are smooth and shiny, more durable, and have no raised edges. \n * Every pin will be mounted on a custom backing card. All the pins are concept mock-ups. The final design may vary.\nThere will be several stretch goals once we surpass the funding goal.

See further below in the Kickstarter for the white/pastel pin variants.  All pins are hard enamel, approximately 2 inches (6cm), and will have 2 posts with rubber backings.\n1. Star Carrier Crow\nThis is an exciting new type of pin for me! It's large, over 2 inches tall (6cm) with a chain and attached star which will dangle below. \nStar Carrier Crow\n 2. Deer Skull Raven\nThis pin will feature several cut-out areas between the raven and antlers. The pastel variant will have a glow in the dark blue skull and antlers!\nDeer Skull Raven\n3.

Moon Cutout Crow\nThese pins feature a crescent moon shaped cutout. \nMoon Crows in both color variants\nMinipin Sets\nThese pins will be manufactured in hard enamel with gold metal for black pins and rose gold for white pins at approximately 3/4in (2cm). All will each have 1 post, since they are tiny, with a rubber backing. See below for both sets in the original black/gold variants. Pictures of the pastel variants can be seen further down the page. \nTo make packaging less complex, mini-pin sets of 3 will be kept together without substitutions. The four options are Set 1 (crow head/sitting flying) in black or white as well as Set 2 (skull, feather, foot) in black or white. If you want a specific design not in the set, it will need to be added on separately.\nMini-pin Set 1\nMini-pin Set 2\n Knife birds are also available as single Mini-pins!\nKnifebirds!\nEvery single pin available!\n Backing Cards for Pins & examples\nBacking cards make for a nice display.

They will also be available to add on. \n\"Micro\" pins :)\nShipping\nYou'll see that shipping prices are added on when you choose your backer tier. The prices are based on USPS rates with tracking plus the minor cost of packing materials. \nOrders of pins only will ship in bubble mailers, bags and keychains will ship in poly bags. \nUnfortunately, international shipping is quite expensive for parcels with tracking- I recommend going in together with someone local to you to save on shipping if you are outside of the US.\n\nTimeline\nMarch: Project launches and runs for 30 days\nLate April: Project finishes, funds are collected, and surveys are sent out to all backers\nMay-June: Surveys are completed and manufacturing of all items is initiated\nJuly-August: Items are received by me, quality checked, and packaged for shipping \nAugust-September: Backer rewards are sent out in waves! Please be aware that while I will ship these out ASAP, shipping times may still be affected by COVID.  \nSome notes:\nDesigns: It's possible that there will need to be slight adjustments to the enamel pin designs due to manufacturing limitations, but I don't foresee this being an issue as the pins have been designed with this in mind.\nColors: Colors may appear slightly different on your monitor from the colors of the actual products. Shouldn't be too much trouble considering most things are black and white though! \nRefund policy: Once the campaign has ended, refunds cannot be given out. Please only back this campaign if you certain you are like the product and you are aware of the timeline and potential shipping time to your location from the US. \nThank you so much for reading, and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do!\nBag & plush!\nthat's me :)\nUpdated Tier Info\nKickstarter does not allow edits to tier information once so I'm adding info here to clarify now that the stretch goals have been reached!

Reaching. Reaching $125K would allow Jenn to begin pre-production on a new standalone short film that will be used as pitch for a feature film. All funds raised after the next stretch goal will go towards production of the next film project, contingent on the final production needs of Death's Diner (edited 4/11/2021).  \n\"The Vagabond and the Sea of Stars\" (work in progress title) is a mystical short film about otherworldly bonds, and going to the ends of the earth to find one missed connection.\nDeath's Diner \nDeath\u2019s Diner follows two patrons who stumble into a diner, one foggy night, and find that their lives have come to an end. It\u2019s through their conversations with one another and their charismatic waiter that the truth is unravelled.\nDeath's Diner was filmed in 3 days at the iconic Twede's Diner, the same location as the Double R Diner in Twin peaks. The story was written and created by Son M. The short film was co-produced and directed by Jenn Ravenna Tran. Jenn is also the cinematographer. Death's Diner will be a 10 minute short film.   \nIt all started with a story thread Son M. had written on Twitter that follows patrons in a diner who have brief conversations about their lives with Death. It was written during a difficult time in their life, past-midnight, and was thought to just be a personal outlet for their feelings. It resonated with a lot of folks, and soon it spread, eventually landing on the timeline of Jenn.

A multitude of factions in the city seek to purchase, discover, commission, and otherwise acquire a vast collection of items to be used, investigated, or traded.\nA Catalogue Chimerical is a zine of one-hundred-and-forty-four items described and illustrated by an Aydinlar Cataloguer, a specialist in analyzing and describing these fantastic objects for later use. The zine is framed as a magical mail-order catalogue. Members of their University back home acquire items by spending votive ink, the currency of the Aydinlar Suzerainty.  \nEvery backer of this campaign will also get a digital copy of Lost and Found, a d36 zine of Pentolan magical items! \nWhat's inside the zine?\nEach of the thirty-six pages in this zine includes four items and at least one sketch of the items on that page. There will also be an art-free version with half the page count, ideal for printing at home.\nAt the base level of funding, the art edition of the zine will have one illustration for each page, meaning one quarter of the items are given custom illustrations. At higher levels of funding, additional sketches will be added until all the items are illustrated.\nHere are a few examples of the writing for such items:\nThimble of Bloodsweat Endeavors - Example Item\nThis small porcelain thimble is chased in scarlet and has a crimson silk slip cover. The markings on the thimble itself are minute and depict a cheerful but strained proprietor hawking various wares from a cart.\nIf the bearer spills enough of their own blood into the thimble to fill it, they are unable to use any magic for the day, though they find all mundane ventures one step easier. Each time the thimble is used, it seems to grow in size.\nFrostgiver Pendant - Example Item\nThis lapis lazuli pendant is miraculously strung not with wire but with thin ironoak, mysteriously supple whilst held. The engraving on the pendant shows a woman offering her cloak while snow falls thick.\nAnyone whom the wearer lends clothing to finds that they are utterly immune to the cold. Until the item is returned, the pendant wearer frosts everything they touch, though their extremeties slowly become frostbitten over the next several days unless the item is returned or they give away something else.\nMoonberry Ring - Example Item\nThis thick ring is made of smoothly polished granite and topped with an ironoak relief of the watchful moon at its zenith over a berry bush. It smells of crushed raspberries.\nThe bearer of this ring is compelled to kiss it and to seek out fruits to satisfy their newfound sweet tooth; every day that circumstances keep them from eating such fruit they become bitterly selfish. All tastes become extraordinarily more potent, their tongue an order of magnitude more sensitive.\nMarblewound Khopesh - Example Item\nThis olive-handled khopesh has a Pentolan marble blade, pale green veined with gray. The hilt is polished smooth and inlaid with tiny discs of gold which hum softly unless in moonlight.\nWhen the curved blade inflicts a wound it calcifies the damaged flesh, leaving an obvious marble scar and preventing most forms of mundane healing without further surgery.\nFlamekeeper Vambraces - Example Item\nThese puce drakeleather vambraces are tooled meticulously in the image of roiling flames, the heart of each of them embossed with bronze.\nWhen worn, anything held in either hand shrinks to half its normal size in a flash of scorching light, returning to normal size when let go, but glowing-hot.\nLet's talk about the Art for this Zine.\nThe Catalogue is not just a collection of written items, however. It's also going to feature at least one illustration for every four items (36 in total!) - and, if we unlock enough stretch goals, expand all the way to ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR illustrations, one for every last item in the Catalogue.\nThe art will be in the form of sketches by the Cataloguer themself (Aaron Radney being the artist on Earth pulling this off), meant to be quick illustrations of the item for the readers of the Catalogue to get a visual for. Each will be roughly A9 (1.5\" x 2\") in size.\nAaron has an extremely well developed sketch style that was much of the inspiration for this project - when we conceived of a catalogue of magical items, it was obvious there was only one choice for who to illustrate it.\nHere are a couple examples of Aaron's work in the sketch style that will be in the zine:\nAlt Text: An image sketched in brown pencil on white paper of a thin, relatively androgynous figure with kinky hair sweeping back from their head, again with distinctly African features and seen from the waist up. They wear a cloak that sweeps forward sa if blone in the wind. They carry two scimitars, one in each hand and are leanly muscular wearing a wrap of some sort across their chest, loose pants and a cloth wrap around their waist with their midriff bare.\nAlt Text: A picture of a male elf, seen from the shoulders up and sketched with brown and white pencil on tan toned paper. He's looking out of the corner of his eyes. He has African features, a close cropped afro and high cheekbones. The ears are long, pointed and adorned with rings. The image is lightly crosshatched for its shading.\nNotes on Accessibility\nBoth versions of the zine will fully meet the PDF/UA Standard, ensuring that they are as accessible as we can make them. We'll also publish an epub version of the item text for easier/more accessible reading on tablets and e-readers.\nWe will also be producing a WCAG 2.0 Accessible website for the magical items (no art included) which will include all of the items from the zine as well as bonus items - this site will have full text search, collection pages for both bonus items and Catalogue items, and random-item selector. \nYou can find a preview of that website at catalogue-chimerical.netlify.app - we'll be updating it as writing and editing is complete, putting it out as soon as they are completed so you don't need to wait on the PDFs/epub. You can actually view the bonus items right now!\nBacker Tiers - what they cost and what you get for them\n$1 - Curious Onlooker Tier\nThis tier primarily provides support to the team - every single penny and pledge helps this project be successful. You'll get a digital copy of Lost & Found, a print-at-home zine with 36 magical items in it and have access to the community copies, physical and digital alike, before anyone outside of Kickstarter gets access.\n$7 - Home Scrivener Tier\nIn addition to prior rewards, this tier gets you a copy of the artless PDF version of Catalogue Chimerical, enabling you to print a copy at home without using all of your ink.\n$12 - Chronicler Tier\nIn addition to prior rewards, this tier gets you a copy of the illustrated PDF edition of Catalogue Chimerical so you can revel in the beautiful art. You also make a digital community copy of both editions of the Catalogue available!\n$24 - Archivist Tier\nIn addition to the rewards from prior tiers, at this level you get a physical copy of the illustrated PDF edition of A Catalogue Chimerical. Every 5 pledges at this level makes a physical community copy of the zine available for other folks! \n$48 - Neighborhood Advocate Tier\nIn addition to the rewards from the Archivist tier, at this level you fund six digital community copies instead of one and every backer at this tier funds two physical community copies as well! This tier exists for those folks who have the funds and share the belief with our team that art should be made as widely available as possible.\n$72 - Artisan Tier\nIn addition to the rewards from the Archivist tier, at this level you also get an hour consultation with Michael on an artisan NPC - he will then go on to create a print-at-home PDF for you that includes the NPC and six items made by them, just for you! Every backer at this tier also secures both a physical and digital community copy of the Catalogue.\n$144 - Dozenal Dealer Tier\nThis tier is primarily intended for retailers; it includes a dozen copies of the print edition of A Catalogue Chimerical and funds 12 digital and 4 physical community copies as well!\nWho's on the team for A Catalogue Chimerical?\nThe writing for this project is by Michael T. Lombardi, the illustrations are by Aaron Radney, editing is by Samuel Mui Shen Ern, layout is by Dai Shugars, worldbuilding consultancy for the Aydinlar Suzerainty is by Bee Scerri, and character consultancy, sensitivity consultancy, and voice acting is by Persephone. Finally, if the audio format is unlocked, Adil Leghari will join the team as our audio engineer.\nAaron Radney - Illustrator\n Aaron Radney is a fantasy illustrator who loves stories, world building and how the two intersect within the field of illustration. He grew up on a steady diet of fantasy books and shows as well as a healthy dose of mythology and dragons provided by his mother\u2019s substantial book collection. He studied at Memphis College of Art in Memphis, Tennessee and is focused both on helping clients bring their ideas to life and illuminating the power of diverse heroes through drawing heavily from non-Eurocentric inspirations. \nHe\u2019s currently based out of St. Louis Missouri living there happy with his partner and tolerating her needy tuxedo cat. In his spare time he plays fantasy card and tabletop games as well as writes to feed the world building addiction and cooks to feed his belly.\nMichael T Lombardi - Writer\nMichael T. Lombardi is a kitbash enthusiast game designer and developer based in in the St. Louis region of the United States. He is interested in exploring procedural generation, gameable lore, and alternative models and modes of development. He splits his free time between game and open source development (currently working on Platen, digital tooling to make hosting accessible and interactive editions of digital games easier and cheaper).\nSamuel Mui Shen Ern - Editor\nSamuel Mui Shen Ernis a game designer, writer, editor, musician, and visual artist from Malaysia. Their works explore real-world topics like death, relationships, and emotional brokenness with an unwaveringly brutal honesty and a sense of fun(?)! When she\u2019s not working on hir next big thing, he\u2019s probably zoning out to k-pop, experimenting in the kitchen, or reading autobiographical comics.\nDai Shugars - Layout Artist\nDai Shugarsis a graphic designer and publisher out of Orlando, Florida known for such books as Libret\u00e9, The Demon Collective, Lorn Song, and Mystic Punks. He's also written several articles on PDF accessibility and how RPGs could stand to better utilize the medium.\nBen \"Bee\" Scerri - Worldbuilding\nBen \"Bee\" Scerri is a non-binary bisexual Maltese Australian tabletop- and video game producer, writer, designer, and community builder, living in Melbourne, Australia. Their work focuses on themes of diaspora, disability/critical illness, self-actualisation, and found family, often through the lenses of their ethnic and queer intersections. When not writing for or about games, they're likely talking about language, cooking, baking, folklore, and/or fashion.\nPersephone - Consulting & Acting\nPersephone is a writer, content creator, model and sensitivity consultant working in multiple fields. She is also an active Twitch streamer, working to build a platform that promotes inclusion and acceptance.\nShe is also the DM of her own actual play podcast, Fast Times at D&D High, and the creator of the upcoming 5th edition parody game, Critical Love. You can find her @Persephiroth on Twitter, Twitch, TikTok, and more. \nAdil Leghari - Audio Engineer\nAdil Leghari enjoys creative pursuits, playing with audio, video, and images. When not working on DevOps and Automation, he enjoys long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners, and designing stickers.\nWhat are the stretch goals for A Catalogue Chimerical?\n$8550 - Expanded Illustrations Stretch Goal\nAt this level, the zine will include an additional 36 (total of 72) custom illustrations by Aaron Radney, covering half of the items in the zine. \n$10,500 - Expanded Illustrations II Stretch Goal\nAt this level, the zine will include an additional 36 (total of 108) custom illustrations by Aaron Radney, meaning 75% of the items get an illustration.\n$12000 - FULLY ILLUSTRATED Stretch Goal\nAt this level, the zine will include an additional 36 custom illustrations by Aaron Radney, meaning every single item in the zine will have an accompanying illustration!\n$18000 - Audio Format & Diaries Stretch Goal\nAt this level, we will pay Persephone to read each of the entries in A Catalogue Chimerical as the Cataloguer; in-world, the document itself can carry both written word and the diction of the Cataloguer. This means that the very act of reading the Catalogue puts the voice of the Cataloguer into your head, so you hear their diction and cadence and don't have to rely on the written word alone to grasp intent and nuance.\nWe'll also write 12 short diary entries from the perspective of the Cataloguer, making their written form available on the website.\nAdil Leghari will be editing the audio for both the diary and item entries. After the kickstarter campaign wraps (and the work is done), this audio-format for both the items and the diary will be made available separately on bandcamp! Backers at any level will have access to the digital audio if we unlock this stretch goal!\nWhere is the budget for A Catalogue Chimerical going?\nThe breakdown of funding for this project includes:\nWriting and Editing ($1,440) \n36 item sketches ($900)\nLayout for 54 pages [36 with art, 18 for the condensed artless version] ($840)\nWorldbuilding consultancy ($1200)\nCharacter & Sensitivity consultancy ($1800) \nA pie chart showing the budgetary breakdown for the base goal\nOn top of these expense items, we are including a 25% overhead/emergency fund, which includes Kickstarter's own cut. That accounts for the $7,725 initial budget.\nAdditional funds beyond the budget and stretch goals will be split between the team members with the writing and publishing portion of the revenue split going into the general fund for the Gondolieri Cooperative.\nWhat is the Gondolieri Cooperative?\nThis project is being organized under the Gondolieri Cooperative, a new creator-owned organization under which this and all future Pentola projects are being worked. We seek to change the industry by proving out a new model which remunerates everyone involved equitably for their labor, funds the creation of art and games, and reinvests in the community both directly (supporting projects and creators, buying equipment and software, etc) and indirectly (helping keep creators housed/fed through hard times, seeding funds for creative endeavors, establishing re-usable contracts and templates). Our members are international as is the scope of our impact.\nAt this time, the Gondolieri Cooperative consists of three members: Pam Punzalan, Viditya Voleti, and Michael T. Lombardi.\nHow is digital fulfillment for A Catalogue Chimerical being handled?\nAfter successful funding and completion of this project, backers of the project will receive access to printable PDFs of the artless and full version of the zine, as well as the epub editon, via LeanPub, where future sales of the digital copies will be available.\nAdditionally, access to the writing only will be available for free on catalogue-chimerical.netlify.app. That site will be updated as the project writing is completed, meaning you won't need to wait for the final shippable product to start using these items in your games.\nHow is physical fulfillment for A Catalogue Chimerical being handled, and by whom?\nPhysical fulfillment will be handled by Spear Witch in the USA, Monkey's Paw Games in Canada, and Glaucus in Australia.\nBackers at a physical level will be given an at-cost coupon for the physical copy in these stores and have shipping calculated at the time that they use the coupon, meaning backers will pay for shipping via these storefronts.\nThis should be overall safer and cheaper for everyone, especially international folks, who won't have to absorb the international shipping costs from the USA we would otherwise have to charge.\nTo be abundantly clear: YOUR BACKER PLEDGE DOES NOT COVER SHIPPING. YOU WILL NEED TO PAY FOR THAT LATER VIA THE FULLFILLER STOREFRONT OF YOUR CHOICE.\nWhat are community copies and who is getting them?\nCommunity copies are copies of the zine which are earmarked specifically for folks who for any reason cannot afford to purchase a copy for themselves, no questions asked. We will not be means-testing submissions for community copies nor will we be checking to see if you \"need\" one - if you think it's for you, it is. If you don't, it probably is anyway! We do not and will not vet the claims for these copies.

The Deep South breeds its black boys hard, then there\u2019s JAY. He sticks out for all the wrong reasons. He\u2019s dark-skinned, quiet and skinny; and likes to wear flowers in his hair.\nThe opposite of his masculine and charismatic older brother, JACOB. Their differences peak at the community pool where swaggering manhood is on full display. Jay is reserved as he struggles to embody his brother\u2019s carefree confidence.\nUntil he gets help from JUSTIN, a charming, light-skinned boy from the neighborhood. Their new friendship is tested, however, when an unspoken truth dares to surface.\n\n\nTerrance Daye, photographed by Alexy Kim\nMy name is Terrance Daye, the director of Pritty: The Animation. In 2019 I completed -Ship: A Visual Poem, an award-winning short film that significantly impacted my film career. For all of its success, however, I felt dissatisfied with filmmaking. Every day, the world seemed to grow more hateful and unjust. I asked myself, \u201cWhat is the point of art-making if we\u2019re all saying the same things and nothing is changing?\u201d\nThen I remembered a 300-page unpublished manuscript by the name of Pritty that was shared with me by a close friend and soon-to-be collaborator: Keith F. Miller, Jr. I remember being floored by the audacity of Keith\u2019s words. His complex depiction of black men coming of age was the very hope I now needed.\nThere are too few stories that simply feature black boys at play, discovering their full humanity and vulnerability\u2014and learning to heal because of it. I longed for my own work to engage more intentionally in this practice. I changed my perspective on filmmaking and committed to bringing a new question to the big screen: \u201cWhat would it mean to visualize the softer, more intimate sides of black men without fear of consequence?\u201d\nWith renewed vision and a devoted team by my side, I set about bringing Pritty to life. Visualizing this world and now getting to animate it has given me permission to hope again. It has been one of the highlights of my year and has taught me that filmmaking is just another form of dreaming. The world may be chaotic now. But it won\u2019t always be. Black lives may exist on the cusp of constant peril now. But somewhere there must be joy and laughter. The media can\u2019t imagine this for us. But we can imagine it for ourselves. Can\u2019t we?\n\n\n\nWe originally planned to make Pritty as a live-action short film, but when our shoot got canceled due to COVID-19 we weren\u2019t ready to give up. Through animation, we found a new way to bring Pritty to life!\nAnimation is a medium that is full of imagination and dreaming, and with Pritty, we are actively allowing ourselves to imagine what it looks like for black and brown boys to be free. Choosing to make animation our new medium felt like a natural fit to capture these dreams, hopes, and imaginations for our future world.\nWe turned to Japanese animation director, Hayao Miyazaki, to inspire the lush landscapes and naturalism that we wanted to exude through Pritty. His work became one of our largest sources of inspiration. But for all its beauty, we never saw ourselves represented in his worlds. Bring Hayao Miyazaki To The Hood became our new motto. Our hoods, our communities, our spaces with their subtleties and nuances are worthy of occupying the center. This animation is a reminder of that.\nOur animation direction includes lush, romantic landscapes, textured ambient sounds, and distinctly black character designs that create a sense of immersive realism through traditional 2D Animation - an immersive Black reality that we rarely see depicted in animation.\nWe are partnering with Powerhouse Animation Studios in TX for our animation production. Powerhouse Animation Studios is a full-service creative agency that we are very excited to have bring our rough animatic to life and later, with your help, our full animated short! \n\nCharacter Designs from Pritty: The Animation\n\n\n Writer/Director - Terrance Daye \nTerrance Daye - Photographed by Alexey Kim & Illustration by Jarren Simmons\nTerrance Daye is an award-winning poet and filmmaker from Long Island, New York. His creative work reimagines traditional representations of black masculinity and male identity and invests strongly in destigmatizing mental illness within the black community.

He also serves as the Executive Producer for the short film, Pritty, based on his unpublished manuscript by the same name.\n\n Producer - Jeremy Truong \nJeremy Truong - Photographed by Alexey Kim & Illustration by Jarren Simmons\nJeremy Truong is a San Francisco transplant working as an LGBT film producer in New York. Attracted to films with socially impactful themes, Jeremy hopes to move the needle on timely and urgent issues by exploring them in subversive ways on screen.

As a producer, she is dedicated to uplifting underrepresented narratives about people of color, womxn, and LGBTQ communities. Natalie received her BFA from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in May 2020, where she graduated with Honors and received her department's award for Excellence in Community Service. Passionate about the intersections between filmmaking and social justice, Natalie worked for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Presidential Campaign in 2019 as a Video Intern and recently created a short documentary in collaboration with TIME Magazine and the Biden/Harris campaign. Over the years, she has produced films that have received recognition from The Directors Guild of America, Sundance Ignite, Outfest, Vimeo Staff Pick, Short of the Week, The British Film Institute, and The National Film Festival for Talented Youth (NFFTY).\n\n\nIn pivoting from a live-action short film to animation, we realized that our budget would increase exponentially. However, we believe that the black kids we create this art for are worth the time, the money, and the big asks.\nIn this Kickstarter campaign, we will spend 31 days trying to raise enough funds to reach our first goal of $50,000 and then strive to get as close to our $1.6M budget as possible. While $50,000 is our initial target, we hope to hit our 6 other stretch goals that will allow us to continue the animation process. Each step is vital in getting the film as beautiful, polished, and professional as we imagine it can be; whether that be through this campaign or as we partner with production companies and animation studios to close the gap.\nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created an outline below to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. We're hoping production will begin with Powerhouse Animation Studios in August 2021 and for the animation to be completed by October 2022.\n\n \"When Black Boys Feel They Heal\" - Keith F. Miller, Author of Pritty the novel & Executive Producer of Pritty: The Animation \nToday, few animated queer coming-of-age stories exist for black men. Pritty aims to fill this gap and expand a necessary conversation around what it means to be a black boy coming-of-age in America.\nPritty is a universal but unique story of one teenage boy\u2019s journey through pain and trauma to transformative self-acceptance and healing. It purposely flips the typical narrative arc that audiences have come to expect from queer films where the boy gets bullied and either succumbs or survives. And, instead, pushes against what we\u2019ve been conditioned to consider possible...arriving on the other side of healing, hope, and community.\nThis story was created in response to a startling, ever-present truth: boys and young men of color face innumerable obstacles that prevent them from living long, full, healthy, and productive, emotionally-rich lives. And more than anything these obstacles stand to block young men from feeling.\nWe believe there is a correlation between the limited range of queer black male representation on screen and the staggering number of suicide attempts amongst black male LGBTQ+ youth.\nUnfortunately, most black queer coming-of-age films habitually reproduce traumas onscreen without visualizing futures beyond the \u201ccoming out\u201d experience.\nPritty aims to address this disparity by showcasing black men in an unconventional light. Instead of watching black boys fight, belittle and harm one another; we get to watch them at play, figuring themselves out, making themselves vulnerable and healing in the process.\nVisualizing a world where black boys get to express themselves without consequence models an alternative reality for queer black youth, which present-day narratives don\u2019t even allow them to imagine.\n\n\nWe greatly appreciate any and all support towards this project - be it monetary or otherwise. We would love it if you could spread the word about our Kickstarter with your own community by sharing the link to our campaign.\nYou can also follow us on Instagram and Twitter @prittynotpretty to stay connected to the world of Pritty!

Thank you again for your love and support. \n- The Signing Animation team\nThe Story: Liftoff \nThis story was born out of a desire to see accurate Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (HoH) stories in animation.  We want to tell stories with Deaf/HoH main characters who have authentic, well-rounded experiences. \nLiftoff is a 9-minute 3D-animated short film which explores the mind of a Deaf dancer as she faces her fears about her big audition  Vivian is a born optimist and has loved dance ever since she was a little girl, but at 22, she's out on her own for the first time and finds her insecurities appearing the night before her audition for her dream ballet company. Will she conquer her nerves and show her true self as a performer, or will the anxiety swallow her whole?\nWhile assembling our team, we found that Deaf/HoH talent was severely underrepresented in the animation industry, as were Deaf/HoH stories. Therefore, we created the animation studio and non-profit Signing Animation to uplift talent of all hearing types in integrated environments while creating Liftoff. We are creating meaningful representation for the Deaf/HoH community through our film, and affecting meaningful change to the animation industry for Deaf/HoH artists through our work at Signing Animation.\nSupport this Kickstarter because...\nYou want more stories about Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (HoH) protagonists and underrepresented minorities.\nYou want to see American Sign Language in more animated films.\nYou believe that representation behind the camera matters.\nYou want to support a Deaf/HoH-majority studio with an integrated crew.\nYou want to support a studio that demonstrates diversity, inclusion, and positivity. \nYou want to support Deaf/HoH artists in the animation industry.\nIn addition to an animation studio, Signing Animation is also a non-profit! We are a 501(c)(3) charity in the state of California. Your donations to our Kickstarter are tax-deductible and eligible for charity matching from your company. \nCharacters\n Vivian \nHarmony\nArt Process\nEnvironments\nThis story takes place in the eclectic city of Chicago, a place special to our director, Carin. As Vivian's primary character color is pink, we took the red-gray-silver color palette of Chicago and looked at it through rose-colored glasses to have a better idea of how Vivian would view that setting. The strong blues and purples are used narratively throughout the story to indicate liberation and clarity.\nThe visual development crew channeled the apartments they had as 22-year-olds for the apartment that Vivian and Harmony share, including the hand decorations on the walls, the thrifted furniture, the preoccupation with string lights, and stickers absolutely everywhere. You can't see it in this picture, but one of the legs on the couch is missing, so they replaced it with a soup can. The crew frequently tell us that they wish they could live in Vivian and Harmony's apartment.\nOur director spent several years living in Chicago (near the Kimball stop on the brown line, for those familiar with the El train.) She chose it because of its architectural variety and its status as a central artistic hub, home to the Joffrey Ballet, the Chicago Symphony, and the Chicago Art Institute, among many others.\nColorscript \nWe move from a Dorothy-in-Kansas neutral palette at the beginning to a vivid rosy color scheme when Vivian is dreaming to show what it's like inside her head. As her tension increases, so does the temperature and intensity of the color script until it reaches a fever pitch on the stage. It was important to us to have a moment of visual quiet to give the audience time to process the story, so we have a moment of simplicity and emptiness, almost solitude, before the momentum of the story picks up again, and we break the feverishness of the colors with a cooling, powerful blue. When Vivian returns to the waking world, everything is just a little bit brighter, the way things are after a good night's sleep and a good decision reached.\nProcess Videos\nThe Atherton Ballet and its building was made up by the team to represent everything that's intimidating about established artistic forms: rigid traditions, rich and powerful sponsors, and a strong sense of obligation to conform. We wanted the building to look expensive, well-established, and a little scary, and we channeled various international opera and ballet houses to achieve the effect. \nPLAY\n\nAnimation Ambitions\nWe'll be attempting what many have not before: animating American Sign Language to  be dynamic and reflect the personality of the characters. American Sign Language is such a dynamic and exciting language to watch, and we want to reflect that spirit in our animation.\nAs ASL is a language consisting of rapid gestures, our development team was challenged to find a version of 3D animation which captured these nuances. We settled on a synthesis of 2D and 3D which eliminates motion blur and allows the language to move at an organic pace. Most crucially, we\u2019ll have artists who use sign language executing sign language animation, making it understandable to native users of ASL. That\u2019s the difference between false representation and authentic representation: legibility and authenticity.\nStory Ambitions\nThere are many different ways to be Deaf/HoH, and we wanted to be able to represent many, not just one or two. That\u2019s why Liftoff is the first of an animated anthology series featuring the dreams of Deaf/HoH people; cathartic dreams, funny dreams, nightmares, everything. The chosen story form of dreams is to allow an intimate look into the imaginations of these highly visual characters, and to let us use the infinite possibilities of the animation medium.\nExpectations \nWorks for Deaf/HoH audiences first\nFeatures the holistic Deaf lived experience instead of focusing solely on the difficulties\nSigning characters animated by signing artists\n (Slide template by SlidesCarnival)\nFunding Ambitions\nYour support enables us to create a magnificent film while paying our team of part-time crew, interpreters, and volunteers.\nWhile our Kickstarter goal is set at $40k, here\u2019s what your additional support can help us achieve:\n $40k raised (Reached!) enables us to create a rough cut of the movie with characters fully animated and environments fully modeled.\n $120k raised enables us to complete a high-quality short film with polish and post-production.\n $500k raised enables us to complete the film at a faster pace, pay our crew full-time, build out larger teams, and promote the film to larger audiences.\nAs you\u2019ll read in the \u201cSigning Animation: Who We Are\u201d section of this page below, your support contributes toward building the careers of Deaf/HoH artists and making change in the animation industry through successful integrated environments.\n(Slide template by SlidesCarnival)\nWho We Are: Signing Animation \nAnimation Studio and Nonprofit\nSigning Animation began because representation starts in development. It's time for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (HoH) creators and artists to be recognized by the animation industry for the unique skill sets we bring. \nStorytelling is one of the most powerful vehicles for meaningful change, and as a proud, thriving culture with a rich history, the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community deserves to see themselves represented accurately, positively, and respectively in more onscreen stories.\nSigning Animation's mission is threefold: \nCreate meaningful Deaf/HoH animated stories with Deaf/HoH artists.\nContribute directly to a 200% increase in Deaf/HoH employment in US-based animation studios.\nAffect positive societal change that supports the Deaf/HoH community through our films.   \n(Slide template by SlidesCarnival)\nOur mission began because Deaf/HoH applicants get this question at their interviews for studio work that hearing applicants don't: \n\"How are we even supposed to communicate with you?\" \nBecause of long standing negative misconceptions about the ability of people who hear differently, the animation industry is largely without the tools to create and maintain Deaf/HoH-accessible workplaces. This places Deaf/HoH animation students, who graduate every year, without the means to earn an income from their degree.  \nSigning Animation strives to provide these experiences to Deaf/HoH artists and crew while creating a film benefiting the Deaf/HoH community. In addition, Signing Animation identifies and connects artists and production team with opportunities in the animation industry.\n(Slide template by Puress Online)\nFrom the beginning we've required that our production team be 50% or more Deaf/HoH artists, and further, that each of those artists has access to opportunities in studios outside of ours. Part of our mission is to get studios to notice the extraordinary talents of our crew by: \nHolding roundtable events with major studios\nParticipating in career week at the National Technical Institute of the Deaf \nConsulting with recruiting departments\nPromoting our artists for discussion panels\nPosting job listings \nEvery one of our artists has access to on-the-job growth opportunities, expert portfolio review, and peer critique, and we balance this by maintaining firm work-life boundaries and promoting physical and mental health. We watch movies together on Friday nights, and have recently begun taking dance classes together to avoid repetitive stress injuries, connect with our main character, and have some fun as a group.\nYour contribution brings Vivian to the screen and keeps our mission alive! Come join the revolution and help us make a world where animation studios get excited when they see a Deaf/HoH applicant come through the door. Together we can affect meaningful change in a creative and lucrative industry while making beautiful stories!\nRewards\nAll of our rewards are made by our Signing Animation members or created in collaboration with Deaf/HoH-owned businesses.\nHere\u2019s a look into some of our rewards\u2026\n\nCustom-made Sticker\nExpress your love with stickers that say \u201cI love you\u201d in American Sign Language!

Here's a sneak peek into our talent...\nCREATIVE TEAM SPOTLIGHT\nCarin Powell - Director, Writer, Co-Founder of Signing Animation\nCarin Powell is the writer and director of Liftoff, and co-founder of Signing Animation. Formerly a lead animator and fix team lead, Carin started Signing Animation with Nora Ng-Quinn in January 2020 as a way to combat the bias against Deaf/HoH talent in the animation industry. She has had single-sided deafness since early childhood, and has long been a proponent of Deaf Gain. Her mentors in animation include Eric Cera, Paul Naas, Peter Kelly, and Matt Majers. Through her work with Signing Animation she aims to demonstrate the singular talent of Deaf/HoH artists, the methods by which integrated teams can thrive, and the transformative power of storytelling.\nAustin Balaich - Lead Rigger\nAustin joined Signing Animation because he wanted to contribute to a film that represents authentic stories about Deaf people.  From his experience in the animation industry, stories about Deaf people are very underrepresented, and he's glad to be part of this group to help make the change!\nVivienne Crews - Storyboard Artist\nVivienne is a 24-year-old deaf visual artist with a lifelong passion for storytelling through her drawings and characters. Profoundly deaf at birth, she was born into a hearing family who recognized the importance of early language development and sought to provide her with a sign-language-rich environment as quickly as possible by studying and learning ASL. Her elementary education in Miami, Florida, was a mix of special deaf and mainstream classes until her early artistic talent was discovered, and she was enrolled in a fine arts magnet school at the age of 7; a sign language interpreter accompanied her to every class. Despite being the sole deaf student in all of her classes from 3rd grade all the way through to college graduation, her life\u2019s true focus has always been art. She graduated in May 2019 from the School of Visual Arts in NYC with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Computer Art, Computer Animation and Visual Effects. As far back as she can remember, she has been using my drawing skills to express her emotions and to communicate with the world, straddling the line between hearing and deaf cultures, never feeling completely a part of either. Facial expression, body position, and subtle movement are used to convey the details of her language \u2013 American Sign Language \u2013 and she relies heavily on these tools in her artwork, too. Storyboarding allows her to bring her characters and their stories to life, something she's dreamed of since she was very young. She is excited to be a part of the Signing Animation team and our mission to bring awareness of Deaf and hard-of-hearing talent to the industry forefront.\nNatasha Hill - Internship Coordinator\nNatasha is the only Deaf person from her hearing family. She's used American Sign Language her whole life. She was born and raised in Alaska, and loves mountains and Alaska's longest sunlight in the summer. She also loves sports and activities to keep her working out. She has a family cabin at Nancy Lake, and it's her favorite place to relax and enjoy some nature. She graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology last May 2020 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a minor in Communication. She's exploring her skills as an artist, including graphic design, video production, and photography. She loves to take videos and pictures of nature. She joined Signing Animation in June as an Internship Program Coordinator to help interns who build 3D models with feedback and help them with anything they need from us. She has been enjoying seeing our team growing with our varieties of skills.\nTaylor Jones - Lead Modeler\nTaylor Anne Jones is the Lead Modeler of Liftoff at Signing Animation. She graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design in June 2017 with a BFA and MA in Visual Effects and Animation, receiving multiple accolades for her work. Taylor specializes in 3D Modeling, Look Development, Character Design, Concept Art, Writing, and Quality Assurance for AAA video games. She hopes to share parts of her creative journey with others through developing strong characters and beautiful worlds. Her favorite joys in life are her family, cats, video games, films, and chocolate.\nS\u00f8ren Sparre - Animator\nSoren is a Danish animator, currently living in Copenhagen.

His interest is in movies, TV series, computer games, and VR, and he is a frequent participant in TV-series projects in Copenhagen. He considers himself a creative actor with a great passion for facial expressions and body language. It has always been his dream to work with sign language in a movie. It is his goal to inspire others to dare to dream the impossible. He is searching for a new network outside Denmark, and he wants to meet other people who also want to work on sign language in 3D animation, in software programs such as Maya and Blender. He is openminded to meet new challenges and he is always happy to learn something new!\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM SPOTLIGHT\n Nora Ng-Quinn - Head Producer, Co-founder of Signing Animation \nNora Ng-Quinn is the producer of Liftoff and co-founder of Signing Animation.

It has a thick front and back cover. Includes a matte black golf pencil that slides perfectly into the spiral binding, and a black and white d6 that you can carry along as well.\nSample pages (Subject to change)\n\n\n\nHow to play:\nGameplay is simple but entertaining: you roll a 6-sided die to determine how far you'll move each turn. Then pick a direction, draw a line, and interact with anything on that line, be it a monster (ouch!) some treasure (nice!) or a teleporter (cool!).\nCustomize your character, roll your way through each floor, and get items at the shops sprinkled throughout the game. There's even a page in the back to track stats like how many times you died -- so if you die, don't worry! It's all part of the adventure.\n\nYou can get a PDF of sample rules and level here\n\nTesting a prototype\n\nHow I'm making it:\nI am using software called Drawbot that allows me to code a level generator in Python. This generates PDFs which I will send to a local printer to get the notebooks made. This means that each game pad is different - each one has random level layouts and different shops. So if you get more than one game pad, you'll have different levels to play!\n\nLevels are generated with Python code using Drawbot\n\n\nWhy I'm making it:\nI feel compelled to cut games down to their bones and to see what makes them tick. In that spirit, I'm trying to strip this genre down to its simplest form: 1 player, simple mechanics, no story-telling, just you, a die and pencil, and a series of simple decisions in the face of randomness. \n\nAs a product designer, I have been thinking for a long time about the concept of \"paper apps\". In fact I've created one already. Sometimes you want to do something during a dull moment, but don't want to get sucked into your phone screen. Paper apps fill that gap with discrete, screen-free experiences that respect your time and attention. Eventually I plan on creating a whole Paper App Library (PAL) that will include all sorts of little notebook \"apps\", including games and utilities.\n\nAbout me:\nI've been creating games since I first learned to program in QBASIC as a kid. I have published several video games and even published a tabletop game on Kickstarter back in 2013. I am interested in game design, graphic design, and product design. \nPaper Apps is a joint effort of my video game company, Beep Yeah!, and the design company I run with my wife, Gladden.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk involves getting printed and shipped.

Some are playful critters, while others are somber spirits - there's a full array!\nEach card was traditionally drawn in sumi ink on rice paper, then scanned and digitally colored for consistency, giving it a not-quite modern and not-quite traditional fresh look. \nThe deck will consist of the full 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana, broken into four suits of staves, cups, coins, and swords. \nPrinted on 350gsm art paper\nGilded edges\nMatte linen finish to compliment the traditional look and feel of the illustrations\nA small booklet that gives the name and a very brief description of the yokai\n2-piece simple rigid lidded box\nFSC Certified paper, meaning the paper was environmentally and ethically sourced. \n These are available in their own tiers, and as add-ons at any other tier.\n8x10 Print: A kickstarter exclusive offer -- choose a 8x10 print of ANY of the 78 cards!

You may know me from Instagram, Patreon, Twitter, Facebook, Beast of Oblivion on DeviantArt , and Crispyfishsticks on Tumblr.\nIn the last decade I've spent some time on game projects such as Warhammer 40k: Dark Millenium Online, Darksiders 2, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, and Crowfall. I've also done numerous TTRPG illustrations for Pathfinder and Fantasy Flight Games. Additionally, many may know me as the artist that helped kick off the popular online series 'Extra Credits'.\nAfter perusing some older art I realized it'd been almost a decade since I'd released my last sketchbook. Time certainly flies when you're busy! I have SO MUCH work to show you all - gesture work, sketches, iterations for my personal world-building project, and in-progress larger works. \nSome of this I've shared across my galleries online at one point or another and you might be familiar with it, but much of it has sat in folders and in sketchbooks unseen. My aim is to assemble all of this work into a solid book to share with you!\nOver 10+ years of raw sketches and concepts! This book contains loads of personal work from over the last decade. It includes traditional and digital pieces, finished and unfinished works, as well as thoughts around design and iteration and my overall creative process. Like my last book, 'A Book of Mostly Creatures,' it will also touch on the massive personal project I've been visualizing since I first began creating creatures in 1997.\nThis book showcases traditional and digital sketches, ranging from complete critter nonsense to world-building speed paints and everything in between. It features predominantly new work, a dabble of my IP work, and exclusive artwork that will only be available in this book.\nThrough this campaign, I will be offering a unique opportunity for backers to acquire a signed copy Mostly Monsters, The Art of Allison Theus, as well as stickers, wallpapers, prints, and even a downloadable copy of my first artbook \u201cA Book of Mostly Creatures\u201d (another 150+ pages of critters!). There\u2019s also a limited number of signed prints, one-of-a-kind sketches, and commissions available. \n\nAll backers, however large or small, will be able to download a video that goes over my process when designing creatures in photoshop!\nPLAY\n\nPlease note that the number of signed copies of this new book and interior doodles are extremely limited, and will no longer be available once those reward tiers run out! \n\nThis campaign is the only opportunity to get this bundle of books, stretch goals and unique goodies around my work. However, after the campaign ends, Mostly Monsters, The Art of Allison Theus will be made available through my website.\nGet ready for more goodies! In the event I reach my funding goal, there are some incredible opportunities for more of my work! I want to give a special thank you to all my backers who were kind (and patient haha) enough to brainstorm some of these goals with me.\n\nAll final designs are subject to change, based on the artists' discretion - and I'll do my very best to share finalized imagery and (in the case of the savage bunny pillow and dark fu enamel pin) prototypes via updates. \n\nKickstarter gives me a unique opportunity to thank those who are kind enough to help make the book possible, by adding stretch goals and lots of unique extras to the campaign. The more the campaign funds, the more unique and exciting creations I can give the backers!\nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, I will be working through all the additional content for backers rewards, stretch goals, and exclusive goodies. Our current timetable is to ship the books out roughly 3 months after the Kickstarter's end.\n\nIn order to facilitate speedy and quality publishing, we're also working with PrintNinja! A custom printing company that offers affordable, high-quality offset printing and superb customer service. I'm super excited to collaborate with them on this project, as they produce high quality art books with amazing features.\n\nAbout a month before we're ready to ship, we\u2019ll be sending out a survey through Kickstarter, asking to confirm your address so we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details! When the survey is ready, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, should there be a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will me several weeks to prepare and package all the rewards!\n\nUnforeseen delays that are out of my control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We'll be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time.\nIn the event of lost orders in the mail (it totally happens!), I\u2019m more than happy to offer to resend the order once for free, or alternatively you will have the option of a refund. \nFrom what I\u2019ve researched, the logistics for a high number of backers might be more intimidating than anticipated. To that end, I\u2019ve partnered with LiquidLockMedia LLC, who has fulfillment and logistics solutions in place to begin packaging up the rewards as soon as everything is ready. This way, we can ensure that we can process a high number of rewards as quickly as possible, and mitigate any bottlenecks or loose ends. \nJust as well, a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, which makes it impossible for the processing and shipping of rewards. I pledge to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 6 months and will make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.\nI would love to be able to share this amazing book with you all, and I hope you might consider backing this exciting project to help it become a reality! \n\nThank you!

A city where humans are as dispensable as the trash littering the streets.\nWelcome to Remnant by Eduardo Pena\nTalyn finds hope and light in her little mischievous sister, Tessa. \nTessa and Talyn\nBut when Tessa is abducted by a mysterious ghost-like entity, Talyn is thrust into an uncanny mystery, pushing her dark temper and brash nature to the breaking point. \nSearching for Tessa\nIf you enjoy imaginative settings of classic anime works Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust and Demon City Shinjuku (Yoshiaki Kawajiri),  the expansive lore and themes of the Dark Souls Series (Hidetaka Miyazaki), and mysterious modern noir films like Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Se7en (David Fincher), you\u2019ll love TALYN and its highly original cast of characters.\nThe TALYN Cast\n\n What is the Project?\nTalyn Issue 1\n\nTALYN - Seed of Darkness Issue 1 is a 32-page comic book that sets the stage for an 8 issue series.

The idea behind it is that it should be a relaxing and creative experience, every click should uncover a new possibility and there are no wrong moves. Whatever you decide to build will blend seamlessly and the end result will be an organic world. \nThe game is functional and currently there is a limited tile set in the game but I am adding more and more content every day. If you choose to back this Kickstarter you will get a windows version of the game in an Early Access state in December that will automatically upgrade to the full version when it is released, which means that you'll get it before the full release so some features that are planned won't be in by December. What you will get is a relaxing experience building an imaginary world. But I want to be very clear that this won't contain the full feature set that is planned for the full game. The benefit of getting it here is that it will be cheaper than buying it on Steam because I won't have to pay the Steam fee for each copy so I thought I'd pass the savings on to all the people that support the project early. You will basically get a Beta version of the build and your input will help guide what features I add and what I focus on when continuing the development of Atlas Architect. Of course you will continue to get all updates and the full game when it releases at no additional costs.\n\n\nThese are the current biomes that are in the game:\nCastle\nCities\nDeserts\nDead lands\nFarmlands\nForests\nIslands\nJungles\nGrass lands\nMountains\nOceans\nRivers\nRoads\nRocky\nRuins\nSavannahs\nSnow\nSwamps\nVillages\nVolcanoes\n\nAnd these are planned for future updates (but won't be in the first Early Access Release)\nBridges\nCave Entrances\nDwarven City\nFloating Islands\nElven City\nElven Villages\nHills\nLake Towns\nOrc Cities\nOrc Camps\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks involved here are very small but here they are.

So I'm looking for some good tips for a way to get this into the hands of kids where it could help their situation. It would be completely free for them and the idea is just to make their lives a bit more fun. I was  planning on contacting a few charities that work with kids but a problem is that it requires a computer and that might make it a bit trickier.

Rick and Morty, Bill and Ted, Futurama, Star Trek. . . you get the picture. Alternate realities are a favorite theme of visual art makers and storytellers -- not only do these concepts give us an out from the insanity of life here on earth, but it gives us wildly creative ways to ask the big cosmic question \"what if things were different...?\"  \nWelcome to World Roulette - an interactive art book about wild worlds and their stories, by 150 incredible creators.\n We (Light Grey Art Lab founder, Lindsay Nohl, gallery manager, Jenny Wells, and Intern Kait Bartlett) decided to make an amazing project that delved into the idea of random world generation. It's part art book, part interactive experience. We asked 150 illustrators, visual development and concept artists, comic artists and creatives to use a virtual \"world randomizer\" we built -- which scrambled dozens of world attributes and spit out unique, entertaining, and intriguing combinations of factors for their creative pleasures. Each artist took on the challenge of creating a unique and compelling world. The result was an incredible art book filled with exceptional illustrative vignettes of 150 worlds beyond our own and the stories that accompany them.\nThen, because we couldn't stop there, we made a highly expanded version of the \"Randomizer\" -- a creative prompt deck that uses a system of stacking, twisting, and combining cards to create infinite prompts for worldbuilding for worldbuilding, writing, drawing, and creating fodder for infinite RPG campaigns :)\nFinally, because we are very, very proud of the creativity and genius that our collaborating artists have when making work - we asked them (and some other worldbuilding professionals from the the videogame, comics, animation, and illustration industries) to share their advice, creative challenges, resources, and pro-tips on how to make the best worlds -- and gathered it in the back of the book to share with you.  \n So we're asking for your help in making this a reality! We've worked super hard gathering the art, writing the book, designing the deck, and making some extra goodies -- and hope you'll help us reach our funding goal so we can share this awesome project with you all! Please help us spread the word! Anything helps! \n Here's a fun breakdown of all of the fun things you can enjoy if you're up for helping us reach our funding goal! \n\u2022 THE WORLD ROULETTE ART BOOK \u2022\nFor the past few months we've been creating the most amazing book of alternate universes, far-away lands, and fantastic civilizations there ever was. World Roulette is an art book that will whisk you away to a land far-far-away! It's filled to the brim with amazing illustrations and stories by 150 incredible artists and meanders through 10 cosmic epochs, visiting unique fantasy + sci-fi worlds like we had our own cosmic wormhole.\n(Artwork above by Rebecca Hu, Morgan Moen, Justin DeVine, Lauren Franklin, and Saleha Chowdhury)\n(Artwork above by Alaina Cooper, Steven Sugar, and Miguel Co)\n The book is our pride and joy. It's got 150 incredible pieces of artwork by 150 international artists and stories about each awesome world we visit! The book walks through 10 fanciful historical ages, each with their own twists and turns of fate! \nThe first 180 pages are dedicated to full-page black and white illustrations and stories, and after you've had your fill of wandering through the ages, head to the back of the book where we've compiled a \"worldbuilding compendium\" for those of you that would like to learn about worldbuilding from the best! The back has all sorts of great challenges for creatives, advice on worldbuilding, and pro-tips from the artists that work on the animations, TV shows, comics, games, and books we love.\nCONTRIBUTORS JUST ANNOUNCED!\nWe\u2019ve saved one of the best announcements for last!

This deck uses simple mechanics of layering, twisting, and combining cards to prompt dynamic idea generation for building robust, intriguing, believable worlds!

We are a fiscally sponsored nonprofit through Springboard for the Arts. We believe that art culture should be accessible to everyone and that it should be easy for creatives to celebrate and grow their practice.\nWe love to make big things happen! Though we are an illustration-heavy gallery, we adore and support an interdisciplinary approach to 'making,' in that we frequently look for alternative and interesting ways to engage the creative community. Whether it's through a printed or an online project, we promote the theory that all artists are multi-faceted, idea-centric individuals whose creativity goes well beyond the visible technical aspects of the piece into the experiential side of art-appreciation. In addition to gallery experiences, we also host creative residencies, art camp programs, and art camp international programs to areas such as Iceland, Norway, Scotland, Japan, and various National Parks through the United States.\nLIGHTGREYARTLAB.COM\nWe have a history of making collaborative projects -- our past publications include COSMOS Tarot & Oracle Deck,The Light Grey Tarot, In Place book, Girls: Fact + Fiction book, Rolemodels: Battle for Vyk\u2019Tornaahl Card Game, Great Personality dating sim inspired by Myers-Briggs Personality Types, and Dream Arcade a 28-level platformer game made in collaboration with Microsoft.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe World Roulette book & deck are nearly finished -- we are about 95% done with the design, editing, and additional content, and all artwork is complete; there is no risk of the project being unfinished. All stretch goal products and content have also been designed, and there is no risk they will be incomplete.\n\nThe biggest risk for this project would be a delay in shipping due to Covid-19 or slowed service with USPS. If the books and products arrive late to our gallery, it may take us a little longer to package and send our rewards. \n\nLight Grey Art Lab is just three of us (Lindsay + Jenny + Kait) so we will keep you updated on shipping status and any changes along the way.

Pledges can be adjusted at any time during the campaign!\nAlso, please don\u2019t wait for your favorite design to be unlocked. If you do, it may never happen.\n\n\n\nWhen the project is fully funded, you will be able to choose from any of the unlocked pins for your pledge amount.\n If all previous stretch goals are unlocked I will consider adding new pin designs as stretch goals (and potentially a free pin with every pledge!) \nThe pins will retail at a regular price of $13-$15 once funded. However, in addition to the discounted early bird tiers at $10 per pin, these pins are available on Kickstarter at a lower price per pin as a thank you for helping to bring this project to life.\n\nI had a test batch made ahead of this project to identify any potential production errors and see how white screen printing would look on black enamel. The results were stunning (pictured below!), but I did end up with a higher flaw rate than normal due to scratches on the screen-printing of some pins. Because of this I\u2019ve adjusted all of the unlock goals to accommodate ordering a larger quantity of pins. This will make up for the higher flaw rate and insure that all backers receive standard A grade pins.  \nAnubis test batch!\nFor every pin design, it will cost roughly $600 to create. This includes manufacturing fees and shipping from the factory. All remaining funds raised will be used for shipping to backers, materials, fees, and taxes. Excess funds will be used for the production of more pins and stickers. The buffer will be used to cover any additional or unexpected costs.\n Once the project is funded, surveys will be sent out to backers to select their pin choices. Once the surveys are complete it will take roughly 1-2 weeks for me to receive funds from the campaign. After the funds are received, the pins will be ordered. It should take around 4-6 weeks to receive the pins from the manufacturer, and orders will be promptly shipped out once pins are received. Assumed pin arrival date will take around 2-3 months from the end of the campaign. I expect the pins to be shipped out to me around mid-September to early October.\n7/14/2020 - Campaign launches\n8/13/2020 - Campaign ends and surveys are sent out\n8/30/2020 - Funds are received and pins are ordered from the manufacturer\nSeptember/October - Pins are received and shipped out to backers.\nSeptember/October - Pins are received by backers. Please allow additional time for international shipping.\nWant to support the campaign, but can't back it? No problem! Sharing on social media will help just as much. All shares are greatly appreciated! Be sure to tell your friends :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI will be sending the designs off to a pin manufacturer once funds are received.

I expect to receive the pins by September if all goes well, however I chose November as the expected shipping date for rewards to allow extra time in the event production errors occur.\n\nFurther shipping delays may occur if the design needs some minor edits, or if any errors happen during manufacturing.

You may know me as Dibujante Nocturno on Instagram or Facebook. \nThank you for taking the time to check out this Kickstarter campaign for my art book Dibujante Nocturno: The Art of Fran Garc\u00e9s. \n Together with 3dtotal Publishing, I am creating a book that reflects who I really am as an artist, by giving insight into my creative experience and processes. The book will also include my ballpoint pen sketches, many of which I have scanned and colored especially for this project, and some new digital paintings, which I can't wait to share!\nDibujante Nocturno: The Art of Fran Garc\u00e9s will be beautifully presented in hardback with grained leather-effect binding and gunmetal foiling, making it a stunning addition to your art book collection. \nI see my sketchbooks as personal journals, recording important thoughts and moments in my creative journey. To offer a glimpse into my artistic mindset, I have chosen to include unseen personal sketches in this book, accompanied by notes and inner musings.\nIn addition to showcasing diverse galleries of my fantastical works, I will be sharing my workflow through a series of step-by-step tutorials and a collection of tips and tricks I have learned over the years as a freelance artist. Through this book I hope that I can help you to grow and develop as artists and offer inspiration for years to come.\nI hope you will consider supporting this project to help make this book a reality. Thank you all very much!\nBelow are the exclusive items that are available in addition to the book. Some tiers and gifts are limited, so be sure to pledge quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out! We have put a lot of love into these items and we hope you enjoy them.\nPlease note that as this is a live project, all designs are examples of content I would like to include but these are subject to change.\n\n\n\n\n Launching this book through Kickstarter means we can thank those who support the book by adding extra stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed high-quality bonus rewards to be given away if we can meet certain targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3dtotal like to give the best and most exciting stretch goals possible to their backers. For that reason we only reveal one stretch goal at a time. This allows us to respond to the success of the campaign, offering more exciting and adventurous items when the campaign does well, rather than having committed to multiple smaller inexpensive products.\n\n3dtotal publishing is committed to having a positive effect on the environment. From 2020 they have committed to planting one tree for every book they sell by partnering with re-forestation charities. This includes books sold in their Kickstarter campaigns. If you support this campaign we would like to thank you for helping us take on this mission.\n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.\nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service, and parcels sent to the rest of the world will be sent with tracked shipping. Due to complications to logistics caused by the Coronavirus, some countries have introduced surcharges to receiving international postage. This is why shipping prices will seem slightly higher for some backers than it has done on our past campaigns.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in October. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\n  As seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time.

La raison est simple, j'ai offert une belle part au texte en confiant certaines de mes \u0153uvres \u00e0 la plume de plusieurs auteurs,  pour revenir aux racines de ce qu'est un livre. Si vous souhaitez n\u00e9anmoins ardemment participer \u00e0 cette campagne ou au deux, d'abord merci infiniment, mais n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 attendre la version fran\u00e7aise si vous ne ma\u00eetrisez pas l'anglais. Je rel\u00e8ve le d\u00e9fi de multiplier mes campagnes pour vous, par amour pour la langue de Baudelaire.\nForgotten Gods is the name of a painting I created in 2013, using the very same technique that promoted my work: graphite and gold leaf.\nFor this illustration, I was inspired by an encounter with a large deer during a stroll in the moonlit forest. Thriving on the emotion this sighting generated as I crossed tall iced over grass, surrounded by trees frozen in their exquisite prisons of crystal, my steps resonating in the mysterious silence of the night, I began dreaming of a tribute to the forest, the one I live in as well as the others, to nature and to its liveliness.\nOf all my works, this image is undeniably the one that has travelled the most, all around the world, thus speaking to the souls of many cultures. Some symbols are powerful enough to cross our differences and bring us together to remind us that all of our civilizations have a common background.\nForgotten Gods is a door to Another World, this is what I wish for this book: that it will delight you and take you elsewhere for a stroll with me.\nForgotten Gods - 2013 - graphite, gold leaf and hydrangea petals on Arches paper\nYoann Lossel has exhibited his work in numerous galleries around the world, mainly in the United States. Award-winning artist, he is well known for his meticulous work combining graphite and gold leaf, legacy of the iconography that he cherishes such as the Italian Renaissance, the Symbolist, Pre-Raphaelites, Art Nouveau and Arts & Crafts movements. He currently lives in the legendary Broceliande forest in Brittany, France.\n\u00ab Large landscapes fascinate me. I have always admired the strength that emerges from these visions.\n Before locking myself up into my workshop to represent these worlds, I am primarily a contemplative person searching for spaces, atmospheres, for a scope for imagination. I pay particular attention to what is \"outside the frame\", to this tiny nuance that transforms a space into a story. The timethat shapes the tree and forces it to adopt a posture. The erosion of the stone which distinguishes this very one from all the others. The wind that modifies the moor and forces the hawthorn to grow horizontally. These shrubs you identify in the hilltops of Devon or the paintings of Hokusai. I have a special affection for ruins: in these spaces,time becomes tangible, somewhere between civilization and wilderness.\nTo highlight the depth of these scenes, I opted for the use of gold leaf,which generates background by their way of reflecting light.\nThus are born twilights and dawns. \u00bb\nwww.yoannlossel.com\n (It starts with a \u201cfundraising\u201d that will take the project to fruition and elevate the rewards level of the final product. Then in 2021 the customized products will be delivered to each collector/purchaser)\n This book is a dream come true. I designed it as a jewel, a precious artifact, an object animated by a life of its own. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support and hope that together we will give rise to this project.\nWith my wife, Psych\u00e9, we worked on the creation of four levels of editing and finish. All are in high quality and wide format (24 / 32cm), including the first edition. Do not hesitate to take your time to choose. Each edition\u2019s specifics are listed in the \"Artifacts\" section.\n\n                                                                       I am a bookworm, I have been fondly collecting books for years, with a preference for first editions of the masters of the golden age of illustration (Rackham, Dulac, Nielsen, Robinson, Bauer, Dor\u00e9, ...).\nIt\u2019s with this love that I imagined Forgotten Gods, an art book which brings together my works from the past decade, with the wish to pay tribute to said period\u2019s illustrations and carvings.\nSo, striving for sophistication and willing to work with the best materials, I was, for the creation of this work, joined by great artists and craftsmen, and guided by passion and ethics.\nForgotten Gods will include several sections and will address my technique, my inspirations, my collaborations, my relationship to art, my relationship to my muse and wife Psych\u00e9, as well as some of my early works. There will obviously be a selection of my works (best collected works), some yet unpublished, as well as close-ups to highlight some details. The layout and cover of the deluxe edition are obvious tributes to the 19th century and to the golden age of illustration.\nThe text is always important. With that in mind, we called upon the poetic pens of French and English-speaking authors we know and love to accompany my works, among whom: Gabriel McCaughry, Marc Nagels, Christophe Sudre, Arnaud Flici, Jean- Baptiste Garnier, Psych\u00e9 Ophiuchus, Gwenael de Montfaucon and many more surprises...\nAlan Lee does me the great honor of writing the preface of the book. Who better than the descendant of the masters of English illustration? I wish to once again send him my heartfelt thanks. I have dreamed as a child, and still dream as an adult, while admiring his illustrations. For me, as a contemporary artist, he has created a timeless art that remains dear to me. His is a formidable technique supporting a referenced background and a magnificent culture.\nAlan Lee - Merlin\nFlorence Alibert, a French academic, signs the afterword for the book. Her book Cath\u00e9drales de poche (which translates into \u201cPocket cathedrals\u201d), which describes William Morris\u2019 perspectives on publishing, imposed itself on me during the conception of my book. Morris is one of the personalities who have been with me all along my artistic path and bringing a little bit of this great artist\u2019s soul and intellectual through her intervention means the world to me.\nThe book will be printed by the printer Escourbiac, in France. His printing company is renowned and has won awards, and makes good use of both craftsmanship and ethics. They specialize in fine works and produce the artbooks of many artists and photographers in France. They received three \"Cadrat d\u2019or\", a top distinction in the printing field in France. They are also respectful of the environment and their employees.\nThese pins have been specially designed for this kisckstarter!\nHowever, as the pins are wide, they cannot be sent with the classic version book.

THANK ALL OF YOU SO MUCH.\nTHE PROJECT\nThe Bone Herder is an Afropunk/Afrofuturistic fantasy horror comic that puts black characters at the center of the story. Often people of color are left out of fantasy worlds or forced into stereotypical roles. I'm not alone in my desire to see settings that extend beyond the familiarity of typical western stories. This project originated from Gail Simone's Comic School, which gave me the confidence to go forward with my idea. \nTHE SQUAD\nOpe, I am Zaire Lanier and I am a writer and narrative designer from the Midwest and I am the writer for The Bone Herder. The sequential artist is Tumo Mere from Botswana and the concept artist is Morgan Madeline. Morgan and Tumo are known for their work in the amazing SWORDSFALL UNIVERSE and more! Sam Willoughby came on to do additional art! Gary Kings and his sister, Harriet did the trailer and music respectively. Please give everyone follows and support!\nZaire: https://twitter.com/Zlanier21     \nTumo: https://twitter.com/ItsTumo  \nMorgan: https://twitter.com/mormadillus\nSam: https://twitter.com/SamRWilloughby   \nGary: https://twitter.com/GaryJKings      \nHarriet: https://twitter.com/Harriet_FerretE                                             \nTHE STORY\nEvery generation, a child is chosen to travel from village to village punishing wrong doers, by flaying their bones and burying them. Cass is the first to break the tradition, but in doing so breaks an ancient pact with the Flesh Folk. \nPreliminary sketch of the first page - Tumo Mere\nColored and Lettered First Page by Tumo Mere\nTHE WORLD \nThe Bone Herder takes place in the mythical country of Koatrom and is inspired by pre-colonial Africa and Afropunk aesthetics. Why Afropunk? It is a battle cry against the norm and a baseline for something different. It isn't easily defined. Fantasy has been built on the shoulders of the Western ideals. While I enjoy it, it does have its issues, prejudices, and hurtful stereotypes. \nThis is why  I am creating the world of The Bone Herder. It is for people, like me, that want to a reflection of themselves in the media they consume. My family tree and genealogy have no known origin. Africa is the framework for my existence and I feel an attachment and at times even a hole for a motherland I never knew. I imagine worlds and stories they might have once been a part of many, many years ago.  \nI based the world around ancient African cities like Carthage and Kush. The ancient cities of Africa are a rich and diverse world. I have created my own mythos surrounding the mysterious and ancient Flesh Folk. \nWhile this story is a fantasy horror comic, I want to portray a strong and loving Black family. Cass's family will come strongly into play and we will see the impact that they have on her personhood as the story progresses. \nTHE DUO\nAnallelli Yosi - Cass's mentor and teacher. Analleli hates what she does, but knows it is necessary. She acts out of a sense of duty.\nAnalleli Concept Art - Morgan Thomas\nAnalleli by Tumo Mere\nCass Ilondyri - The forced apprentice to Analleli. She's vowed vengeance against her mentor and wants to end the practice. \nOlder Cass by Tumo Mere\nCass Concept Art by Morgan\nThe Rewards\nLogo Pin\nCass Button by Morgan\nAnalleli Button by Morgan\n11x17 Print by Sam\nTHE SCRIPT\nI wanted to show you guys a couple pages of the script :)\nPage 1 of Script by Zaire\nPage 2 of Script by Zaire\n THE BUDGET\nART \nAbout half of the funds are going directly to the artists. A lot of Kickstarter comics are already finished, but this isn't the case with Bone Herder. This is helping fund production of the comic, which goes towards myself, Tumo and Morgan, as well as Gary and his sister, who did the trailer and music. We all have already put in so much work and our skills deserve to be properly compensated.\nI believe very strongly in paying artist fair rates for their time and skills. I saved and paid out of pocket for a first page and some concept art. They both believed in the script and decided to come on board for the project. I am trying to pay as close to professional rates as possible. Passion does not pay bills, as nice as that would be\nPRINTING AND SHIPPING\nThe rest of the money goes towards printing, getting books bound, posters, etc. \nThe Promise\nWe will be transparent with every step along the way. I promise to treat this comic and work respectfully. I wrote The Bone Herder with people like me in mind, who want to see more diverse characters and stories in comics. Fantasy has always catered to a Western bent. I want to help change that. I modeled the world partially off of ancient African cities like Carthage, Kush, and places that Africa influenced. The ancient world was more colorful than we were taught. \nI am excited about what I have put together with my team. I hope that you are too and that I will see you at the finish line!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. I believe in the concept, but I haven't ever planned a project of this size before. My name isn't out there a ton, but there has been a lot of interest in the comic. \n\nI believe that my main risk would be attempting to large a scope for my first project. To mitigate this risk, I have been consulting friends and professionals that have run other successful Kickstarters. This ensures that I stay grounded. My artist are being paid through the Kickstarter and I want to make sure that they are able to be paid fairly on time. The rest of the money will be going towards shipping and production costs.\n\nMy challenges are mainly keeping an open line of communication with the team since we are working remotely.

That's about 4% larger than the normal size of a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\nWe imported the highest-quality puzzle cardboard in the world (1.9mm Eska \"blue\" stock) from the Netherlands and invented some new printing techniques so the pieces snap together and stay snapped\nThese puzzles have been extensively playtested to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible from the moment you open the box to the moment you place the last piece of the last segment\nWhen you're done with the puzzle, everything can be reset and all of the secret compartments close back up with velcro so you can share the puzzle with a friend or solve it again later.\nNo puzzle dust!!\nPuzzle Art\nMost puzzles start with stock art of some trees or cats or something. We wanted each of our puzzles to make a fantastic, tiny world. And we wanted the art to tell a story as you solve it. So we worked closely with independent artists like Sarah Becan, Boya Sun, and Felicia Chiao to create beautiful one-of-a-kind puzzle images loaded with tiny details, story quirks, and easter eggs.\n\"The Happy Isles\" by Sarah Becan\n\"The Mystic Maze\" by Boya Sun\n\"The Sunny City\" by Felicia Chiao\nCustom Dielines\nTo make the magical ending work right, we had to customize the shape of every single piece in all three puzzles. While we were at it, we also made sure that the individual puzzle-piece shapes highlighted the cool art details instead of cutting them in half.\nJigsaw puzzles start as one big piece of cardboard, and then a specially designed cutting tool called a die comes down like a stamp and slices it into a thousand pieces.\nThe die for the \"Happy Isles\" puzzle\nUsually, the tolerance for that slice is about 3mm. But to pull off the magical ending in our Series One puzzles, we needed a 0.5mm tolerance. Nobody had done that before, so we had to work closely with our puzzle factory create new quality-control and die-cutting techniques to make it happen. Some of the roughly 3,000 blades that make up our dies actually had to be precise to within 0.1mm \u2014 30 times more precise than a regular puzzle. \nAn excerpt from Simon\u2019s briefing for the puzzle factory\n One of the nice side effects of making a more precise die and using super high-quality puzzle cardboard is the pieces click together in a really satisfying way and stay together even if you need to move the puzzle.  \n Magical Surprise \nIt\u2019s always exciting to pick up a new puzzle with an image you like and then open the box and start putting together the corners and edges. But after a while, you get to the part of the puzzle where you need to assemble 400 pieces of blurry sky. And then when the puzzle's about 75% done, that feeling of \u201cwhat am I doing with my time\u201d creeps in. Eventually the last piece finally goes in and the puzzle is over. We\u2019ve always found that part a little anticlimactic.\nSo we came up with a whole new way for a puzzle to end. When you place the last piece of what you thought was the end of the puzzle, you unlock a whole new part of the experience \u2014 a final act that includes both a magical illusion and a completion to the puzzle's narrative. We playtested these puzzles hundreds of times with people all over the world to figure out how to make this special ending as clear and engaging as possible, and we hope you're going to love it.\n\"The Happy Isles\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Mystic Maze\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Sunny City\" 1000-piece puzzle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working with our long-time manufacturing partner Ad Magic to deliver these puzzles to you on time.

The title of this book is Komorebi, Japanese for \"sunlight filtering through trees\", which I believe perfectly sums up the magical feeling I want to evoke with my work. I craft detailed illustrations imbued with a hint of magic and nostalgia to tell stories and celebrate my love for nature and Japanese animation. \nAlthough I share my work online, Komorebi is by far the most personal thing I have ever made. Across its pages, this book brings you a collection of the artwork I have created over the last three years, as well as providing insight into my thought processes and workflow. I will be sharing my early influences and personal journey of becoming an artist, and you will also find sketchbook pages, tutorials, and five brand new illustrations that I've created especially for this book. \nI wanted this book to be as beautiful as it can be, and that's why I teamed up with 3dtotal Publishing. I feel a lot better having an expert by my side for a project of this scope. I have The Art of Loish and The Art of Heikala on my bookshelf and I absolutely love them, so I'm really excited that 3dtotal has given me the opportunity to create an engaging and sensitively designed book that showcases my art in the best way possible.\nI hope you consider backing this project and help me make this book become a reality.\nThank you!\n\nBelow are the exclusive items that are available in addition to the book. Some tiers and gifts are limited, so be sure to pledge quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out!\nPlease note that as this is a live project, all designs are examples of content I would like to include but these are subject to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunching this book through Kickstarter allows us to thank those who make this book possible by adding extra stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed high-quality bonus rewards to be given away if the project meets certain targets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch goals are available to all backers from Tier 1 and above. Please note: final designs of items are subject to change.\n\n\n3dtotal publishing is committed to having a positive effect on the environment. From 2020 they have committed to planting one tree for every book they sell by partnering with re-forestation charities. This includes books sold in their Kickstarter campaigns. If you support this campaign we would like to thank you for helping us take on this mission.\n\n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.\nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service, and parcels sent to the rest of the world will be sent with tracked shipping. Due to complications to logistics caused by the Coronavirus, some countries have introduced surcharges to receiving international postage. This is why shipping prices will seem slightly higher for some backers than it has done on our past campaigns.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\n\n\n For those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in September. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\n              As seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time.

Prohibition, the Constitutional ban on the sale of alcohol in the United States, comes into effect.... And business couldn't be better at the Little Daisy Cafe.\nBut things aren't what they seem. Atlas May, proprietor, uses the charming little restaurant as a front for his real cash cow; the Lackadaisy speakeasy, where flashing the club symbol from a deck of cards grants everykitty in-the-know access to more moonshine than they could ever drink. Life is good... Until Atlas is murdered in cold blood.\nNow, it's 1927. Mitzi, Atlas' widow, struggles to keep Lackadaisy afloat, as the patrons drift away and a skeleton crew of staff sticks by her side. Scrappy young musician/rum-runner Rocky Rickaby, his wide-eyed but tightly-wound cousin Freckle McMurray, and the endlessly resourceful and sharp-tongued Ivy Pepper, heiress to the quickly-dwindling Lackadaisy fortune, are forced to make do in a world of increasingly unfriendly competition, intent on shooting, smuggling, and conspiring their way back to a successful bar, against all odds. \nLackadaisy Cats has been running online since 2006, immersing its readership in a world of sepia-toned crime, adventure, action, and comedy. And now, it's ready for its next big move... to a screen near you.\nWhy a cartoon? Why now?\nThere's never been more interest in adult animation, with shows like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and Primal capturing the attention and imaginations of millions of viewers. \nLackadaisy is an exceptional webcomic, but in her mind, Tracy has always pictured it as an animated film. It\u2019s a side effect, perhaps, of a childhood nourished on Looney Tunes, Disney, and Don Bluth features; a dream of sharing that living, breathing, musical version of Lackadaisy with its dedicated readership. But the when-and-how something like that could ever be achieved has always lacked an obvious ingress.\nAs the 20s dawn upon us again, with new animation tools and techniques available, with talented and excited artists on deck an raring to get to work, and with the internet eager for more independently-created media, the auspiciousness seems writ-large - splashed across an art deco picture palace marquee, if you will. \nNow\u2019s the time.\nThe Lackadaisy animated short proposes a 10-minute, fun-and-action-filled adventure, full of car chases, shootout, sass, and  un-requested violin solos. And with your help, we can make it happen!\nThe finished short will be available for everyone to watch!\nMeet the people in charge of (and contributing to) the project! \nA former game dev, illustrator and graphic designer, Tracy Butler began Lackadaisy after researching the history of her century-old Saint Louis home, and being inspired by her love of jazz music and 1920s aesthetics. Boasting over 1,600 backers on Patreon, Lackadaisy has been her full-time job for years, garnering a dedicated readership of thousands. As the creator of the comic, Tracy will play a role as co-director on the animated short, as well as overseeing art direction.\nFable Siegel is a veteran animation professional, boasting a resume that includes Titmouse, Starburns, the internet phenomenon Hazbin Hotel, and two Game Grumps Animated shorts, along with storyboard work for Cartoon Network (Ben 10), Stoopid Monkey (Adam Ruins Everything: Reanimated History), Warner Brothers (Wacky Races), Shadow Machine (F is for Family), and more, as well as being a board artist, animator, and designer for Six Point Harness (Like Share Die).  Brought onto the Lackadaisy animated short as a production manager, director, and producer, they'll be overseeing the project utilizing their years of professional experience and skill.\n Our awesome line-up of talent, in no particular order:\n Michael Kovach  (@kovox) as Rocky Rickaby! \n Belsheber Rusape (@BelRusapeVO) as Calvin \"Freckle\" McMurray! \n Lisa Reimold (@lisareimold)  as Ivy Pepper! \n Ashe Wagner (@TheQueenViking)  as Mitzi May! \nand SungWon Cho (@ProZD) as Mordecai Heller! \nCharacter Design\nTai (@corvidmonster)\n3D Modeling\nZachary \"Newt\" Nall (https://www.noneuclideandesigns.com/)\nStoryboard Artist\nAshley \"Kilomonster\" Green (@AshGMonstrology)\nSound Direction\nM.

Look no further!\nLackadaisy Essentials is the primary means by which we intend to fund the animated short, and Iron Circus Comics' part in this incredibly ambitious project! Planned as a hardcover volume of about 100 pages, Lackadaisy Essentials contains never-before-published minicomics, one-offs, sketches, and other creative work by Tracy, delving into the world and details of the Lackadaisy webcomic.\n Lackadaisy Volumes 1 & 2 ebooks are the collected Lackadaisy webcomic! Grab the tiers including this reward to read the comic offline at your leisure, at a beautiful, high resolution!\nWant to see the finished product in its snazziest, most high-quality form? Back a tier that grants access to an HD download of the finished animated short! The Lackadaisy short will be a fully-polished final product, professionally animated, voice-acted, and scored by musical and animation professionals!\n There's so much that goes into making a cartoon. Storyboards, animatics, a soundtrack, 3D models! Back at the Goodie Bag level and higher to grab all these cool bits 'n' pieces. The perfect backer level for folks who wanna see how the sausage is made. Higher levels even grant special thanks in the credits!\n ALL IN! Really wanna become an indispensable part of the project? Maybe even make animation history? The very highest tiers of support grant in-story cameos, personalized Lackadaisy-sona designs, original art from Tracy and the crew, and MORE. \n There's something available at practically every level of support!\n $85,000 is the minimum we would need to make sure this one-of-a-kind project comes to fruition. But in case we overfund, we already have some awesome plans to make this Kickstarter even better.\n\nAnd our final two stretch goals...\n\nWhatever you may decide, thanks for getting this far down the page, and reading all about this new venture!

Thank you for deciding to click on this link and land on this page. Unfortunately, our campaign has coincided with the Covid-19 outbreak, which makes it a little awkward to be asking for help right now. Thank you so much for supporting the arts during this time and pushing for the stories we need from marginalized groups for our history and cultural growth. Every day we are thinking of our first responders, medical professionals, couriers, grocers, cleaning professionals, and anyone on the frontlines fighting to save lives. Thank you for keeping us safe. Please check in on your loved ones and be kind to yourselves during this crisis. Thank you again for choosing to support our film. Hopefully it can bring you a little sunshine when it's finished.\nWith love, the \"And Then\" team. \nSee all of the unlocked stretch goals below!\nMana and Haru\nAND THEN is a short film about two women who meet in Tokyo and grow closer to each other through insomnia, discovering Tokyo together, and their shared love of art. We are looking to crowdfund the cost of post-production, including editing, music, sound mixing, color grading, festival submissions, possible re-shoots and associated rental and production costs, and other costs to finish the film. The more money we raise, the better the film we can make. Principal filming was done in 3.5 days and finished in February 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. The film and spans across Taito City, Asakusabashi, Asakusa, Shizouka Prefecture, Shinjuku, and Shibuya. The project is led by JENN RAVENNA, a queer Asian-American director and cinematographer with roots in the video game entertainment industry. \nMana wandering the streets of Tokyo alone\nWhile the video will be submitted to film festivals first, the final video will be delivered to backers once the festival season is over at a date to be determined. As the film is currently in-process with an editor, it is also possible the film will be delayed in the event we need to return to Tokyo to film additional scenes, depending on the success of the campaign. Physical rewards will be delivered sooner.\nABOUT AND THEN \nMana and Haru at Shibuya Crossing\nAND THEN is a story about missed connections, loneliness, adventure, longing to be accepted, art, finding purpose, and the possibility of reconnecting with those we've lost touch with. The short film follows Mana, a Japanese-American woman who arrives in Tokyo seeking to find a break from her life as an artist, and Haru, a Japanese woman from the countryside who dreams of becoming an artist herself one day. They meet under unique circumstances, and their story unfolds. It's a story that is not often seen in mainstream cinema: a queer Asian and Asian-American love story.\nMana and Haru\nThe film began as a possible project idea during the director's stay at an artist residency in Tokyo. As the director became more committed to film-making and cinematography, and more aware of the challenges of  representation in narrative cinema, the idea soon solidified into an international independent film production. \nJoin us on this whimsical, serendipitous love story about two women  who find each other on the streets of Tokyo\nMana and Haru at Shinsen Station\nMany of the talent and crew members volunteered their time to the film, as they also believed in the story and the need for more representation on screen. Local Japanese businesses also generously offered their resources and spaces to the production. \nMana and Haru in Shinjuku\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\nCurrently, the film production is entirely self-funded by Jenn Ravenna. So far production costs have totaled over $31,300.\nA breakdown of film production costs already spent for principal filming\n3/12/2020 EDIT: Above diagram does NOT include insurance which was $3,705 alone. This means Jenn put out over $31,300 of her personal savings + available credit to kick-start the film. \nWe are crowdfunding the remaining $15,000 for the same reason we are making \"AND THEN\": to be able to tell our own narratives. Crowdfunding is the best way to ensure that the talent and production team - both in front of and behind the camera - have full control over their story, credited accordingly, and ensuring the work is produced and shared in a timely manner.\nWe are asking for an additional $15,000 for post-production and finishing costs, including editing, music production, color-grading, festival fees, the possible event that we may need to return to Tokyo re-shoot scenes and add pick-up shots, and to relieve Jenn of some  financial burdens accumulated from the production. The more money we raise, the better the film will be.\nMikans - a reoccurring symbol\nShould the Kickstarter become wildly successful, the dream would be to fully recover all production costs, back pay the crew and talent who generously donated their time, contribute to funds to continuing education and film gear for crew members, and to set up a small scholarship fund at ALMOST PERFECT for future creative residents. \n4/8/2020 Update: Estimated Budget Allocation should the Kickstarter reach 100K.\nTHE REWARDS\nNEW TIER: DIRECTOR'S CHAIR will include a custom wooden USB drive with all digital content and the film, plus surprise bonus content.\nCustom USB with the Film!\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Every $65 backer and above will receive a Cosmic Pride Enamel Pin designed by Jenn Ravenna.\nThis was a stretch goal that was unlocked when we reached $55K!\nINSOMNIA PRINT by Elora Pautrat\nMIKAN HARD ENAMEL PIN by Julia Reck\nONE-OF-A-KIND POLAROIDS by Jenn Ravenna\n1/1 EDITION PHOTOGRAPHY MONOTYPES by Jenn Ravenna\nReward items offered at various tiers\nREWARDS BREAKDOWN\n1/1 EDITION PHOTOGRAPHY MONOTYPE TIER OPTIONS\nNEWLY ADDED FINAL 48 HOUR MONOTYPES\nTOKYO SEA OF STARS MONOTYPE by Jenn Ravenna\nABOVE SHIBUYA MONOTYPE by Jenn Ravenna\nSHINSEN II MONOTYPE by Jenn Ravenna\nNIGHT WANDERING MONOTYPE by Jenn Ravenna\nNIGHT WANDERING II MONOTYPE by Jenn Ravenna\nMEMORIES MONOTYPE by Jenn Ravenna\nLUCKY LONELY MONOTYPE by Jenn Ravenna\nNEW PHANTOM SERIES MONOTYPE 3/27\nOriginal Jenn Ravenna photography monotype pieces inspired by Japanese manga, for those who enjoy a blend of illustration and photowork.

I tried extremely hard to keep the September timeline, but the books are not due to arrive until the first week of October. Fulfillment will take 2-3 weeks, which means they should start arriving just in time for all the good spooky vibes!

When the last of the magic orbs that once powered their city is depleted, she faces her fears and embarks on an unexpected journey into the heart of the jungle to save her home.\nAlong the way, Naiya discovers her own self-worth as she and her foxdragon friend navigate the treacherous jungle and learn about her own relationship with the world\u2019s magic.\nAru (left) & Naiya (right)\n Naiya - An independent young teen of 14 years, Naiya loves to spend her time outside. She finds freedom in climbing rooftops and hidden passageways on her errands within the city as a house servant to a spice merchant. Always curious about the greater world, she enjoys learning through books. Naiya has a soft spot for animals, caring for those she finds abandoned in the city.\nAru - A young foxdragon brought to the trade city of Ora, Aru has no recollection of his past. His curiosity and fondness for food can, at times, get him into a bit of trouble. Aru is a loyal friend & companion. \n While Naiya and Aru's story can stand on words alone, the illustrations throughout the book add glimpses into their world for a more immersive experience.\nEach chapter begins with a unique full-page textile pattern, and the following spreads contain a variety of vignette, half and full-page spread illustrations to complement the text.\nThe book is a standard comic book size at 6.625 x 10.5 inches, chosen for comfortable chapter reading as well as an immersion into imagery that flows from page to page. \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\" is 282 pages long, 24 chapters and 78,000 words.\n\nThe outlining stage of \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\", my studio space and a thumbnail sheet of all the pages + illustrations in the book.\nAbout Naomi VanDoren: I am a visual artist and author based in Northern California. For the past six years, I have been working independently as an artist on creator-owned projects like my yearly art books, which I have Kickstarted in the past.\nIn my storytelling, I strive to capture the adventures of my youth in the jungles of Indonesia and pay homage to the beautiful culture in which I spent over 14 years. \"Naiya and the Foxdragon,\" and the tropical world of Antarah in which it takes place, was born out of a desire to fully dive into storytelling and create an immersive world using inspiration from where I grew up. It also was born from a love of the fantasy genre, epic quests that sweep you off your feet and endearing characters you feel a deep connection with.\nIf you're curious about my writing style I encourage you to check out the first chapter of \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\" which takes place 10 years before the rest of the book, when Naiya is still a young child.\nIf you're a fan of the Ghibli films, Avatar the Last Airbender, and even The Hobbit, I think you'll enjoy this book too.\nWhy an illustrated novel? I've loved reading and writing just as much as I love art. Rather than create a book that was art-focused, or heavily writing focused I decided I wanted a book that celebrated both in a way that allowed a reader to escape deeper into the world that I've created.\n This project is going to print as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends!\nI've spent the last 2+ years working on this project so that I can bring you something that is nearly complete and ready for print. As a Kickstarter backer myself, I appreciate creators that are transparent about the status of their projects. In that spirit, here is what has been done with \"Naiya and the Foxdragon\", what is being wrapped up, timelines for printing etc.\nWriting: All of the writing from outlines through the final draft of the book are complete. I've worked with a professional developmental editor twice to perfect the story, run the project through beta readers and had a copy editor proof the book. The only thing that I plan to do in regards to the text is one final round of quick copy editing (1/2 way through already) for that last look as well as adding any words I find to complete the appendix page.\nIllustrations: All of the illustrations have been designed and are in their final form linework-wise. This involved reference gathering, some 3D designs for some of the locations, character design, and lots of time for the composition and inking process - all of which are now complete. I'm going through the bulk of each illustration and adding the final touches of color to each (1/2 way through this process at this point). I estimate this to take 2 weeks while the campaign is live. Check-in on the status here.\nDesign: The full book has been designed from a rough draft to the final draft. While I have a background in graphic design, this book is being handled by a designer that has publishing experience. The only thing that remains in this stage of the project is to typeset the file and export it for print.\nPrinting: I'm working with a printer currently and finalizing files once the campaign is over. I've received a blank sample copy of the paper that will be used with the book along with the cloth for the Special Edition.\nTimeline after the campaign ends: The timeline for the book production begins after this Kickstarter campaign is complete and I receive the Kickstarter payment from the campaign to make the order (which is usually 2 weeks after it ends, on or around the first week in April). Once I receive it, I am able to move ahead with printing. The estimated time for printing is 3 months from handing files over to the printer in April until books being physically at my door in July. I'm allowing a month for shipping your rewards out with the exception of books with remarque sketches which I have allowed for additional time to complete. I will be preparing shipping materials as well as any additional rewards during the waiting period for the books to arrive.\nShipping: Will be collected after the project is complete and the books are printed and ready to ship in or around June or July. Please see more about shipping in the \"Shipping\" section at the bottom of this project page.\nDoes not include shipping. Click on the image to find out more about changing your pledge amount.\nAll stretch goal goodies are for all backers, any tier!\nShipping for this project will be collected after the project is complete and the books are ready to ship. In order to give you the best price for shipping, I've decided to handle shipping after the campaign and through Backerkit. This allows me to better estimate how much shipping will be with a physical sample book as well as not inflate the Kickstarter funding goal which is for printing.\nHere is a shipping table to help you estimate what shipping may cost. I ship artwork internationally frequently however it is impossible to get exact shipping estimates without a finished sample book in-hand.\n*All original paintings will be shipped insured.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the third Kickstarter that I've run. My previous two were designed similarly with a project that was already complete and both were delivered before their estimated due dates. This project is, however, a much larger project. I've done my best to simplify some aspects of it and thought ahead in regards to printing timeline, shipping, packaging etc. I have added some padding in the fulfillment timeline to be able to stay on target.\n\nWhile there are many things I can plan out ahead of time I realize there are always unforeseen circumstances that may arise in regards to working with such a large order of books that are out of my control. I plan to be transparent about the status of the project along the way so backers will be the first to know if anything comes up.\n\nIn order to keep backers up to date on the project, I've included the \"project status\" as well for extra transparency.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you", "descp": "Support the project for no reward, just because it speaks to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "SOFTCOVER - Unsigned", "descp": "Just the softcover book and that's it!\nINCLUDES:\nSoftcover book, unsigned", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["234 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "HARDCOVER - Unsigned", "descp": "An unsigned hardcover book\nINCLUDES:\nHardcover book, unsigned", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["42 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 85 or more", "title": "HARDCOVER - SIGNED +Prints", "descp": "A signed hardcover book along with a single set of three 6 x 8 inch prints.\nINCLUDES:\nHardcover book, SIGNED\nSet of 3 Prints (6x8in)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "SPECIAL EDITION - SIGNED +Sketchbook", "descp": "A signed and numbered special edition hardcover, world building sketchbook and a single print set of three 6 x 8 prints.\nINCLUDES:\nSPECIAL EDITION - Signed & Numbered\nWorldbuilding Sketchbook\nSet of 3 Prints (6x8in)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["74 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "THE FOXDRAGON HOARD - Hardcover Edition", "descp": "A signed hardcover book, the limited edition embelished giclee watercolor print, bookmark, the worldbuilding sketchbook, and both sets of 6x8 inch prints (6 prints total).\nINCLUDES:\nHardcover book, SIGNED\nLimited Edition embellished giclee watercolor print\nBookmark\nWorldbuilding Sketchbook\n2\u00d7 Set of 3 Prints (6x8in)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "THE FOXDRAGON HOARD - Special Edition", "descp": "A signed and numbered Special Edition hardcover book.

You may know me from Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook as Guweiz.\nHowever you found your way here, thank you for taking the time to check out my first Kickstarter campaign to create my first ever art book, Guweiz: The Art of Gu Zheng Wei.\nOver my creative journey, I have created pieces that I am very proud of, and have experienced many wonderful moments that I would love to share. For this reason, with the help and expertise of the great people at 3dtotal Publishing, I am crafting my first book.\nAs well as resulting in an inviting and thoroughly packed book, this campaign also gives me the opportunity to offer my art to fans in another physical form \u2013 as exclusive printed gifts.\nContinue reading to discover more about what hides within the 152 pages of the book, admire the additional items available only during this campaign, and take a sneaky peek at the bonus stretch goal items that you can unlock!\nGuweiz: The Art of Gu Zheng Wei will be beautifully presented in hardback, and will explore my artistic journey, from drawing my first anime portrait at seventeen years old, to developing my own unique urban style of manga and working on big-budget films such as Ghost in the Shell.\nWith an affinity for creating gritty textures and fantastical scenes, I categorize my work into two genres I have endless passion for: \u201cfantasy\u201d and \u201curban\u201d. Within these styles, I explore the magical moments in the everyday and the edgy realism of fantasy realms. Get lost in my world of witches, warriors, and whimsical night shoppers.\nTo learn more about my workflow and thought processes, you will also find in-depth tutorials and discover a dissection of my working mindset and unique techniques. Delve into this book to understand the importance of maintaining a visual library for inspiration and reference, and how utilizing the art fundamentals can offer invaluable improvements to your design skills.\nI would love to be able to share this book with you all, and I hope you might consider backing this project to help it become a reality.\nThank you!\nBelow are the exclusive items that are available in addition to the book. Some tiers and gifts are limited, so be sure to pledge quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out!\nPlease note that as this is a live project, all designs are examples of content I would like to include but these are subject to change.\n\n\nWe have chosen to launch this book through Kickstarter as it gives us the chance to thank those who make this book possible by adding extra stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed four high-quality bonus rewards to be given away if we can meet certain targets.\n\n\n\nStretch goals are available to all backers from Tier 1 and above. Please note: final designs of items are subject to change.\n3dtotal publishing is committed to having a positive effect on the environment. From 2020 they have committed to planting 1 tree for every book they sell by partnering with re-forestation charities. This includes books sold in their Kickstarter campaigns. If you support this campaign we would like to thank you for helping us take on this mission.\n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.\nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will only be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service, and parcels sent to the rest of the world will be sent with tracked shipping.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in July. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\nAs seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time.

Even their gentle priest is unbothered. Palermo has always been a city of differences, after all. Everything changes abruptly when a town member is found dead, with a symbol carved into their forehead and horror on their face. They are only the first of a series of victims that will send the life of the community into panic.\nSicily is a big Italian island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.  This story is based on Sicilian folklore. Palermo, the capital of this island, is where this story is set, a patchwork of architecture and cultures.\n\u201cMa\u2019ari\u201d: this is how Sicilians call \u201cwitches\u201d in their language. On this island the Ma\u2019ari were respected as keepers of knowledge and trustworthy healers.  Many saw them as creatures from \u201cThe Outside\u201d, a world parallel to ours.\nThey could be protectors or they could be enemies: it was up to you to decide what to make of them.\nThey were pretty good at being both.\nAs a Sicilian myself - born and raised in Palermo - it feels like it\u2019s my duty to tell our stories. I can only hope you will love it just as much as I do.\nSomething I also deeply care about is telling stories about the ones whose stories aren\u2019t told very often. We use stories as mirrors, desperately trying to find the one with our reflection in it\u2026 \u2018cause there\u2019s nothing more powerful than finding yourself in a story someone else has told. You feel seen, heard and less alone.\nI like to write about queer characters without necessarily centering the story around their sexuality: they exist, they are queer, but their story could be about magic, friendship, blood, murder or love. For instance: in Ma\u2019ari, it\u2019s about all of the above.\nRead the first 11 pages of issue one HERE\nAfter getting a degree in art, Elisa Bisignano - born in Palermo, Italy, in 1993 - decides that she really doesn\u2019t want to be a painter. Thanks to some good luck she manages to enroll at the \u201cScuola del Fumetto\u201d (School of Comics) of Palermo. She completes the three years and, once finished, creates with her colleagues \u201cEhm Autoproduzioni\u201d, a small indie self-publishing house. She writes and/or draws a few titles, a couple of them in collaboration with other members of the group: \u2018Come le bambole\u2019, \u2018Balloon\u2019, \u2018The Dead Waltz\u2019, \u2018TA\u2019, \u2018Frikis - Episode 4\u2019.\nAs of today she is, thankfully, still not a painter. Her paintings would have been pretty bad.\n\nIolanda Zanfardino is a comic book and cover artist born in Southern Italy in 1988. She graduated with honors from the International comics Academy in Rome in 2015 and soon started working as an artist for Titan Comics and Marvel, and as a writer, artist and colorist in her first Original graphic novel for Lion Forge comics.

Bonus \u201cstretch goals\u201d will unlock if the funding exceeds these goals, giving you more designs to choose from. When the campaign ends, you will be emailed with a form in which you can specify your shipping address and which designs you\u2019d like, corresponding to your pledge tier. \nBackers will be able to add additional pins for the price of $10 each with no extra shipping cost via survey at the end of the campaign!\nDesigns\nEach pin will be manufactured in shiny gunmetal and hard enamel at approximately 1.5 inches. Sizes may vary slightly depending on design.\nLegosi- Unlocked!\nHaru - Unlocked!\nStretch Goals\nThe initial goal for this campaign is a set of two pins, Legosi & Haru, but many more characters can be unlocked via stretch goals!\nOptional Backing cards: $1100 - Unlocked!\nYou will have the option to add backing cards designed for this project to your pins!

This Kickstarter will hopefully satisfy all those who have asked and more.\nIt is our desire to give you all the images you want on limited edition, hand-signed playmats. Already there are 57 different playmats from the last 23 years of Magic unlocked for backers and for the first time ever an official playmat with all 5 Unhinged lands! Scroll down to see this mat and all the others....     \nFor the next target there are 4 more classic images including Urza's Swamp c and 5th Spring Mountain...\nAll of these playmats will be limited edition; limited by the numbers ordered through this project. All of the playmats will be hand-signed in silver or gold by John, following 2 decades of signing John now has a titanium bionic wrist. Our partners Ultra Pro have done an amazing job in beautifully recreating John's work as well as significantly minimizing logos and legal information.  These mats will all look stunning.\nThere are a limited amount of discounted earlybird levels so you might like to jump on one of those now and wait for your favourite image(s) to be added.  We will be using Backerkit after the campaign concludes to ask you which playmat(s) you would like to receive (you will be able to add more beyond your initial pledge). Also via Backerkit, you will be given the opportunity to pick up one of our few remaining Unhinged or Unstable Land playmats at a special price.\n**This will be your only chance to get your favourite image(s) on a playmat!**\nStretch Goals\nPlaymats to unlock at the next stretch goal.. \n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\nPlaymats already unlocked and available... \n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* currently approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n* approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of offical logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of offical logos\n*approved design, pending addition of offical logos\n*approved design, pending addition of offical logos\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of official logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of logos.\n*approved design, pending addition of logos.\nExample of John adding a drawing (he will do this on your choice of playmat unlocked via this project if you backed at the doodle reward level)..

Professionally printed on sturdy 300g/sqm paper with a UV protective coating and autographed in silver ink, they'll come in a protective plastic sleeve and will ship packaged in stable wraparound cardboard. You get to decide how many you want, and which ones!\nNo nonsense - Prints on 300g/sqm paper, signed with silver ink, UV coated, and sleeved.\nHere's the prints you can select from! Once the campaign has ended, you will get a survey for your shipping address and for your choice of prints.

The printing company I work with has proven reliable countless times. I'll also order shipping materials etc. This whole process should take about two weeks, meaning I will start...\nShipping in mid-endOctober! This should take anywhere between two and four weeks if things go normally - I have quite a bit of experience with this stuff by now so I think I'll do just fine.\nThat means that depending where in the world you live, it'll take one to four weeks until you get your prints - that means November!

I started using ink as a young child when my parents gave me lessons in traditional Chinese calligraphy. Some may have found it mind numbing and dull, but I grew addicted to the medium. Over time, the ink brush evolved into the ink pen, and those Chinese characters evolved into fantasy characters. I always make it a goal to participate in communal art challenges such as Inktober and Mermay. It helps provide the fuel of consistent discipline alongside passion.   \nInk is a straight-forward, binary medium- black ink and white paper. With only two hard tones at one\u2019s disposal, it can be difficult to create subtle transitions and softness. Mistakes become stark, and attempts to fix them usually make it worse. The challenge is part of the appeal. My love for ink has me constantly striving to master the medium, and always eager to create.\"\nAndrew Mar on: Instagram \u2022 Facebook \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Artstation\nThe Content:\nThe pages within this book are a collection of ink drawings of the life of my mind, separated by their realms:\nCelestial \u2013 the dominion of angels, of elegance and power, who serve to protect their boundaries.\nTerrestrial \u2013 the mortal lands of warring kingdoms, and those caught between them in forest and sky.\nInfernal \u2013 a dark world of demons, succubi, dragons, and beasts, all scraping to survive and sometimes, even live. \nPelagial \u2013 the abyss of those who only seek company so sparsely found in the void.\nThe Book\nLike all books that I have created with the previous artists, this one is launching finished. We just want to know how many we should print for you guys. This is why we made this campaign\nIt has 284 pages of 150g matte paper and is bound in a hardcover with golden hotfoil stamping in the swashes around the title. The format is A5 and the artwork inside is mostly black and white. The book weighs 2 kg. \nThis is a .gif - wait for it to load\n\nThe 3 Prints \n\n\nThe Original Art\nZoom image\nZoom image\n\nThe Stretchgoals\nOf course there are a couple of stretchgoals for all of you. These will be added to every single tier that is listed in this campaign and you will receive them together with the products you pledged for. Short: All backers get these!\n\nAll stretchgoals unlocked!\n\n\n\nThe Shipping Date \nWe will start shipping the books worldwide starting December 2019. Until the shipping starts you can change your address in the surveys. Here is a helpful article. \nIMPORTANT: Please note that exactly 1 year after the campaigns end we will close the surveys. We will make sure to update you on multiple platforms, write messages here on Kickstarter to remind you, but as a general rule any pledge which still has no finished survey in September 2020 will be seen as a donation. This means those who have not responded to the surveys will lose their claims on their rewards and the pledge for rewards will be seen as a donation to the campaign. The reason is simple: the longer we hold out the more we get charged in taxes, insurance and stock fees.  \nThis is a .gif - wait for it to load.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the content and layout is finished. The only thing that is missing is the actual printed products for which we are running this campaign.\n\nThe fulfillment will be handled by the busy bees at \u00c9ditions Caurette who have great experience in publishing and cheap shipment to buyers of high quality print products. They have been publishing works of artists like Kim Jung Gi, Jesper Ejsing, Karl Kopinski and many more, so we trust their competence and judgement.\n\nShipping of the products will be untracked, except for the highest tier which will have items unique to this campaign and will demand a higher fee to make sure nothing gets lost. In case of problems with the shipping of the other tiers, \u00c9ditions Caurette will be there to answer your questions.\n\nWe don't expect any delays but of course we will update you all if there are

With a female-majority veteran team from the film industry, ALHAMDU is already halfway done after completing principal filming on the West Coast. We are looking to crowdfund the cost of principal filming on the East Coast, as well as post-production. The project is led by MIPSTERZ, a non-profit creative collective that amplifies marginalized creators through film, music, and illustration for the broad audiences ready to hear them. \nWhile the final video will be accessible to all on YouTube, ALHAMDU campaign rewards are exclusive to Kickstarter backers.  \nABOUT \u201cALHAMDU\u201d  \nCOLOR. MUSIC. MUSLIM FUTURISM.\nYou may not acknowledge our past, but you will know our future.\nWhat does an American Muslim future look like? Who gets to decide? Who gets included? \nWe are taking Muslim Futurism, Afrofuturism, and other liberationist ideas, from the spaces of academia and constructing a world where we tell our own stories. A future where Third Culture is the dominant wave, where Muslims exist loudly alongside each other in their found-families. Join us on this surreal, fashion-heavy, and multi-chromatic journey featuring both dynamic portraits and soft emotional stills. This is a bright America that exists tomorrow, shared today. Show the audience that they should have been paying attention all along. \nTexture differentiates the scenes and color tells the story. From the different locations: the Californian desert and grasslands, the concrete jungle of New York; to the exaggerated fashionable aesthetic: street fashion meets your grandma\u2019s closet, old world thobes and flowing hijabs, loud turbans and kufis, clashing patterns, obnoxious colors. Finding the wrong puzzle piece for the right fit.  \n\"Alhamdu\" is the Arabic term for \"Praise be\", Alhamdullilah being an expression of relief, joy, exasperation, etc to Muslims everywhere.\nTHE MUSIC \nThe soundtrack of the video is an original song featuring sounds and words from new Muslim artists. Produced by our very own, Yusuf Siddiquee, \u201cAlhamdu\u201d is best described as an alternative, third-culture hip hop sonic experience. Much like its creators, the song samples a previous generation and remixes it with the poetics of now. A classic Egyptian wedding song is looped and layered with live tabla and darbuka from percussionist extraordinaire Neel Agrawal. LA boom-bap rapper Haseeb the Few  reminds us of days before the \u2018gram, NYC emcee Ahmed El-Naggar ruminates on third-culture kids stuck between worlds, all while an Oakland chorus of voices led by Emily Afton shouts \u201cAlhamdulillah\u201d at the top of their lungs.\nAlhamdulillah, we are out here and unapologetically ourselves.  \n- \nTIMELINE AND BUDGET BREAKDOWN\nCrowdfunding goals are set up based off of costs involved in the 3 stages it takes to create and distribute the work: Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production. They encapsulate everything from location scouting, to paying make-up artists and gear rentals the day of shooting, to film festival fees. \nCosts for production of backer rewards, shipping and fulfillment, and Kickstarter transaction fees have also been accounted for.\nWe are crowdfunding for the same reason we are making ALHAMDU: to be able to tell our own narratives. Crowdfunding is the best way to ensure that the talent and production team- both in front of and behind the camera- have full control over their story, are paid for their efforts, credited accordingly, and ensuring the work is produced and shared in a timely manner. \nClick through for high-res view\n-\nMEET THE TEAM \n-\nTHE REWARDS\nWANT IT DONE RIGHT // DO IT TOGETHER - High Resolution Digital Wallpaper \nInspired by the real landscapes and scenes featured in ALHAMDU.

MIPSTERZ is a curated space for an emerging generation of Muslim creatives, enabling and amplifying our collective voice in the larger public space through film, music, and illustration. We are a creative collective recognizing the power in the minority voice and the broad audiences excited to hear them. \nMIPSTERZ is a home for marginalized creators to build, collaborate, or experiment with diverse folks who share a common connection to a larger tradition. Besides creating original work, we run live events, actively provide mentorship, resources, and carve out positive creative spaces. We have worked with everyone from the popular media, academia, to museums and art spaces to bring our multi-dimensional third-culture inspired voices and stories to the forefront.

While we have a dedicated team of experienced producers, cinematographers, directors, etc we are still shooting outdoors and in several different locations, each with their own set of variables out of our control.

I work as an illustrator, and my passion is painting fantasy ART. I get to do that for some amazing projects, including Magic: the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, Star Wars, Hearthstone, Game of Thrones, and Lord of the Rings. \nIn 2018, I created a treasure token for my Patreon supporters. A card token is a marker that a player uses during gameplay to represent something, such as a creature, that isn\u2019t already represented by a normal card in the game. My treasure token since evolved into the Treasure Skull, which I want you to enjoy as wearable art. \n\nartist render of pin design\nEach, hard-enameled, gold pin will be securely backed for safe travel. Each pin has two backing points and military rubber backings, so your pin will stay put and not spin in circles.\n\"Each Treasure Skull is lucky for whoever has it now, but not so lucky for whoever had it first.\"\nEach pendant is crafted from powdered bronze and resin, with each gem hand set by sculptor David Lee Pancake. The pendant is two inches wide and 2.25 inches long. The chain is 18-inch, antique bronze. \nIt's perfect for your next gala or gaming night.\nThe Treasure Skull brooch is the same size and made of the same, fine materials as the pendant. Adorn your finest outerwear with the pin-backed brooch while on your way to a feast or cosplay party.\nI wanted a smaller, precious piece for the collection, befitting the setting of stones found in real treasure, so I reached out to metalsmith Olivia Gobert-Hicks. Every step of the process was exciting to see unfold. She first created a wax sculpture of the skull, followed by a production sample mold for the casting house to create my stunning precious metal versions.\nThe Treasure Skull precious metal pendant shown is the production sample cast in pewter. Your pendant will be cast in either sterling silver or gold-plated sterling. Each of the five gems are two millimeter long hand set in the 1\" x 1.25\" pendant.\nEach pendant comes with a FREE 18-inch chain. Giving you the opportunity to wear the pendant right away while you find the perfect chain to suit your style and budget. \nOlivia has tons of options available.\nIf you're in love with it now, get ready, because it only gets better. Each pendant comes in a black felt jewelry box.\nStore your dice in the Treasure Skull dice bag. Or, use it to hold your Treasure Skull collection.\nEach bag features a Treasure Skull printed on microfiber exterior and boasts a soft, interior lining.  It measures approximately 6.5 by 8.5 inches.\nKeep your precious items free of fingerprints and smudges. Perfect for your glasses or cell phone, too.\nEach cloth measures approximately 5.5 by 6.5 inches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADD ON TO YOUR BACKER PLEDGE\nPress \u201cManage Your Pledge.\u201d If you have not backed this project yet, it will say \u201cBack This Project.\u201d\nIncrease your pledge in the Pledge Amount Box by the total price of the add-ons you would like to add. For example, add $10 for a pin.\nDo not change the tier you are currently pledged at unless you would like to change it. If you do, you will also need to add the add-ons amount to the new tier.\nOnce the Kickstarter ends, you will receive a survey asking how you want the add-on money assigned. I'll use Backerkit to make this process easy.\nI was excited to have the opportunity to team up with these amazing creatives to turn my ideas into reality. I can't thank them enough for their skill and creativity.\n\nAaron Miller is a professional illustrator from Chicago, Illinois, USA. Specializing in the fantasy/sci-fi genre. Featured projects; Magic: the Gathering, Star Wars LCG, Dungeons & Dragons, and many more. \nMouthy metalsmith. Hillary campaign staffer turned MTG cosplayer. Sometimes wins commander games.\nOlivia sculpted the precious metal pendant.\nDavid Lee Pancake\u2019s sculptures grace homes and business all over the world. David is an entrepreneur, avid reader, science fiction and fantasy aficionado, arm chair philosopher, and science nut, but his first love is art.\nDavid sculpted the brooch and pendant.\nTawny Fritz is a Colorado-based artist who specializes in clean and intricate ink drawings as well as vibrant ink and watercolor paintings. She is also a specialty and guest speaker at events, focusing on encouraging creatives to go after the life they want. \nTawny worked on the line drawing for the enamel pin.\nThe Orcish Librarian is a Boston-based writer, book-eater, and cosplayer. He supports his crippling dictionary habit by working in video game development and was once voted \"Most Valuable Customer\" for ten years running by the Greater Boston Paper and Pulp Trade Association. In his spare time, he enjoys reading, gargling, and keeping at least 500 feet away from public libraries. He also wants to give a shout out to Dios Revoredo for his dapper avatar.\nThe Orcish Librarian wrote some of the story text above.\nMei Jung \"MJ\" Scott is a freelance writer born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, USA. MJ wrote card names and flavor for over a dozen Magic sets, beginning with Theros. Also an accomplished cosplayer, experienced \"cool Mom,\" and human rights advocate, MJ enjoys reading fantasy, watching anime, writing fanfic, and singing country when it's time to purge their brain of reality.\nMJ wrote some of the story text above.\nYour survey will be powered by Backerkit. You'll have a lot more control over your survey, your shipping address, and have a ton of additional add-ons to check out after the campaign has ended. \nSHIPPING:\nEach reward and/or add-on increases the weight of shipping, making it difficult for Kickstarter's platform to tabulate. I've decided the best solution is to use BackerKit to calculate shipping. It's very easy! Check out the chart below to gauge shipping costs. I'll send you a survey, confirm your address, and pay for the shipping.  I'm doing all that I can as a small business to keep your shipping costs equal to or below my costs. \nYou can expect postage per item to be about $5 USD Domestic and $10- $15 USD International, depending on your country. I learned a lot from the last campaign about shipping international and will try my best to keep the customs cost down or none at all for you by shipping items as a gift, which the rewards essentially are (I cannot guarantee against your country's additional customs fees.)\n\nNote:\nIf you back this project, make sure you have the correct email address listed in your KS account because that is the ONLY way I will be able to contact you after the end of this campaign to get you your rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk I'm taking is the shipping date for the brooch and pendant.

I'm Amanda, an artist and illustrator residing near Boston, MA. You can view my work at  www.amandatulacz.com and follow me on instagram @amanda.tulacz. This is my  first enamel pin kickstarter and I'm excited to make it a reality with your support!\nLife in Death is a collectible enamel pin set inspired by the cosmic, yet fleeting nature of existence. \nBacking card designs subject to slight changes\nThey should arrive to you just in time for halloween!\nAll of the pins will come with:\n two backing posts\n mounted on double sided backing cards\n black rubber backers.\n***Back now and pay later! You will only be charged if the campaign reaches its funding goal.*** If the project doesn't reach its goal, your card won't be charged at all. Pledges can be adjusted at any time during the campaign!\nAlso, please don\u2019t wait for your favorite design to be unlocked! If you do, it may never happen. \nEarly bird tiers: add $12 per pin to your pledge if you'd like to order more pins.\n\nThe initial pins that you will unlock are: \nDuality Ravens - \u201cThe dance between darkness and light will always remain\u2014 the stars and the moon will always need the darkness to be seen, and the darkness will just not be worth having without the moon and the stars.\" Unlocked at $700. \n1.75\u201d diameter, rose gold metal \nPlease note - each pin in this set is separate and counts as one individual pin.

This includes manufacturing fees and shipping from the factory. All remaining funds raised will be used for shipping to backers, materials, and fees. Excess funds will be used for the production of more pins and stickers. The buffer will be used to cover any additional or unexpected costs.\n\nTIMELINE\nOnce the project is funded, surveys will be sent out to backers to select their pin choices. Once the surveys are complete it will take roughly 1-2 weeks for me to receive funds from the campaign. After the funds are received, the pins will be ordered. It will take 3-4 weeks to receive the pins from the manufacturer, and orders will be promptly shipped out once pins are received. Assumed pin arrival date will take around 2-3 months from the end of the campaign. I expect the pins to be shipped out around mid-August to mid-September.\nMid-June - Campaign launches\nMid-July - Campaign ends and surveys are sent out\nEnd of July - Funds are received and pins are ordered from the manufacturer\nMid-Late August - Pins are received and shipped out to backers. \nEarly - Late September - Pins are received by backers. Please allow additional time for international shipping.\n\nWant to support the campaign, but can't back it? No problem! Sharing on social media will help just as much. All shares are greatly appreciated! Be sure to tell your friends :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI will be sending the designs off to a pin manufacturer once funds are received. The designs may be tweaked to ensure the best outcome for the clarity and quality of the pin molds, but I will be sure to keep everyone updated on the final results.\n\nColor on the manufactured pins may appear different than what you see on your screen due to your monitor display settings. All of the pins have been designed with the color palette required by the manufacturer (Pantone+ Solid Coated), so the colors shouldn't vary too much from the original designs. The colors are hand mixed at the factory, so slight shifting in color may occur.\n\nShipping delays may occur if the design needs some minor edits, or if any errors happen during manufacturing. I will be sure to keep everyone informed of any delays.\n\nPrints and original drawings will be sent along with the pins once the pins arrive from the manufacturer. Prints may be delayed should I find any errors or damaged prints in the printing process.\n\nAgain, I'll be sure to keep everyone updated regarding any delays, and feel free to ask any questions!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "1 Enamel Pin", "descp": "Choose any 1 of the unlocked pin designs.\nINCLUDES:\n1 Enamel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "2 Enamel Pins", "descp": "Choose any 2 of the unlocked pin designs.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 42 or more", "title": "3 Enamel Pins", "descp": "Choose any 3 of the unlocked pin designs.\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "2 Enamel Pins + Signed Art Print", "descp": "Choose any two pins from the unlocked designs, plus one 8x10\" signed art print of your choosing!

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having a seventeen year record of delivering over ninety books of the highest quality. I've run ten previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Jeffrey Alan Love, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over ninety books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before.

Our first 2 books touched briefly on the character design process, but this new book is a really deep dive into the art. Character design is such a vast field, which is why it needs it's own focused, indepth book. \nWe're working with an amazing line up of incredible industry PROFESSIONALS, and the book is jam-packed full of their combined experience, gained over their long careers. \nDesign Example - Unofficial Cover\nDesign Example - \"Character Archetypes\" Chapter\n The Goal! \nOur goal is to help YOU be a better artist and have fun at the same time! We want to provide you,  both hobbyists and pros, with a better understanding of the WHOLE character design process. Most importantly, the book gives you the tools you need to produce unique and memorable characters. \nThe techniques and tutorials included in the book help build your confidence and strengthen your knowledge of the art of character design, enabling you to successfully design for any project, and most importantly, in any style. And that's why we have such a wide array of artists with varying styles contributing to book! \nThis is a book that we have dreamed of making for a long time and it is our biggest project to date. We're making a book that you'll love and cherish for your whole drawing career. YOU will love every page or else you'll get your money back!

Posted uncensored, their work has led to blocked profiles, deleted images, and platform bans,  creating an industry stigma around the subject that artists are now cautioned to avoid. #hardcover is taking a stand; publishing explicit artwork created by established professionals who believe in the freedom to explore our sexuality and humanity through art. With artists like Kim Jung Gi, Sara Pichelli, Bastien Lecouffe Deharme, Daniela Uhlig, Bel\u00e9n Ortega, Even Mehl Amundsen, Gerald Parel and many many more, this book promises to be one of a kind!\nWe opened the entry phase for the second book #hardcover2. You can submit your work under this link: https://upload.hardcoverart.com/\nEven here on Kickstarter, promoting a book celebrating sexuality and the human form, we cannot show you the beautiful art contained within. We share the sentiment of sadness as we have no other option. The campaign would get rejected for anything but extremely cropped images, to a level where showing them defies the purpose of their creation. Check out the edited previews and let your imagination complete the picture, for now\u2026\n\n\nMost of the artists contributing to #hardcover haven't published any adult art until taking part in this project, which makes this volume an exclusive window into their intimate thoughts. We wanted the artists to be free to create any content without boundaries, so the book contains expressions of all sexualities - and we wouldn't want it any other way. The book will be bound as a black hardcover (duh!) and have 160 pages of content. \nWe have the work of over 120 artists in this project. The cover will feature a copper-foil logo, and we have a Kickstarter-exclusive tier that adds a sketchbook that is showing alternative work, processes and sketches, and also includes a slipcase.  \nThis is a project that was built together with a lot of democratic decisions, pushing the limits of everyone's creativity, even outside the creation of the works themselves. As such, every artist will be compensated with a part of the profit. We want to be clear that by supporting this project you are also directly supporting the artists.  As the publisher of artists like Kim Jung Gi, Karl Kopinski, Jesper Ejsing, Claire Wendling and the Superani Group, \u00c9ditions Caurette has a wealth of experience in fulfilling books like this and making sure they arrive safely at every backer's home.\nIn case you don't have a credit card to back the project, please reach out to us on orders@hardcoverart.com\n\nDuring the campaign we will be having a contest! You can win a stack of artbooks!

The character(s) must be depicted interacting with our book in some way. It can be read, burned, sit on a stack of it, or just thrown in the corner, but it must be visible that it is #hardcover.\nPost your piece on social media with the hashtag #hardcovercontest and make sure that it has the format A4 (210x297mm) in 300dpi, RGB and as a JPG in portrait format. Send your finished piece to contest@hardcoverart.com. Entries that arrive after the campaign's end cannot be considered for winning. \nYou don't have to be a backer to participate.

Every reward backer who has pledged for 1 pin or more gets the Kickstarter Exclusive Kitsune Mask pin completely free! Check out the 'Stretch Goal' section for more information!\nHi, I'm Kayleigh! Thanks for checking out my 2nd Kickstarter project! \nThe key theme of this project surrounds Japanese festivals. All of the pin designs are based around different icons that I have seen at temples and shrines during festivals, such as Daruma dolls at New Years, and the ubiquitous Lucky Cat. I have intertwined this with a starry night sky aesthetic as I always loved visiting these festivals after dark, feeling buzz of excitement and seeing the sky lit up by fireworks. The last key theme is cherry blossoms, with both plum and light pink sakura represented, as it was always my goal to visit during this really special and fleeting season. What I've essentially done is created a set of eight pins that represent my perfect festival, which I hope you will also love too. \nAbove are the three designs that are automatically unlocked when this Kickstarter hits it's goal of \u00a3900! These will all be between 2.5/3cm in height, cast in gold-coloured metal with hard enamel colours, and will feature a butterfly-clip back! \n1. This represents a type of Japanese amulet called Omamori. They're often made of fabric and feature scripture on the front detailing the type of good fortune it brings. \n2. The Lucky Cat, or Maneki Neko. I'm sure you've seen these incredibly popular little kitties!  It's right paw is raised to bring good fortune in the form of wealth!\n3. A paper fan, inspired by the kind often used in traditional dancing! \nEDIT! - Every reward backer who has pledged for 1 pin or more will get the KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE Kitsune Mask enamel pin! Pictured in the campaign banner. The kitsune fox mask is often seen at shrines, with some even being dedicated solely to these creature! Foxes were seen as messengers for the god Inari, and Kitsune can be good or evil depending the situation! This enamel pin was added on as an extra stretch goal to say thank you to everyone who has pledged! \nFirst stretch goal is unlocked! This is a Daruma doll, often seen around New Years festivals. You colour in the first eye when you set a goal you wish to achieve for the year, and then you colour the second eye when you have completed it!\nSecond design is unlocked! This is an Ema, a wooden plaque that is often seen at shrines. Sometimes you can buy them with printed designs, but you'll normally see them clustered together with different prayers left on them. You can normally write your own too!\nThird design is unlocked! Lanterns are seen all over Japan, from welcoming visitors into festivals through to inviting guests into restaurants. There are even festivals held around the country surrounding lanterns themselves!\nFourth design is unlocked! This one depicts an origami crane; this is a symbol of hope in Japanese culture, and it's said that you wish will come true if you fold 1000 origami cranes. This is also a homage to the first enamel pin I created, which will be discontinued after this Kickstarter (you can see it further down the page!).\nFinal design is unlocked! This one is of a Japanese Koban coin; these coins date back to Japan's feudal era and are now often seen being held by Maneki Neko (lucky cats) to bring luck in the form of wealth or as little charms. This design features the main phases of the moon along with the cherry blossoms. This design will look like an amulet or charm as it will mostly be gold! You may also recognise this coin from the character Meowth in Pokemon. \nORIGINAL TEXT!\nAh yes, stretch goals. If this Kickstarter reaches it's initial funding goal, there are five stretch goal targets to hit that unlock five more Japanese Festival designs! Each will be revealed when the target that precedes it is hit! \ne.g. The first stretch goal design will be revealed once the Kickstarter is funded, and the second design will be revealed once the first goal is funded, etc.\nSo it's very simple, you get to choose from the unlocked pin designs for your reward! \nExample 1: We unlocked 3 designs and you pledge for 2 designs, you get to choose which 2 you want.\nExample 2: We unlocked 4 designs and you pledge 5 designs, you get to choose from the unlocked 4 designs, so you can choose doubles of certain designs.\nRemember, the funding does not go through until the project time is finished. So you can alter your pledge at any time, so you can add on a pin for a stretch goal design if you like it! \nI have a limited number of First Come, First Served rewards which offer a little bit of money saved, these are limited to 5 per reward.\nIf I come up with any more stretch goal ideas then I'll update ASAP on here with the details! On my last project we ended up adding another pin after all of the stretch goals were met which became a Kickstarter backer exclusive! \nIf you have any questions about the above, please let me know! \nThis handy little pie chart gives you a quick idea of the cost breakdowns that have to be considered with this project.   \nMARCH - Kickstarter launches! \nAPRIL - Kickstarter ends! The funds take roughly 2-3 weeks to arrive on my end so I'll send out surveys as soon as I can!\nMID-LATE APRIL - Send out surveys to you guys, so you can choose which pins you want! Then I put in the pin order! The pins take roughly 1-1/2 months to produce.\nJULY - I will receive the pins! I check every single one to make sure they're in perfect condition.

Thank you for checking out my campaign. Following the success of my previous Kickstarter campaign, and after receiving multiple requests from fans and players to launch a new one, I've decided to do exactly that. I'm offering all new playmats and prints featuring my latest work, in exchange for donations towards my feature film project called KIN Fables: The Stolen Child.\nFor newcomers, my name is Seb McKinnon and I've been illustrating for Magic the Gathering since the M13 core set. For a full catalogue of my works, I invite you to check out this link here. \nAnd if you haven't seen it already, I highly recommend this video essay from Rhystic Studies exploring my work for MtG.\nI also direct films and videos through my production company, Five Knights productions, and I make music under the name CLANN.\nWhat's so special about these playmats/prints?\nI'd like to offer you something special. Here's how I'm doing that for you: \n Limited Edition - This will be a one-time printing only. In other words, once this campaign is done, I will never reprint these playmats or prints again. EVER. The amount I produce will depend on the demand. For example, if 100 people pledge for a Bedevil print, there will be only 100 produced (for playmats however, I need to print in increments of 50). \n Minimal Logo presence on the playmats! The Planeswalker symbol and Wizards of the Coast and Ultra-Pro logos are mandatory on official playmats. No way around it. However, Wizards of the Coast, Ultra-Pro and I worked together to make the logos as unobtrusive as possible for you, looking more like watermarks in placed in 2 corners of the mat.\n  Signed playmats and prints for everyone! \n These items have purpose. 100% of all funds raised during this campaign go towards funding my film (after shipping and playmat/print production costs). \n Unique, extended artworks - To avoid cropping of any kind, I have painted expansions to each artwork. This way, the art you love remains whole, and you still get a playmat with art that reaches all the way to the edges! Take a look at the example below. \n\n\nTEAMING UP FOR THE SHIPPING PROCESS\nTo help me take care of shipping, I've teamed up with the wonderful people at HitPoint Press, the team behind Cubeamajigs, Cardamajigs, The Deck of Many and soon Humblewood, so you know you are in really good hands!\nWe are offering 2-5 day expedited shipping with tracking with Fedex, and regular post to P.O. Box addresses. \nPLEASE CHECK THE F.A.Q. FOR MORE INFO ON THIS CAMPAIGN! :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've gone through all this before and have learned a lot from the last campaign, so this one should run even smoother! The only risk is a longer waiting time for your items due to circumstances out of my control. For playmats, Ultra-Pro needs an 8 week production time. Which means that when this campaign ends, I will need all backers to answer the surveys as soon as possible and choose their artworks, so that I may send that information to Ultra-Pro. So if we move quickly together, you could possibly get your packages in July. I added 2 months for safety in case of hiccups, which explains the September delivery date. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to send me a private message, or leave a comment! \n\nThank you all! \n-Seb\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 25 or more", "title": "Donate and own the film!

I am a designer that truly has a passion for pins.  They give life and purpose to what would otherwise just be little sketches in my book that no one would ever see.  With your help these tiny works of art can serve their true purpose of inspiring those who see them and helping people express themselves.  \nThank you for helping me bring magic into the world one design at a time.    \nLast January I had a campaign for a Black Bird pin design, and that design became one of my favorite pins!  It had mysterious feel about it and a striking look thanks to the rhythm of the line-work in the wings.  \nSince then black birds have been a commonly sketched subject for me.  One year later, I am ready to share some related designs I have been working on and to build on that aesthetic and subject matter through a series of pins I am calling Black Feathers!  And don't worry, the original black bird pin is available as a reward for those who missed out on it the first time around!\nDesigns Insights\nEach design is made with hard enamel and silver colored metalwork.  They each have two post/rubber clutches on the back to hold them securely in place and prevent spinning.  \nEncircled - Unlocked!\nThis design is 1.5 inches wide and features several open cutouts.  This noble, yet mysterious bird haunted my sketchbook for many months until I finally got it to look how I wanted.  I absolutely love this design and cannot wait to see it come to life!\nShielded - Unlocked!\nThis design is 1.5 inches tall and was originally designed as part of a series of celestial guardian pins that I am considering releasing in the future.  His keen eye is ever watchful over you, lending you the ancient wisdom of his kind when you need it most.\nMoon Flight - Unlocked!\nThis design is 1.5 inches wide and is the inspiration for this project.  This design was originally Kickstarted in January of 2018 and remains one of my favorite designs.  For me it represents freedom as his flight traverses the moon.  \nBlack Feather - Unlocked\nThis design is ~2 inches from tip to tip.  I have always loved the aesthetic of feathers.  Whether they were loose feathers found on walks, or stately looking writing quills, I just love them.  I tried to embrace a feather's elegant simplicity in this design.  \nFated - Unlocked!\nThis design is 1.5 inches tall and 1.75 inches wide.  I am an avid gamer and love to show my support for the table top community.  This beautiful, yet fearsome bird has found an enchanted D20.  Shall he roll for your fate?  For those of you who are not gamers, perhaps he has happened upon a beautifully cut amethyst?\nLeft Wing and Right Wing - Unlocked!\nEach of these designs is ~2 inches from tip to tip.  I have seen many others do their take on feathered wings.  What I find so interesting is the huge diversity in how they look.  Some are very realistic, others are heavily stylized.  I was going for something in between.  A primary goal I had in designing these was to make sure the rhythm of the feathers 'felt' right to me when I looked at them.  I am very sensitive to minor variations in things like this and I spent a considerable amount of time making tiny little adjustments that most people will never notice, but in the end I achieved a design that satisfied my inner sense of harmony.   Please note that the Left Wing and the Right Wing are considered two separate pins so you would need to pledge for two pins to get a set.   \nWand Keeper - Unlocked!\nThis design is just shy of 2 inches from wand tip to tail feathers.  The Wand Keeper is the head of a bird council who are interested in advancing the magical arts among birds.  Sure they have had to 'borrow' a few things to get the job done, but they fully intend to repay those who have 'donated' to their cause.  \nEbon Gryphon - Unlocked!\nThis design is ~1.75 inches from wing-tip to toe.  Don't let the dark feathers fool you, this noble creature is as pure as any of his kind.  Gryphons of all kind symbolize strength, courage, and leadership.  His pose was inspired by the 'rampant' attitude which gryphons are often seen in in European heraldry.\nKnowledge - Unlocked!\nThis design is 1.5 inches tall.  I woke up one morning with most of this idea flitting around my head.  I put down a rough version in my sketch book but when I looked at it I felt like it was incomplete.  A while later the idea to hang a key around his neck came to me and when I added that element it was like the entire piece just clicked into place.  This piece screams symbolism to me, but I do not know what it means.  Whatever message it speaks to you is for you.  \nKing - Unlocked!\nThis design is 1.5 inches tall.  I have always had a love of playing card art, especially the court cards.  I can remember as a child flipping the king of clubs over and over to see if they had made any mistakes in his mirrored art.  I really wanted to play with that classic look and this seemed like a great opportunity.\nQueen - Unlocked!\nThis design is 1.5 inches tall.  What would a king be without his queen?  This design posed an interesting challenge.  First I had to make sure the design felt different than the king, but also they needed to compliment each other and feel like they were of the same world.  Second I needed to find ways to suggest ideas of femininity.  The Queen design easily took twice as long (if not longer) than the king.  \nT-Shirt Add-ons\nTo celebrate this project hitting over 100 backers I took my two favorite of the pin designs and will be having t-shirts printed for myself.  \nIf you want a t-shirt too you can add $25 to your existing pledge for each shirt you want. They are unisex  (mens) sizes XS through XL  I will get the details (what size and design you want) from you in the backer survey at the end of the campaign.  If you have any questions please send me a message!\nMockup of t-shirt designs.\nAbout Frost Dragon Designs, LLC\nMy name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.  \nI am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins.  \nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.  \nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.  \nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time. There could be production issues that are beyond my control that could impact the delivery date. Also minor changes in the design may occur to prevent manufacturing problems, but these will only be made if it is absolutely necessary and every effort will be made to preserve the original aesthetic.\n\nAdditionally, though shipping logistics could always potentially be a problem, I have reliably shipped thousands of pins via USPS.\n\nIf any issues arise I will be sure to notify backers.\n\nPlease note that everyone's monitors display images a little differently.

If we do not reach our goal, you will never be charged. You can change your pledge at any time, reduce or add on rewards. For any questions about managing your pledge, please see the FAQ and / or contact us. We are always happy to help.\nGreetings! We are Three Muses Ink, a trio of indie artists and authors. Friends since grade school, we express through writing, artwork and all things creative, forming our own independent publishing company and art house located in Anchorage, Alaska. \nOver 2018 year we've grown from just art and books, to creating enamel pins, able to create our art collections with the help of Kickstarter and amazing backers who believed in our art. \nThe project this year is to do some work inspired by the beautiful place we live and create in, Alaska. We have several books and art projects planned, and we are starting with this set of large, hard enamel art pins in the theme of Alaska's plant and wildlife coupled with lanterns. \nWe are known as the Land of the Midnight Sun, but that is coupled with long dark winters. Lanterns and light are a part of being an Alaskan to get us through those dark snowy times.\nInstagram - @3MusesInk\nWebsite - www.3MusesInk.com\nThe $900 is to fund the creation of 4 hard enamel pins depicting some of the favorite animals and plants from Alaska.\nShould we reach our goal, we have 3 additional pins that can be unlocked as the campaign grows.   \nWe offer a special discount for Kickstarter backers. \nThe Early Bird and Full Set tiers offer the BEST, lowest prices. The regular Kickstarter price is still lower than the retail price. After the campaign, these will be for sale at our website at regular retail prices. \n Should we reach our goal, these stretch goals can be unlocked as the campaign grows.   \nFAQ\nAdding Pins\nHow do I add pins from this Kickstarter to my pledge? \nTo add pins to your existing pledge, you need to add your pledge manually.

We are always happy to help. \nWebsite Add Ons:\nIf you would like to add any of our other pins from out website or past pin campaigns, please message us here at Kickstarter. We can add any of our pins listed at our website shop to your pledge to save you on shipping and to help fund this Kickstarter.\nFor collections and prices, please visit our website www.3MusesInk.com\nThree Muses Ink Website Shop\nOur funding goal of $900 will be used to cover the following:\nPins, backing card, plastic bags, and rubber pin backs - 60% \nShipping & postage, labels, bubble mailers - 30% \nKickstarter Fees -10%\nOnce the project is funded, a backer survey will be sent to each backer, allowing you to select which pins you would like from the unlocked designs. \nAll surveys must be completed within 5 days of campaign\u2019s close date.

We don\u2019t anticipate this being an issue, as our vendor has done similar projects.

I've always been a big RPGer ever since RPG games were paper and pencil and included games like Dungeons and Dragons. My favorite thing was creating a character and coming up with all the stats. I would also always draw my character in dragon form and would normally picked a druid or ranger as my class. Later when MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) became a thing, I was hooked. From EverQuest to Guild Wars 2, I played just about all of them. \nBeing a huge fan of RPGs, I thought it would be cool to take some of my dragon designs and make them into a set of enamel pins. \nEach pin will be done in soft enamel and be about 2\" across or tall at the widest area. \nWhy soft enamel? I've done both hard enamel and soft enamel in the past. Unfortunately, the hard enamel process of polishing the pin flat losses some of critical details. I may add hard enamel as a stretch goal later.  Check out the link to my video showing the difference between hard enamel and soft enamel. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JH05JgI6Mk\nAll designs are unlocked!! 11 Different Dragon Designs & 4 color variants for the Dungeon Master Dragon!! \nFirst Pin Design: \nWhy the healer?

Customs and duties charges are not included in the shipping fees and are a responsibility of the buyer. \nAnd remember there is no added shipping cost no matter how many pins you get! \nInternational customers, you pay one flat shipping fee no matter how many pins you add! \nAll items are shipped with First Class Mail, and insurance is not included. Buyers may upgrade to Priority Mail which includes insurance, upgrade is $7.20 for domestic or $25 for international (I sorry it's so expensive but I have no control over the USPS prices). Or insurance can be added for $3 for domestic and an additional $5 for international shipments. Just add the amount to your pledge and let me know so I can make a note of it. \nIn the case of a lost shipment. Please understand that is the shipment does not get to you but the tracking number shows as delivered, there is nothing we can do, unless you purchased insurance. This should not be an issue but in the unforeseeable case that it does happen you must take it up with your local post office.

I strongly urge my international backers to be aware of any potential customs fees or taxes their country may  apply. \nTimeline\n If I meet my goal, Kickstarter will hold the funds for 14 days.  After it's processed and released I'll pay our manufacturer to produce Spooky. Here's what the timeline looks like! \nApproximately 45-60 days for production\n  Approximately 14 days to arrive to PlanetPlush via air shipping\n  2 weeks to ship to backers!

It's Cat here! I wish I could say I'm a graduate designer, or an insta-famous artist, but I'm merely a high schooler with a BIG dream. My name is Catherine Tang, and here's my story. :)\nGrowing up, art was always something respected in my household, but not valued half as much as math or science. Though I loved my art classes, I soon had to stop to pursue \"more important\" things. \nBut even though I couldn't take classes anymore, I continued to pursue my passion in other ways... decorating my room with DIYs, paintings, and dried flowers... painting my jeans one night at 3am. Then, a major milestone occurred: I started Bullet Journaling. \n I post my spreads on @catandcreate, and though my community is small (I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!), it's my creative outlet and way to keep track of my art and progress.\nNow, as much as I love art, I genuinely love math and science too! (Yep not an English person.) STEM stands for: Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. I realized that Art and STEM shouldn't be viewed as mutually exclusive; in fact, my creativity HELPS me in my pursuit for these fields!\nAs a girl who loves math, and feels that more girls should be confident and given the chance to embrace their love for STEM, I wish to empower females in the pursuit of STEM through my designs, and show the literal integration between the three:\nNow with enamel pins, you can express your beliefs, or simply \"wear\" the art you love; I own quite a few myself! Thus, from my love for both fields and my random doodles (scroll down to see!), came this CRAZY IDEA to sell my OWN PINS, SO HERE I AM!  \nI hope to spread positive messages with the AWARENESS and REPRESENTATION raised through this project! \n *Now every pin comes with a FREE stretch goal sticker!!!*\n(SCROLL DOWN FOR UNLOCKED 7TH PIN DESIGN!!)\n \u2666  As the title suggests, the designs integrate the \"Nerdy\" and the Aesthetics\n\u2666  All pins are Hard Enamel with Gold Plating & comes with 2 Metal Clutches\nWhether you support this cause, or simply like my designs (which I really hope you do), please consider buying a pin or two for yourself OR a friend!! \nIt will really mean a lot, and though I am young, I promise that I will dedicate my 120% in executing this project. I poured blood, sweat, and tears (okay slight exaggeration), a total of three months, and many hours at boba stores into the designs.

'Welsh Monsters & Mythical Beasts' is an 89 page illustrated guide containing numerous creature profiles and legends accompanied by detailed ink and watercolour illustrations.\nDigital product mock-up.\nMy name is Collette and I'm a full time freelance fantasy illustrator from Wales, a modern Celtic nation situated on the lower West coast of the British Isles. I grew up surrounded by the stunning countryside, dramatic landscapes, legends of King Arthur, dragons and tales of mysterious creatures that inhabited the land. Over the years I built a career through my art and have been heavily influenced by Welsh culture and inspired by fantasy, nature and ancient mythologies from around the world. \nSamples of inside pages.\nYou may have heard of the Red Dragon (Ddraig Goch) featured on the national flag of Wales, but sadly here in Wales many of our other legends and mythical creatures are being forgotten over time. I felt so sad to see my culture loosing such an amazing array of stories and creatures, so it  became my mission to bring them back to the forefront of Welsh culture and introduce them to a new generation and share our rich mythology with the world.\nY Ddraig Coch - The Red Dragon\nSPECS:  \n89 pages in length \nApprox 8.27 x 8.27 inches in size\nUPGRADED TO HARDBACK (VIA STRETCH GOAL)\nPrinted cover with metallic gold foil filigree and text \nI originally launched the 1st edition of this book in 2016 and I received an overwhelmingly positive response. The original book had to meet very tight deadlines and I always had this niggling feeling that it could have been so much more than what it was, still, people all over Wales started sending in even more legends of mythical beasts from their local areas. There was so much new material that naturally it inspired me to expand on the original book and create a second edition. So, I set out to recreate some of the original illustrations and add many more.\nSample of gold foiling effect that will feature on the cover.\nADDITIONAL CREATURES & LEGENDS:  \nTHE ANNWNN (The Celtic Otherworld)  \nTYLWYTH TEG (Fairy Folk)  \nELLYLLON (Elves) \nCOBLYNAU (Mine Fairies) \nBWBACHOD (House Fairies) \nGWRAGEDD ANNWN (Water Fairies) \nGWYLLION (Mountain Fairies)\nCEWRI (Giants) \nCERNUNNOS (The Horned God) \nBWCA (Knockers) \nCWRACH Y RHIBYN (Hag of the Mist) \nMORGANS (Mermaids) \nCATH PALUG (Paulg's Cat)\nSamples of two new pages\nListed below are just a handful of changes that have been made to this new edition of the art book:\nMetallic gold foil cover artwork and text\nExpanded from 50 to 89 pages\nExisting legends and creature profiles have been expanded\nOriginal artworks have been enhanced or re-drawn \nGraphic design and typography has been updated\nAll blank pages have been removed \nExisting typos have been removed or corrected\nAn editor and Welsh translator will oversee the writing\nCan be bought with an additional behind the scenes sketchbook\nNew exclusive prints available \nPostboxes are smaller and more streamlined\nThe book has been ISBN registered \nFeatures a barcode for easy sale\nWholesale options available\nThe new book has been separated into sections to include Dragons, Beasts, Spirits and a whole new section on Fairy Folk has been added.\nI'm so excited about this expanded version of the book, there's so much new content and I hope you will love it too!\nThis time you'll have the option of adding an additional sketchbook to your order! The all new sketchbook offers a unique insight into the development of the book; featuring a variety of thumbnails, concept sketches and page plans.\nSketchbook digital mockup\nIt is the same size as the art book featuring a soft cover and recycled pages.\nWorks in Progress\nThis is the perfect add-on for aspiring illustrators and behind the scenes lovers out there who want to see how the book was made. \nEARLY BIRD REWARDS:  \nDuring this campaign there will be a limited number of Early Bird rewards available.

You must also be an active Patreon during the campaign and remain a Patreon until May 2019 at ANY level. If you did not purchase a book during the last campaign but would like to get in on this giveaway, you can do so by becoming a $5 Patreon Supporter for one month HERE\nMy name is Collette J Ellis and I'm a full time freelance fantasy illustrator from Wales, my work is hugely influenced by ancient mythologies and I love drawing dragons and mythical creatures.\nHello!\nIn the past I have achieved an MA in Design Communication and have exhibited at various conventions across the UK; including London, Manchester and Cardiff. In October 2016 I opened my third solo exhibition in the Oriel Yuys Mon on Anglesey and have launched a number of successful Kickstarters, the first of which was the 1st edition of the book \u2018Welsh Monsters and Mythical Beasts\u2019 which sold over 1,000 copies in its first year.\n2016 First edition.\nOver the years I have worked on numerous publications for authors and album covers for musicians. I've been featured in several online blogs and magazines, including Imagine FX Magazine, 'Y Lle\u2019 on Welsh TV channel S4C and have even appeared on the BBC \u2018Wales Today\u2019 Show. \nSamples of my artwork.\nIf you want to know more about my work and what I do, you can check out my website that includes more artwork, a link to my mailing list and links to my social media pages: www.collettejellis.com \nOctober 23rd - Kickstarter launch day\nNovember 22nd - Kickstarter closes\nJanuary 2019 - Book edited \nMarch 2019 - Book completed and paid for\nApril - Surveys sent out to backers\nMay / June 2019 - Books dispatched \nPlease keep in mind that this is a rough guide, prep and shipping time can vary dramatically depending on how many books have been ordered. I will continue to keep backers up to date with monthly updates here on Kickstarter, but my goal is to have the books delivered by October - November 2019 at the very latest should I sell more than I anticipate in the schedule above. \nCOSTS:\nTo give you an idea of how the money will be spent should this project fund I have created a rough pie chart illustrating the costs involved.\nA rough pie-chart to illustrate funding breakdown.\nThe funding goal includes production costs, postage, packaging, prints, add-ons and additional fees including Paypal, Credit-card fees, Kickstarter fees and a cushion should additional costs arise, in my experience running Kickstarter campaigns there are always a few unforeseen costs. \nWELSH LANGUAGE:\nSadly due to cost, I'm unable to produce a bilingual copy of the physical book for this pre-order. However the Welsh language is incredibly important to me so if this Kickstarter goes well I intend to have the book translated into Welsh and made available in book stores and online by the end of 2019.\nPlease keep in mind that the writing for the book is 80% complete thus far and 60% of the artwork is complete. This Kickstarter will afford me the time and means to complete the book, it will also be receiving a final edit by a professional editor. I will be working closely with ExWhyZed Printing to ensure you receive the best quality product so I have allowed time for these final touches to be made. \nPledges will be shipped worldwide! Simply select your pledge option, your location and Kickstarter will calculate shipping for you! The price will include postage and packaging costs. All orders will be sent standard delivery. In the event of lost items, I will offer to resend your order once for free after 28 days of the items being sent; alternatively, you will have the option of a refund or Etsy store credit. Please note that I can only reship an order once if it is lost, if the second parcel is lost, I will not be able to offer a replacement. If you fail to provide a correct address during the surveys then I will be unable to replace your order. \nCUSTOMS DISCLAIMER: Please be aware that some countries will charge a handling fee on items over a certain price / weight, unfortunately I have no control over this. \nKICKSTARTER SURVEY DISCLAIMER: Please keep in mind that once surveys have been sent out you will have a limited amount of time to fill them in (up to 4 weeks). After this time a public update will be made to let you know that the books have all been shipped. Anyone who has not completed their survey by this time will not receive a copy of the book, instead their pledge will be viewed as a 'donation pledge'. \nThis time I have chosen to have my book printed by \u2018Ex Why Zed Printing\u2019 in Colchester, UK. \nI have used them several times in the past for my art sketchbooks and prints as they have came highly recommended by many other successful Kickstarter users and friends. They are both remarkably fast and incredibly high quality. \nLearn more about Ex Why Zed via their website: http://www.exwhyzed.co.uk", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n*** IMPORTANT PLEASE READ

every two - three weeks on the progress via this campaigns updates section or you can follow the project on my social media accounts. \n\nI've also allowed for time needed to complete all commissions

Over the next day the pain continued to worsen. My mother is a nurse and decided to drive all the way from the north of Wales to get me and bring me back home. I was checked into the hospital where she works, where they did more tests, an x-ray and ultrasound. They discovered I had gall stones which were causing inflamation of my gall bladder and a cyst on my right ovary. I\u2019ve been discarged for the time being with pain meds while they decide the best course of action. It\u2019s very likely I will need my gallbladder removing and they need to check out the cyst and decide if that can be removed also.

No problem! Just add the desired amount below to your pledge and more will be sent your way. Some of these prices are slightly higher because they include the extra shipping.\n Hi there and welcome to my first ever Kickstarter campaign! My name is Lydia Fenwick, but the internet knows me best as \"Lyfe Illustration.\" I am a professional illustrator from Southern California who has a passion for watercolor, ink, whimsical women and animals, and my panther chameleon sidekicks whom I affectionately refer to as tree dragons.\nDuring the month of October, I embarked on a series of women and animal illustrations based on constellations, including all astrological signs, as a celebration for reaching 200K followers on my Instagram. Each piece was done in a single day, using mainly ink, and filmed for YouTube (You can view a video of each finished piece here!) The project soon turned into some of my favorite work and my following quickly grew to almost 240K which brings me to why I'm here...\nKickstarter allows me to make something much bigger than I can on my own! The 30 day funding period allows me to create multiple new art products with the best quality possible and offer them to you for a much cheaper price than in my normal shop. The best part about this is that the bigger the campaign gets, the more I get to reward you all through stretch goals! Giving fancy gifts to my supporters is one of my favorite things to do, so I really hope we get there!\nI have prepared A LOT of reward options for you all, including even more stretch goal additions!\n FIRST is a better visual list of all pledge tiers available so you can see exactly what you will be getting in the one you choose! This also includes stretch goal extras as they are unlocked. \nPLEASE NOTE the \"value in shop\" price! This is how much these items would/will cost in my normal shop. Some are only available during the Kickstarter. Basically you won't find deals on my work like this again; I wanted to make my first Kickstarter extra special and worthwhile for my backers <3 \nNEXT I have listed the rewards with as much detailed information as possible so you know exactly what each item is, including what you could get if we surpass our main goal! \n*This is the mock-up cover art concept. Cover is being painted with watercolor and ink right now!\nSample Page\nMy main goal for this project is the \"Galaxy Girls\" book. It is filled with illustrations of constellations and astrology signs as well as descriptions of the lore behind them. \nBook details:\nAt least 80 pages with 31 illustrations \nTUTORIAL now unlocked!!\n8.5\" x 11\" \nHARDCOVER now unlocked!!\nShiny holographic cover detailing\nThickest paper available \nBelow is a list of illustrations you will find in the book! Some pieces are in the mock-up stage and some are yet to be made. Throughout this campaign I will be working on the last pieces and will update this page as they are finished! \nThat's what you are by funding this Kickstarter! Everyone who pledges for a book ($35+) will have their name included in the back under my \"Lyfe Supporters,\" the list of the very important people who brought this book to lyfe...life ;) After the campaign ends, a survey will be sent out for the name and/or @handle you wish to be listed as. If you wish to remain anonymous, that of course is ok as well.\n*Real names only please, joke names and inappropriate @handles will not be printed.\n*Bookplate mock-up, final art will be more detailed\nI am illustrating a limited edition bookplate sticker, about 4\"x3\", as a collector's item for those who wish to have a signed book! It will come un-stuck so you can place it wherever you'd like.\nI am not limiting this tier, so the edition total will be the unique number of signed book backers. However, this bookplate is a Kickstarter Exclusive and will not be available to any one else after the campaign ends!! \n*Examples of what inside cover sketches will look like\nThese sketches are limited to 50 backers who wish to support everything this campaign has to offer AND get a one of a kind doodle by me inside their book cover! Sketches will be randomized quick portraits and Galaxy Girls themed. \nEvery Original Book Art tier will also get a sketch inside their book covers as a thank you for supporting my original work! \n*Please note these are mockups and final design may vary slightly...and be hella more shiny!\nShiny stickers are the best kinds of stickers! I'm making my first ever *holographic* stickers featuring these celestial cuties: fox, rabbit, and the galaxy version of my deer girl! More animals from the book can be unlocked as stickers if we reach certain social media stretch goals. Stickers will be 3-4 inches on their longest side.\n*Please note these are mock-ups, final design may vary slightly\nI've been drooling over enamel pins for years now, so it is time to finally release some of my own! You will get two pins, the official Galaxy Girl pin and a Lyfe Chameleon pin to celebrate my panther chameleon sidekicks and our brand name. Fun fact, my chameleons have a social media following of their own. It's a little ridiculous: @lyfechameleons\nEnamel Pin details:\nhard enamel\ngold metal\nabout 1.5\" (33mm)\nrubber clutches \ninclude an artistic backing card\n*Purchasing only one pin is not available during the Kickstarter. If I am able to order extra, single pins will be available in my shop after for $15 each.\n Is my obsession with shiny things obvious yet? I am releasing a set of my first ever gold and silver foil embellished prints! My specialty 5\"x7\" prints go for $15 each in my shop, so you are getting quite a deal with these tiers. \nWant to add on items or get more of something? No problem! Just add the desired amount below to your pledge and more will be sent your way. Some of these prices are slightly higher because they include the extra shipping.\nGraphic of Stretch Goals coming soon!\nI have included some social media goals so everyone can help unlock some more cool stickers! As long as we hit the funding goal, everyone will receive the following when they are unlocked:\n500 Retweets - Retweet this link here to unlock the Dragon sticker! ALL tiers will receive this reward!\n500 Notes - And why not get Tumblr involved? If this post here gets 500 notes ALL tiers will receive the Pegasus sticker!\n500 Shares - If this Facebook post here gets 500 shares ALL tiers will receive a Lynx sticker!\n30,000 Likes - Ok Instagram, you are my main squeeze. If we get 30k likes on this post here ALL tiers will receive a Chameleon sticker!\nCome on guys, let me give you free stickers ;) \nIf we surpass the initial $7.5k funding goal, we can unlock these awesome extras:\n10k UNLOCKED! - A tutorial will be added to the book! \n12k UNLOCKED! - 5 more 5\"x7\" holographic prints will be added to the set! Deluxe set will now have 20! \n15k UNLOCKED! - 5 more 5\"x7\" silver embellished prints will be added to the set! Deluxe set will now have 25!\n18k UNLOCKED! - 6 more 5\"x7\" gold embellished prints will be added to the set! Deluxe set will now have the complete series of 31!\n22k UNLOCKED! - A third enamel pin with be unlocked and sent to ALL pledges over $20! \n25k UNLOCKED! - The book will become a hardcover! \n35K UNLOCKED! - A Kickstarter exclusive bookmark will be unlocked and sent to ALL pledges with a book!\n50K UNLOCKED! - A print of the cover will be unlocked and sent to ALL PLEDGES! 5\"x7\" for all pledges without a book and 8.5\"x11\" for all pledges with a book. \n70K - I will now be able to make a T-SHIRT!!! This will most likely be a screen printed black uni-sex tee with the Libra design and stars. It will be available as an extra add on for all tiers, and free to all EVERYTHING tiers (tiers 11-14)\n80K - All social media stickers, Dragon, Pegasus, Lynx, Chameleon, and a *mystery* sticker, will now be unlocked without having to reach specific like/retweet/share goals and sent to ALL PLEDGES!\n??? - We've hit so many goals so fast I am working on more! Suggestions welcome :) \n Let's be real, shipping costs can be a pain, especially for my international supporters. Books with nice thick paper are heavy, and packaging them securely just adds on more. Unfortunately, I cannot get around the price of shipping, but I can assure you your package will be packed with love by *me!* \nDomestic Backers: I refuse to send you your package media mail as it has a much higher chance of getting damaged! Therefore all tiers will include tracking except the sticker only tier.\nInternational Backers: I will include tracking whenever possible, but some international tiers may not include tracking past the U.S. to alleviate some extra cost. If you wish to add tracking on international orders please email me: lyfeillustration@gmail.com\nPlease know I do not make any money off of shipping, and in some cases, I lose a bit. \nAs my main goal is making high quality art products, I will not rush production if it will lose quality. I have given myself a time cushion by giving an estimate ship date in April 2019, but they may arrive and ship sooner. I will keep you all updated on the process and status of production on here and my social media as often as possible!                                ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis may be my first Kickstarter, but it is by no means my first \"pre-order\" type of project! I have over 3 years experience of producing quality products, selling my work online, and shipping all over the world. I am confident this will help me provide you with the best rewards on time!\n\nThat being said, with no previous Kickstarter to gauge how many backers I may receive, I could have more on my plate than anticipated. I have given myself a time cushion, and will update you along the way if any delays come up!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Sticker Pack", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Holographic Stickers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Three Prints (Random)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Random 5\"x7\" Prints (unsigned)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["54 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Enamel Pins", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Book Only", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1x Galaxy Girls Book (unsigned)\nListed as a Lyfe Supporter in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["350 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "SIGNED Book Only", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n1x Galaxy Girls Book\n1x SIGNED Exclusive Bookplate\nListed as a Lyfe Supporter in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["147 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "*Holographic* Print Pack and Book", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Holographic 5\"x7\" Prints (unsigned)\n1x Galaxy Girls Book (unsigned)\nListed as a Lyfe Supporter in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "*Silver Foil* and Book", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Silver Foil 5\"x7\" Prints (unsigned)\n1x Galaxy Girls Book (unsigned)\nListed as a Lyfe Supporter in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "*Gold Foil* and Book", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Gold Foil 5\"x7\" Prints (unsigned)\n1x Galaxy Girls Book (unsigned)\nListed as a Lyfe Supporter in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["49 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "DELUXE Print Pack and Book", "descp": "You get ALL the prints with the book!

If you have already pledged, you may modify your pledge for the additional amount.

I will have a list on the survey as to what the additional pins you pledged for!\nHere is an example of rainbow plating I had done in the past. As a note, the orange/yellow were not very prevalent. I'm not sure if this is the case in most rainbow plating runs or if it also depends on the surface area.\nI encourage you to look up 'rainbow metal/plating' on pins if you are still not sure of what it may look like, and look for more line detail oriented pins.\nThank you.\nFeel free to help out by retweeting/reblogging these posts!: \n https://twitter.com/AskSweetCream/status/1054857938714664960 \nhttp://asksweetcream.tumblr.com/post/179361956838/httpswwwkickstartercomprojects17929745spiri\nThank you!\nIf this project exceeds my wildest dreams by funding  beyond the final tier, I may look into additional designs.\n\u2666\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f Timeline \u2666\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f\nOctober/November - Launch/Campaign/Funding\nNovember - Production.

And what do all of these stories have in common?  \nElectrum is an alloy formed by mixing the elements of gold and silver, and mixed-race people are just as precious! We are overjoyed to bring you our newest anthology Electrum: 26 brand-new fiction and non-fiction comics that explore the joy, the insecurities, and the unique strengths that come with being mixed-race from the perspective of dozens of artists from all around the world.  \nfrom \"Mestizo\" by Alberto Rayo & Diego Revelo and \"Rose Metal\" by Iasmin Omar Ata\nOver a year in the making, Electrum is the first-ever comics anthology entirely produced and created by mixed-race artists. In this book, you'll hear our own voices in a variety of art styles and genres, from fantasy to history, from science fiction to autobiography, and much more. \nfrom \"Coils\" by Georgia Henderson and \"Chameleon\" by Veronica Agarwal\nThese stories don't shy away from difficult subjects. You'll be reading about origins and celebrations, but also internalized fears, racism and insecurities. But each and every story in this volume illustrates the way we've learned to draw strength from our challenges, and how we choose to embrace our bright future. \nfrom \"Bobby and Jules\" by Kam Mars Heyward and \"Angel's Daughter\" by Tzor Edery\n We are so proud to bring you all of these stories... and more!  \nIn addition to the book, you can pick up some great rewards, including a bookplate dedicated to the recipient of the book, a double-plated enamel pin celebrating the mixed-race identity, and even a limited number of sketches and custom art from your favorite contributors.\nAt the \u25c8 FLYING HIGH \u25c8  tier you'll receive an original 5x7 drawing from one of our contributing artists (including Der-shing Helmer, Georgia Henderson, Julia Hutchinson, Iasmin Omar Ata, Lara Kim, Y\u1ebfn Quach and Charlene Soto), or you can choose one of our special custom commissions from the very limited \u25c8 COMMISSION TIER \u25c8 options.

While the primary purpose of the book is to inspire and celebrate mixed-race readers of all ages, we also intended Electrum to be shared with the friends and family of mixed-race people, and all comic lovers regardless of background. We are an inclusive anthology that uplifts our voices without silencing others.\nfrom \"Captain's Log\" by Sam Wade\nMany of us who pursue relationships beyond the bounds of our own race may also have (or be planning to have) children who combine the qualities of both parents! We live in a multicultural world, and this book will help build empathy and guide non-mixed readers to understand our diverse and growing demographic.   \nThe artists of Electrum are among the best artists working today. We come from countries all around the world and from a variety of races, religions, genders and occupations. We run the gamut from seasoned Eisner and Ignatz award-winners and industry professionals to first-time contributors. What binds us together is our love of comics and our passion for sharing our stories with readers old and new!\nFind out more about our stories at our Twitter, via updates to this campaign, or via the links below~ \n \u25c8 Alberto Rayo & Diego Revelo \u25c8 M Cat White \u25c8 Charlene Soto & Kelsey Soto \u25c8 Georgia Henderson \u25c8 Hinahina Gray \u25c8 Iasmin Omar Ata \u25c8 Jem Yoshioka \u25c8 Jordan Alsaqa & Jenna Yow \u25c8 Julia Hutchinson \u25c8 Kam Mars Heyward \u25c8 Kelly Bull \u25c8 Kiana Khansmith \u25c8 Moe Espinoza \u25c8 MOM \u25c8 Sam Wade \u25c8 Little Corvus \u25c8 Lara Kim & Sara Lee \u25c8 Shadia Amin \u25c8 Sloane Leong \u25c8 Tajliya Jamal \u25c8 Tess Stone \u25c8 Tzor Edery \u25c8 Veronica Agarwal \u25c8 Y\u1ebfn Quach \u25c8 Ashanti Forston (bookplate) \u25c8 Yoshi Yoshitani (cover)\u25c8 Kiku Hughes (editor and contributor) \u25c8  Der-shing Helmer (editor and contributor) \nThe Alloy Anthology aims to explore complicated and intersectional identities through visual storytelling, starting with our first volume, Electrum.

Now, cast out by tragedy and strange magic, she\u2019s bound to wander the countryside, living by her wits and banishing spirits for her work. But for Anna, some things aren\u2019t so easily settled, and some traditions aren\u2019t so easily forgotten. Dark, ancient things are stirring in the woods, awakened by the war between the states, by the new roads, the belching locomotives and logging cuts. There\u2019s granny witchery and her own roots to learn. If she\u2019s going to survive, she\u2019d better learn them fast...\nAnna O\u2019Brien: Ghost Days is an illustrated collection of short stories, with tales of the uncanny that draw from the (often misunderstood) history and folklore of the Southern Appalachians. An enchanted mask that exacts a powerful price; a bank heist that runs afoul of an undead curse; dark things yearning for an even darker savior on a remote hill; and two women tormented by a relentless suitor. \nBorn out of a deep love for the southern mountains, Ghost Days is road trip through a world on the brink of massive upheaval and ecological collapse, a world of old traditions and remnant spirits. It's a mix of historical fiction and magical realism, plus a hefty dose of monsters, hags and haints. If you like the work of Mike Mignola, Andrzej Sapkowski, and Manley Wade Wellman, this is the book for you. \nBut you don't have to take our word for it. You can read the first story, Wampus Mask, for free right here!\nWe're asking for $7,000 to make a physical book!\nThe manuscript for Anna O'Brien: Ghost Days is already written, and the art is already done. Should we make our goal, we will deliver unto you an 8\" x 5.5\" (22 cm x 28 cm) perfect bound book, with black and white interiors. It will have eight stories  and nine gorgeous interior illustrations, comprising about 52,000 words and around 250 pages. \nHere's an early mockup of the cover! \nAnd one of Tiffany's interior illustrations, from the story Night on the Bald.\nIn addition to digital and physical copies of the book, we're offering a number of rewards! These include digital extras like research notes, author commentary and tutorial videos.  But what about physical rewards, you ask? \nBut that's not all! We're also offering a limited number of hardcovers, plus two collectible, hand-annotated editions at $800, which will never be available again!\nWe got \u2018em! At $7,500 we\u2019ll add a process section in the back, including a sketchbook portion from Tiffany and folklore and research notes from Asher.  This is a feature we've seen in comics, and we feel it would be neat to have something similar in a fiction collection. [UNLOCKED!]\nAt $10,000, some of Asher's original design sketches (which you can see in the backer updates!) will be added to the already unlocked sketchbook portion of the book! [UNLOCKED!]\nIf we crack to $11,500, then we\u2019ll produce a print run of 500 books through PrintNinja, which will be sold in bookstores and on Amazon, given to libraries, and released out into the world! [UNLOCKED!]\nIf we get to $12,500, Tiffany will produce five new interior illustrations for the book, giving you even more spooky bang for your buck! [UNLOCKED!]\nAnd if we reach $14,000, we\u2019ll upgrade the print run to 500 hardcovers, which means everybody who\u2019s pledged at the paperback level will get a hardcover book! (These books will only be signed if you\u2019ve pledged above the 75$ tier.)

I've been creating and self-publishing fantasy-adventure comics online and in print since 2006. For the past eight years, I've been working primarily on Vattu, an enormous graphic novel series about a girl captured by an empire.\nI'm running this Kickstarter to finally print the THIRD collection of this story, containing almost 400 pages of the comic. All of the contents of this book are finished; all that's left to do is get the books printed. This Kickstarter is the place to preorder the third book of Vattu, or get the entire series so far. Thank you for helping make this possible!\nVattu is an expansive fantasy adventure comic, and is the third graphic novel set in a world of strange creatures called Overside. Vattu is a girl from a nomadic society who is caught in the middle of a clash of cultures with the conquering Empire of Sahta. In the first two books, Vattu is taken from the idyllic grassland of the Fluters, and must find her way through a new world of zealous conquerors, and the many peoples incorporated into their Empire: mute, monstrous slave-soldiers from across the sea; chemist-priestesses who manufacture an addictive drug; and amphibian people called Grish who struggle for a foothold in the capital city of  Sahta.\nIn the third book, Vattu is taken in by the Emperor of Sahta and begins to see an entirely different perspective on the Empire and the nature of its power. At the same time, a cunning pirate named Bakrah lands among the Grish, and begins to see how their marginalization and righteous anger can be tools for his own power. Reactive and revolutionary tendencies throughout the city's populations begin to emerge.\nThe fourth book will be the last book of Vattu.\nEach of the books has focused on a particular population within the Empire and its capital city, and a particular angle on Vattu's central concerns of political power and the development of identity within and against it. This is a huge, strange, meditative comic: it is the largest and most complicated thing I can imagine working on as an individual, and I am grateful to my audience for making it possible for me to focus on it.\nVattu is the winner of a 2014 Ignatz Award. The webcomic version has been running since summer 2010, and first two books have been in print for a few years.\nFor the duration of this Kickstarter, a free download of the first three books (not including the extra material from the print versions) is available here.\nBook 3 of Vattu will be printed in paperback and hardcover versions, to match the first two books (though it has about 25% more pages than either). The paperback edition will have a matte cover and french flaps, with a wordless full-bleed image on the front cover. The hardcover will have a cover of gray cloth over board, with Vattu's icon printed and debossed on the front, and a ribbon bookmark in red. Hardcovers will have a white partial jacket to match the first books. You can see photos of the previous books here and here to get an idea.\nLike the first two, Book 3 will have a \"title sequence\" of extra art, and an appendix section with several world-internal maps and documents.\nThe books represent the ideal presentation of the comic, in my opinion: extra content is world-internal and supports the story, and I've tried to present the story in an immersive and beautiful way.\nVery few extra things for this Kickstarter! I am prioritizing just getting the book printed. Every book of Vattu ordered through this Kickstarter will include a signed bookplate. Some tiers include the option of a print: this image is meant to be the portrait of Vattu that is painted in the comic itself, and also appears in the appendix of Book 3. No more of these will be printed than are preordered through this Kickstarter.\nCopies of my earlier graphic novel Order of Tales are also available through this Kickstarter (in print, online). Order of Tales is an atmospheric adventure story following the last member of a society  of story-collectors, as he becomes involved in a secret conflict  involving a mysterious being made of glass, and thousands of years of  violent history.\nThe only stretch goal for the project will be a reprint of the paperback version of Vattu Book 2! At $35,000, which is 7K over the initial goal. We're running low on Vattu 2 and I'd like the whole story to be available in print consistently. Whether we meet this goal or not, the previous Vattu books are available through this Kickstarter.\n Working with the printers and fulfilling the rewards will be handled by Make that Thing! They're well-equipped for this and they've helped run a number of big book projects on Kickstarter, including my second book of Vattu, and illustrated Wizard of Oz and Moby-Dick.\nThe 28,000 USD goal for this project includes an estimated $13,000 to get both versions of Vattu Book 3 and the extras produced, and an additional amount to cover shipping and handling, and Make That Thing!'s fee.\nThank you for reading, and thank you for your support!\n- Evan Dahm", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the seventh book I've self-published, and the fourth I've made with Make That Thing.

But in the end, I've always been able to get the quality of product I want.\nPin quality issues have been happening much more frequently I feel that it's now appropriate to mention delays may happen, and should be expected, as a precaution.\n\nThese pins are also going to be using an additional screen printing technique which I've never tried before! So we may run into some quality issues on that front as well. But again, my manufacturer has always been faithful when it comes to helping me get the high quality I expect when something goes wrong.\n\nI heavily pride myself in making sure I stay upfront and transparent when it comes to communicating with my backers. I like to keep everyone in the loop in regards to whatever's going on, including when we may run into issues.

14 fantasy artists and illustrators from all over the world, gathered by myself (Jodie), also a practicing artist! Tired of seeing generic and uninspiring 'how to' art books in stores, I've decided to publish my own - an A4 size thread-sewn softback filled with a wonderful variety of fantasy art and a comprehensive selection of tutorials! My end goal is to create a book that will inspire artists and art lovers alike!\nInside The Enchanted Forest you'll find over 130 pages of traditional and digital art; featuring woodland elves, witches, mermaids and other high fantasy beings! In addition, there are 28 pages of exclusive tutorials covering a variety of topics from digital painting, copic marker and traditional media to illustration prep, colour theory and much more!\n Prototypes of the The Enchanted Forest have already been printed - we now need your help to fund a full run of books!\n Each artist has an 8-page section of the book, which includes a collection of illustrations, their exclusive Enchanted Forest images and a 2-page art tutorial.\nFor everyone interested in the art-making process, we've lovingly put together 14 unique art tutorials from our featured artists: these tutorials have been written especially for the book and can't be found anywhere else! Take a look at some highlights:\nIn their Enchanted Forest tutorial, Eli Baum highlights the many ways you can use color theory to enhance your images, draw attention to certain aspects and tell a story with your art!\nHave you ever wondered how digital illustrators create such crisp, perfect images without using line art? Viv Tanner walks you through the process from start to finish, with tips on how to apply color gradients, flats and texture.\nIn this wonderful traditional media tutorial, Miss Etoile walks you through the creation of one of her beautfiul Copic Marker & gouache illustrations. Learn how to prepare your sketch, transfer it to art board and complete it!\nLearn how to complete a traditional painting in ink, watercolor and marker - Nati's tutorial contains a full list of her favorite tools and tips on how to use them!\nAnndr reveals her top digital painting tips to help speed up your creation process, adjust colors effectively and use Photoshop's tools to create great special effects!\n Using your own 3D models as reference can save a lot of time! In this tutorial, Cashile details her creative process from start to finish, and how to set up reference models of your own using free software.\nExclusively for Kickstarter, all of our reward tiers include a downloadable PDF copy of all 14 tutorials, so you can read them on your phone, tablet or PC! Not only that, there are three unique videos showing the creation process of various illustrations from start to finish, so you can watch and learn how our artists create their works!\nTo celebrate the launch of the book our artists have designed a beautiful collection of Gold Foil prints! These will be printed on heavyweight stock, finished with delicate gold hot foil stamping and presented in a custom card case. The full set is available in the Deluxe Tier alongside a whole range of other art goodies!\nIn addition, this stunning variant of our cover art by ELK64 will be produced as a Holofoil Art Print and will be included free in all book pledges as a bonus 'thank you!' to our backers! This special print will have a magical rainbow holographic foil effect on highlighted areas~\nIf you'd like a range of wonderful art goodies with your book, you can also pledge for a Deluxe tier! This special Limited Edition book set contains over 30 different art prints in various sizes, a signed copy of The Enchanted Forest and a full set of gold foil prints - all presented in a beautiful foil-stamped gift box. Each box is signed and numbered by the author and is exclusive to Kickstarter!\nPlease note the A4 Art Prints and Art Postcard sets will not be available to other tiers in the Add-On Store - these are exclusive to the Deluxe Book Bundle!\nWe have a variety of rewards to choose from - whether you'd just like to donate or would like a copy of the new book, take a look at what we have on offer!\nIf we can hit our initial target, a whole range of exciting goodies will be available at certain milestones!

The estimated shipping time is November / December 2018: Delays are possible, but we've streamlined the production process so any delays will be minor at best!\nDid you enjoy our last project: 'Threads: Fashion Artbook'?\nWith the help of our Backers, in 2015 we brought our fashion-themed artbook 'Threads' to life and shared it with the world - it has been sold in multiple countries since publishing and we've had nothing but positive feedback from our buyers!

My name is Julie Dillon, and I'm a 3-time Hugo Award winning artist from Northern California. I absolutely love to draw and paint, and art has been a vital part of my life for as long as I can remember.  Art can offer an escape as well as an invitation; a way to process one's experience of the world, a way to offer a different perspective. It can illuminate and reveal the magic lurking just beneath the surface of the world, and that is what I've attempted to do throughout my career as an artist.   \nI've put together an art book that will let me share with you more of my art and ideas than I ever have before. I have assembled and curated over 200 pages of artwork that includes everything from my portfolio highlights,  freelance work, sketches and studies, unfinished pieces, to old work from when I was first starting out. \nThe Book: \"Daydreamer's Journey\"  \n\"Daydreamer's Journey\" will be a 200 page 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover book, on beautiful thick glossy paper. This book will contain personal work,  freelance projects, sketches, studies, and illustration drafts, some of which either has never been posted online or that hasn't been available online in over a decade. Also included will be my commentary and thoughts, as well as progress shots for most pieces so you can see part of my painting and brainstorming process. \nMockup of the printed book\nSample Interior Spread\nIn addition to my portfolio pieces, I've also included some older art from the early 2000s: \n As well as tons of sketches and unfinished illustrations: \nSample Interior Spread\nPlease note! There will be VERY LIMITED AVAILABILITY of this book after the kickstarter concludes, so if you want a copy, don't wait!  \nRewards\n  Note: If you select a reward tier with a giclee or metal print, you will be able to select which image you want on the Kickstarter Survey that will be emailed out after the end of the campaign. \nUPDATE: I was able to find lower rates for international shipping, so there are now new INTERNATIONAL tiers for most rewards that reflect the lower cost. Please either message me with questions or refer to Update #2 for more information.

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having a sixteen year record of delivering over eighty books of the highest quality. I've run ten previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Jeffrey Alan Love, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before.

Read all about it here.\nUrsula K. Le Guin is best known for her groundbreaking, visionary, bestselling science fiction and fantasy novels, but throughout her life, she wrote, read, and believed in the power of poetry.\n\u201cI just knew from extremely early on\u2014it sounds ridiculous, but five or six\u2014that writing was something I was going to do, always... It started as poetry.\u201d\nPhoto courtesy Euan Monaghan/Structo\nWhen Le Guin brought the manuscript for her final collection, So Far So Good, to Copper Canyon Press, she did so with faith in us as a nonprofit, independent publisher to do justice to her poetry. As huge fans of her writing and ethos, we were thrilled to accept the book for publication. We were deeply saddened when Le Guin passed away in January of 2018, just days after she sent her last edits to what would be her final poetry book. This tremendous loss strengthened our resolve: Let\u2019s do all we can to lift up the poetic legacy of this essential American writer.\nSo now we invite you to join us in a rare opportunity: Help publish Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s final collection of poetry! The book, So Far So Good, will be published in the fall of 2018\u2014thanks to your help. This will truly be a community effort, and a community\u2019s book. In fact, to honor this community element we want to print your name, or the name of a loved one, in every copy of the first edition of the book, when you back the project at $100 or more. Scroll down to \u201cabout the publisher\u201d to learn more about our nonprofit publishing model, and read on for much more about the incredible Ursula K. Le Guin and her poetry.\nUrsula K. Le Guin, award-winning novelist, poet, avid feminist, and environmentalist, passed away on Monday, January 22, 2018 in Portland, Oregon. In addition to being the author of more than 20 novels, she has written 12 collections of poetry, more than 100 short stories, several collections of essays, 13 books for children, and five volumes of translation. Her books have been translated into more than 40 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide.\nShe is known for her vast contribution to the genres of science fiction and fantasy with books including the Earthsea series, The Left Hand of Darkness, and The Dispossessed, which made her the first person to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel twice for the same two books. In April 2000, the U.S. Library of Congress dubbed Le Guin a Living Legend in the \u201cWriters and Artists\u201d category for her significant contributions to America\u2019s cultural heritage. In 2002, she won a PEN/Malamud Award, and in 2003, she was made a Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) Grand Master, one of only a few women writers to take the top honor in the genre. In 2014, she was awarded the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.\n\u201cWhere I can get prickly and combative is if I\u2019m just called a sci-fi writer. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a novelist and poet. Don\u2019t shove me into your damn pigeonhole, where I don\u2019t fit, because I\u2019m all over. My tentacles are coming out of the pigeonhole in all directions.\u201d\nLe Guin's final book of poems, So Far So Good, will be published in the fall of 2018\u2014with your help\u2014by Copper Canyon Press.\nHere is one example of the powerful, often short, wise poems in the book we\u2019ll publish together. You hear Silky, Margaret, and Ella reading some lines from this poem in our campaign video. \nSo Far So Good showcases Le Guin\u2019s spiritual depth, quiet humor, and deep passion. She contemplates approaching the end of life with an equal sense of awe, mystery, and urgency that characterized her best-selling novels, but here the work is personal and sometimes nearly whispered\u2014a voice speaking from the heart of the author.\nPhotograph by Rod Searcey. \u00a9 Rod Searcey\nHere are some words from Le Guin\u2019s poetry editor and a few longtime readers of her fiction, on what it\u2019s like to discover her poetry:\n\u201cIt was a tremendous privilege to work with Ursula on her latest book. Like many great writers, she has been writing poems for much of her life, even while she saw her fame and recognition coming from other genres. This new collection is intimate and personal, and throughout the editing process she revealed a tremendous graciousness and receptivity, even while admitting to feeling a degree of vulnerability in the genre. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s a gorgeous book that celebrates the living even as she contemplates mortality.\u201d \n\u2014Michael Wiegers, Editor in Chief at Copper Canyon Press\n\u201cShe's been such a guide for so long in the work that she's done: in terms of how we think about the world, how we think about political systems, how we think about race and gender and class and relating to each other. Now it's in her poetry; she's a guide for how to process the world in different ways, how to process the environment, your day to day life, how you process the end of your life. \u201d \n\u2014Silky Shah, longtime Le Guin reader and Executive Director, Detention Watch Network\n\"It's interesting seeing Le Guin\u2019s themes manifesting in different ways, through different uses of words. Her other books are largely fantasy, or science fiction. Her poetry is much more grounded in the real world\u2014but a real world that feels mystical, and still has a sort of magic to it.\" \n\u2014Ella Wiegers, longtime Le Guin reader and student\n\"It felt like she was speaking my heart, my mind, something that I know but I never could've put into words. This was somebody that I felt like I knew.\u201d \n\u2014Margaret Schonfield, longtime Le Guin reader and dancer/psychologist\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a long career as a writer, and a good one, in good company. Here at the end of it, I don\u2019t want to watch American literature get sold down the river. We who live by writing and publishing want and should demand our fair share of the proceeds; but the name of our beautiful reward isn\u2019t profit. Its name is freedom.\u201d\n\u2014Ursula K. Le Guin\nOur headquarters in Port Townsend, Washington\nFor more than 45 years, Copper Canyon Press has been operating as an independent publisher dedicated to poetry. Our nonprofit status enables and requires us to place art above profit, and creative freedom above the whims of the marketplace. We are able to operate in the name of aesthetic excellence and cultural relevance, specifically because you and other visionary community members share this value, essential to a healthy climate for the arts. For this reason we were particularly proud when the Ursula K. Le Guin\u2014none other than the literary legend herself\u2014chose to bring her poetry collection to Copper Canyon Press.\nNot unlike independent record companies and public radio stations, we rely on the support of donors like you, who share our belief that poetry is vital to language and living. The Kickstarter community in particular has helped us to publish major collections including Then Come Back: The Lost Poems of Pablo Neruda, The Essential W.S. Merwin, and Aimee Nezhukumatathil's Oceanic. We are proud to publish extraordinary poetry\u2014in collaboration and community with you.\n...and Realists of a Larger Reality\nWhile Le Guin is best known for her major contributions to the genres of science fiction and fantasy, she was also a great poet. One of the fiercest advocates of our time for literature as a mode of social justice, her outspoken values shifted the literary landscape\u2014a rare and invaluable combination. \n\u201cHard times are coming, when we\u2019ll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being, and even imagine real grounds for hope. We\u2019ll need writers who can remember freedom\u2014poets, visionaries\u2014realists of a larger reality.\u201d\n\u2014Ursula K. Le Guin, from a speech at the National Book Awards, 2014\nPhoto by Win Goodbody\nWhen you back this project, you will help readers everywhere rediscover Le Guin: as a poet, and will enable Copper Canyon Press to continue to keep poetry publishing independent. Le Guin saw the role of the poet as visionary citizen, capable to envision a different way forward through difficult times. We see it as an honor and urgent obligation to continue this good work.\nAs a nonprofit publisher of poetry, only half of our overall operational expenses are covered by book sales, so each pledge helps us to sustain our community-powered model of getting poetry into the hands of those who\u2019ll benefit from its power.\nThis just in: thanks to your early enthusiasm and support, we have announced both a stretch goal, and a new Kickstarter-exclusive project! Read all about it here.\nWhen you pledge $100 or more to the project, your name (or the name of a loved one) will be printed in every copy of So Far So Good, soon to be on bookshelves all over the world and in the Library of Congress, alongside Le Guin's other great works. At $25 and above, you'll receive a copy of the book when it is hot off the press, before it's been widely distributed. \nIn thanks for your support of So Far So Good, you can also receive: \nA beautiful letterpress broadside featuring a previously unpublished poem from the book \nA selection of other Copper Canyon Press books: an entire fall season, an editor-curated package of bestsellers, or every single book from our annual list. \nWe at Copper Canyon Press are grateful for people like you who value poetry and the vitality it brings to readers.

My name is Francine Bridge - i'm also known online as Witnesstheabsurd, and i'm a freelance digital illustrator with an investment in monsters. Last year I ran a campaign to print my first artbook, the Occult Supergiant Primer and thanks to everyone who supported it was a terrific success. I always intended to publish more books and now, i'm here to try something a little more ambitious!\nThe Lesser Key of Solomon is an occult text containing the \"Ars Goetia\" - a list of 72 demons that can be summoned and commanded by mortals. The Goetic demons have long been a source of inspiration for artists and have received many different interpretations much like the Tarot. I've always wanted to produce my own version, and now I am!\nTHE BASICS\nI want to print 100 copies of a roughly 80 page hardback artbook featuring illustrations of 72 demons alongside their original seals and the text describing their nature and abilities.\nI've completed 7 of these 72 demons right now. Funding this project will go towards not only printing but also permit me to take less commissions from outside clients and focus on completion of the book over the next few months.\nOf those 72, a select few demons among those listed as \"Kings of Hell\" will receive oversize double page illustrations such as Bael, Asmoday and Belial.\nMockup Page\nBackers at the \"Marquis of Hell\" and above tiers will have first dibs on copies, with 90 copies available at the reduced price of \u00a325/$33. Shipping is \u00a35/$7 for outside the UK and \u00a33/$4 for inside the UK/Ireland.\nThe remaining 10 copies + any unsold will be sold afterwards at \u00a330/$40 each, with the chance of a second print run if the campaign is a success, but no guarantees!

To celebrate, we asked her to put together an art book of whatever she wanted. Bobby Chiu also wanted to join in on the fun so he's making a book as well!\nMasae learned that families are often different but love is the same. In this book about family, she reflects through illustration on her fond memories and moments with her family. \nMasae dedicates this book to her parents who showered her with love and support, teaching her the importance of pursuing what she loves. After losing both parents, Masae felt in the beginning that drawing her memories with her family was the best way to cope with her emotions. As she created more and more family drawings, she wanted to share her stories and allow other people to connect to them. So she decided to create this book, \"Kin\". \nWith 72 pages of illustrations and sketches, \"Kin\" features many human, animal, and creature designs! Some of these are accompanied by short stories while in others, the pictures tell the tales. She hopes that people will view her illustrations each as a small celebration of love and family in its many forms, and they will also see their own families in some of the illustrations. \nCredits: Disney Publishing \"Vampirina\" Series, Netflix \"12/24\" \nWhen we hear the word \"unicorn\", the first thing that comes to mind is a horse with a single horn, surrounded by rainbows and butterflies. They are supposed to be majestic, fantastical, rare, and special. But Bobby felt that somewhere along the way, \"unicorns\" became tacky, cliche, and uncreative. Bobby saw more potential in unicorns than that! He wanted to bring back the cool things about unicorns, so he decided to collect a bunch of them to show the world -- unicorns that are weird and unusual. \n\"Unusual Unicorns\" is an art book filled with sketches and fully-colored illustrations of over 40 different types of unicorns. The book takes you into a world that no one has entered before; the possibilities of these unique unicorns are endless. \nCredits: Alice in Wonderland, Alice Through the Looking Glass, Men in Black III, Niko and the Sword of Light \nEach book is carefully bound in 8\" x 10\" inch hardcover, containing 72 pages of beautiful, full-color pages! It includes sketches, drawings, traditional watercolor, and digital paintings! \nBobby and Masae will each have a new art print made especially for this Kickstarter! These will be included in every book exclusively for backers of this campaign, so now will be the only chance to get them! \nThrough this Kickstarter, you will also have the chance to get your hands on ORIGINAL drawings and paintings of images that appear in the books! Check out the \"Original Art Rewards\" packages below to see which originals you can get! When you back one of these, you will receive both \"Kin\" and \"Unusual Unicorns\", 2 exclusive mystery prints, AND the original artwork listed! \nThe art books also include contributions from an amazing list of guest artists!\nThere will only be 500 copies of each book available, so don't miss your chance to grab one! To help back this campaign, we offer package deals of both books for a great price!  \nWe have 10 more slots of New Original Art rewards open! \nIf we reach the $40K mark, we will open up more new originals rewards with art that won't appear in the books, so it will very special and exclusive! There will be 10 new reward packages in total to give you more opportunities to purchase original art. \n*shipping & handling rates will apply\n\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already over come most of the risk and challenges that come with Kickstarters for art books, such as completing all artwork, editing the files, finalizing the design and finding a manufacturing company. We are scheduled to have the books manufactured before the funding period ends, so we will start packaging up the rewards ready to ship as quickly as possible! We will be sending you a survey through Kickstarter, asking you for your shipping address.\n\nWe have run multiple successful Kickstarters in the past (Niko and the Sword of Light, and Schoolism Subscriptions) so this process is nothing new to us!

I am a British artist living in the UK and I have been working in the art industry for over decade. It gives me tremendous joy to release my third self published art book, \"The Turning Shape\".  \n\"The Turning Shape\" is brimming with traditional pieces of beasts, monsters, and creatures, all of which dwell within my subconscious. My art is many things - Mostly therapy, but also a journey into what it means to be human.\nOriginal Artwork of La Loba and The Witch\nNew large originals\nWolf Girl original (sold out)\nPhases Original\nBuck Rabbit Original\nCrow Original\nPrints available\nShapeshift Tote bag\nDead inside but cute mini print FREE!\nMore stretch goals to be announced!!\nFAQ  \nWhy Kickstarter? \nI'm using Kickstater as a preordering platform. The book is well underway already and i'm expecting to go to print as soon as the campaign has ended. This way I know how many to order!  Kickstater has been used previously for my last two art books which smashed their goals in a matter of hours. Both of these books have now sold out!\nThe great thing about using Kickstater is that I can get the funds upfront to pay for the printing costs, merchandise, and shipping materials. \nWhen will the books be shipped?\nThe plan is to get the books printed by the end of July and make a start on shipping in August. However, please allow up until November especially if your book requires a drawing or commission. I'll keep everyone fully up to date in the journal posts on Kickstarter! \nWhen will payment be taken? \nPlease remember that payment will be taken at the END of the campaign, so please keep this in mind! Payments that fail at the end of the campaign will loose out on rewards. No reservations. \nHow will you get my address?\nWhen everything is ready to ship i'll be sending out a survey to collect any information I need to complete your order. Keep an eye out on the journal posts to let you know when the surveys are sent! You will also be sent an email.\nCan I pay extra for tracked and signed shipping?\nYes! Tracked shipping tends to be double the amount of standard shipping and you can pay the extra amount by Paypal at the end of the campaign. Just drop me a message! I don't make a profit on shipping.\nIn regards to the commission slot, what is allowed and what isn't?\nMy strengths are in monsters, werewolves, animals, pets , skeletons or skulls. Please don't buy the slot if you want a commission of machinery, a human, a copyrighted character, hateful propaganda, sexual or pornographic images (although tasteful nudity is fine). You would be welcomed to get the piece tattooed if you wanted to! If you're not sure please drop me a message!\nIs there any nudity or bad language?\nThere is no bad language. There is however some booty and tasteful nudity! Any nude character is not at all drawn in a sexual manner but more to reflect a natural state. \nAny other questions please just drop me a line!\nFind more of my work on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/wolfskulljack_art   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis being my third Kickstarter project, I am confident I can handle any issues that may come our way!

We know that shipping overseas is very expensive and we wish it was cheaper, too! We help by subsidizing some of the shipping cost. We make no money from the shipping.\n Jeff's Thoughts on Working with John Fleskes\nI love working with John because he makes beautiful books. It's as simple as that. He is a master craftsman, and I know that he will bring the same level of attention and care into bringing the book into the world as I did in creating the work within it. I could not have been happier with our first book together, Notes From The Shadowed City, and I can't wait to see what he does with The Thousand Demon Tree.\nJohn's Thoughts on Working with Jeffrey Alan Love\nI was mesmerized with Jeff's work from the moment I first saw it. I could tell immediately that this was an artist with that rare individual voice that could speak in soft tones, yet have a strong commanding presence through his art. Upon meeting Jeff I found someone with an equal passion and commitment to making art and books that had a genuine purpose. He is humble, one of the best storytellers and designers who I've met, and someone who lets his work speak for itself. It's a joy to work with Jeff--especially when I get to see each new work for the first time, and during the excitement that comes while we brainstorm ideas. It's pure pleasure to have this opportunity to bring his work into the viewers hands.\nJeffrey Alan Love is an award-winning artist and writer whose clients have included the New York Times, TIME, The New Yorker, Scholastic, HarperCollins, Tor, Gollancz, and others. Winner of the World Fantasy Award for Best Artist, a gold medal from the Society of Illustrators, a Silver Spectrum Fantastic Art Award, and two Academy of British Cover Design Awards, he has been nominated for The British Fantasy Award, The British Science Fiction Award, and the Chesley Award.\nA message from the Publisher, John Fleskes: What Kickstarter offers is the opportunity to create and do what we love, while connecting and giving back to our supporters in a personal way. This makes the process much more enjoyable than if we simply worked behind closed doors. It is also gratifying to have the opportunity to continually add value to the project through stretch goals. I've never felt that we are making products. Instead, we are making unique art books and prints. This is done with great care to best allow us to showcase Jeff's art in a way that we can be proud of. We hope that you will cherish them just as much as we do.\nThe Thousand Demon Tree is trademark and \u00a9 2018 Jeffrey Alan Love.

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having a sixteen year record of delivering over eighty books of the highest quality. I've run eight previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before.

The comic will conclude in April 2018, and is conceived, written and illustrated by me, Der-shing Helmer, the Ignatz-award winning artist of The Meek.\nThis Kickstarter campaign brings the complete 270+ page full-color story to life in beautiful print form for the first time, in both softcover and Limited Edition hardcover.\nwrow! Thanks to overwhelming response, the number of available hardcovers has been increased :]\nAs usual, my number one goal is to make a beautiful and durable book with a ton of unlockable upgrades which will be automatically added to your edition as the campaign progresses.\nHow will this version differ from the online comic? Well, the print and PDF editions contain entirely new pages, edits and improvements to the art and writing, and \"one year later\" illustrations to lend a sense of closure to the characters and story, and an afterword. These additions are limited to the Kickstartered editions only, and will never be shared or posted online.\nextra content + all the pages you know and love (except, you know, edited)\nMare Internum is a labor of love, and from the very beginning has been a creator-owned comic funded by its dedicated readers. Your pledge supports a high-quality, independently produced book created with immense pride and personal attention to each step of the process.\nTo celebrate my first complete self-published book, I'm also offering several rewards:\nCOLLECTOR'S PIN: I am once again teaming up with the incredible Maya-styled artist MonaRobot (Tumblr | Patreon) to create the PROCESSOR, a sister pin to her incredible limited KALLAKORE design from the Friends in Dark Places Kickstarter campaign.\nJust like the first pin, this pin will be stamped, numbered, and will come mounted on a breathtaking metallic backing card. And as with the first pin, the PROCESSOR pin is limited to just 150 copies which will never be reprinted [EDIT:Due to me being an idiot who lowballed the interest in this pin, I'm increasing this number to ~300 pins (and Mona is receiving a bonus)! The lower your backer number, the lower the backstamp number on the pin you receive]. Check out our previous collector's pin below:\nDIGITAL COMICS: I've hired none other than Abby Howard, whose work I love dearly, to do some digital humor strips for all of us... omg\nEXTRAS PDF: Vaguely aware of the presence of tons of extra content, but not motivated enough to wade through 3 years of Patreon archive to find it? Don't you worry, you'll be given a handy PDF copy of all this bonus info in one place, as well as additional brand new content for long-time readers!\nPRINTS: a set of prints created by some of my (and your) favorite artists, which will be revealed as stretch goals are met. I'm srsly excited about these you guys\nBOOKPLATE: a custom-made color bookplate which will be unavailable outside of this campaign\nBOOKMARKS: a set of three beautiful graphic bookmarks to be included with every book purchase\nSIGNED AND SKETCH: each of these very limited signed books will also come with a hand-drawn ink drawing of a Mare character of your choice for you to sell for a tidy profit after I'm dead\nBUMPER STICKER: Keep Mars Red! Originally just a silly worldbuilding detail/ homage to the popular California bumper sticker, now an actual position to have irl T__T Please don't ruin Mars (btw, this bumper sticker will be printed on removable vinyl, so no worries about messaging up your car permanently~)\nMORE?? yes, there are more secret rewards which will be automatically applied to your tier as we unlock the following goals \u2193\nI like my Kickstarters chock full of unlockables, and this one is no exception. We've got a slew of delightful and incredibly talented guest artists, as well as numerous upgrades and add-ons to apply to your book or pledge tier free of any additional charge once these goals are met. You'll just keep getting extra stuff, and best of all you're helping a bunch of other science and comic artists ~who are not me~ get paid.\nWant to try and unlock a few?

I decided to take it to the next level and do my best to make a big change, in a way that could reach everyone.\n(I'm the one on the left)\nAfter illustrating the successful Kickstarter of Prof. Dan Ariely - \u201cThe Irrational Game\u201d (1800% funded!), and after following its process, I know how things work and feel ready to manage this big production.\n\nI base all information in the book on studies and reliable data, and you can easily find the references cited in the book and website. All nutrition information is written and verified by awesome vegan nutritionist BSc Tal Porat who volunteers in Challenge 22+ (Experience veganism for 22 days) as a professional clinical dietitian, as well as other experts.\n  Some of our experts, examining a walnut\nI would like to thank Ziv Meltzer, Oren Fait, Gal Mamalya and Omer Matityahu for their effort, motivation, and support during the creation of this project. Special thanks to Shirley Charlie Kleinman and Shachar Bechor for being great vegan charm models. A big thank-you-almond-cheese-cake to Neta Dror for consulting and doing the things I'm not good at.\nThe book has many more important issues to cover, such as:\nNutritional comparison of plant-based VS non plant-based foods \u2022 Plant-based Omega 3 \u2022 Dietary fibers \u2022 Shattering the myths \u2022 Meat substitutes \u2022 Building a healthy plant-based grocery list \u2022 Easy to make plant-based burgers \u2022 Soaking and sprouting \u2022 Breastfeeding on a vegan diet \u2022 Kids and plant-based food \u2022 Super-healthy smoothie ideas \u2022 Nutrition facts reading guide \u2022 How to replace sweets with healthy eating \u2022 How to eat a raw plant-based diet \u2022 Sample meal plans for the vegan athlete \u2022 Answers to common questions \u2022 Oils guide \u2022 Tofu and Tempeh \u2022 Keto diet (and others) \u2022 Plant-based versions of common recipes \u2022 Amazing things you can do with aquafaba \u2022 Cultured vegetables \u2022 22 days vegan challenge kit \u2022 How a plant-based diet can help you lose weight \u2022 The E number dictionary \u2022 Things you need to know about Vitamin B12 \u2022 The plant based pyramid \u2022 and more\u2026\nSome of the topics are already sketched, but we need your support to develop them into beautiful, funny and useful illustrated pages.\nIf you'd like to write about us, you can find high-resolution page samples, logos, rewards photos and campaign video here.\nYou can contact us via email: hello@simplehappykitchen.com\n\u2665 Thank you for your support! \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile every project comes with risks and challenges, I feel more than confident the book and rewards will make it into your hands.\nMy goal is to make the highest quality products, so I\u2019m working with a top-quality printing house and manufacturers, using the best quality materials. I received samples from the suppliers, and they look great, so I feel very comfortable with starting mass production of the rewards as soon as the campaign ends.\nThe wonderful team behind Simple Happy Kitchen is highly experienced with designing, printing, manufacturing and fulfilling shipments worldwide.\nOf course, there can always be unexpected delays with bulk orders once the Kickstarter is complete, but I promise to do my best in communicating any delays or issues.

With contributions from twenty witchy femmes, queer conjurers, and magical rebels, BECOMING DANGEROUS is a book of intelligent and challenging essays that will resonate with anyone who\u2019s ever looked for answers outside the typical places.\nThe latest book from Fiction & Feeling, a new and independent UK publishing company, the book is edited by me, Katie West, and Jasmine Elliott. From ritualistic skincare routines to gardening; from becoming your own higher power to searching for a legendary Scottish warrior woman; from the fashion magick of brujas to cripple-witch city-magic; from shoreline rituals to psychotherapy\u2014this book is for people who know that now is the time, now is the hour, ours is the magic, ours is the power.\nOriginally, this book was going to be about the secret and safe spaces women create for themselves and each other. But as I was exploring that idea, I started to notice that so many babes I knew were turning to each other in more ritualised ways. I saw my friends creating private covens on Facebook, casting emoji spells to protect each other, sharing ritualised skincare routines, using tarot readings to make their weekend plans, making offerings to the Goddess, and performing binding spells on their President.  \nI loved looking at the different ways in which women and LGBTQIA people; people of colour; nonbinary, and gender variant people were all summoning power in a world that prefers them powerless. The world is not a fair and equal place and, for many of us, that makes it a scary place. The culture we live in is built on systems of oppression and a patriarchal imbalance of power. We\u2019re regularly faced with threats to our agency and authority. Those with power are not keen on sharing, and those of us without are left with discovering ways to summon it for ourselves. Discovering power that hasn\u2019t been given to us begrudgingly or allocated sparingly makes us threatening. Power makes us dangerous. \nI knew I wanted to make a book about this. I wanted a book for people who needed to discover ways to summon their own power and become dangerous. \nRituals, and magic in general, tend to increase in popularity during times of uncertainty and unrest. So at a time when there are forces at work in the world that threaten our freedoms, rights, and well-being, now is the moment to go dark and fuck shit up. This book collects twenty remarkable, defiant writers doing whatever they need to do to get people to stop fucking with their energy. The essays are personal explorations about how and why rituals of resistance work for them. Our goal is that this 300-page softcover book can help you to summon your own power to resist, survive, and thrive. \nThis project won\u2019t be possible without your help! Please check out our amazing rewards and pre-order your copy of BECOMING DANGEROUS today. Also! Please share this Kickstarter with the people you know who could do with becoming a bit more powerful, a bit more dangerous.\nContributors for this book write for publications like The Guardian and The Paris Review; websites like Autostraddle, The Hoodwitch, VICE, Broadly, and Nylon; and have published books and journal articles with several different publishers. \nSome identify as witches; others identify as writers, musicians, or artists. All of them have developed personal rituals to summon their own power and want to share these personal experiences of resistance and survival with you.\nCara Ellison(Embed With Games, Polygon 2015) \u25b2 Catherine Hernandez  (Scarborough, Arsenal Pulp Press 2017) \u25bc Deb Chachra (The Atlantic, The Guardian) \u25b2 Gabriela Herstik (HelloGiggles, Nylon)   \nJaliessa Sipress (The Hoodwitch) \u25b2 J.A.

If we reach this level, we'll be able to add three new contributors to this book. Spread the word and share this campaign so we can get to this level and get more rituals, more power! \nOne of the driving principles at Fiction & Feeling is that our creators are paid fairly; this accounts for why contributors' compensation is the biggest slice of our funding pie. \nOur initial campaign goal covers all printing, design, and editing costs; provides compensation for all of the contributors in the book; and goes toward shipping costs, reward production, and Kickstarter/credit card fees. \nHere's the breakdown:\n  To make sure this project is a success, I'm working with Backerkit to ensure the back-end of this campaign runs as smoothly as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project comes with risk, and this one is no exception. However, I've done everything I could to mitigate those risks. \n\nI've helped prepare, run, and fulfill several Kickstarters before in my past life as a personal assistant to creatives. I have great support from some Kickstarter superstars (thanks, Hope!), and I've been preparing this Kickstarter for almost a year. I've published books before and the last publication I did was the project I did to learn everything I needed to know to make this project happen. I've made mistakes and now know how to avoid them.\n\nI do not require finished pieces of writing from contributors until the Kickstarter is fully funded and they can be paid for their work. This means it's a possibility that a contributor's situation may change at some point between the beginning of the campaign and the end of it, making it impossible to write their piece. However, we will do our utmost to keep the line-up as advertised, and no matter what, you will be getting a book with twenty authors and they are all going to be incredible.\n\nDespite the best preparations, things can still happen. Printers can be later than they say, shipments can get mixed up or lost, suppliers can be late on delivery. I can't control those things, unfortunately, but I am an excellent communicator and will keep you up to date on issues as they arise and let you know how they're being handled.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "THE DIGITAL RITUAL", "descp": "A digital copy of Becoming Dangerous\nINCLUDES:\nDigital copy of Becoming Dangerous", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["261 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "THE PHYSICAL RITUAL", "descp": "Get the main attraction: THE BOOK!

Freaking the fuck out in traffic... avoiding important shit we have to do... being a dick to people we care about... What the hell, brain? \nThis is a book about how to make friends with your brain again. In her unique, unforgettable voice, Dr. Faith Harper shows you how your brain is actually trying to help you and provides practical, simple exercises for teaching it to work for you rather than against you. The second half of the book includes chapters honing in on stress, anxiety, anger, depression, addiction, grief, and other specific ways our brains get fucked. \nReading this book is like having a friend with a PhD talk you through all your stuff with easy-to-understand science and plenty of cussing. Unfucking your brain is totally possible! Why not start now?\nAbout the Book\n  Unfuck Your Brain: Using Science to Get Over Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Freak-outs, and Triggers by Dr. Faith G. Harper comes out from Microcosm Publishing in fall, 2017. Back it here and get your copy before its official release!\nAs for the book... we'll let it speak for itself. Here's an excerpt from the introduction:\nThis book is essentially all about trauma. And our traumatic responses, life bullshit, and other-people dickitude that gets in the way of us kicking ass at life. It\u2019s also about how we create coping strategies that deal with this bullshit that fancy doctor people like to label with words like anxiety, depression, addiction, anger, etc. \nThese strategies are part the whole complicated process of your brain responding after shit goes down in your life. The brain is really just trying to do its job by protecting you the best way it knows how. But the brain often ends up being a not-particularly-helpful asshole instead. It\u2019s like your friend that offers to beat the shit out of anyone who upsets you. Gratifying, but not helpful in the long run.\nThis book is also about general life bullshittery and other-people\u2019s dickitude. The shit that might not be traumatic but gets in the way of us kicking ass at life. The ways we manage stuff that isn\u2019t full blown trauma\u2026but sure as fuck isn\u2019t kittens, rainbows, and teddy bears. Like with trauma, the coping skills we create for THESE situations tend to be less and less useful over time and downright exhausting.\nThe good news is, no matter how long you\u2019ve been stuck in this quicksand you CAN rewire your response and unfuck your brain.\nHere's a video of Dr. Faith reading a section from the introduction, \"Who This Book is For\" (spoiler alert: very possibly you!).\nPLAY\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Faith G. Harper, PhD, LPC-S, ACS, ACN is a bad-ass, funny lady with a PhD. She\u2019s a licensed professional counselor, board supervisor (that means she teaches therapists to be therapists), certified sexologist, and applied clinical nutritionist with a private practice and consulting/training business in San Antonio, TX. She has been an adjunct professor and a TEDx presenter and proudly identifies as a woman of color and uppity intersectional feminist. \nAbout the Publisher\nMicrocosm Co-Owners Joe Biel + Elly Blue\n  Since 1996, Microcosm Publishing has been creating books and zines that help you empower yourself to change your life and world for the better. We operate out of a bright green building in Portland, Oregon, where we try to have the most fun every day.\nRewards\nAre you ready for some books and zines that will change your world? We've gone through our catalog and chosen a selection of care packages bound to help you shift the balance to change your life and world.\n5-Minute Therapy Zines\nIt takes about 3 years for a book to come out. Instead of waiting that long to have a thing to share with her clients, students, and the world, Dr. Faith decided to start cranking out zines\u2014which are basically like much-shorter, photocopied books that you can put out into the world as fast as you can write them. And Faith can write fast, and has a lot to say. By the time this book comes out, we'll have published more than 20 of her zines, with more on the way, on topics ranging from boundaries to friendship breakups to dating to succeeding at work to living with an STI. \nSome of the zines ended up becoming chapters of the book; when we're choosing specific ones to send you along with your book, we won't choose those.\nAnd yes, we have a reward level where you can get ALL THE ZINES.\nUnfuck Your Mind & Body\nFor this reward level, we'll send you a selection of books we've published about mental and physical health.\nUnfuck Your Body & Mind\nGood Trouble is Microcosm founder Joe Biel's biography of learning to turn Autism into a superpower\nMaps to the Other Side is Sascha DuBrul's story of being young, punk, and bipolar and building a radical mad rights movement\nSick is a compilation zine about physical illness\nBamboozled is a true-life parable about the hazards of not unfucking your brain\nDistance Makes the Heart Grow Sick is Cristy C. Road's art book featuring emotive young people expressing themselves and changing their lives.\nCycletherapy shares different stories about healing from grief through the comforting and cathartic act of bicycling\nUnfuck Your Lifestyle\nOf course, all this unfucking doesn't happen in a vacuum. You still have to work and eat and such. Once you start unfucking, though, you might find you want to do some of those things a little differently. Here are some guides. (At this level you'll *also* get all the books in the Unfuck Your Mind & Body reward.)\nUnfuck Your Lifestyle\n[IMAGE with book cover thumbnails]\nHow & Why is Matte Resist's manual and manifesto for sustainable urban living; projects range from building rain barrels to making music\nUrban Revolutions will teach you about the modern bicycle movement and how to revolutionize your own life on two wheels\nGrow is Eleanor Whitney's guide to turning your crafty passion into a business that supports you. Live your dream!\nScam is inspiration for a different sort of off-the-grid urban revolution\nUnfuck the World\nOnce you've taken a good, hard look inward, you'll likely want to turn your attention outside yourself again, this time with the tools to make lasting change in the world. We hope the authors of these books inspire you with what is possible. (Even better: By backing at this level, you'll also get ALL THE BOOKS in the previous two levels.)\nUnfuck the World\nBeyond the Music interviews dozens of people who are living their values in all walks of life\nIn Cambodian Grrrl, Anne Elizabeth Moore travels to teach young women to make zines\nKatrina's Sandcastles is Kaycee Eckhardt's tale of students overcoming great odds in New Orleans schools\nWhy We Drive is Andy Singer's part-comics journalism showing the checkered history of the private automobile and its alternatives\nX-Ray Visions is a documentary movie about the all-ages music venue and cultural icon that defined Portland, Oregon in the 90s", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been publishing books for more than two decades, and we're pretty good at it by this point, if we do say so ourselves.

And learning not to beat ourselves up over normal stuff like this is a key factor in unfucking our own brains. \n\nThank you for trusting us with your pledge!

I'm Lucy Bellwood, a professional Adventure Cartoonist living in Portland, Oregon. I'm running this campaign to fund a printed collection of my 100 Demon Dialogues Project and a companion plush toy to keep you all company as you bicker with (and perhaps get to love) your own inner jerks.\nWhat's all this about? Here's the scoop:\nBack in 2015 I started exploring a series of illustrated dialogues between myself and a small, obnoxious character who had a lot of big ideas about everything I was supposedly doing wrong in my life and my career. \nSharing these illustrations induced a particular kind of catharsis: it turned out most everyone I knew was struggling with feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety. Externalizing these conversations and giving them a humorous twist often enabled me to overcome my self-doubt and get on with the exciting business of Making Good Art\u2014and it seemed to help other people do the same.\nThis year, for The 100 Day Project, I decided to delve deep into these Demon Dialogues. For the past three months, I've been drawing a demon every day, exploring all the ins and outs of the creative process, growing up, and trying to live a balanced life as an adult in the 21st century. (You can read all the entries online for free right here.)\nThe project has garnered a massive and humbling response. I've heard from so many people who saw themselves in these illustrations and were able to laugh at the absurdity of the demon's demands or nod in recognition when something hit too close to home. Lots of people were asking for books or prints, so I decided to launch this campaign to bring a physical edition of the project to life.\nThe primary goal of this campaign is to produce a print edition of the complete 100 Demon Dialogues series. I'll be making softcover and hardcover editions available, both with all the fancy bells and whistles I can think of. \nSoftcover editions will measure 6\"x 6\" and feature French Flaps, color covers, spot foil, and patterned inner covers.\nHardcover editions will measure 6\" x 6\" and feature ribbon bookmarks, colored spine stitching, spot foil, and patterned endpapers.\nBoth editions contain all 100 entries from this year's 100 Demon Dialogues project, printed in black and white, plus a brief essay on what I learned while completing the project. If things go really well, I'll be including a gallery of additional demon entries from previous iterations of this project, but let's get the basics down first.\nOf course, the logical companion for the print edition is a cuddly demon of your very own! \nI've partnered with Soft Stuff Creations to produce a plush toy demon for all your bickering needs. Here's a look at the prototype:\nThis little fella measures about 15\" from tip to tail and has beans in his backside so he can easily sit up on any surface you care to place him on. The body and eyes are both ultra-soft, short fur, and the eyes and mouth have embroidered edges. His floppy limbs windmill in a very pleasing manner when you throw him down a flight of stairs, too. \n\"Ugh, I can't believe you like this band.\"\nSoft Stuff Creations has a stellar record of producing plush toys for folks like KC Green and Kate Beaton, and I'm really excited to be working with them for this reward.\nWhile I'm deliberately keeping this campaign simple so I can better focus on producing high-quality books and toys, I am offering a limited-edition run of signed and numbered, reversible letterpress prints, produced in partnership with my pal Emily Riley of Rx Letterpress, a local Portland printer.\nThese prints will be 6\"x9\", featuring black and blue ink with a custom watercolor wash\u2014which means no two will be alike! You can hang them whichever way appeals to you the most, or switch \u2019em up depending on the day.\n(Concept art only, final design forthcoming.)\nIf you're looking for prints of specific Demon Dialogues, never fear: the fine folks at Buyolympia have got you covered. You can buy prints of every single demon from the series right here.\n  Of course, producing all these exciting things takes money, which is where Kickstarter comes in! The operating budget for this campaign looks like so:\nFor all you number nerds, here's the breakdown. [Note: these numbers are current quote estimates and may change, but we've been careful to overestimate where possible so there won't be any nasty surprises.]\n~$9,540 to Soft Stuff Creations for plushie design and production.\n~$3,050 to the print team for book production and shipping.\n~$1,000 for print brokerage and negotiation.\n~$8,000 to Blackbox, who will be bringing their stellar customer service and logistical experience to the table to get your packages shipped intact and on schedule.\n~$600 to Allyson Haller, my fabulous book designer.\n~$320 to Rx Letterpress for limited-edition demon prints.\n5% for Kickstarter fees (about $1,214, with current figures).\n2-5% for credit card processing fees (variable, but again: about $1,200).\nThis takes us just about up to $25,000, which you'll notice is the goal for this campaign. I try to be transparent about my finances as often as possible, so here's the deal: this campaign is to fund the production of these items, which is why I\u2019m setting the base funding goal at 25k. \nHowever, reaching the magic number of $32,500 will ensure that I\u2019ll be able to afford the taxes on this income (The More You Know: Kickstarter money counts as income for creators!). The final rate may be less than 30% because many of these expenses are deductible, but it's always best to play it safe where this stuff is concerned. \nThere are no official stretch goals for this campaign because I wanted to jump straight into making the best possible thing right off the bat, so consider this our one above-the-mark mission. Deal? Deal.\nSupport Team\nI'm thrilled to be working with the following companies to ensure the backend of this campaign runs as smoothly as possible:\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third Kickstarter campaign, and I'm really looking forward to implementing everything I learned during my first two successful experiences.\n\nAll the illustrations in the 100 Demon Dialogues series are complete! I've been working hard to get as much of the book design done ahead of time as possible, so all that remains is gather that artwork and getting the final files put together with my fabulous book designer, Ally.\n\nFor both books and plushies: production and transit time are hefty where overseas projects are concerned. I'll be keeping backers abreast of the production process so they can see what goes into designing and producing these objects, but we can't get around how long it takes them to arrive from abroad. \n\nOur March 2018 arrival estimate is VERY generous to allow maximum time for potential delays. I'd rather your rewards be a pleasant, early surprise than an overdue burden! I will, of course, keep everyone fully apprised in the updates of when to expect their goods. Blackbox and BackerKit, our survey and fulfillment companies, both have fantastic customer service and backend interfaces to help guarantee that your books and plushies arrive in a timely and undamaged fashion. I have the utmost faith in them. \n\nAside from shipping delays, though, we're looking at a solid, stress-free experience bringing some exciting things into the world.

The more we raise, the better quality film we can deliver. A budget breakdown is included at the bottom this post.\nHair Love, is a 5 minute animated short film that centers around the relationship between an African-American father, Stephen, his daughter, Zuri and her hair. Despite having long locks, Stephen has been used to his wife doing his daughter's hair, so when she is unavailable right before a big event, Stephen will have to figure it out on his own. This sounds simple enough, but we soon come to find that Zuri's hair has a mind of its own. \nThis story was born out of seeing a lack of representation in mainstream animated projects, and also wanting to promote hair love amongst young men and women of color. It is our hope that this project will inspire.\nI've had the idea for this project for a couple of years now, but it wasn't until I recently started coming across a lot of viral videos of black fathers interacting with their sons and daughters online that I finally had the confidence to try and make this a real thing. Below are great examples of some of the great viral videos I have come across in the past year:\nThrough this project, it is my hope that we can show a positive image of black fathers and their daughters, while encouraging natural hair and self-love throughout the world through the animated space.\nCHARACTERS:\nZURI (Daughter)\n STEPHEN (DAD)\nANGELA (Natural Hair Vlogger)\nROCKY (Pet Cat)\nMeet the crew:\nMATTHEW A. CHERRY (WRITER/CO-DIRECTOR)\nThis will be my first attempt at an animated project, but my 3rd Kickstarter campaign and I am super excited about this project. Previously, I directed two Live-action feature films: The Last Fall and 9 Rides, both of which premiered at SXSW, as well as, two Live-action short films: This Time and Forward, in addition to many music videos.\nJASON MARINO (CO-DIRECTOR)\nI will be co-directing this short film with the incredible 3D artist, Jason Marino. I came across his short film, Tamara on Twitter a few months ago and tracked him down so we could collaborate on this project. Check out his short film, Tamara below.\nVASHTI HARRISON (CHARACTER DESIGNER)\nVashti Harrison is a remarkable artist and filmmaker in her own right. Vashti illustrated all of the 2D character designs featured in our Kickstarter campaign. Vashti is also ramping up to release her first children's book Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History, which you can pre-order right here: https://t.co/m554qLrvi4. You can also check out some more of her work below\n PETER RAMSEY (Executive Producer)\nPeter Ramsey is a legend in the animation game, and we are so fortunate to have him be a part of this project as an Executive Producer. Peter was the first African American director to direct a big studio, feature-length, animated film, Rise of The Guardians, and he is currently co-directing Sony's new animated Spider Man film that will feature, Miles Morales for Sony. Peter, is also an accomplished story board artist.\nFRANK ABNEY (Executive Producer)\nFrank Abney is another legend in the animation game that we are super excited to have as a part of this project. Frank was named one of Variety's, 10 Animators to Watch in 2016. Frank has worked on projects such as, Big Hero 6, Frozen, Kung Fu Panda 3, The Boss Baby, and Coco and is currently working on the upcoming Incredibles 2, while continuing to develop his own projects and short films. Frank is a valuable asset to the team. He likes to work on projects that spotlight strong African-American characters and illuminate key events from African-American history. \nMONICA A. YOUNG  (Producer)\nMonica Young has worked with me on all of my projects on the producing side and is another invaluable resource to the team. Emerging from the music industry, she has recently added film and TV producing to her repertoire. Monica is a super knowledgeable and experienced producer that will be helping to coordinate all of the music on the film, ranging from helping with composer selection to curating all other necessary music.\nJEROME CALDWELL (Producer)\nJerome Caldwell was a producer on my latest feature film, 9 Rides and has been a resource on a lot of my prior projects. He is a great partner when it comes to producing and getting films done, and more than that he is a great person whose knowledge and expertise will be invaluable in getting this project completed, especially in the post-production phase.\nVAUGHN GILL (Producer)\nVaughn Gill initially worked with me as the attorney for my first feature \"The Last Fall.\" He served as one of the Executive Producers on my webseries \"Almost 30\" as well as my second feature \"9 Rides.\" As a Producer, Attorney and a Father who has had the \"Hair Love\" experience his expertise will be tremendously helpful in completing this project.\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN - 200k Stretch Goal\nStoryboarding - 5k\n3D Character Designs - 10k\nEnvironment Design - 10k\nVisual Development On Characters & Environments (Plus Color Script) - 10k\nCharacter Modeling, Texturing, and Rigging - 10k\nEnvironment Modeling & Texturing - 10k\nHair, Fur, and Clothes animation - 15k\nLighting/Rendering/Compositing - 10k\nAnimation - 15k\nEditing - 10k\nSound Design & Music Composition - 10k\nAnimation Producer - 10K\nVFX - 5K\nBusiness & Legal Expenses - 25k\nKickstarter Gifts & Shipping - 25k\nKickstarter Fees - 20k\nCONCLUSION\nWe have our goal set for $75k, but we are now trying to raise $200K or more to make this project at the highest quality level we can make it. The more we raise, the more people we can hire to work on it. We are aiming to do it in the same vein as other Pixar animated, short films, and as we all know animation is more costly than traditional Live-action projects and every little bit helps. Thanks so much for checking this project out, and I hope you'll help to support it. Sincerely, thank you. \n-Matthew A. Cherry", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge with the project is going to be managing the pipeline of the animation work.

In a perfect world would have liked to have gotten these out by Christmas. With that said most of the gifts are in my possession and I'm excited to finally be able to get these out to everyone. If you have moved recently or never filled out the survey please try and send us your updated shipping address as soon as you can. The only gifts that I do not have yet are the Zuri dolls (That will take another 4-6 months to create and ship), and we have a limited supply of the Hair Love pins so if you don't get them in this batch I will ship them out individually at a later date, and we're still figuring out the Making Of Coffee Table book. Also lastly about the digital download; now that we're Oscar nominated we're going to be hitting theaters in select cities on a tour with all the shorts through Shorts International and there are a lot of tricky eligibility issues that we have to navigate with the film. With that said to be safe we won't be sending out the digital download link until after the Oscars on February 9th. I hope you all understand. Now that we're with Sony Animation it's a bigger conversation and we're trying to be smart about maintaining our eligibility throughout this month long window we have before Oscar night.

Cooper patron!\nIn addition, each of these originals will appear in one of the books.\nA. \"Conquerer\" 8.5 x 10.5 inch, ink on acid-free 50lb bond paper\nB. \"Moth Friend\" 8 x 11 inch, colored pencil on acid-free 50lb bond paper\nC. \"Bear Family\" 10 x 8 inch, graphite on acid-free 50lb bond paper\nD. \"Salamander And Lion\" 10 x 8 inch, graphite on acid-free 50lb bond paper\nE. \"Tattooed Back\" 8 x10 inch, ink on acid-free 50lb bond paper\nF. \"Girlfriends\" 8 x 10 inch, ink on acid-free 50lb bond paper\nOriginal Art Note: Drawings may fade over time in direct sunlight; be sure to take steps when framing and deciding where to hang these pieces to guard against premature sun damage.\n Four Kickstarter Bonus Prints!\nExclusive Kickstarter Bonus Prints! We will include an 8 x 10 inch print of the pencil art for \"Rattle\" and \"Safe Passage,\" plus, prints for \"Smug POS Dogs\" and \"Smug POS Cats\" by Cooper for all pledges of $25 or more.\nStretch goals are bonus items that are added to the campaign as we hit certain goals. These are additional items that are free upgrades. As we gain more support, we offer more rewards as a special thank you.\nUNLOCKED--Stretch Goal #1 -- We will add an extra 16 pages to the Flora & Fauna book that will feature more animal drawings by Cooper. This will raise the page count for this one book from 64 pages to 80 pages!\nHardcover set slipcase design in progress.\nUNLOCKED Stretch Goal #2 -- We will add a slipcase to house the three book hardcover set. In addition, we will add the second 8 x 10 inch bonus print of \"Safe Passage\" to all pledges for $25 or more.\nUNLOCKED Stretch Goal #3 -- We love prints, and we love the idea of giving more of them away. We will include two more 8 x 10 inch prints featuring Cooper\u2019s Smug POS Cat\u2019s, and her equally Smug POS Dog\u2019s, to everyone who has pledged $25 or more!\nUNLOCKED Stretch Goal #4 -- We will add the 1 inch enamel pin \"Fig Frog\" to every pledge of $25 or more! This pin will only be available through this Kickstarter campaign. (Note that the design and colors are in progress and may change.) One per person.\nThe four bonus prints are available as one set per person.\nAdd-on anything to anything! An Add-On lets you pledge for more than one tier by adding the price of any additional tier to your existing pledge. Say you want to include an extra set of postcards? Simply add-on an additional $10 to your pledge and let us know. Want two of something? Double the pledge and let us know that you would like two of them. Please also double the shipping charge. Easy-peasy.\nYou can expect to receive your pledges by October. Since the books and prints have been designed already we will send them to the printer within a couple of weeks after the campaign ends if we hit our goal. It takes approximately three months for everything to be printed, then to be delivered to us. We will ship them to everyone immediately upon their arrival at our Flesk warehouse in Santa Cruz, CA.\nAll items shipped within the U.S.A. are by USPS Mail and will include tracking. The items shipped to our international friends usually take 3 weeks for delivery, but can sometimes take up to 3-6 weeks depending on the country. We know that shipping overseas is very expensive and we wish it was cheaper, too! We help by subsidizing some of the cost. We make no money from the shipping.\nSample book spread from Familiars\n  JOHN'S THOUGHTS ON J.A.W. COOPER\nThe first time I saw Cooper's art was when she submitted to Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art. This is when her art smugly entered my life, sat in front of me to show itself off, and literally caused a pause in time. I couldn't help but to absorb and enjoy her art for an undetermined (translates to very long) amount of time. This moment repeats itself every time I see a new piece of hers. She has the perfect mixture between the informed sciences and the surreal as she stretches reality into an abundance of unique views that constantly amazes. The intelligence and cleverness of her drawings are simply extraordinary.\nSample book spread from Viscera\n ABOUT J.A.W. COOPER\nJ.A.W. Cooper was born in England to a South African/British mother and an American father - both freshwater ecologists. She grew up traveling for their research and professor exchanges, living in Kenya, Sweden, Ireland and traveling across Europe. Home base was Southern California between trips, sabbaticals, and longer stays in other countries. Her mother always practiced art, in particular scientific illustration, and from an early age she was eager to learn how to perform the same kind of \"magic.\" Between my parent's dedication to ecology, our extensive traveling, and her mother's skill as an artists, Cooper was primed to be fascinated with flora and fauna and obsessed with capturing them in sketches and paintings.\nSample spread from Flora & Fauna\n  A message from the Publisher, John Fleskes: What Kickstarter offers is the opportunity to create and do what we love, while connecting and giving back to our supporters in a personal way. This makes the process much more enjoyable than if we simply worked behind closed doors. It is also gratifying to have the opportunity to continually add value to the project through stretch goals. I've never felt that we are making products. Instead, we are making unique art books and prints. This is done with great care to best allow us to showcase Cooper's art in a way that we can be proud of. We hope that you will cherish them just as much as we do.\nAll artwork is \u00a9 2017 J.A.W.

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having a fifteen year record of delivering over eighty books of the highest quality. I've run six previous Kickstarter campaigns, with Brom, Frank Cho, Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini, Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date. \n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before. You directly help us to make these beautiful books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "J.A.W.

Unsounded is published online for free right now and you can read it for yourself at http://www.unsoundedcomic.com.\nThe comic stars Sette Frummagem, a streetwise young pickpocket eager to please her dad, the local King of Thieves. In order to prove her worth, Sette is sent across the continent to collect on a debt from her cousin, with no one to protect her but a mysterious man named Duane who... happens to be undead.\nBattling and sneaking their ways past human traffickers, corrupt police officers, heroic royal guardsmen, nihilistic mages, and desperate criminals, our protagonists finally arrived at the headquarters of Sette's cousin. The second book ended on a tense note, with an injured Sette leading a menacing slaver back to a Love Hotel bedroom where there awaited a ravenous, oblivious, man-eating Duane!\nNow, in the third book, things get really weird. With a friend at your elbow though, you can survive almost anything... even the flip-side of reality. Even a pain-eating genocidal superweapon. Even a whorehouse musical!\nUnsounded is rated PG-13 for occasional rough language and violence. There are also a lot of boobs. Sometimes they talk!\nWhat's this Kickstarter for?\nLet's print Volume 3! Like the first two books it will be a professionally offset printed, perfect-bound, softcover tome. It will include chapters 7,8, and 9 of the comic, weighing in at 300 pages - what a beast! This is the longest of the books so far, with some of my favourite art and definitely some of the fan-favourite interactions and story twists! All comic art will be edited and retouched, and there'll be new interior illustrations. If the stretch goals are met I'll add additional, print-exclusive content. Would you like a senet bestiary?\nI also desperately need to reprint the first volume (again!) and hopefully reprint the second as well. Check out the stretch goals below for the skinny on that.\nGOOD v. EVIL - Put your mark on Unsounded\nI'm super stoked to be offering two KS exclusive 1\" x 1.25\" metallic hard enamel pins!\nBut you'll have to look deep inside yourself, backer, and determine your true nature. Do you cling to your best days? Do you focus on the positive and keep a khert-fish ever pinned to your pocket? Or do you walk beneath a dark cloud, smoke eels in your shadow, fixated on entropy and the inevitable end of yourself and all things? You can only choose ONE pin, so choose wisely! Whichever design sells the most will determine the art on the back of Volume 3. Will it be an illustration of the merry Adeliers, or the diabolical Frummagems? Duane's best days or Sette's worst? You decide.\nThese are Kickstarter exclusive and will not be kept in stock afterwards.\nStretch Goals!\n$55K - An illustrated senet bestiary. Senet beasts are the immortal first inhabitants of the Kasslynian continent, predating mankind and privy to the deepest secrets of the world. These mysterious creatures are mostly extinct, but the extant remainders range from silk-spinning worms to cannibalistic, mind-altering viper-men, to the water-blooded waterwomen and their airheaded brothers, the stormbringers.\n$60k - An illustrated short story. Duane was not a man of means in his younger days, and a desire to line his pockets drove him towards an unsavoury pursuit.\n$70k - Every copy of Volume 3 will come with a cool new sticker and bookmark.\n$80k - MOAR BOOKS. With enough dough I'll be able to reprint the entirety of the series to date, concluding with volume 2! This will allow me to open up that Complete Set Tier to the options of pins and bookplates, so that anyone who wants pretty much anything is able to pick it up. Until then, my stock is unfortunately limited to the 7 boxes left under my bed.\n$100k - In this impossible and dystopian future, every copy of volume 3 will come with a set of Unsounded art prints. This amount will not be reached, let us be satisfied with the reality into which we were born.\nThank you.\nUnsounded only continues to exist because of the support of its readers!. When you support the comic you become a direct patron of a independent story delivered ad-free and unfiltered to your eyes, creator to reader, without any middlemen in-between.

The cards themselves are printed on 3.5\"x5.5\", high quality, 350gsm card stock with rounded corners, so they're built to last even after you've given your hundreth relationship reading to that one friend of yours that asks every week... you know the one. \nThere are 22 Major Arcana cards, and 56 Minor Arcana cards, split into 14 cards of 4 different suits - swords, wands, pentacles, and cups.\nMajor Arcana\n The Major Arcana are the twenty-two trump cards at the beginning of a tarot deck. Each of these cards bearing a specific name and number carries a significant meaning when pulled during a reading, and are typically considered the most important cards in the deck. They are usually the first things a new tarot user will learn.\n0 - The Fool. Bringer of Beginnings\n  08 - Strength - Conquer Your Fears\n \n\nThe Minor Arcana\nThe Minor Arcana are the 4 suits, with 14 cards in each, that make up the rest of the 78 card tarot deck. Typically, they are sorted as Swords, Wands, Pentacles, and Cups. They serve to clarify detail and nuances in a person's tarot reading, depending where in the spread they lay. Think of them more as signifying changes or insight into your day-to-day life, whereas the Major Arcana is typically interpreted as having a more significant telling or impact - signaling a larger turning point in your life.\nThree of Swords - Difficulty, Loneliness, Betrayal\n  Ace of Wands - Confidence, Courage, Self Expression\n  Four of Pentacles - Greed, Control, Obstruction\n  Three of Cups - Friendship, Working Together, Celebration\n   \nThe ArCANIS Tarot Art Book is a 6\"x8\", 168 page, full color, hardcover book, designed to accompany the deck. Complete with written interpretations and meanings of the cards themselves, as well as popular tarot spreads for multiple types of readings, this book is for both the tarot expert and the newcomer who is just beginning to learn. The book can also act as a stand alone on its own for backers who just want to see the art in collection, who may or may not be interested in receiving an actual deck.\n    For the $16,000 stretch goal, I'll be able to have the cards foil stamped on both the front and back! The front and back border around the cards, and the silver area of the four suit design on the back of the entire deck will be foil stamped in silver.\nFor the $17,500 stretch goal, ALL BACKERS who pledged at the Hermit or Magician tier and above (Including the sold out $25 early-backer tiers) will receive a hard enamel pin - where the final design will be voted on in a final poll by backers!\n \nThe ArCANIS Tarot combines simple, modern character design with a love of animals. People can be very particular about the deck they use for their own readings, and with this in mind, I found it important to invest in designing a deck I would purchase for myself. I have wanted to illustrate a deck for nearly ten years, but could never find a design aesthetic that felt \"right\". There were many false starts over the years, but the moment I designed the Devil card for Inktober this past year, I knew I hit what I was looking for. \n\nI created the initial softcover book of the 22 Major Arcana for the CTN Animation Expo in November. The response I received at the Expo was so amazing that it really pushed me to make the full deck! To make things even better... I partnered with CTN's founder, Tina Price, to turn the original illustrations into a full gallery show, opening July 28th, at her amazing Center Stage Gallery in Burbank!\nCenter Stage Gallery in Burbank, CA\n  Center Stage Gallery in Burbank, CA\n    David DePasquale is a Los Angeles based visual development artist in the animation industry.

I'm not a graphic designer, so I'm working with the folks at Global PSD to make sure anything I design will print properly and in time. The book is a huge undertaking, and I'm double and triple checking my card interpretations and spread explanations to be absolutely certain I'm not publishing misinformation. \n\nWith any project involving publishing, whether it's a deck or a book or both, printing is always a risk. I have tried to do as much research as possible to assure I can get any and every reward out on time, and I would rather over estimate a shipping date than not be able to met my backers' expectations. Transparency and consistent communication are something I promise with this and every project I create in the future, and as I continue hitting goal posts with this project (i.e. receiving Hard Proofs of the book and deck, receiving updates with both printing houses regarding every stage of publishing, shipping updates, and any hiccups along the way) I will absolutely, 100% keep my backers informed.\n\nI am always open for questions... after all, we're on this journey together!

Naturally, coloring magical girls will be extra, super fun! Support this project to help me produce a book of beautifully detailed illustrations of original magical girls!\n\nThe 8\" x 10\" (approx. 20cm x 25cm) books will be printed via Smartpress.com on 100# cover, uncoated smooth paper. They will be coil bound along the top. The paper weight has tested well with colored pencil, crayon, and markers. Each page will have a blank backside to avoid problems with bleed of art materials. Books ship worldwide and shipping is free for all US backers.  \nBackers receive exclusive access to WIPs of the book art during and after the campaign. Plus, every backer gets a surprise digital coloring page just for supporting the project!\nThe following is a breakdown of the costs to make this project: \n$350 for Print Production & Shipment\n$400 for Art Production\n$50 for Fees\n$50 Buffer for Additional Costs\n$850 GOAL\nIf more books are produced than needed to fill Kickstarter orders, the additional books will be sold online and at conventions.\nAfter reaching our stretch goals, the book is currently at 25 pages (20 by me and 5 guest pages). Additional pages may become available as the campaign proceeds! Check updates for more information.\nThis goal unlocked at $1000! This means I will add 5 more illustrations and bring the total number of illustrations to 20! A perforated edge will be on each page for easy removal. \n$1500 funding level, we unlocked detailed backgrounds to all the pages drawn by me. The paper in the book will also be upgraded to thicker stock with no bleed in marker tests. \n A funding level of $2000 unlocked designs by Guest Artists!\nSpecial Guest 1: We welcome Juri H. Chinchilla to the project! Please visit the update post for more information about her!\nSpecial Guest 2: Runesael has joined us!

I do not have any conventions or major obligations this fall so keeping up with this will be my primary focus, however there's always a risk that life could throw in a surprise. For that reason, I've estimated the delivery in March 2017 to account for potential, unexpected events, and to give me enough time to complete all the art, order the books (including a full proof), and get everything shipped. \n\nI have used this printer before with my pose reference books and they have been fantastically reliable. In the case they cannot do the project for some unforeseen reason, I have additional options for print including through CreateSpace or Lulu.\n\nIf you have any questions about me or the project, please feel free to message me.

Wirelessly preview, capture, and transfer, with Bluetooth technology.\nEvery shot is perfect because you're the one who took it.\nUSE CASES\nYour phone is great, but it's not always the right camera for the job.\nOur customers love how easy it is to use Podo to enhance their lifestyles:\nEveryday adventures:\nSelf-portraits: Ditch your selfie stick for good.\nGroup photos: Fit everyone in on the very first try.\nFamily: Fun for even the most camera-shy little-ones.\nAnimals: Get up-close on their level with your pets.\nFood: Snap a recipe step-by-step or get that perfect food pic.\nCars: Use Podo as an easy backup cam.\nFor your passions:\nPhotography: A fun and creative addition to your gear bag.\nTravel: Never miss a photo op, without relying on strangers.\nStyle & Fashion: Check your outfit from the back, and take your #ootd.\nFitness: Check your form, yoga poses, and of course, progress pics!\nSports: Record your swing, or watch a basket from the back board.\nArtists: Dancers, musicians, stop-motion animators, painters, etc.\nTime Lapse: Set any interval for the easiest time lapse ever.\nPerfect for events:\nWeddings/Parties: Capture it all automatically with time lapse.\nConcerts: Get every angle of the venue without running any cables.\nMulti-angle: Use multiple Podos to capture everything at once.\nPhoto booth: Everyone loves a good photo booth!\nFEATURES\nLarge Pixel Size\nThe pixels on our sensor (2.2 \u03bcm) are 50% bigger than those in the iPhone 7 (1.5 \u03bcm) and the Galaxy S7 (1.4 \u03bcm).\nBigger pixels collect more light, leading to increased dynamic range, improved low-light performance, and reduced noise. Bigger pixels = better picture.\nChoosing a 5MP camera allows bigger pixels within the same sensor size, and is enough megapixels to print at 14\"x11\" full resolution.\nSee sample images here.\nMicro-Adhesive Sticky Pad\nPodo sticks with a quick press, then peels right off. It physically \"grips\" the wall so it doesn't wear out, and you can clean it with water. Think gecko's feet...but on a camera.\nNo other stands, clips, or mounts required. Just slip Podo in your pocket and you're good to go.\nSound like magic? It feels like it too! Just wait until you try it yourself.\nFor a short video on how it works, click here.\nThe Podo App\nOur camera may be tiny, but it becomes powerful by partnering with your phone. Bluetooth technology lets your phone act as a complete wireless controller.\n\n1. Wake Podo up and start the preview, all from within the app\n2. Adjust settings, hit the shutter, or start a countdown\n3. Choose your favorite shots and transfer them to your phone\nWhen you're done, just stick Podo in your pocket and it will return to sleep automatically. \nThe Podo App is free for iOS and Android. Requires iPhone 5/Android 4.4 or higher.\nPhoto transfer times vary with phone model and strength of Bluetooth connection. Typical transfer time for a 5MP photo is 2-4 seconds.\nApp Modes\nPHOTO: Simple. Fun. Our bread and butter.\nLAPSE: Set any interval for the easiest time lapse ever. (Does not require connection with phone)\nVIDEO: 720p HD video at 30 fps. Your phone records the audio like a wireless mic.\nMULTI (new): Capture photo, video, or lapse with up to 6 Podos simultaneously in a unique and immersive way.\nBOOTH (new): Easily provide the classic photo booth experience.

See bottom of page for detailed instruction.\n\nThe Choices:\nSticky pads are 12x6 cm and perfect for sticking your phone to your dashboard, hanging keys and cards by the door, or for mounting frames and posters. *These are stand-alone bonus pieces, not replacements for the Podo.*\nDrawstring bag is perfect as a gym back or light daily carry!\nCarrying case is made of high-quality Santoprene (industrial-grade, highly durable) and allows Podo to hang on your bag, belt, etc. Thanks to the success of this campaign, we're also including a neoprene sleeve with magnet enclosure that fully protects your Podo.\nBACKER REFERRAL PROGRAM\nRefer your friends and earn free stuff! Simple.\nWe count the number of Podos referred. So if your friend orders 6 Podos, you get credit for 6 referrals. What a good friend.\nThe top referrer overall also receives:\nTwo advance Podos from our manufacturing test runs\nThe very first Podo from mass production! (#001)\nSee the bottom of this page for the full how-to and program rules. Good luck!\n\nRETURNING BACKERS\nIf you pledge for a Podo yet again, we'll send you one free gift bundle of:\n3 piece Sticky pad set ($10 value) \nPodo carrying case ($10 value) \nDrawstring bag ($10 value) \nOur sincere gratitude, again.\nABOUT US\nThe founders, Eddie, Jae, and Sam, began as friends and roommates at UC Berkeley. We got tired of someone always getting left out of group photos and needing cables to transfer photos from Jae's DSLR. We wanted something much more versatile and easy to use, so we made it!\nWe raised $427,000 last year from over 3,600 amazing backers. Podo shipped worldwide, won global design awards, and starred on TV, magazines, and even a music video.\nPodo represents our passion, our team\u2019s grit, and our conviction that technology should be fun and simple. Thank you to every fan and supporter who\u2019s shown us love along the way.\nHOW TO ORDER\n1. Back this Project: Click \"Back This Project\" at the top of this page, or click here. You may choose a maximum of one reward level.\n\n2. Add accessories: Add $5 extra to your total pledge amount per accessory you would like to order. There is no limit to how many or which combination you can order, and there is no additional shipping cost required. See above for accessory choices.\n\n3. Finish payment, and that's it: Your credit card will not be charged until the campaign is completely over. Once it is charged, we will ask you for your shipping address and which accessories you chose, if any.\n\nNote: We do not handle VAT or other import duties for shipments, and we do not charge for this upfront. We are not professional agents in this regard and cannot give you estimates or tax advice. Backers may face additional customs costs upon delivery of their Podo. To avoid regulatory problems, we will put the reward level value (sans shipping) on the declaration. We cannot promise to do otherwise. Thank you!\n\nHOW TO ADD ACCESSORIES\nClick \"Manage My Pledge\", then \"Change your pledge\". Do not change your choice of reward.\n\nAs seen in the video below, you must manually add to your total pledge amount to reserve your accessories.\n\nWe will confirm your choice of accessories via survey once the campaign is over.\nPLAY\n\nREFERRAL PROGRAM RULES\n\nProcedure\nFind your backer number. To find it, visit https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/backings and find us under \"Active pledges.\" Scroll down.\nAffix your backer number to the beginning of podolabs.com followed by a period (no commas). \nFor example, backer number 9,999 would use 9999.podolabs.com\nShare your unique link with friends and family. \nIf they use it to order, you will automatically get credit!\nRules:\nYou must pledge for your own Podo(s) first.\nReferral credits are calculated after the campaign is over.\nWe cannot respond to individual requests for referral count status. \nCancelled orders or failed payments do not count. \nYour referral must use your link to pledge in one session or the referral will not register. \nPlease do not try to game the system (we'll know) or you will forfeit any and all rewards. \nThe Really Big Pack counts as ten referrals. \nIf someone has already pledged once, they cannot re-pledge using your link.\n3 days before the campaign concludes, we will post referral totals for all backers so you can get an idea. However, the official count will only come after the campaign concludes, as some referrals may cancel their pledge.\nThank you and good luck!\nEXTRAS\nVisit www.youtube.com/c/podolabs for fun and informational Podo videos!\n\nTake your camera and stick it:\n   Cher Lloyd - Activated Music Video\n    How Podo Works:\n                       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is no longer our first rodeo, and there are many reasons why we expect to deliver faster than last time. For one, this version is much improved but similar enough that we can reuse much of what we learned.\nSecond, we're further along in the manufacturing process; we've already down-paid for the early bird units and tooling has already begun. Third, our new manufacturer is much more experienced with high volumes of cameras. Lastly, we know not to run into the same certification delays as last time. \n\nAnd of course, we are still under Highway1/PCH's experienced wing, who's motto is appropriately, \"We Make\".\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "PODO FAN", "descp": "Thank you for supporting our dream!

The core of it is an illustration series that I've been working on for over twelve years. This is the second book in the series and is the largest collection of work from the project to date.\nThis is a story of the angelic order known as the Watchers that came down to earth to teach mankind. Despite their good intentions, they brought a down a catastrophe that completely destroyed their lineage. I've built upon the scraps of myth that surround these fallen angels to create original stories and illustrations that illuminate their epic tragedy.\nThe final book will be at least 92 pages worth of art, short stories and poems making it at least twice the content of the first book. It will be printed with a 9\"x12\" hard bound cover and dust jacket so that makes a matching set with Angelarium: Book of Emanations.\n  The central figures of this book are the Chiefs of Tens. They are the twenty most powerful members of the angelic host and lead the hundreds of Watchers who've made their new home on earth. Each one is corrupted in their own way and through their downfall, they come to embody the opposite of what once made them great. You can see illustrations for all twenty of them on the official website here along with the rest of the project: www.angelarium.net\nThere will also be a number of Seraphim in the book as well\nArtwork from Goni Montes\n   In addition to the book, I've created a number of complimentary items for fans that want something extra but also because I really enjoy making them. The sktchbooks, cards and coins exist because I love those sorts of things, so I created them to share with you.\nSketchbook - See the thoughts behind the work. This comprehensive companion book contains a complete collection of process drawings from the Book of Watchers.\nChallenge Coin - This totem for the project is a Kickstarter exclusive. Solid metal with embossed designs by Eli Minaya.\n Collectible Cards - An expansion of the first set released last year, this pack includes the names and writing from all 20 watchers in additional to alternate art for several angels.\n8\" x 10\" Prints - Many of the these packages include affordable luster prints done to the same loving quality is their larger counterparts.\n    Many of the most popular Watchers prints are sold out online. However, I am making my prints of them available as part of this print portfolio. All twenty 12\"x18\" Watcher prints are included, signed and delivered inside a custom gold and black portfolio.\n   There are 12\"x18\" prints of the Seraphim and Emanations are just like the ones I sell at conventions. Everyone who backs this campaign will have access to the opportunity to purchase these prints online for a limited time. This is one of the only times I will ever make these available outside of an in-person appearance.\nConventions prints will be sold through a secret part of the Angelarium store that will be linked to from a private update just for backers. There is no need to include additional funds as part of the campaign in order get them and they will be shipping far in advance of the rewards associated with the book.\nLimited Edition Prints\nbrowse available prints on the Angelarium store\n  There are no Limited Edition prints on offer through this campaign because they are actively for sale on the Angelarium.net store. They usually take between 1-5 business days to ship from my studio.\nAddons \n If you would like to combine tiers or purchase multiple copies of a tier, you may increase your pledge to cover the total amount of them added together. After the campaign ends, we will reach out to anyone with extra funds pledged to survey them about what additional rewards they are interested in. If you are interested in the first book in the series the complete Book of Emanations collection is currently available on Angelarium.net and usually ships within 1-3 business days.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe most complicated reward packages took nearly a full year to arrive to their backers last campaign. That's never the plan but sometimes unforeseen delays creep in. As delays unfold, I promise to keep backers informed as to their cause and what the revised schedule looks like. One of the team members or I will be addressing customer service issues throughout the process.\n\nWhile it's possible that the books themselves will see delays of weeks or months beyond the estimated delivery date, most of the other items from the collection are comparatively easy for me to produce and shouldn't contribute to any additional delays.

Our TRIUMPHANT RETURN to publishing classy, art-focused books by great creators in the worlds of independent comics and illustration.\n  MEREDITH GRAN lives in Brooklyn, NY where she draws the webcomic Octopus Pie and teaches at the School of Visual Arts.\nDUSTIN HARBIN is a cartoonist who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. He's probably best known for his autobiographical series Diary Comics, published by Koyama Press, and serialized on his website, dharbin.com. He is a pretty good kisser.\nBECKY DREISTADT is a painter based in Los Angeles, known for creating Capture Creatures, Tiny Kitten Teeth and Tigerbuttah! Currently Becky is a character designer for Disney Television Animation.\nEVAN DAHM has created and self-published the fantasy graphic novels Rice Boy, Order of Tales, and Vattu. He does a bunch of other illustration and stuff too. He lives in Brooklyn.\n  These books will match our three previous art book sets: they will be 6.625 by 10.25 inches, and 32 pages long. They\u2019ll have full-color, matte interiors, and their covers will be emblazoned with the seal of the Benign Kingdom in iridescent foil. Our intention is to make classy, no-nonsense books that show the art off above all else, and to offer a beautiful format for these artists to present work that may not have been published elsewhere, or is separate from the work for which they are most known.\nThe hardcover compilation will have the interiors of all four individual art books bound together in one book, with a foil seal on the cover. The cover images from the individual books will be included in the interior too, so nothing\u2019s missing from the hardcover.\nIn addition to the shiny new books, this Kickstarter is an opportunity to get books we\u2019ve previously published: in 2012 and 2013, Benign Kingdom published art books in the same format as the new series, by Yuko Ota, KC Green, Evan Dahm, Becky Dreistadt, Emmy Cicierega, Anthony Clark, Danielle Corsetto, Aaron Diaz, Emily Carroll, Gigi D.G., Tyson Hesse, and Phil McAndrew. You can in fact get ALL TWELVE of these original books here, if you\u2019re feeling it.\nThese other rewards come in two different packages:\nTHE BENIGN BOX contains two different older art books, selected at random, and a selection of things like prints, postcards, and other miscellany from the 2012-13 era.\nTHE FULL-REGALIA BOX contains ALL TWELVE of the older art books, and more prints & 2012-13 miscellany. This is probably the simplest and most cost-effective way to get all of these.\nBenign Kingdom was founded in 2012 by Yuko, Ananth, George, Frank, Becky, and Evan, and we've published a series of books that represent the work of independent artists in a classy way.

In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF\u2014and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.

Previously, we crowdfunded our two other \"Destroy\" special issues: In 2014, we published Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which was named one of NPR's best books of 2014 and won the British Fantasy Award; and in 2015, we published Queers Destroy Science Fiction!, which received similar acclaim.\nWhen not doing special issues devoted to destroying science fiction, LIGHTSPEED is usually edited by bestselling anthologist John Joseph Adams, editor of anthologies such as Wastelands, The Living Dead, and Brave New Worlds, and series editor of Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy.\nAll of the money raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of the POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and related stretch goals. Anything leftover after that will go toward the production of future issues of LIGHTSPEED.\nYou'll find our various reward options in a column on the right side of this page (PC/Mac) or on a separate page (iOS/Android). Below are some explanations and clarifications of our various reward options.\nAll backers who pledge at least $5 (the DESTROY SF! reward level) will receive an ebook copy of the LIGHTSPEED POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue. The special issue will be available in June 2016.\nAll ebook rewards, including ebook subscriptions, will be made available DRM-free in epub, mobi, and PDF format via our ebookstore. Mobi is primarily for Kindle/Kindle app users; Epub works on lots of things, such as Nook, Kobo, and iBooks.\nIf you select one of the subscription rewards, your subscription will begin with the June 2016 issue.\nSince all of the subscription rewards include the DESTROY SF! reward, the POCDSF special issue won't count against your subscription; so if you buy a one-year subscription, you'll really be getting 13 issues, rather than 12, etc.\nIf you are an EXISTING SUBSCRIBER: If you choose one of the subscription rewards, we'll just extend your current subscription by the specified term (i.e., by 1 year, 2 years, etc.). Note: We can only do this for subscribers who subscribe directly via the LIGHTSPEED store or via Weightless Books; unfortunately we can't offer to extend subscriptions for Kindle Periodicals subscribers. When we send out the Kickstarter survey after the campaign concludes, we'll ask you which store your subscription is currently with and renew it accordingly.\nIf you want the DESTROY PRINT reward, but also want to back at a higher tier, we also have options for that. Just look for the rewards that have PRINT in the titles.\nTo our international backers who want the DESTROY PRINT! reward\u2014we apologize for the stiff fee ($20) for international shipping, but that's what it costs, unfortunately! The print edition will likely be between 1-2 lbs., which means the shipping will be $18+, so we rounded that up to $20 for the \"handling\" part of \"shipping and handling.\"\nPREMIUM REWARD - Video Chats: Chats can be about whatever you want (within reason!) in connection with the theme of the project. So that includes the business of writing and publishing, science fiction/fantasy in general, POC SF/F specifically, etc. But if you just want to squee about your mutual interests, that's okay too!\nIn the event we massively exceed our goal, we'd like to thank our backers by offering the following stretch goals:\n(#1) $10,000 - Essays & Artwork Booster - UNLOCKED!\nThe Personal Essays we're posting on Kickstarter throughout the campaign will also be included in the issue, and we'll double the number of stories illustrated in the issue from four to eight.\n(#2) $15,000 - Destroy/Subscriptions Booster - UNLOCKED!\nIf you chose a LIGHTSPEED subscription reward, you'll get LIGHTSPEED issues #1-73 (including the POC Destroy Science Fiction! issue), and your subscription will begin with #74 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-73, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nIf you chose a NIGHTMARE subscription reward, you'll get access to NIGHTMARE issues #1-45, and your subscription will begin with #46 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-45, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nAll other reward tiers will get 3 additional back issues of LIGHTSPEED (for a total of 6), plus 3 back issues of NIGHTMARE and 3 back issues of FANTASY.\n(#3) $20,000 - JJA POC Sampler - UNLOCKED!\nLIGHTSPEED publisher John Joseph Adams will assemble an ebook sampler of POC-authored stories previously selected for publication in his many projects. Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be like a short anthology (about 50K words; about half the size of a normal anthology). All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\n(#4) $25,000 - Podcasts Booster - UNLOCKED!\nWe normally podcast 4 (out of 8) stories we publish on our website each month. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll podcast all 7 short stories we publish on the website, plus one of the flash fiction pieces. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\n(#5) $30,000 - POC Destroy Horror! - UNLOCKED!\nWe'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Horror! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, NIGHTMARE. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Oct. 2016]\n(#6) $40,000 - POC Destroy Fantasy! - UNLOCKED!\nWe'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Fantasy! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, FANTASY. FANTASY merged with LIGHTSPEED in 2012, but we'll revive it for this one special issue. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward.

[Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, then increase your pledge by the relevant amount.\nThere\u2019s no way to tell us NOW which add-ons you want (an unfortunate limitation of Kickstarter), so we\u2019ll get that information from you during the Kickstarter survey process after the campaign is over. Basically we\u2019ll send out the surveys and ask if you added any add-ons to your pledge, and then we\u2019ll cross-reference everything with the pledge data.\nSound complicated? It is! But it's the only way to offer the full array of options our backers have previously requested during our other campaigns.\nAdd-On Selections\nNote: All of the trade paperback rewards listed below INCLUDE the shipping price.

As the title of the book suggests, the last two years have seen wandering and struggle as I left my old life of freelancing in search of a new one. Although it is my third compilation of my work, it is the first in which all of the artwork was created not for commercial clients, but entirely for myself.\n I am a bona fide art book junkie, over the past dozen years I have collected around 400 volumes. This publication will feature everything I want in an art book and nothing I don't. It will be printed on nice, thick paper stock and feature tons of full page reproductions, extreme closeups, sketches, behind the scenes photos, step by step looks at the process and snippets of text here and there to give some insight into my work without boring the reader to death.\nThe softcover version of Exodus will be an open edition print run.  It will be approximately 50 pages long, A4 size (8.27 \u00d7 11.69). Each copy will come signed.\nA Kickstarter exclusive limited edition 8.5\" x 11\" print will be included in every reward tier. This image will only be available to backers of this campaign, and will come signed and numbered.\nSoftcover copies of my second art book, Awakening are also available. This is a 54 page, A4 size book. Each copy will come signed.\n(My first book, Prologue, is now out of print.)\nThe hardcover version of my book will be a one time, limited edition run available exclusively to backers of this campaign. It will feature all the content of the softcover plus an exclusive signature page shown below. Each copy will be signed, numbered and include a remarque (a small, rough pencil sketch that will be repeated in each book)\nEach 12\" by 16\" lustre finish print will come with a double mat measuring 16\" by 20\" on the outside. This standard size will make it easy and cheap for you to frame these. Most hobby or frame stores have dozens of frames in this size you can purchase for around $20-$30.\nThe prints are made by me, on my own printer using archival pigmented inks. Each print will come signed. You may choose from the selections below.\nSorry, but due to the size and costs of overseas shipping I am only able to offer these to U.S. backers.\nI am offering a small number of original paintings and drawings as rewards.  I don't have room to list them all here, but visit http://artofmike.com/shop/original-artwork-for-sale/   to see everything I have available.\nAgain,  due to size I can only offer U.S. shipping as a Kickstarter reward.

By backing this project you will help us to give you the opportunity to gain an insight into the working practices of some of your favourite artists, discover new techniques, and learn new skills from some of the most talented and popular creative minds in the world.\nWe have joined forces with a vast assortment of artists and have recruited them to help us make 100 hours of video training which we will make available for an affordable one-off price of \u00a318 (US$25). The beauty of 100 Hours is that there is no subscription required. By backing this project, you will be able to access an amazing 100 hours\u2019 worth of art tutorials, which you can download and watch over and over again. \nIf you back this campaign you will be given a unique login and password that will allow you to stream videos from the 100 Hours website on to your computer, phone or tablet. You can download content too and take it with you wherever you go. We are also going to make a DVD boxset of all 100 videos available for \u00a350 (US$70).     \nThe 100 Hours website will run for 2 years from its launch. During this time you will also be able to stream and watch videos as well as download them. Why 2 years? We thought 2 years would offer everyone a good amount of time to be able to download the videos to keep forever. Our goal is to continue to add to and improve this project, so in the future we would like to re-launch this concept with new artists, new training videos, and demonstrate new skills and techniques.\nGetting so many great artists to create a good-quality hour-long video is a significant undertaking, which is why we have decided to launch this project on Kickstarter. All the artists involved will be paid an amount that reflects the success of this campaign once it has been funded, which will enable them to create video content ready for us to edit and produce.    \nBy funding this project you are not only benefiting from the knowledge of 100 incredible artists, you are also supporting the community that both you and we love.\nTutorial topics are subject to change and the images used above are just representative of the artists work, they are not an image taken from the artists training videos.\n        Abigail Larson, Ahmed Aldoori, Ahmed Rawi, Aleksandr Nikonov, Alessandra Fusi, Alessandro Baldasseroni, Alex Negrea, Ania Tomicka, Anna Dittmann, Bastien Lecouffe Deharme, Bobby Rebholz, Brian Kesinger, Cesar Zambelli, Charlie Bowater, Christophe Desse, Chris Gillett, Clint Cearley, Cory Godbey, Cris Delara, Daarken, Damien Mammoliti, Daniel Crossland, Darren Bartley, Denis Zilber, Eduardo Vieira, Erica Calardo, Fawn Veerasunthorn, Faye Halliday, Frida Lundqvist, Gabriel Soares, Gareth Davies, Glauco Longhi, Glen Southern, Genzoman, Henning Sanden, Ignacio Bazan Lazcano, Ilya Kuvshinov, Ioan Dumitrescu, J.C.

Over the course of 3 volumes, 250+ artists explore themes about what it means to be a knight and what makes for a strong character through illustration, comics, poetry, and prose. The artists involved have worked long and hard to create meaningful art that will uplift and inspire readers. 1,001 knights will be represented between all 3 volumes, including fictional characters and the contributing artists.\nIn order to make this the coolest and most epic anthology we can dream of, we need your help! All money raised will go towards making the book and compensating the participating artists.\n1001 Knights is curated and created by Kevin Jay Stanton (Illustrator, curator of FEZZINE, artist for the Signature Shakespeare series) and Annie Stoll (Grammy Nominated Art Director, Year 85 Group creator and illustrator of the comic Ode). Kevin and Annie met on the wonderful world of Twitter and have spent many an evening chatting about unicorns, lady knights, and impossible dreams. They have been working on curating, creating, and herding 250+ artist cats for 1001 Knights for over a year and are extremely excited and proud to put this set of books out into the world.\n1001 Knights is suggested PG-13. Read on for further details about the book, participating artists, and the rewards!

Read below for book size & specs\nThere are three volumes each over 250 pages. The book is 7\"x10\" with cloth bound hardcover and full color interiors. There is also a box to house all three books that will be included with complete physical sets. Each volume can stand alone as one but combined, the three volumes represent all the unique houses/themes and between them contain a complete set of 1,001 unique characters.\nEach book in the set is themed after one of three qualities that embody what it means to be a knight. Wisdom, Courage, and Fellowship - the knowledge of right and wrong, the strength to stand up against injustice and protect the innocent, and the trust and love of friends.\nWe are so very honored to have the following inspirational people writing introductions for each of the volumes of 1001 Knights:\nSamantha Swords, a real life lady knight for Courage\nSteven Sugar and Rebecca Sugar, a super talented pair of siblings for Fellowship\nRichie Pope, an incredible illustrator and activist for Wisdom\nMET!!!!!!!!!!! $72,500 --- Patterned Pantone Printed Endsheets for each House book.

CHECK THE LIST HERE {HERE}\nThe artists of 1001 Knights are illustrators, cartoonists, designers, animators, authors, poets and more! Many of the artists are award-winning and acclaimed in their own right and have done work for such companies as Disney, BOOM!, Archer/FX, Nickelodeon, Sony, Cartoon Network, Marvel, IDW, Archaia, Hiveworks and Lucasfilm. Several 1001 Knights artists have won or been nominated for Eisners, Harveys, Ignatz, Junos and Grammys to name a few.  The anthology is bursting at the seams with a ton of extremely talented up-and-coming artists to look out for too! We hope that you will check out all of their personal links that we've gathered HERE on our website. All the artists in this anthology have put a lot of hard work into crafting not only visually stunning, but thought-provoking and diverse characters.\nThe art is complete and the book is 90% designed. We just need YOU to help us make this a reality. We want to make the coolest anthology set we can! We also want to compensate the participating artists not only monetarily, but with a special \u201cArtist's Edition\u201d of 1001 Knights, with an alternate cover design. All profit after the cost of books and rewards will go to our artists, being split evenly amongst them.\nWe will not be selling this to publishers. It\u2019s an entirely not-for profit project. Artists will be receiving \u201cArtist Edition\u201d copies of the House they created for, but there will be nowhere else to get full sets after the kickstarter closes!\nTo make a set of books of such high quality has taken a lot of hard work. Since this anthology is very deluxe to begin with, the costs of producing it are high. That said, we are confident in our artists and you that together we will make these books come to life!\nHelp us make 1001 Knights a reality! Rise a knight and fight alongside us as we challenge the traditional representation of \u201cknight\u201d and \u201cstrength\u201d and bring meaningful and truly rad new character-driven art into the world.\nOur rewards include PDFs of the book, print sets, custom art & even more special items which will be unlocked once we reach our goal!\nHere is a tier chart guide to all the rewards. More will be unlocked once the goal is reached.\nThis chart represents the cost of making & shipping the books and rewards after Kickstarter fees. Profit raised beyond the cost of producing the rewards will be going to our artists. Now that we have reached goal, all profit goes directly to an even split amongst the artists themselves.\nBreadpig helped us with the math needed in order to make 1001 Knights a reality. They helped us find printers and spec out the costs of books and rewards. The books are very deluxe to begin with (cloth-bound, foil-stamped, hardcover, & full color to boot!), so the cost of making them is quite high. Working with Breadpig has ensured that 1001 Knights will be the most amazing Anthology we can make. They have worked with some our artists's projects, including Ryan North's TO BE OR NOT TO BE and Scott Wegener's ATOMIC ROBO, as well as many other projects that we love and have supported! \nAnnie & Kevin are a pair of friends who met on Twitter and decided to collaborate on a comic anthology. Eventually, they met up and began to scheme about all the zines and anthology ideas they wanted to make. What started out as a small call for art to a zine they were putting together about lady knights, quickly grew into the full revolution that is the current 1001 Knights project. The pair has been working for over a year on this passion project. They both feel very strongly about the need for better, more diverse characters and promoting people positivity as well as supporting their fellow artists in every way they can. Both Annie & Kevin have previous experience in comic anthology self publishing (Hana Doki Kira, Fezzine) and are very excited about creating the best anthology they can with and for their fellow art peers on 1001 Knights.\nAnnie @aniistoll\nKevin @kevinjaystanton\nCampaign Support - Breadpig, Inc.\nVideo by Matt Pichette  \nMusic by DarkeSword\nPR by Lillian Noble\nThe 1001 Knights Crest", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've held off on kickstarting until we we had nearly everything in hand.

The contents are already finished (and online as a webcomic here), so this Kickstarter is to raise money to get it printed, AND to reprint the first book of Vattu, both in paperback and deluxe hardcover editions!\nThis Kickstarter is the place to preorder the second Vattu book, and help make this possible! And you can get the first one, and some other graphic novels I've made too!\nVattu is an expansive fantasy adventure comic, and is the third graphic novel set in a world called Overside. Vattu is a girl from a nomadic society who is caught in the middle of a clash of cultures with a ruthless imperialistic civilization called Sahta. In the first two books, Vattu is taken from the idyllic grassland of the Fluters, and must find her way through a new world of zealous conquerors, and the many peoples incorporated into their Empire: mute, monstrous slave-soldiers from across the sea; chemist-priestesses who manufacture an addictive drug; and amphibian people who struggle for a foothold in the capital city of Sahta.\nI've been publishing Vattu online since 2010; it's the biggest project I've ever worked on. It's the winner of a 2014 Ignatz Award. The first book is already in print, and it'll be four books long when it's done.\nBoth books of Vattu have extra art and appendix sections with world-internal maps and documents. The second book of Vattu will match the first book! Paperback editions both have matte covers and french flaps; hardcovers have printing on gray book-cloth, and ribbon bookmarks. There will also be signed bookplates available through this Kickstarter, designed to fit the Vattu books!\nThe books represent the ideal presentation of the comic, in my opinion: extra content is world-internal and supports the story, and I've tried to present the story in an immersive and beautiful way.\nThis Kickstarter is a way to preorder the second book of Vattu, BUT ALSO it's a way to get the other books I've made at a bit of a discount! This includes the first book of Vattu, and:\nRice Boy, my first comic set in Overside, a surreal adventure story following an unassuming creature called Rice Boy and an ageless machine-man called The One Electronic as they journey through a strange world to fulfill an ancient prophecy that they hardly understand.\nOrder of Tales, an atmospheric adventure story following the last member of a society of story-collectors, as he becomes involved in a secret conflict involving a mysterious being made of glass, and thousands of years of violent history.\nMore details on these books here. No extra trinkets for this Kickstarter! Just enormous comic books.\nPrinter-interfacing and reward fulfillment will be handled by Make that Thing! They're well-equipped for this and they've done good work in the past dealing with bigger and fancier projects than this one. Last year they did Kickstarter fulfillment for my illustrated edition of the Wizard of Oz.\nThe goal for this Kickstarter was decided on based on a quote for getting the books printed (Volume 2 in paperback and hardcover, and a reprint of volume 1), and an estimate of shipping cost for fulfilling rewards, and 10% for Kickstarter.\nThank you for reading, and thank you for your support!\n- Evan Dahm\n Stretch Goals: So far I only have one stretch goal in mind: when we reach $25,000, the hardcover editions of book 2 will have a partial jacket to match book 1!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the fifth book I've self-published, and the format is basically identical to the first book of Vattu.

You know those popular culture characters you love so much from your favorite video games, TV shows, and movies? He\u2019s reimagined them, putting them in an alternate and strangely satirical universe. After years of putting these images and their associated stories online, Dan is ready to present you with POPPED CULTURE, a book that collects some of his peculiar pop culture paintings, the stories that accompany them, and presents many new and unseen ones as well\nExpect to be entertained, disturbed, and, yes, even moved by the world of POPPED CULTURE!\nTHE ART\nA small dose of some of the featured artwork from POPPED CULTURE! \n\"The Pumpkin King\"\n\"Good Mornin', Max\"\n\"Inglorious Puppets\"\n\"The Mouse Queen\"\n\"The Mouse King\"\n\"My Brother's Keeper\"\n\"The Puppet Hunter\"\n\"Forbidden\"\n\"The Yellow King\"\n\"The Driver\"\n\"What I Do Best\"\n\"The Streets - Chapter 1\"\n\"Chew\"\n\"Recalled\"\nTHE BOOK\nPOPPED CULTURE features 96 pages (upped from 64 pages thanks to the generosity of backers!) of Dan LuVisi's bizarrely skewed takes on popular culture in one eye-popping book. Some of the images contain short stories, explaining the disturbing and/or sometimes thoughtful backstories behind the characters. The book also includes some amazing work from several guest artists: Chase Conley, Jason Edmiston, Dave Wilkins, Richie Pope, Alex Konstad, Allison Smith, Sterling Hundley, and more!\nThere are two editions of the book to choose from:\nStandard Edition: softcover\nKickstarter-Exclusive edition: hardcover, exclusive cover art, dust jacket, foil stamps on cover and spine of book (added thanks to the generosity of backers!), and a tip-in page with an exclusive Dan LuVisi print\nWHO IS DAN LUVISI?\nDan LuVisi\u2019s story as an artist began with what may be his very first memory: drawing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in a coloring book with his father. Before finding success, he suffered through his share of setbacks, including learning disabilities that had teachers telling his mom he\u2019d be lucky to flip burgers for a living and difficulties making ends meet as an artist.\nWhat drove Dan\u2019s life and career in the early years were his unwavering love of drawing and his desire to share his creations with the world. After years of struggling, he found regular freelance work with companies such as DC Comics, which renewed his craving to make something original. Spurred on by friends and online fans, Dan created LMS: Killbook of a Bounty Hunter, his massive scrapbook-style book about Gabriel\u2014a genetically engineered super-soldier who is framed by a extremist organization\u2014and the people Gabriel targets in his quest for revenge. The book made a splash due to Dan\u2019s bold artistic vision, leading to talk of many ancillary possibilities, such as merchandise and a film. LMS changed Dan\u2019s idea of what he wanted to do with his art and he used its success to found Section 9, a company that provides a home for upcoming artists who want to create their own characters and worlds.\nPerhaps more so than any of his works, Dan's POPPED CULTURE series struck a chord with people around the world. Now, Dan wants to reach out and connect with even more people through a book featuring the strange art and satirical stories of the series.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nDan LuVisi has a secret weapon: his dedicated followers. They are the ones who encourage him to build and share the unique worlds he creates in his art. The publication and subsequent success of LMS were completely dependent on fans wanting the book and pre-ordering copies back in 2009.\nHaving POPPED CULTURE on Kickstarter is a way to continue the connection between Dan and his fans. For the past couple years, many of his online followers have asked him to put together a POPPED CULTURE book. Now, finally, it's time. \nCurrently, Dan's about 85% finished with the art for POPPED CULTURE. By donating to the Kickstarter, you\u2019ll make it possible for Dan to finish the art for the book and get it assembled and printed . . . and perhaps even add some cool extras! For your donations, you can get the book (in either the Standard or Kickstarter-Exclusive editions) and numerous awesome rewards, add-ons, and stretch goals.\nREWARDS\nFor your pledges, you can receive the Standard Edition or Kickstarter-Exclusive Editions of the book, plus all kinds of great stuff, like a PDF of the book, a POPPED CULTURE T-shirt, an original Dan LuVisi sketch drawn inside the book, an original Dan LuVisi hand-drawn artwork, and even a Dan LuVisi digital work drawn according to YOUR specifications (you would own all rights to the work). Check out the list of rewards for all the details and options.\nPOPPED CULTURE T-shirt included with many reward tiers (available in S, M, L, XL, XXL)\nADD-ONS\nIn addition to the items included in the various reward tiers, we are happy to provide additional items that you can purchase in any quantity you desire.\nHow to purchase add-ons: First, you must pledge to one of the reward tiers. After pledging, you click \u201cManage\u201d on the Kickstarter page. You will then have the option to change your pledge amount (without changing you reward tier). Add an amount to your pledge that corresponds to the add-ons you want. For example, if you would like two signed posters (each of which is $20), you would increase your pledge by $40. This means that if you pledged to the $60 reward tier initially, your revised pledge\u2014to get two copies of the signed poster add-on\u2014would be $100.\nWe will have a Pledge Manager after the campaign to help you select which specific add-ons you would like for your increased pledge.\nPOPPED CULTURE Poster: \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d - $15 OR $20 signed\nMeasures 18\u201d x 24\u201d\nPOPPED CULTURE Poster: \u201cWhat I Do Best\u201d - $15 OR $20 signed\nMeasures 18\u201d x 24\u201d\nPOPPED CULTURE T-Shirt - $20\nAvailable in multiple sizes: small, medium, large, extra-large, and extra-extra-large (we\u2019ll ask your size after the campaign ends).

The amount charged will be determined by the actual costs to ship your items to your location. \nFor International Shipping: Please be forewarned that shipping costs could be substantial due to international shipping rates.

I'm Lois van Baarle, sometimes better known as Loish! I'm a digital artist and animator from the Netherlands. I make my living as a freelance artist but what I love to do most is make my own digital paintings and artwork, which you can find on my website, loish.net.\nPLAY\n\nOver the years, I've gradually gained an amazing fan base who have given me so much support as my artwork and career developed into what it is today. I've regularly been asked whether there is an art book featuring my work, and I've had plans to make one for the last three years. I've researched different options and given a lot of thought into what I'd like to include in the book. With the help 3dtotal Publishing's expertise in digital art books and Kickstarter, I hope to create a book that not only showcases my art but gives a detailed behind-the-scenes look at how I create my work.\nTo make sure I can offer something special in return for supporting this project, I'm coupling the book with signed art prints and commission slots. I'm also hoping to share some of my knowledge by offering downloadable video tutorials, extensive portfolio reviews and feedback, and livestream sessions as some of the pledge options.

We hope you like them!\nPlease note that these images are just mock-ups so the design is subject to change. The playing cards will feature 52 different images!\nThe book will of course feature images of my art, particularly my illustrations, and show my progress from someone who drew digitally as a hobby to a professional freelance artist. It will feature tips and insights, and show the process of creating my work, from initial idea and sketch to finished piece. You'll find images that range from finished digital paintings to rough sketches, studies, sketchbook pages and client work. I hope that you will find it inspiring, insightful, and most importantly, enjoyable to read through!\nMore specifically, the book will include a visual timeline of my artistic journey, with a selection of remakes of past works to show how my work has evolved over the years. I will also discuss my approaches to illustration, sketching, concept art and storyboarding. In addition to all of this I would love to be able to share some never-before-seen work and provide written tutorials and tips for fellow digital artists. \nI have been working on this project for a while and have already completed the cover art and new illustrations for the book, as well as a detailed plan for the various chapters. The lovely people at 3dtotal Publishing have already agreed to produce the book and are helping to launch the project on Kickstarter. All I need now is a bit of help from you guys to make this project happen!

The video that comes with the \u00a35 tier will be video 1.\n\nVideo 1: This tutorial will run you through the process of creating a rough character sketch - the type of sketch I often make for my clients when working on character concepts. Starting with the rough sketch, it will show you how to choose colors for the sketch, add details and shading effects, and adjustments throughout the process. Basically, it will show you how to make a dynamic and colorful illustration with the detail and personality needed to convey a character in a time-effective way.\n\nVideo 2: This tutorial will show my process for creating a digitally painted character illustration based on one of my older pieces - basically, a re-make. I'll talk about the older illustration and the points I would like to improve in my revised version, and show you my process for drawing the characters, as well as give pointers on digital painting, backgrounds, and everything you need to create a finished character portrait.\n\nFor backers of the \u00a380, \u00a3130, \u00a3250, and \u00a3440 tiers: Backers must deliver their instructions for their commission and any reference material within 10 days of Kickstarter closing.

Lois will provide digital feedback by 5 December 2015 at the latest.\nFor backers of the \u00a3250 tier: Commissioners will get to see a rough version of the sketch and can list any revisions (one major and any minor). Once the sketch is complete, one round of minor revisions will be accepted before the sketch is sent out to the backers' address.\nFor backers of the \u00a3440 tier: The livestream session can take place between 9am and 9pm (Central European Time) by prearranged appointment.

If the second parcel is lost, we will not be able to offer a refund.\nI\u2019ve set aside time in my schedule to get the book done on time, with a detailed week-to-week plan to ensure that the deadline is met.

The illustrations and artwork has earned a special reputation and a great following. We\u2019ve developed a setting based on the traditional Scandinavian and Celtic sagas, legends and myths. It\u2019s a truly unique fantasy world inspired by the very source of story telling, such as Beowulf, the Icelandic tales, the Finnish epos Kalevala, and also true art masters such as John Bauer and Akseli Gallen-Kallela.\nWe\u2019ve been rewarded with some of the most astonishing art from exceptional artists like Paul Bonner, Justin Sweet and Alvaro Tapia, just to mention a few. Throughout the years more than 1000 top class illustrations, and more than 20 covers have passed our doors. \nRiotMinds art and art direction has been published in fantasy art publications such as Spectrum, and the game has been awarded with high ratings and a very loyal fan base, expecting nothing but the best.\nWE seek funding for a truly unique ART BOOK: The Fabulous Art of Trudvang.\nThis book is a Kickstarter exclusive and for backers ONLY. It will not be sold or distributed to 3rd party. This is a one and only unique chance for backers to get the collected art of Trudvang in one book.\nShipping cost will be added to your pledge as you check out.\nOur goal is to produce one of the best art books ever made for a fantasy setting. Something you can use as a well of inspiration whether you are a fantasy gamer, dreamer, artist or just love the art itself. If you are into gaming you can see this as \u201cillustrated Trudvang\u201d, if not, just like an exceptional art book.\nIllustrations from all our World books...\n...including the famous Trudvang dwarves!\n Full wide screen covers\nShort stories about the beasts of Trudvang and some of it\u00b4s characters.\nWe will fill this book with artwork, both illustrations and covers. It\u2019s a hard cover, glossy paper, high-production-value art book with the best illustrations and paintings selected. We will also give the book some extra touch by explaining some of the thinking behind the scenery and design as well as sharing some of the stories from the world of Trudvang. \nLet there be lots of dragons and other fierce creatures and..\n..lots of trolls..\n ..some deities..\n ..a full chapter about the undeads..\n..and of course giants..\nWe will publish, not only sketches and scribbles but also actual illustrations and paintings, everything wrapped in a design worthy the true art masters behind this book.\nRiotMinds is a traditional game publisher since 16 years back. We have published numerous of gaming books for mainly two games: Trudvang and G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. Both have been awarded with prestigious ratings and reviews. All books have been sold in Swedish and later this year Trudvang Chronicles will be released in English for the first time.\nThe founders: Theodore Bergqvist and Magnus Malmberg have been working with fantasy and gaming properties for many years. Between 2001 and 2005 Theodore Bergqvist was the CEO and Creative Director at Conan Properties Inc, working with renowned properties such as Conan, Solomon Kane and others. Theodore Bergqvist was also the founder and CEO of Paradox Interactive, a Swedish strategy games developer and publisher.\nRiotMinds have published more than 20 books for it\u2019s table top Role Playing Game: Trudvang Chronicles (in Swedish: Drakar och Demoner Trudvang), a Board Game and numerous of other products of which many does not even exist to buy any more.\nRiotOnline a new digital service for our RPG\u00b4s, including complete rules, world setting and a suite of digital tools to create and store characters, roll dice, make game calculations as well as a remote center to start gaming sessions online, all wrapped in stunning graphics.\nSo, to cut it short: we think we know what we are doing and we know it will be good, and we need your help. RiotMinds is a \u201clabor of love\u201d project for us and as such the resources are limited to produce and print such an ambitious project as an Art Book.\nWe\u00b4ve started, we have most of the art in place but we need funds to write, edit, layout and print it. We ask for 15,000$ and the funds will be used for printing, layout, commission to artist and editing.\nWe think this can be a great book, but with your additional help it can be even better! If we fund more than we asked for, we will of course spend the money to make the Art Book even bigger and more exclusive. See our stretch goals below.\nNEW STRETCH GOAL 30,000$ (GOAL UNLOCKED!)\nIf we reach the 30.000 dollar goal we will sign and number all the books (Kickstarter exclusive) AND commit to a small print run for selected retailers globally. To balance the high shipping cost we will also make a slipcase OR a dust jacket for the book, should we reach this goal.\n(GOAL UNLOCKED!)\nIf we reach 35K we will add all the fuzzy extra such as a fabric bookmark ribbon inside the book, embossment, extra thick paper and all things that make the book stand out in the shelf.\nIf we reach 45K we will add another bunch of pages to make the book even bigger and include as much art as we can. The original idea is to have 120 pages, but with this stretch goal we can go as high as 192+ pages, including more art from Paul Bonner and Alvaro Tapia. We will produce a slip case for the book.\nWe will add an extra package of a couple of unfoldable pages, a full color Trudvang map and pages with boarders and interior art from previous publications.\nALL ABOVE + We will PRINT the Core rules + world setting of Trudvang Chronicles (in English) for you to buy in our store.

Founded in 2006 by S\u00e9bastien Larroud\u00e9, Jo\u00ebl Dos Reis Viegas and Nicolas Ferrand, Steambot rapidly became a serious outsider thanks to its innovative teamwork approach but also its unique creative touch.\nWe at Steambot come from different backgrounds; from Animation (Jo\u00ebl) to Architecture (S\u00e9bastien), to C\u00e9ramic Design (Nicolas). This richness of disciplines keeps us constantly curious to discover new skills and extand our activites : we don\u2019t only outsource Art, we also produce original projects (IP) internally.\nThe journey started in 2005 when Steambot was a collective of Artists, inspired by sharing, experimenting and by pass ego. Years later, we still trust in these values that led the team to collaborate on numerous AAA games and movies such as TRON Legacy, Godzilla, X-MEN: Days of Future Past, Thief, Batman Games (Warner). This exposure allowed Steambot to establish the agency as a leader in the Industry.\n\"I have been a big fan of this project since I first saw it.

Like Fat Albert, The Boondocks and Black Dynamite before it, Urbance introduces a world that reflects the diverse, fast-paced one we live in and not a manufactured one. Where social tolerance is at the forefront of the world, while never speaking down to it's audience...and visually blowing them away at the same time.

I backed the project and I am confident that the true animation lovers will support Urbance.

The original graphic novel is published online at wormworldsaga.com. In 2012 the German publisher Tokyopop started to publish a German book edition of The Wormworld Saga and collected the first three chapters in a glorious hardcover book.\nThe current German edition of the first Wormworld Saga book\nThe German book already had a second edition and this January a French version of the book was published by the well-established Belgian publisher Dupuis. There really is no reason why we shouldn't find a publishing partner for an English edition of this book in the United States. Especially if you take into account that 70% of the visitors of the Wormworld Saga website are located in countries where English is the native language and 50% are actually living in the U.S. Frankly, of all languages, an English edition should have been the very first one to be published. \nHowever, it turns out that it's not that easy to bring a European graphic novel to the North American market and since the traditional publishing world didn't give this book a chance we've decided to have this crowdfunding campaign. \nPLAN B - because everyone should have one!\nThis project is based on the page layout that Tokyopop created for the German edition and should this campaign succeed, the printing of the English edition will also be supervised by Tokyopop in Germany. It's interesting to note that publishers normally don't print foreign language editions. Printing the books isn't even the problem. Distributing them is. Publishers typically don't have strong connections to distributors in foreign countries and since bringing the printed books into the bookstores is the critical part in selling books the traditional way, most publishers only do business in their home country and license their books to foreign publishers if they want to bring it to foreign markets.\nHowever, in this case we don't have to worry about distribution because we will do our business directly with you, the reader. Through this kickstarter campaign we will find out if there is a demand for an English book edition of The Wormworld Saga and should this be the case, it will be our pleasure to meet it without any middlemen.\nOUR GOAL - which we can't reach without you!\nOur goal is to produce a moderate print run of an English edition of the first Wormworld Saga book. Our funding goal covers the printing costs, postage and kickstarter fees. It's simple as that. To thank you for your support we have a nice set of rewards.\nREWARDS - because you deserve them!\nThe central reward of this campaign is the book. We'd love to see it in as many hands as possible and therefore we've tried to make it extra affordable. Since this book is going to be produced in Germany we expect to ship practically all books via international mail. Therefore we have incorporated a flat shipping fee into the price of $25 for the book. No matter where you are located in the world, you don't have to worry about additional shipping fees AT ALL. \nThe book is 5.91\u2033 x 9.25\u2033 (15 x 23,5cm), hardcover with varnished logo, 128 pages, and contains the first three chapters of The Wormworld Saga, a sketchbook section, a fan art gallery*, and a 'Making Of'-article about the history of the project. All books in this campaign are signed and stamped with a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp.\n* We will actually try to get ALL NEW fan art from international artists for this edition. If you are an artist and want to contribute to the fan art gallery, keep an eye out for our call for submissions!\nYou can also get a small sketch and a personal dedication in your book. Since the blank first page is covered with the stamp and the signature, these will go on the last page of the book.\nIf you want to make your book extra special, you can get these three prints from my favorite panel artwork of each chapter in the book. The prints are 5.91\" x 7.87\" (15 x 20cm) on strong 230g/m\u00b2 paper with rounded corners and they are signed and stamped with a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp.\nBecause these are very popular Wormworld Saga items we're offering an exclusive edition of the large collector's prints of The Journey Begins, Welcome To The Wormworld, and Trapped! . The prints are 27,6\" x 19,7\" (70 x 50cm) on strong 230g/m\u00b2 paper, signed, dated, and come with a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp. You can get a personal dedication on it, too.\nThe three collector's prints are also available as a bundle in THE PRINT MANIAC tier at $500. This reward will also come with three signed posters:\nThe three posters \"Captain Orion\", \"Fireflowers\" and \"The Course of Things\"\nAnd if you're willing to invest an additional $100 you can add some nice merchandize to the package. The MERCH MANIAC tier at $600 comes with all the prints, a wooden sword replica, a plush, and a button set. Here's a video:\nAs my illustration workflow is 100% digital these days, I practically don't draw on paper anymore. But you know, it's like riding a bike and whenever there is an occasion for it, I enjoy doing pencil drawings for my most dedicated fans. The pencil drawings are 5.91\" x 7.87\" (15x20cm) with rounded edges on heavy drawing paper. The drawing incorporates a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp, is signed and dated and you can get a personal dedication on it. These are rare items. Really, you don't often have the chance to get one of these!\nCUSTOM REWARDS - because you know exactly what you want!\nIf none of the listed rewards exactly fits your needs - maybe you want a specific number of books, or just a very specific mix of the available items - you can choose the reward tier THE INDIVIDUALIST at $25 and combine your own custom reward. Take any combination of items that you find in the chart below and calculate the total sum of your custom reward. Then edit the amount of your pledge to fit this sum and you're ready to go. When the campaign ends, we will send around a survey in which we will ask you of which items your custom reward consists and that's it. Please note that kickstarter limits the number of items that we can send out in bulk. So, please don't choose more than 10 pieces of a specific item. Your total number of items can be more than 10 pieces though.\nAll Custom rewards - even those that don't include books - come with at least one set of all available freebies. If your custom reward contains more than one book each of the books will come with all available Freebies. \nFor custom rewards it's hard to optimize shipping fees. The shipping costs are incorporated into the pricing of the individual items but the more items you combine the more likely it is that we can save shipping costs if we send out everything in one big package. In cases where we can save a substancial amount of shipping costs we will compensate this with additional items that we will put into your package.\nDo you have an idea for a completely new item that you'd like to have but don't find in this list? Write it in the comments and if your idea isn't too crazy it's very likely that I will add it to the list.\nFREEBIES - because everyone loves them!\nWe appreciate any contribution to this campaign, be it ever so small. Therefore every backer will receive a PDF containing the Jonas, Raya and Loki papertoys. You will have to print out the PDF and assemble them yourself though. Fortunately this is a lot of fun!\nPHYSICAL FREEBIES - because what's in your hand matters!\nThe following items will be given away as freebies to all backers that receive a physical reward ($25 and above). You know how it works: should we reach beyond our funding goal, the list of freebies is likely to expand as we hopefully hit many different stretch goals.\nFor the beginning we'll put this cool metallic Wormseal sticker into all packages. It's 3.15\" (8cm) in diameter and looks especially cool on dark surfaces. I personally love to put these on black Moleskine notebooks. It looks awesome!\nA set of three postcards with the covers of the chapters that are featured in the book. These postcards are strictly limited to this campaign and will never be produced again. The idea is, to have all future books equipped with chapter postcards so that you can gather a nice collection of them!\nThis giant magnetic button is 3.1 inches (7,9cm) in diameter and sticks to any magnetic metal surface. It simply looks awesome anywhere you put it.\nThe \"Trusted Blade\" bookmark is the ideal companion to the book. Every bookmark will be signed with a silver marker.\nThis dust jacket is perfect for all Deluxe Editions because that way you don't have to let go of the nice cover artwork if you upgrade to the Deluxe Edition. And for the standard hardcover books it also doesn't hurt to get them some extra protection.\nThe special thing here is that the mockup above shows the first map of the Wormworld which now is over 7 years old. I really don't like to officially use this map any longer and that's why the map we are talking about here will be a brand new map that I will illustrate completely from scratch.\nBONUS ITEMS - because ... Bonus!\nEvery backer (down to the $1 rewards) will receive the Wallpaper Set:\nI will create a collection of info and images about Captain Orion and you'll receive it in form of The Captain Orion Files PDF (for all $10 rewards and above). The PDF will include all major Captain Orion artworks, editorial text and a lot of sketches and studies of this character. It will also include a Captain Orion comic splashpage that was created as a demo for a videotraining. This page will be translated in English (it currently is lettered in German):\nThe Upgraded Map (for all $25 rewards and above) will be printed on both sides and on the back there will be a list of all backers. I will sign the map with a silver marker and this special version of the map will be limited to this campaign:\nLOCKED FREEBIES - let's free them!\nAll freebies have been unlocked! You're AWESOME!\nTHANK YOU! - which can't be said often enough!\nNo, really! Thank you for your interest in our kickstarter campaign and we hope for your support!\nGreetings, \nDaniel Lieske", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production and printing of the books will be done by Tokyopop.

There are good reasons why there hasn't been a new kickstarter campaign yet and I'd now like to address these in all appropriate detail.  \nIn November 2015, actually right at the time when I was packing the Volume 2 books at the office of my publisher, I've received an email from a major US book publisher who wanted to publish the English book edition of the Wormworld Saga. Of course everyone was happy about this inquiry because this has always been the goal - finding a proper publisher for the English Wormworld Saga books. Negotiations started and everything looked just fine. As soon as I've received the first version of the contract, the editor who had initiated the negotiations, quit his job.

In addition to the printed book, I'm also offering digital downloads, prints and giclees.\nAll the artwork will be available to license for use as cover art by independent authors and small publishers. With each book I produce, I'll be creating a larger library of available art for other creators to license for use, at a fraction of the cost of commissioning a custom piece. \nHere are the giclees available to choose from, featuring all the artwork from the book: \nThe printed book and the two print packs are Kickstarter exclusives. If you want a copy of Imagined Realms: Book 1, or either of the print packs, please buy them now. The PDFs and process videos, will be made available for purchase on my website after the Kickstarter is complete. Any remaining limited edition giclees will also be available to purchase online as well. \nAll the books, cardstock prints, and giclees will all be produced at local family-owned print shops. \nStretch Goals: \n**We made it to 20,000!! :)** +If we reach $20,000, I will add an additional PDF of process sketches of some of my older works to everyone's order.\n+At $25,000, I will add exclusive thank-you postcard to all print orders.\n +At $30,000, I will add a 2nd video download showing the process for the illustration \"Downtime\" to all orders $15 and up. \n +At $50,000, I will add an additional new illustration to the book and print packs. \n+More to come! \nThe artwork has been completed.

In less than 24 hours even - you guys are brilliant and there'll be a volume 2 of Unsounded because of it! So let's talk about some stretch goals.\n$35,000 (6/20 - CONQUERED) - A book-exclusive Duane mini-comic taking place in Sharteshane. Did you ever wonder what Sette's hometown looks like?\n$45,000 (6/23 - DEFENESTRATED)- A book-exclusive guide to the Tainish language, and a few choice phrases you can use against enemies and friends alike.\n$55,000 (7/1 - EATEN BY A ZOMBIE)- Every book will come with a free vinyl sticker and bookmark of Sette and Duane.\n_______________________________________\nHi there!\nMy name's Ashley Cope and I'm the creator of Unsounded, an online graphic novel about a young thief with high aspirations, and the undead bodyguard suckered into protecting her. Unsounded is published online for free right now and you can read it for yourself at http://www.unsoundedcomic.com.\nThe comic stars Sette Frummagem, a streetwise young pickpocket eager to please her dad, the local King of Thieves. In order to prove her worth, Sette is sent across the continent to collect on a debt from her cousin, with no one to protect her but a mysterious man named Duane who... happens to be undead.\nIn the first book, Duane and Sette's trip was messily interrupted when they ran first into a man-eating tree-monster and then into a gang of human traffickers (and the cops hunting them). The pair overcame but not without Duane realizing Sette had led him far further west than he had ever offered to go, and not without Sette learning her bodyguard really is haunted by a zombie's desire to feast on the living.\nIn the second book, Sette has to avoid cops and robbers both and work her way into the mysterious country of Cresce, where her cousin lies in wait. If she ever wants her father's respect and his gang's obedience, she'll have to prove she's the toughest rogue around - all while trying to keep her attack zombie from losing his mind and making her his next meal.\nUnsounded is rated PG-13 for occasional rough language and violence.\nWhat's this Kickstarter for?\nAfter the success of using Kickstarter to print the first volume, I'm back to try and print the second! Volume 2 will be a professionally printed, perfect-bound, softcover tome, and include chapters 4,5, and 6 of the comic, weighing in at 232 pages. All comic art will be edited and retouched, and there'll be new interior illustrations.\nIf you're new to Kickstarter, it's easiest to think of it as a tool that allows for preorder fundraising. If enough preorders are sold, the second volume of Unsounded will go to print and you will receive your copy! If enough preorders are not sold, no money ever changes hands and no books will be made.\nUnsounded only continues to exist because of the support of its readers! When you support the comic you become a direct patron of a independent story delivered ad-free and unfiltered to your eyes, creator to reader, without any middlemen in-between. I hope you'll consider purchasing a PDF or a print volume. If you have any questions about the incentives that offer original content, feel free to contact me here or at murkoph@gmail.com.\nA Note on Shipping for Canadians\nKickstarter's tools aren't terribly useful for tailoring shipping costs to each pledger's country. This is most problematic for Canadian friends. If you're in Canada, please only add half of the additional international shipping that's suggested ($7 if it suggests $15, $10 if $20) and if KS gives you guff on the pledge page, say you're in the US. Please only do this if you're in Canada - if you're elsewhere and don't pay enough shipping I cannot send you your stuff! :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm a one person organization.

I've completed the fantasy adventure stories Rice Boy and Order of Tales, and run Kickstarters to self-publish both of them. I've also made a few books with Benign Kingdom.\nI've been working on an ambitious fantasy graphic novel called Vattu since 2010. This Kickstarter is to raise money to get the first book of the story printed. Its contents are already finished, and you can preorder it and get some other stuff through the Kickstarter!\nThe Story\nVattu is a fantasy comic that takes place in Overside, the setting full of strange creatures that I've developed throughout my work. It's about a girl from a nomadic society who is caught in the middle of a clash of cultures with an enormous, imperialistic civilization called Sahta. It's a story about culture and identity. It's ongoing and is being updated three times a week at rice-boy.com. You can read it there right now for free!\nThe first book of Vattu, called The Name & The Mark, covers its first 270 pages, and follows Vattu from the plains where she is born to the capital of Sahta.\nThe Books\nBoth versions of the book will have the same interiors: 270 pages of story, and extra material including world-internal maps and landscape art. I've tried to make the design as image-heavy and immersive as I can. The books are the same size and similar in design to the Rice Boy and Order of Tales books.\nBoth versions will be available also as Artist Editions, meaning they will be signed and have a small illustration on the title page.\nThe standard edition of Vattu: the Name & the Mark will be paperback and 6 by 9 inches. The cover will have a nice matte coating, and french flaps. The front cover features a full-bleed wordless image of Vattu in the plains.\nThe deluxe version of Vattu: the Name & the Mark will be hardcover and 6 by 9 inches. The cover will be in gray cloth over board, with screen printing in white and yellow ink. The front cover bears Vattu's mark, and the spine bears her name written in the world-internal script. Less of the deluxe version will be produced than the standard version, but they will not be limited and numbered as my previous hardcovers have been.\nBecause we reached 50,000, the hardcovers will have a partial book jacket. Here's a mockup of what that will probably look like:\nExtras\nIn addition to the book, backers can get a set of six 6 x 9 inch prints featuring characters from Vattu. Here is what they look like:\nThere will also be TWO Kickstarter-exclusive 6 x 9 inch prints in addition to this set. These two prints will accompany every physical reward from this Kickstarter. Here's what one of them will look like (the type at the bottom won't be on the print, though!):\nSeveral pledge levels also include copies of my previous Overside books, Rice Boy and Order of Tales, in both paperback and hardcover editions. The hardcover Rice Boy books are almost sold out, so only the last few are available through the Kickstarter! Here is what those books look like:\nI have added two pledge levels which include the two pieces of original art shown below. These are the original drawings from which the six-print series made for this Kickstarter are being made. They are drawn in ink over pencil on 14 by 17 inch bristol board.

The $200 tier includes signed books! Sorry for the confusion.)\n____________________\nMy name's Gigi D.G., and for the past two years, I've been writing and illustrating Cucumber Quest, a lighthearted fantasy webcomic for all ages.\nMaybe! Last year, I launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the publication of Cucumber Quest's first printed book. The project was a tremendous success, and with the aid of over 1,000 backers, I was able to print a very lovely book and work full-time on webcomic updates for six months.\n(Book One is available in the shop, but you can also receive it as part of certain reward tiers this time around!)\nOne year since the previous Kickstarter campaign, I've created nearly 200 new pages of Cucumber Quest, and the next chapter of my story is complete and ready to be printed.\nGiant squid monsters! Treacherous caverns! Mobster crabs! These are but a few of the perils awaiting our intrepid(ish) heroes as they set sail for the Ripple Kingdom. Picking up where the first volume left off, Book Two finds our unwilling \"legendary hero,\" Cucumber, separated from his companions after a pretty gnarly shipwreck. Luckily, the cheerful and wise(ish) Princess Nautilus is on his side, so rescuing the kingdom from evil should be a snap! ...Right?\nCucumber Quest's second book will be about 220 full-color pages, featuring \"Chapter 1: Disaster in Paradise\" and the following 42-page interlude, as well as bonus comics and other new material from the website. Just like last year, we're planning to print both a softcover and a hardcover version. \nSince this book is considerably longer than the first volume, it will cost a bit more to print. The printing and shipping costs for a project of this scale will be at least $12,000. Provided we meet our goal, the books will be printed in fall 2013.\nThanks so much for your support!\n____________________\nAbout Rewards:\nWhat's the print set? A collection of six postcard-sized (6\"x4\") prints, each featuring a character from the comic. Last year's print set is shown above. This year's print set will feature the Dream Oracle, Princess Nautilus, Chardonnay, Queen Cordelia, Splashmaster and Saturday.\nFor a pledge at the $250 you'll receive an original ink drawing (7\"x10\") of the Cucumber Quest character of your choice. At the $325 tier, you'll receive a gouache painting (9\"x12\") of the Cucumber Quest character of your choice. (This example is not signed, but yours definitely will be.)\nAt the $500 tier, you'll receive a complete digital illustration of whatever subject matter you like.\nAt the $1000 tier, you can choose from any of the previously mentioned illustration rewards, and you'll also receive a handcrafted paper cutout featuring the Cucumber Quest character of your choice.

Who is the character amongst all the treasures at the end, and why is he holding the treasure chest so tightly?\nEmbark on a journey through a world filled with wonders. Experience the unexpected as we take you through different cultures and species found in these lands. Hear the story of the greatest hero of them all. The one who founded the era of heroes and valor but who's own story ends in grief and regret. This is \"The Tales of Alethrion\"\nThe first episode will tell the tale of the legend behind the mirror and why the map was created. Afterwards the story picks up just as Vito's and Wilhelm's epic quest has been concluded. They are now old and mighty heroes who wander the world. The next episodes will focus on new adventurers who travel out and explore the world. They will all be connected by the treasure map and influenced by the spirit of Alethrion.\nWhat we would like to do with this series is to further develop the universe that we created during the making of \"The Reward\". There were so many possibilities which we didn't use in the short film and from the very beginning we wanted it to work like a pilot. In our opinion \"The Reward\" is a new take on the fantasy genre and has a spirit of wanderlust and fun and not the classic good versus evil. We want to focus on characters and their individual journeys and make stories that challenge the traditional ways of telling a story. It's important to us that the characters we create feel alive and full of personality. It is our belief that the story and humour will be best told with strong characters.\nWe want to make the series closely connected to the short film, but still have it's own appeal as well. It's important that it follows the spirit but delivers something new. We don't want to just copy the succes but we want to explore the same universe and feel of The Reward.\nWe love animation, we love fantasy and we love to make great stories. We see this as a possibility to take the fantasy genre in a direction that is mixed with the modern world and the values we have today. We hope you will help us get this project on it's feet so we can create something so magical, so epic, so insanely crazy... that you just might go blind...\nWho are \"Sun Creature studio\"?\nWe are the three united beings of Bo Juhl, Mikkel Mainz and Kenneth Ladekj\u00e6r. After we graduated from the animation workshop in Viborg we decided to make our own animation studio. We want to explore the 2D world of animation and try to push the boundaries and limitations that animation has today.\nWe want to keep a playful and experimenting animation style, but still with the most interesting look possible. We want to keep the industry moving forward, and work with talented and good people inside and outside of Denmark.\nFor now we are focusing on the series \"Tales of Alethrion\", based on the universe of the short film \"The Reward\", directed by Mikkel Mainz and Kenneth Ladekj\u00e6r. Bo Juhl was the director of \"Under the fold\", another of the bachelor films of the Animation Workshop 2013.\nWe are looking for possible business partners and co-producers who would like to be a part of this epic series.\nOur weapon of choice considering animation is Tv-Paint! Nice and easy program with lots of possibilities.\ncheck out our website and showreel\nThe journey to make a series:\nFirst we will produce the visual foundations and write the basis of the story line for the whole series. We will be setting the style, making animation tests, exploring and drawing lots of characters and environments, and much, much more.\nThis step will be about finalizing the script for the first episode. While writing this, we will also be making the storyboard for the episode. This is a very interesting point in the production since this is where the cinematography and the scenes and clips of the episode will be settled.\nThis is where we can start working on the animatic for the short. This will settle the editing and cutting of the episode. This is crucial for the tempo, drama and humour. With the animatic you will get a very accurate sense of how the episode is going to look like. Think of it as a moving comicbook. Moreover we will also work on finalizing many of the visual elements at this point.\nThis will be the point where we will grab ahold of our faveourite bardic talent Mathias Winum, creater of the OST of \"The Reward\". With the animatic done and therefore the timing done we can start working on the epic score and theme for the hero Alethrion!! Now we will also be drawing the Layouts for every shot. At this point we can also open up our trusty animation program Tv-paint and start animating actual scenes!\nThis step is the last effort to pull the dragon out of its tower. We will be coloring all of the animation scenes made in the previous step. We will be upgrading the layouts to actual painted backgrounds. Finally, every shot needs to be composited so they look nice and consistent. It's a long and hard process but it will be worth it when we look back.\nHaving reached the final goal, you have not only made us forever grateful, you have also made us able to finish the production of the first episode! We will be able to finish the animation, background painting, final editing and compositing. With the first episode of \"The Tales of Alethrion\" we have created the stepping stone of the series in the spirit and style we want. This will give us a lot more freedom when we take this project further. With the backup from you guys we will be able to convince future investors to give us artistic freedom so we can give you an epic fantasy series just like \"The Reward\".\nThe more support and funding you give us the better we can push the quality of the first episode and thereby the series!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe goal with the KS campaign is to produce the first episode. The better the funding goes the better the episode will be.

At the moment, we are planning on making 12 episodes of 7.5 minutes, but for now it can change since we haven't decided on what platform(s) it shall be published on - television, internet, mobile devices, etc.\nAs mentioned earlier, this is a step towards finding investors and funding for the entire series.\n\nWe have- and will invest a lot of our own time in this project, and will do our best to bring you the entire thing. It will be the best quality possible, and we will keep on exploring and playing in the style of The Reward. We will keep telling the best stories possible that are targeted at teenagers and adults.\nThe violence and irony might be an obstacle for finding the money for the project.

With as proud we are of it, we wanted to make a big to-do for its release- specialty decals, stickers and the like -but such a big book, alone, is expensive enough to make, let alone the extras. So we need your help!\nTo go a long with the book, we're hoping to raise the funds to make GhostBook charms, stickers and decals! These will be available for sale separately later, or as rewards for pledges here on KickStarter! \nAny additional funding will go to a special edition dust-jacket, only available to those who helped fund the project.\nFeatured artists, in alphabetical order:\nAnissa Espinosa | Aramis September | Arden Powell | Ash Evans\nAshley Mackenzie | Casey Parris | Ciaran Gaffney | Coey Kuhn\nD Marciniak | Dechanique | Derrewyn | Elda Th\u00e9 | Fabio Barboni\nFelicia Choo | Felix Kramer | Fyodor Pavlov | Jasmine Darnell \nJemma Salume | Jon Carling | Joobr | Kanesha C Bryant\nKaysha Siemens | Kelly Bastow | Kevin Blasius | KR Mayer\nKristen Starlein | Kristen Nicole | Kylie DiOrio | Laura Croft | Liz Walcher  Llewellyn | Lyle Lynde | Mac Matthiesen | Margaret Hardy | Mari Costa \nMariel Hester | Mia Maria | Mimi Stanton-Gullak | Ms Rosek \nMyra Bergsteinsdottir | NAAN | Nadia Enis | Natsuko Porcino\nPapierteufel | Reapersun | Renee Britton | Rhapsodii | RJ Britton\nSamantha Mash | Saprophilous | Sebastian Jordan | Shy Custis\nSloth | Stephanie Kao | Tanya Zolotareva | Tara Fernon\nTessa Lowe | Trungles | Wai | Z\u00e9lie B\u00e9rub\u00e9\nFor information on past projects, or to keep up on upcoming ones, please visit the 13crowns studio site, Tumblr, and FaceBook page!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe largest foreseeable problem at this point is if something were to be delayed on our printer's end.

After release, all profits from Heaven\u2019s Hell will go toward my next art or educational book so that I can continue doing what I love and giving back to my fans.\nThanks to all of my friends and family for all your support. And all of my fans who believe in me and have encouraged me to this point. I already feel accomplished, and it is mostly because of you all. I promise to get this art book done no matter what, as a personal thank you for all your faith in me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping an Art book is no easy task and I will face obstacles along the way. I wouldn\u2019t feel right giving you anything less than the highest quality of materials that I can deliver. My time is limited, but the success of this Kickstarter campaign will give me the extra freedom I need to devote my full focus toward the completion of Heaven\u2019s Hell. I have already started about 80% of my content, and I will be spending the time you provide me with to flesh out the rest of the Heaven\u2019s Hell universe. I will keep you updated with teasers along the way.\n\nRewarding those who back me is a high priority of mine. In order to guarantee that the rewards I offer are delivered in a timely matter, I have prepared to take off the time required to create my prizes once my funding goal has been reached. I have very limited amount of prizes, and kept them very practical, but at a high value to my fans.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 374, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2131695070/heavens-hell-the-art-book", "project_name": "Heaven's Hell - The Art Book"}}]
