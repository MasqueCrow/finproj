The seven-book series, the first three of which are collected in this sumptuous hardback Artithmeric Edition, took Sean five years almost to the day to complete and gained avid followers worldwide as its chapters were published page by page as a live webcomic while they were being developed.\nDirk Brodey and his sidekick Tad are freelance adventurers in a world of cowboys, magic and monsters in which Dirk owns his very own futuristic flying ship that is capable of flying to the moon and back whenever needed. A fantastic world of Sean\u2019s devising which is strangely real to the protagonists and readers.\nIn this rip-roaring adventure, Dirk and Tad are hired to find the lost Moon Pearl, but soon find they\u2019ll have to battle the forces of the entire Merling Kingdom to get it!\nSean Hall is both a compelling storyteller and a distinctive artist.

In her mind, only a Great House has the right to such power, but who will listen to a poor Irish woman? House Lowell will. For Alice Lowell has inherited an old Puritan journal which describes how to find and enslave a demon, but she needs a psychic to do it. Kidnapping Caitlin is the first step in a plan to rid her husband\u2019s House of debt. But with a demon to do their bidding, her ambitions will be limitless.\nThe Book of Demons can be read as a standalone, but it is a continuation of Ghosts and Demons.\nFirst Three Pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the  original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a  ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer,  and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the American Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship.  I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain;  Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur three previous standalone sequels will be available as well. And they are:\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION \n STORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\n\nGHOSTS AND DEMONS \n STORY:  A disturbing dream leads Caitlin and the team to face off with a new enemy.\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK:\nTwenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax  and color away to your heart's content.

Title Graphics by Anke Koopman.\n\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter. Several reward tiers  include it as either a pdf or print version.\nThe Underground - A Boston Metaphysical Society Short Story (Available as an Add-on for all tiers and is already included in the Granville Woods and All Things BMS tiers.) \nIn The Underground,  Andrew O'Sullivan takes his young daughter, Caitlin, on a case that might reveal a past and a potential future neither of them expected.

Those who order the Nothing But Books and All Things BMS will get the usual sturdy cardboard box as those have worked well in the past.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: We were able to obtain discounted international postage for over 55 countries this year. I have passed on those savings to you depending on your shipping address. To extend these savings even further, for those who pledge to the Nothing But Books or the All Things BMS, and it is shipped to one of those 55 countries, we will be splitting up the rewards into two boxes in order for you to receive the discount. \nTHE TEAM FOR THE SEQUELS:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A   TV, feature film, comic book writer, and novelist, Madeleine holds an   MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as  the Sloan Fellowship.

Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history  together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time  period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism  in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core,  BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story. And you can't tell an  American story without including women and  people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters  who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different  points  of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nADD-ONS\nI have decided not to use the option of Kickstarter add-ons during this campaign, though I will be using Backerkit when I send out the surveys if you'd like to add anything to your pledge.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $5,700 - (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE) **REACHED!**\nBackers who have pledged $10 or more to a physical reward will  receive  this wonderful 8 1/2 x 11 inch print on 10 pt. cardstock gloss  by the  amazing Ashley Woods. \nAshley has worked for Marvel, Dark Horse, IDW, and Stranger Comics (Niobe).

In other words, it would be a whole lot like... \nWHAT IS THE SOLAVORE?\nThe Eater of Dawns\nLike a vampire needs blood, so the ancient evil known as THE SOLAVORE needs the energy of a sun. Absent for centuries from the far-off galaxy of the Morrigen people, the Solavore had disappeared into the realm of myth. But now, with one of their solar systems facing a cosmic loss, the Morrigen are learning that the Solavore is not only real... but hungry.\n\n WHO IS HUNTING IT? \nFor years, the Galactic Kingdom of the Morrigen had been protected by its latest ruler, the brave and brilliant KING THEOSIS. Committed to the freedom and safety of his people, King Theosis has lead the Morrigen through decades of darkness, striving toward a future of progress and peace. But after so many battles, Theosis's beard has gone white; the grip on his sword has grown weaker.  And after a devastating personal loss, Theosis must summon a strength he's never known to defeat the worst threat the Morrigen have ever seen.\nFortunately for Theosis, his husband ABBINOIR will be there to help. Wise and compassionate as any ruler his people have served, Abbinoir is Theosis's personal strength. While the king is looking out for the kingdom, Abbinoir looks out for its king. And though he's been doing it for all of Theosis's reign, every new threat weighs more on his mind, none more so than the Solavore. After all, how can you protect a man who must protect a kingdom?\nNot that he won't have help. In facing this unheard-of crisis, Theosis will have at his command some of the best warriors in the entire galaxy: his own royal guard and the elite female warriors known as the VALKINAE. Together, they make up the best defense the Morrigen have.\nBut will they be enough?\n\nSNEAK PREVIEW\nCheck out some of the (not finalized) pages of HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE.\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n WHO IS CREATING HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE? \nLANE LLOYD - Creator of the weird and zany, Lane is an up and coming artist with an energetic, off the wall style. After being featured on Comic Book Yeti, Outright Geekery, and The Driving Creators Network, Lane's comic GOD-PUNCHER smashed its way onto Kickstarter, receiving more than double the projected amount of funding.  With HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, Lane uses their skill of designing strange, larger-than-life characters to tell a story that's both firmly planted in the horror genre and stretched to the outer limits of science fiction.\nGRANT DeARMITT - Grant's tales of the sinister and strange have been published at Haw Creek Horror, Crystal Lake Publishing, and Black Hole Entertainment.  A lifelong fan of weird fiction and fantasy epics, Grant hopes HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE will present the human side of cosmic terror; an otherworldly story that hits home.\n\nWHY ARE THEY CREATING IT?\nKing Theosis's ship. For interplanetary travel... and beyond.\nLane and Grant have spent two years developing the shocking showdown of Theosis and the Solavore. They made this Kickstarter to bring that story to life in the form it deserves: the comic book format.  But there is another reason. \nHUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE is just one story of thousands set in this all-new universe that Lane and Grant have cooked up. Getting it created, printed, and into the hands of readers like yourself is the first step in telling those tales. We believe that comic fans are hungry for new worlds and new terrors, and we believe we have some great ones to offer.\nSo by backing this project, you're not just helping us make a comic. You're opening a door to another galaxy, and all the heroes and horrors that live there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt takes time and a whole lot of effort to put together a story as ambitious as HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, which is why we're making sure our creative team gets funding to do so! $4200 will go to Lane for his brilliant work drawing, inking, coloring, AND lettering each gorgeous and terrifying page of HFTS, while $2100 will go to Grant for his plotting, several edits, and writing of the script.

Since their creation, these mafia bunnies have been featured in two full-length comic collections (Meet the Family and The Blind Tiger), several booklets (Based on a True Story Vol. 1-2), and have run amuck in countless comic anthology projects (Unlawful Good, Out of the Deep, Forgotten Histories...just to name a few). \nAnd yet, after all of these successful products, there's one project that really shows the true nature of the Dust Bunny Mafia outside of the comic book landscape, which has eluded me thus far: playing cards. With this Kickstarter, I plan to make that dream into a reality. \nIntroducing Dust Bunny Mafia Playing Cards\nThis deck will be a 55 card, standard poker-sized deck of playing cards featuring 52 of my favorite Dust Bunny Mafia characters from the comics to complete the standard deck. \n\nThis will be a limited edition print run for the deck. No more than 500 decks will be produced.\nHere you'll find all 52 cards that complete the standard deck.\nDeck Specifications\nFor the funding goal of $3,000, below are the playing card specifications. As stretch goals are unlocked, there will be chances to upgrade elements of the cards. The more funding that's raised, the better deck quality I will be able to produce.\n Card Stock: (S30) Standard Smooth\n Size of deck: 55 cards\n Print type: Full color print\n Finish: MPC game card finish\n Packaging: Custom Tuck Box (Unsealed) - Glossy\n Box seals: Custom seal\n\nJoker Cards\nAlong with the standard deck there are 3 Joker cards. Two of the Jokers are by guest artists, which will be revealed during the campaign. \n\nThe first guest artist Joker card is Floyd the Crow as drawn by Sean Luke, creator of the Zombie Raygun comic. You can find Sean Luke on Instagram, check out Zombie Raygun on Facebook, or pick up your own copy of Zombie Raygun on Indyplanet\nThe second guest artist joker card is by The Awkward Yeti (Nick Seluk)!\nNick Seluk is the creator of The Awkward Yeti, Heart and Brain, Medical Tales Retold, and Olo.\nYou can find Nick on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Patreon.\nThe third, and final Joker card, is a Mobimal (Mobster animal) commission card.\n\n***DOMESTIC U.S. SHIPPING INCLUDED***\nWhat do people say about the Dust Bunny Mafia?\n ***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY VOL. 1, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.

It's 50 years later, I've had Oscar nominations and won Cannes Festival awards, and it's time to fulfill a boyhood dream.\nThree years ago, I wrote out a storyboard about a slide guitar-playing cowboy named Slide who appears in a corrupt logging town (circa 1940's) to battle a pair of evil twins and save the village of Sourdough Creek.\nSLIDE has villains, an old-time country music cowboy band, the Lucky Buck Saloon and Bordello, and a glorious Oregon backdrop (And it features a hero who, like me, plays the slide guitar.)\nBy raising our $77,800 minimum goal here on Kickstarter my team and I will be able to devote most of the next six months to SLIDE, with a completion date in 2022.\nBut I want to get SLIDE to you sooner.\nWe have a very ambitious $200,000 \"stretch\" goal that would allow us to complete SLIDE by this time next year - and wouldn't it be great to have a new animated film ready for our safe return to theaters!\nI think you're going to love the rewards: Attend the New York City premiere of SLIDE; Take a private animation class with me, either via Zoom or (after the pandemic) in my NYC studio; And ALL backers at the $100 level or higher will see their name in the closing credits!\nI'm also drawing the caricature of at least one backer who will get to play a Old West villain, have a speaking role, see their name in the closing credits, AND get an IMDb credit.\nBest of all, on Dec. 18, 2020 we're sending out a survey to all of our backers, giving you the option of gifting one of our rewards in time for the holidays. We'll email a gift certificate for the reward you select to the recipient you designate.\nOne of the cool advantages of going to Kickstarter now, halfway through the production, is that we have a lot of clips and sequences to share.  Follow me on Facebook daily during the campaign as I do a drawing a day on camera so you can see how I create my characters and animation.\nPeople call me the \"King of Indie Animation\" and I hope to capitalize on that moniker to give people an inside look at how I create my films - from the concept to the editing and music.  \nThanks for supporting independent animation, and a sincere thanks for supporting me and my new film SLIDE with your generous pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an independent filmmaker, being self-financed is a risk all by itself.

Some advance theatrical distribution money from France also helps, but I've used Kickstarter to help fill the gap. My fans have helped with the production of two features, \"Cheatin'\" and \"Revengeance\", and a series of political shorts called \"Trump Bites\".

This is an artist who has an instinctive understanding of how to use sequential storytelling to manipulate our perceptions of time, interaction, perspective and space.\"\n Andy Oliver, Broken Frontier\n\"In fact, what makes MANU a really strong read is that the character moments have as much impact as the action scenes, which gives everything much more depth and substance as a result.\"\n Alex Thomas, Pipedream Comics\n\"Manu is a triumph in cyber-punk done right.

Stories about how my dad would wrestle alligators on the weekends. Or stories about how my grandmother was a quarter werewolf who didn\u2019t like when you touched all the little trinkets in her living room. \nWas my grandmother part werewolf?

I believe the absurdity of it all shines through in my illustrations and hope you enjoy it!\nWeirdos out of my head, onto the printed page...\nThe book is 100% set for print.

The book will have a perfect-bound spine encased with a softcover. I plan on methodically reviewing the proofs and using a local printer will allow me to keep close tabs on the entire process. \nAlong with the printed book you can receive some pretty cool rewards for helping get this project funded.

Now a \"criminal\" herself, she's been sent to Planet Y, the prison planet, where every evil man, woman, and mutant she ever put away is waiting for her on this... PLANET SLAMMER! \nPlanet Slammer is an action packed sci-fi fantasy adventure! It is candy for your eyes and brain! Bright colors! Strange and grotesque creatures! Strong female protagonists! Weird underground and underwater worlds! People getting punched in the face and possibly decapitated! Dorky made-up names for made-up creatures and locations! If these things make you say, \"I want this comic book!\" Then let me tell you, friend... you definitely do want this comic book. \nPLANET SLAMMER #4\nPlanet Slammer #4 represents the end of the initial story arc for Planet Slammer. This campaign is raising funds to get #4 printed, but I wanted to make the whole story available to new-comers, so you will see that the rewards include options for you to get any issues you might be missing, or the whole series if needed! Issues are 22-24 pages long.\nTo make it super worth your while, there's also going to be a super-rad \"making of\" Planet Slammer Process PDF book included at every reward level. This book will include a look at the working script (like, literal scanned script with layout notes in the margins, etc.), thumbnail pages, and the final pencil roughs for just about every page of Planet Slammer #4. You will be able to compare the process against the final product, every step of the way. So far I'm at about 36 pages, but will probably add a few more to get into some finer details about the process. Really cool info for cartoonists, and people who are interested in that sort of thing in general. \nFinally, I'm also making available some original art for the higher reward levels. All of the original art levels will also include a printed copy of Planet Slammer #4 and all of the various digital rewards that come at the lower levels! \nSneak preview pages of issue #4:\nThe kind of stuff that's gonna be included in the Process PDF book:\nOriginal Art Options: ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects come with some risks, however the risks with Planet Slammer #4 are relatively low. The book is 100% complete and ready to print, the campaign is just for printing funds - so as soon as the campaign funds, the books will be ordered, and I will ship them out as soon as I get them.\n\nThere is some risk that there could be unforeseen problems with the printer or delivery that would be out of my control. I will do my best to mitigate these issues, and of course keep you all updated on any potential delays. \n\nThere is also some risk that the books could be damaged in delivery to you. I will do my best to prevent any damage, however if such damage does occur, I will happily ship you a replacement. \n\nFinally, due to COVID-19, I will not be able to ship outside of the U.S. for this campaign. I apologize for this inconvenience. There are digital-only tiers that are available for international backers. Also, once the book is published, there should be options to order it outside of the U.S.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Planet Slammer #4 - Digital Copy", "descp": "You will get a digital PDF copy of Planet Slammer #4, plus the behind-the-scenes Planet Slammer Process PDF book.\nINCLUDES:\nPlanet Slammer #4 - PDF copy\nPlanet Slammer Process PDF Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Planet Slammer #4 Physical Copy", "descp": "You will get a physical and digital PDF copy of Planet Slammer #4, plus the behind-the-scenes Planet Slammer Process PDF book.\nINCLUDES:\nPlanet Slammer #4 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer Process PDF Book\nPlanet Slammer #4 - PDF copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Planet Slammer #3-#4 Physical Copies", "descp": "You will get a physical and digital PDF copy of Planet Slammer #3 and #4, plus the behind-the-scenes Planet Slammer Process PDF book.\nINCLUDES:\nPlanet Slammer #3 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #4 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #3 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #4 - PDF copy\nPlanet Slammer Process PDF Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Planet Slammer #2-#4 Physical Copies", "descp": "You will get a physical and digital PDF copy of Planet Slammer #2, #3 and #4, plus the behind-the-scenes Planet Slammer Process PDF book.\nINCLUDES:\nPlanet Slammer #2 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #3 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #4 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #2 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #3 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #4 - PDF copy\nPlanet Slammer Process PDF Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Planet Slammer FULL SET - PDF Copies", "descp": "You will get ALL FOUR issues of Planet Slammer in PDF format, along with the behind-the-scenes Planet Slammer Process PDF book.\nINCLUDES:\nPlanet Slammer #1 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #2 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #3 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #4 - PDF copy\nPlanet Slammer Process PDF Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Planet Slammer FULL SET Physical Copies", "descp": "You will get a physical and digital PDF copies of all four issues of Planet Slammer, plus the behind-the-scenes Planet Slammer Process PDF book.\nINCLUDES:\nPlanet Slammer #1 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #2 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #3 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #4 - Physical Copy\nPlanet Slammer #1 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #2 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #3 - PDF Copy\nPlanet Slammer #4 - PDF copy\nPlanet Slammer Process PDF Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Original Art -Page 7", "descp": "Original 11x17 ink artwork for page 7 of Planet Slammer #4.

Paul Schiek, A.H.G., and LetterSquids that tells the story of one man\u2019s quest to avenge his murdered brother and how this affects the entire realm of Mercy after the death of one of its prominent leaders. \nWhen the King of the Northlands is assassinated and a note reading \u201cno more monarchs\u201d is left on his corpse, his best friend, an elderly monk named Aldus Berryann, must travel across the realm to deliver the news to the Queen of the Southlands. However, unbeknownst to him, his guide and bodyguard, Lamond Yohe, is also on a journey to avenge his brother by hunting down and killing all the former cultists who took his life.  \nTwo Swords Til Mercy is a five-issue miniseries written by Brentt Harshman with line art by J. Paul Schiek, colors by A.H.G., and lettering by LetterSquids. Imagine if Sergio Leone directed an episode of Game of Thrones, and you'll come close to what we picture with this book. \nWe are asking for $5,000 which will be split between production costs, kickstarter fees, printing, and shipping. \nWHO WILL ENJOY TWO SWORDS TIL MERCY?\n- Fans of Tarantino, Sergio Leone, and Game of Thrones.\n- Readers of Crone, East of West, and Once & Future.\n- People who enjoy high octane action and engaging dialogue. Strong characters...oh, and bloody revenge. \nThe point of this kickstarter is to raise funds to produce the first issue (of five) of a new comic book series. That's the main reward...but that doesn't mean there aren't other goodies outside of digital and physical copies of the books.\nWe will also be featuring original sketch cards, prints, pieces of art, other works by the creative team, short stories and watercolor sketches by EASTIN DEVERNA of SAMURAI GRANDPA fame, a custom printed map of Mercy, an alternate cover by J., variant covers by friends who also happen to be AMAZING artists, as well as stickers, shirts, buttons/pins, and coffee mugs as stretch goals if we surpass our goal of 5,000 dollars. \nOur first variant cover is an alternate cover by creators of the book J. Paul Schiek and Brentt Harshman!\nAnother variant cover comes to us from ANDY MICHAEL, friend of the team and artist on books such as sLAsher and Of Space!\n The third variant cover comes from SACHI EDIRIWEERA and colored by ELLIE WRIGHT. \nOur fourth variant cover is by Lane Lloyd (God Puncher)\nand our final variant cover is by Emily Pearson (The Wilds, Bonding, SnapFlashHustle)\nMainly, we just want to make our book. I'm a firm believer that the product should sell itself, not gimmicks, so that is what we are showcasing. For $5, you get a digital copy of the book. For $15, you get a print copy of the book. While there are other goodies, the book is DAMN good and DAMN deserving of your investment.\nI mean, who doesn't want to see a drunken mercenary stab a dude in the eye with a broken sword in the name of vengeance?\nCheers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nComics are expensive to produce, so cost is the main hurdle we face.

This is a great introduction into the Dust Bunny Mafia universe.***\n***DOMESTIC US SHIPPING INCLUDED, and all books come signed by creator Bret Juliano.***\n  Introducing, The Blind Tiger, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection.\nWhat's contained in this 132 page collection?\nThe Blind Tiger contains over 200 comics, a pin-up gallery, Bret Juliano's guest strips for other webcomics, and a brand new book-exclusive comic chapter focusing on the Corvalus mafia family, entitled \"As the Crow Flies.\"\nCampaign Exclusives\nMobimal (mobster animal) drawn into the book\nCrocheted Mobimal Characters\nLimited edition poker chip\n   Who will love Dust Bunny Mafia? \nFans of mafia-related pop culture like The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Sopranos.\nLovers of Saturday morning cartoons and the Sunday funny papers.\nPeople who like cartoons such as Looney Tunes and Animaniacs.\nCollectors of high quality independent comic books.\nHere's What People are Saying...\n Based on a True Story\n  You can read Based on a True Story, a Dust Bunny Mafia mini comic collection, for free by clicking here.\nBret Juliano - Creator\n  Bret Juliano is a cartoonist and creator of the all ages Dust Bunny Mafia comic, which has over 650 comics in its archive and Mobimals. In late 2016, Bret published Meet the Family, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection. In 2019, he successfully funded a Kickstarter for Based on a True Story, a Dust Bunny Mafia mini comic collection. His dust bunny mobsters have also been included in several anthologies including Unlawful Good, Forgotten Histories and Out of the Deep as part of the Let\u2019s Make Comics: Chicago Collective. He is an avid consumer of mafia trivia, both fact and fiction, and a passionate collector of fedoras.\nFor as far back as I can remember I was always drawing. When I was a kid, my dream job was to be an animator for Disney, but as I grew up, my focus shifted into the world of comics...newspaper styled comics especially.\nGarfield, Calvin and Hobbes, Peanuts, Zits, Get Fuzzy...I could keep going, but I won't. I would read the Sunday funny paper back to back for years.\nThese were the things that brought joy to me and my comics, the Dust Bunny Mafia in particular, is my opportunity to tell my stories and give back in comics form.\nI am coming to Kickstarter in order to create The Blind Tiger, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection because there's a supportive audience here that can help me grow my brand's reach and I know people need a to laugh and I know that my Dust Bunny Mafia comics can help with that.\nWhy did I write this book?\n  I love mobster stories, they are the modern day version of the cowboys of the wild West.\n This book proposes a world where mobsters may not be evil. What if they are not the corrupt ones after all? What would it look like if the mobsters didn't know they were the villains at all?\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nWith this Kickstarter, I'm looking to do a 200 copy first run of this collection. Last go-around, I was shooting for a 250 copy print run and was looking to cover all expenses of the project.\nThis time, I am only looking to cover the cost of the smaller print run, packing materials, getting the books delivered to me, and of course the Kickstarter & Stripe fees.\nWith a smaller campaign goal and less books, it should still allow for enough copies to fulfill the Kickstarter pre-orders and have some stock to sell at conventions in the future. \nMain Chapter: The Sugar Ban\nWhen a nationwide sugar ban goes into effect leaving citizens craving  sugar, Leo Veronisci only sees opportunity. Allying himself with the  Corvalus brothers to leverage both families to push his bootleg sugar to  the masses makes both families rich. Until a bumbling detective  accidentally stumbles into a sugar delivery.\nA Look Inside The Blind Tiger\nSo...What's in it For Me? (The Pledge Levels)\n  Get Your Own Mobimal Drawn Into the Book!\nAt the Boss ($175) and Boss of Bosses ($300) pledge levels, I will draw your very own mobimal into the book in an advertisement for the Four Deuces casino, run by the Dust Bunny Mafia. Limited to 5 characters only.\nProject Timeline\nMilestone Bonus Gifts\n  After we reach funding at each of the major milestones above, a new Blind Tiger related Dust Bunny Mafia mini-print will be revealed. Each print was done by a different comic artist, but I need your help to unlock them! Digital mini-prints will be sent to everyone at the Soldier level ($15) or above. Physical mini-prints will be sent with every Made Member level ($30) or above.\nWhat's left to do?\nThe Blind Tiger is 99% complete.\nThere is only one page that hasn't been finished, the Four Deuces advertisement page. Once the Kickstarter ends, I will be in contact with the backers at the Boss and Boss of Bosses levels to get started on their mobimal characters, and hopefully be able to draw them in during the two weeks while I wait for the funds to clear.\nOnce that's been done, I can send the files to the printer and then ship the books out once they're printed.\nLast year I brought my first project to Kickstarter, a mini comic collection, Based on a True Story and I can't thank everyone enough for supporting my work before on Kickstarter. You are directly responsible for helping me achieve this dream of producing my own comics.

Dust Bunny Mafia is Looney Tunes meets The Godfather. Seven years ago I first started publishing the Dust Bunny Mafia comic. Nearly 650 comics later, I am now coming to Kickstarter to help bring this mini collection to life.\nWhat are people saying about the Dust Bunny Mafia?\nBased on a True Story\nBased on a True Story is a 24 page mini comic collection (8.5\" X 5.5\") containing 22 comics, printed in glorious full color, each based on a real life mobster stories. \nFor years I have been fascinated with mobsters, but more memorable to me than Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corelone from The Godfather and Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, or any other Hollywood interpretation of the mafia lifestyle are the real life stories of the made members of the American mafia.\nIf you ask just about anyone to name a real life mobster, more often than not, the number one answer is going to be Al 'Scarface' Capone. Everyone can tell you something about Al Capone, but fewer can tell you much about his criminal mentor, Johnny \"The Fox\" Torrio, who after retiring from the head of the Chicago mob lived out the rest of his days peacefully, for another 32 years. \nJohnny \"The Fox\" Torrio doesn't get nearly enough credit as his protege, Al Capone.\nWhen people think of Las Vegas, one of the first thoughts is usually the gambling, and people have a man named Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel, to thank for that. With his Hollywood flair and charisma, he was crucial in developing the Las Vegas Strip as we know it today. \nBenjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel was one of Las Vegas' most legendary visionaries.\nThese are the kinds of stories that fascinate me, and this collection is what I am asking for your help in bringing to print. \nWhat's left to do?\nBased on a True Story is 100% complete.\nEverything about this collection is done, all that's left is send the files to the printer and then ship the books out once they're printed. \nWith this Kickstarter, I'm looking to do a 100 copy limited run of this collection. This should allow for enough copies to fulfill the Kickstarter pre-orders and allow me with copies to sell at conventions in the future. If the project is wildly successful and over-funded, I will look into printing more copies as the funding allows.\nWhat Rewards Are Available?\n\n\n\n\nMobimals are a spin-off of the Dust Bunny Mafia brand where I took real life mobsters with animal nicknames and re-imagined them as their animal counterparts. The Mobimals: Chicago, first edition is a 12 page collection (5.5\" X 8.5\") featuring ten of Chicago's most fearsome animal nicknamed gangsters.\nSeveral characters from the Mobimals: Chicago edition show up in the Based on a True Story comic collection which unites the Dust Bunny Mafia and Mobimals brands together to tell a unified story.\nWhat about shipping?\nFree shipping for the United States has already been pre-built into the pledge levels. For other countries, additional shipping costs will occur upon check-out.\nAs for the shipping materials, I will be using rigid photo mailers to ship out the booklets in. By using these materials I hope to minimize the amount of damaged products, but if anything does happen to your shipment, you can contact me and I'll fix it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is my first attempt at Kickstarter, the collection is 100% complete and only needs to be printed and shipped.

It's set in a dark and gritty fantasy universe: full of tragic heroes, violent deaths and eldritch, Lovecraftian horror. \nWith a dark, immersive plot and inspired by legendary titles such as Ultima and the gold box series, this is my love letter to classic roleplaying.  \nThe project was an instant hit, reaching 100% funding within 24 hours! Now is the time to help make SKALD: Against the Black Priory reach its fullest potential as an epic tale of dark fantasy chock full of amazing 8-bit art and music! \n\nUPDATE: The game will now release for Windows AND Mac and backers may choose either version. The DEMO and BETA will only release on PC for now!\n\n\n SKALD: Against the Black Priory is a tile and turn based roleplaying game where you lead a party of up to six characters on an epic and perilous quest.\n SKALD ships with an optional, retro-style, CRT screen filter!\n\n\nThe game features: \nVintage graphics using the glorious Commodore 64 color palette\nComplex level-based character development with abilities, skills and features\nGrindless tactical combat\n\"Choose-your-own-adventure\" system and  dynamic, tree based dialog.\nAs a party based RPG, SKALD puts heavy emphasis on both roleplaying- and mechanical interaction between party members.\n\nThe current leader of the party can be swapped by the push of a button and the skills and abilities of the current leader will influence interactions with the game world. But be warned: Managing the party can be challenging with members having private agendas and motivations.\nCombat in SKALD is turn- and menu-based. This leads to fast and grind-less combat (that can be automated). The design emphasis is on having interactions between abilities, tactics and situational circumstances create unique and challenging combat every time.\nThe game will feature a rich and highly interactive world with both scripted and systemic ways of interacting with the hundreds of NPCs, items, objects and plot points. The game will allow for, and encourage, a large range of player expression and roleplaying. \nInteracting with the world takes place through tree-based dialog, \"choose-you-own-adventure sequences\", combat, tile-based exploration and interaction with in-game systems. \n SKALD: Against the Black Priory will feature level-based character development with both numerical stats and special abilities. I also intend for roleplaying choices to affect character development by taking a leaf from classics such as Fallout 1 and 2. \nSKALD is a fantasy setting and magic is a huge part of fantasy world building. It will play a big part in the game and designing a system that is both mechanically and narratively appealing is a challenge I can't wait to dig into! More on that down the line. \n\nThe game will release on Windows and Mac first with releases for handheld devices down the line. NOTE: The demo and BETA version is for Windows only!\nEstimated release date is June 2020. \n\nThe Gallian Empire is in turmoil: By virtue of it's Wizard Lords, the Empire stood for a thousand years. Now the fabrics of the realm is fraying. Within, the ruling elite is losing its jealously guarded monopoly on the use of magics. Without, hordes of enemies threaten the realms of man.\nIn these troubled times heroes are few and far between. \nOn the isolated island of Idra, lies the Black Priory. Its great libraries were once a haven of enlightenment and wisdom. These days its halls see far darker practices. The Wizard Lord dispatches an elite group of his finest knights to bring Imperial justice to the accursed monastery.  \nHowever, all is nearly lost when disaster strikes on the high seas: The ship carrying the party is lost in a storm. All perish, save one: You.\n\nStranded on the shore of the bleak island, you are the people's last hope for Imperial justice!  \nGather what allies you can and prepare to face the Black Priory - pray your sanity holds!  \n\n\n The rewards for backing SKALD: Against the Black Priory span from digital copies of the game to awesome feelies and special rewards. \nThe feelies for SKALD: Against the Black Priory are heavily influenced by games like Ultima 4 (shown above). For illustration purposes only!\nThe Game\nBackers who recieve the game, get a DRM-free version of SKALD: Against the Black Priory for Windows or Mac shipped digitally and / or on a custom USB card. \n\nDemo and BETA\nBackers who get the demo will recieve it shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. The demo represents the ALPHA version of the game and is intended as proof of concept. \nThe closed BETA commences in late 2019. Backers who qualify will receive invitations as well as access to the \"BETA tester\" Discord channel. \nGame Map\nThe map will feature the games overland area. It will be hand-drawn and full color. Depending on tier. backers will receive it digitally, as a folded paper print or as a luxurious cloth map.  \n\nManual and Campaign Guide\nThe manual and campaign guide will, at a minimum, be a 32-page. soft-cover booklet with black and white illustrations. The manual will explain the rules and gameplay, whilst the campaign guide will serve as an introduction to the SKALD universe with an emphasis on the Gallian Empire and the Island of Idra with its locations and surroundings.\nBesides providing hints and context for the main game, the campaign guide will contain enough information that it will be possible to use the setting in a tabletop RPG campaign.  \nThe manual will be available in print and / or as a digital file depending on reward tier.\nConcept for the manual cover-art! Anyone get the D&D reference?\nDesign Rewards\nAt certain tiers, backers will be invited to participate in the design process for in-game content. Certain terms and conditions apply however: \nThe backer must be able to participate before the deadline of May 2020\nThe creator retains full creative control and retains the right to refuse all and any content not suitable within the game and setting\nThe creator may alter any submitted content as he sees fit\nThe backer will be credited if any content is used\n\nExclusive In-Game Content\n\"The Hermitage\" is a small Imperial safehouse in Idra where you will gain access to exclusive  items, recruitable NPCs and story content.\n\"The Lord of Idra\" will give you access to a sea-side estate that will give you access to unique resources and characters. \nBoth pieces of content may be released as add-ons to the original game down the line. \nT-Shirt\nT-shirt sizes will be requested and must be provided within the deadline (approx. May 2020). Failure to provide a size before the deadline means we may not be able to guarantee the size of your choice. \n\nWith the campaign blowing through the first 100% in less than 24 hours, it's now time to start thinking about stretch goals! We'll be publishing stretch-goals here as we go so stay posted! Goals so far:\n\n100% within 24-hours: Full Color Cover *COMPLETED* \nWe make the cover art for the manual full color!\n\n90.000 NOK: Mountains of Madness  *COMPLETED*  \nThe adventure extends beyond the isle of Idra, into the icy hellscape that is the northern polar regions. Its hostile climate, cyclopean ruins and Lovecraftian horrors will test your mettle as you sail into the eternal night of the high north!\n\n 105.000 NOK: The Captain class  *COMPLETED*  \nThe game is intended to ship with five \"canonical\" classes. If we reach 105.000 NOK I will design a sixth class:  \"The Captain\". The Captain is a combat based class with strong leadership skills and expert maritime and navigational skills.  \n\n 120.000 NOK / 13.800 USD:  The Port of Adler\u2019s Helm   *COMPLETED*  \nAdler\u2019s Helm is the northern-most Imperial provincial capital and the seat of Imperial power in the north. It\u2019s also the jumping off point for the expedition to Idra and the Black Priory!\nBy adding Adler\u2019s Helm to the game, I now get to make the game a three act piece: from the bleak isle of Idra, to the streets of Adler\u2019s Helm and the frozen hellscape of the high North! \n\n140.000 NOK / 16.000 USD: Vile Volumes  *COMPLETED*  \nIf we make our fourth stretch goal, we get to be a lot more ambitious with the manual / campaign guide! We planned to ship with approx. the equivalent of 3 pages of illustrations. If we make the mark we'll up that to  the equivalent of 6 pages in a 32 page manual! \nThis means we get to flesh out the city of Adler's Helm as well as add hand-drawn maps for locations and a fully illustrated bestiary of monsters! You'll be able to run a tabletop-RPG campaign in the SKALD universe! \nThis also means we can afford to pay an editor to give the book the polish it deserves! \n\n160.000 NOK / 18.400 USD: Infinite Darkness   *COMPLETED*  \nIf we make our fifth goal, we're adding a procedurally generated murder-dungeon to the game as optional side content! The area will be completely optional and besides the main game, and will allow you to create a party of up to 6 custom characters and take them on a doomed descent into an infinite dungeon. This will allow you to keep enjoying SKALD long after you've finished the main game! \n\n180.00 NOK /  21.000 USD: To be revealed!\n Should we add:\nA) Two more classes\nB) Bounty-hunting\nC) Crafting\nPoll on twitter now!\nI've been super lucky to have a group of extremely talented freelancers help bring the game to where it is today!\nMementoMoree has been creating art since his late teenage years. Proficient in most types of art, from pencil & paper to highly detailed 4k textures, he's found solace and pleasure in the retro pixel art! \nTwitter: @MementoMoree\n\nMarco Pedrana is a digital and traditional artist (illustration, storyboards, comic art, paintings, installations, pixel art), focusing on narrative art, regardless the media or the scope. He works in advertising and game design (Aeon of Sands: story, texts, graphics, audio, VCS testing). He loves D&D, his cat Agony, Spring, and the sounds coming from the meadow outside his window. \nIllustration: www.behance.net/marcopedrana  |  Fine art: marcopedrana.blogspot.com/ \n\nRomanus Surt is a Jack of all trades at Graverobber Foundation and the developer behind Das Geisterschiff. He did the music for the SKALD demo. \nTwitter:  @surt_r | Web:  Das Geistschiff on Steam \n\nEdwin Montgomery is a composer and sound designer for games, films and performance. A long-time RPG obsessive, he wrote the soundtrack for inXile's remastered release of \"Wasteland\" and is currently working on the 30th Anniversary version. He has created music and sounds for a variety of fantasy game worlds, including Warhammer 40,000, Game of Thrones and Neverwinter. Edwin did the sound design for the SKALD demo.\nTwitter: @edwinmmusic | Web:  www.edwinmontgomeryaudio.com \n\nSKALD is being developed in the SKALD engine. This is a home made engine written specifically for creating old-school, tile based RPGs for modern platforms. The engine is built on top of Unity and has access to Unity's powerful cross compiler. \nThe primary release for SKALD: Against the Black Priory is for Windows and Mac on Steam. Depending on how well the game is recieved I'll consider publishing on other desktop platforms as well as handheld devices. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any project there is always a risk of the project failing to complete or severely under-performing. For SKALD the biggest risk stems from this being a solo-project. As a result, if something happens to me, there is nobody to fill my shoes and finish the project.\n\nThat being said, during the entire development process, I have adopted a stance of risk aversion. \n\nThe game is developed on Unity 3D: A leading and well established game development tool. Unity 3D is well supported in terms of having a large community and a robust technical support system. There is also every reason to believe that Unity 3D will remain supported in the future. \n\nFurthermore, an advantage to developing a retro-style game is that mechanics and graphics are considerably easier to produce for small teams. I keep a very strict line on avoiding feature creep, and the graphical constraints limit bloating on the production of art assets.\n\nThe same can be said for backer rewards: the focus is on keeping the (physical) rewards limited and easy to handle. My goal is, first and foremost, to bring you the actual game!\n\nFinally, development on SKALD: Against the Black Priory is already well under way and I maintain a playable build at all times. The demo of the game ALPHA version will be available July 2019 as a proof of concept.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge NOK 99 or more", "title": "Serf", "descp": "You get a copy of the game!

The pages have all been turned in and the book is almost ready to go - we just need your help to get it printed. \nThe goal of Let's Make Comics! as a group is, well, helping folks make comics. Books that don't go toward fulfillment are split evenly among participants - we're planning on 30 copies each this year - and leftover funds are put back into the group (convention fees, pizza parties, etc).

Music by Emmett Cooke.\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY needs your help to print our new book, THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN (A Granville Woods and Nikola Tesla story). It is a 34 page story in a 44 page perfect bound book, which means 10 pages of extras!\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN is a standalone continuation of the series written by Madeleine Holly-Rosing. Art, inking, and color are by Gwynn Tavares.\nTHE STORY\nGranville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\nGranville returns home to Liberty Row only to find an almost insane Tesla hiding there. But his efforts to get rid of Tesla hit a snag when they discover that a virus is turning humans into soulless mechanical men. Realizing that Emily and Travis Morgan of Morgan Medicinals are behind the outbreak, they fear that the twins are after more than just control of Boston \u2013 They want to take over the Great States of America.\nEMILY AND TRAVIS MORGAN\nEmily, a brilliant scientist, has spent her life creating cures for other people and seeing none of the financial rewards or acknowledgement. Her brother Travis handles the business side of the company and resents that neither he nor his sister has ever been given their due.\nCan Granville and Tesla work together to save the city? Or will Boston and the Great States of America fall under the control of THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN?\nCover art, inking, and color by Gwynn Tavares.\nThe entire story is off to our letterer, Troy Peteri, so here are the first three colored pages for you to see the amazing job that Gwynn has done.\n      NEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nNo worries. The original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\n Cover art by Emily Hu. Color and inking by Gloria Caeli.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a Boston Metaphysical Society ten page short story called, Hunter-Killer, and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship. I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain; Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nAnd for what the story is about, well I have two words for you - Airship Battle!\nThe complete story of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nTHE MONEY:\nWhere the money goes...Your backing would enable us to pay for a print run of the book which means printing enough copies to send off to backers with some leftover to sell at conventions, incentives, shipping (which includes mailing envelopes, postage and handling.) And, of course, the fees (5% off the top, plus credit card fees.)\nTHE TEAM FOR THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A TV, feature film, and comic book writer, Madeleine holds an MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as the Sloan Fellowship.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling, Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\" - Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nThe original series was also nominated for Best Comic/Graphic Novel at the 2014 Geekie Awards.\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nFor those of you who have read the original series, my version of Tesla is not what you usually see in fiction, but it does stay true to his obsessive nature. Granville was a real person and a contemporary of Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. (He did business with both of them.) As a writer, I wanted to put my fictional versions of Granville and Tesla in the same room together for an extended period of time to see what would happen. Let\u2019s just say that Granville is more of a hard ass than I thought he was. This story allowed me to delve deeper into the lives of those who did not belong to a Great House, but were closer to the rest of us. Specifically, I wanted to show what it was like to live in Liberty Row, the middle class Negro neighborhood I created for this universe, and those whose work was used by the Great Houses, but never received any benefit for their effort.\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Not only does it bring my love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and entertaining way. For at its very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nINCENTIVES\nIn addition to THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN, we are offering the trade paperback which includes a brand new ten page story, a BRAND NEW bookmark, the anthologies, Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude and Some Time Later, and a NEW BMS TRIQUETRA LAPEL PIN.

I grew up watching cartoons and reading comic books. In December 2008 I found myself unemployed and decided to devote all of my free time to making silly comic books that featured robots and lizard creatures. Early 2009 saw me moving out to the desert at the request of my mother, to help with some family issues. During this bizarre, isolated time in the desert I finished a 32 page comic book of short stories starring Primus, a naive but well meaning robot with lizard creatures for parents. Over the next few years I wrote and doodled two other print issues that have somehow been purchased from people all over the world. I also have had short comics printed in zines/anthologies put together by others. In 2016 I successfully Kickstarted a paperback collection of the first three Scrambled Circuits minicomics, featuring commentary to go along with the stories.\n\nJust a few months after I decided I wanted to doodle, my comics were briefly talked about on the (now defunct) ART & STORY podcast (Listen Here). I had a short comic in an issue of the zine anthology Candy or Medicine that was reviewed on The Comics Journal website where I was called an \"artist to watch\" (Read Here) by reviewer Rob Clough. Rob would later do a more in depth review of the first four Scrambled Circuits issues on his own site (Read Here).\nWHAT I'M MAKING\nFor many years I have wanted to explore the anthology format. Through different mediums I have always enjoyed this format for it's flexibility in story telling. Whether on television, old time radio plays from the 50s, or the many printed prose and comic anthology series, I have just always been enchanted by them and slowly over time I found myself building a vision of what I wanted to do in the format. Then in October of 2016 I went to a group of creative people I have known for years and I rambled to them about what I wanted to make.\nIt was about an hour after being hired for a seasonal position that I went to this group. I have a full time job that (barely!) covers bills and the general cost of living. This second job was sought out for the sole purpose of ensuring I could handle all of the expenses a project like this would cost. A project that involves over a dozen contributors, scattered geographically all over the planet, as well as also some audio drama recording as well. These expenses are things like software/services, artist payments for art/stories/voice acting, renting a room for recording, dialog editing/sound engineering, etc. \nWhen that seasonal job ended I got a permanent second job to pay for this project. And now it is done. This first one is, at least.\nPLEDGE LEVELS & REWARDS\nEvery pledge level has US shipping factored in already.

My name is Dwight MacPherson and I'm the creator and writer of The Imaginary Voyages of Edgar Allan Poe. The reason we're Kickstarting this project is that we've been asked by several readers if our digital comics will ever be available in printed form. I get that not everyone is a fan of digital comics. Many people (like me) love the feel and smell of the printed page. So we decided to create this campaign and make our first printed comic book extra special. And by extra special, we mean a 28-page book that features a brand-new cover from Emmy-nominated Director/Producer/Illustrator, David Hartman, and a special four-page \"Making-Of\" section designed by author and illustrator, Tricia Martin. We decided to use Kickstarter so we can cover printing costs and pay our creative team something extra. It's a win-win situation!\nCover by David Hartman\n ABOUT THE BOOK\nThe Imaginary Voyages of Edgar Allan Poe is a reimagined version of the Harvey and Eagle Award-nominated graphic novel from Image Comics which features a revised script and eye-popping new art by the artist of the Bram Stoker Award-winning Kolchak the Night Stalker: The Forgotten Lore of Edgar Allan Poe, Luis Czerniawski. This is the first of 12 chapters/issues, and if we are successful with this campaign, the plan is to make all 12 issues available as Kickstarter-exclusive printed issues. \nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. \nTHE STORY\nEdgar Allan Poe has lost everyone he ever loved and now he is losing his mind. Haunted by his wife's ghost and his many literary failures, the poet tumbles into a fantastical world created by his genius...and his madness. This world called Terra Somnium is a nightmare region that merges his macabre literary creations and mythological gods and monsters of old, all hell-bent on stopping him from escaping the land of dreams. \nWHAT IS IT SIMILAR TO?\nI've often described this story as \"Alice in Wonderland meets The Lord of the Rings.\" And for those who are fans of classic literature like myself, I would describe it as \"Homer's Odyssey meets Dante's Divine Comedy.\" \nINTERIOR ART: \nPage 1\n  Page 2\n  Page 3\n ENDORSEMENTS...\n\"Twisted and ominous, yet rich and charming. MacPherson has crafted a complex and enchanting story that blends the macabre and mythological into a strange dream land that is worthy of the great poet and author, Edgar Allan Poe.\" - American McGee, Creator and Designer of AMERICAN MCGEE'S ALICE, ALICE: MADNESS RETURNS, and GRIMM\n\"A beautiful and bizarre adventure into wonder, quirky, lovely and fascinating!\" - Kurt Busiek, Multiple Eisner Award-winning creator of ASTRO CITY \n\"Together in one package, two of the great passions of my youth (that didn\u2019t end there); comics and Edgar Allan Poe. A thrilling adventure with beautiful art. More, please!\" - Roderick Gordon, Author of the New York Times Bestselling TUNNELS series \n\"A glimpse into the enigmatic dreamscape where the great chronicler of mystery and madness, Edgar Allan Poe, meets acclaimed comic creator Dwight L. MacPherson. Readers are in for one wild ride.\" - Chris Semtner, Internationally Exhibited Artist, Author, and Curator of the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond, VA\nREWARDS \nDigital Comics\n  Printed Book and Art Prints\n. \nAwesome Poe T-shirt\n STRETCH GOALS?\n*****UPDATE*****\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED \n  Beautiful wallpaper from David Hartman's masterful cover for your PC, iPhones, and Androids.\n   SECOND STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED\n  A wonderful Irving Rat solo story will be added to the book!\nTHIRD STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED \n  A brand new Poe short story created exclusively for this project by the amazing artist Dave Youkovich\nFOURTH STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED AT $4,000\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is already completed, except for the special Making-Of back matter, so the risks are extremely small.

There\u2019s a vibrant world in here, and the creative team bring it to life deftly.\"\nOliver Gerlach, Comic Bastards.\n\"The Demon Archives is a fantastic webcomic. Really good science fiction, high-concept kinda cyberpunk stuff ... I can't recommend the comic enough, it's really good. It's one of the better webcomics out there, in my opinion.\"\nThe Awesome Comics Podcast.\nShort Description:\nAfter 5 years of publishing The Demon Archives online, we're proud to finally announce we're doing a print run! The Demon Archives: Volume 1- The Battle of Arkjut is a compilation of the prologue and first 3 chapters of the webcomic, brought together into a single bound book. 7x10 inches in size and over 100 full-color pages long, you KNOW you want a copy.\nWe've made a couple of test copies, and found a great local printer who will do a larger batch, but we need YOUR help to raise the money necessary for their minimum order requirements.\nWho We Are:\nDaniel Sharp is an MD/PhD student who sometimes wishes he'd picked a career path that didn't involve 14 years of post-bachelor's training. He started writing The Demon Archives in a creative fiction class he took in his senior year of undergrad, regularly bouncing ideas off of his older brother, Nick.\nNick Sharp is a web-developer and programmer at Amazon, which luckily for us means he knows how to build and manage our website, AND has the discretionary income to pay our artist, Seba.\nSebasti\u00e1n P\u00edriz is a freelance artist and illustrator from Argentina who somehow juggles a dozen different projects at once and still finds the time to crank out \"warm up\" sketches that make Dan and Nick weep in jealousy.\nThe Goal:\nWe've done the math, and if we can raise $3500 we can meet the minimum quantity requirements of our printer of choice. By using media mail we can keep shipping costs down, so we've made shipping free for all US backers,and only $10 to Canada, and $20 to the rest of the world.\nAll the art in the book is already produced and paid for, so literally all that the $3500 has to go to is Kickstarter fees, printing costs and shipping. If we manage to raise more? Well, we'll get to stretch goals in a bit ;)\nThe Story:\nIf by some miracle you don't already read the comic (hint, you should, it's free), then a short introduction to the story might be in order.\nThe Demon Archives is a full-color post-apocalyptic sci-fi graphic novel set in 22nd century Earth, 100 years after World War 3 and the collapse of global civilization.\nThe story takes place in the new nation-state of Minerva, a high-tech society based around bunkers in Kyrgyzstan that survived the devastation, preserving the knowledge and culture of the past.\nWe follow our protagonist, Tenzin Dorje, Captain of Minerva's top military squad, the Keleres, and his prototype AI assisstant, Jane, as they embark on a mission to a nearby city under Minerva's protection, Arkjut.\nWhat they discover there will threaten not only the survival of the Keleres (power armor and all!), but Minerva itself.\nThe Rewards:\nStretch Goals:\n$3500 is what we need to make this project a reality, but we have some great ideas for if we can raise more. I'll wait to give you the full details until we meet our basic funding, but I'm thinking fancier books, coloring books with your very own pack of red crayons, printed version of the Nightshade short stories, and more!\nEDIT: We've reached 50% funding, and unlocked the announcement of our first stretch goal!\n More will be unlocked as we reach the Main Goal!\nAdd-ons:\nThe listed reward tiers not quite got what you want? No worries! If you've pledged at one of the physical tiers ($15 and above, plus shipping) you can simply increase your pledge to account for any mix of the following:\n$15 - 8.5x11 inch poster of a chapter cover\n$25 - Another copy of the book\n$50 - Custom commission by Seba\n(So if you have pledged at the $25 tier and want a second copy, just raise your pledge to $50, etc)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe story is already complete, the pages drawn, and test prints made.

Join us as we explore love, connection, and the limits of speculative fiction! \nTHE BOOK \nComics are best enjoyed in book form. We plan to release another beautiful book, 6\u201dx9\u201d, perfect bound, offset printed, 180 pages, black and white, with a color cover. This will fit perfectly on the shelf with volumes 1 & 2, making a wonderful collection of sci-fi romance comics to be enjoyed for years to come. \nTHE ARTISTS \nJust like the first two volumes, we have gathered a diverse group of independent comics creators to share their visions with you. Volumes 1 & 2 featured some of the most incredible new creators in comics, and many of them have continued on to become some of the top talent working today. We strongly encourage you to check out this volume, as we are sure that we have found another batch of comic creators with bright futures!

Jose is an illustrator and master book-maker living in northern California. His illustrations are immediately striking, featuring unique color palettes and beautiful figures. We think his cover is the perfect closing to our sci-fi romance anthology! \ntwitter@jamorenoart, instagram@jamorenoart, www.jamoreno.com \nTHE REWARDS \nThe Books:\n All 3 volumes of Speculative Relationships are 6\"x9\", offset printed, perfect bound, with black & white interiors and color covers.  Volume 1 is 80 pages, Volume 2 is 136 pages, and Volume 3 weighs in at an enormous 180 pages of content!\nVolume 1 features stories from:\nDaniel Warren Johnson\nMike Manomivibul\nIsabella Rotman\nRinko Endo\nTyrell Cannon\nScott Kroll\nVolume 2 features stories from:\nLiam Cobb\nGrim Wilkins\nEzra Claytan Daniels w/Ben Passmore\nMax & Morrow Dowdle\nRich Foster\nDaniel Warren Johnson\nBeck Kramer\nAmara Leipzig\nMike Manomivibul\nIsabella Rotman\nM.R. Trower\nKat Verhoeven\nTyrell Cannon\nScott Kroll\nNone of these stories are available anywhere else!\n...\nThe Prints:\nWe've had some incredible cover artists involved in Speculative Relationships, including Mike Manomivibul (volume 1), Sandra Lanz (volume 2), and Jose Moreno (volume 3).  Each cover image is printed sans-logo, so you can appreciate the beautiful art on its own.  All are 8.5\"x11\", digital prints, on heavy paper stock. \nTyrell Cannon's print was created specifically for this final volume's campaign and has not been released before!  It is printed to the same specifications as the other prints, so they can all be displayed side by side.\n...\nThe Making Love zine:\nOur \"Making Love\" zines have been a fan favorite since Volume 1.  It's your behind the scenes look into the work that goes into creating comics and putting together an anthology.  You'll see sketches from the artists, thumbnails for pages, preliminary designs for the cover, and even some candid email exchanges. The zines are printed old school on black & white xerox machines, then hand-bound and numbered by the editors.  \nKawai Shen Postcards:\nSR3 artist Kawai Shen has presented an intimate reward for you with two tantalizing postcards.  Each pair is scented with one of her favourite niche perfumes, all murderously expensive.  She will personalize one card per backer, including a small (naughty?) drawing on the back.  Only 5 rewards available! \nThe PDFs\nWe give you high resolution, DRM-free PDFs for easy sharing across all your reading devices in the household.  \nWHERE THE MONEY GOES \nThe money is all for printing the book, backer rewards, and shipping. And then some extra to go to Kickstarter & Amazon (as usual). Much like our last campaign, we feel that money raised in excess of our goal should be passed on to the artists, as compensation for creating these wonderful stories (all artists have created their stories for FREE). We have a few stretch goals in mind, all of which will enhance the book. Think spot varnish, embossing, rich black inks, and individual book numbers! We are excited to be working with a well-established and Kickstarter experienced printer: Print Ninja. With their help we hope to bring you the best quality book possible. The books will be printed overseas, so this will make the expected delivery a little further out than a U.S. printer, but we think it\u2019ll be worth the wait.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGetting proofs of the book and making it look JUST RIGHT for our backers is very important, so that process could possibly take longer than expected.

Thanks to Chris Lewis Lee for the beautiful illustration.\nGalahad and the Far-Off Horizon is a 130 page collection of five stories, set in a fantastical world of witches, golems, and magical creatures. I've had the pleasure of working with some of my favorite artists over the past two years in bringing these stories to fruition, and - with your help - we'll be all set to take this anthology to print.\nI owe many thanks to Chan Chau, Julian Adkins, John Adkins, Maria Frantz, Julie Godwin and Devin Kraft for helping make this project a reality. Their hard work and dedication can be seen in every single page of this book. Each of them brings a unique art style to the book, and it's fascinating to see their different interpretations of the character designs. I have linked their names to their previous work, so you can have and idea of what to expect in the anthology.\nBelow is a small preview of what they've created for Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon. As our campaign progresses, we will showcase each artist and what they've brought to the project.\n   The beautiful wrap-around cover was painted by Julian Adkins, and Emily Osborne designed the vibrant endpapers. \n    The Garden of Galahad is a story about love and dedication. Galahad, an enchanted suit of armor, carries out the wishes of its master until the young witch Brynne interrupts its peaceful routine. Over hills, by seasides and past the ruins of old castles, the pair embark on the journey of a lifetime. Julian Adkins beautifully illustrates these pages with flatting assists by John Adkins. This story is 49 pages long and introduces the world in which all the following stories are set. Click here for a preview of the first ten pages.\n   The four short stories, illustrated by Chan, Devin, Maria, and Julie, explore the backgrounds of key characters before The Garden of Galahad and help flesh out the world they live in. \nThe Witches Laugh (8 pages) introduces us to a powerful coven.\nBroken Keep (14 pages) looks back at the early life of Galahad's creator, Lance.\nTougher Than The Hills (26 pages) uncovers a mistake Brynne made in her youth.\nWhen Magic Was Free (14 pages) details the tragic beginning of the series antagonist.\nAlong with the five stories that comprise the anthology, there are companion illustrations and a character gallery featuring artwork from some amazing folks. I'll be posting a few of these as the campaign rolls on. \nDigital and printed versions of Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon, as well as several different digital bundles are available now. \nThere's also some extra goodies to choose from - postcards and posters - if you'd like even more of Galahad and the Far-Off Horizon in your life.\nThe wonderful Meredith McClaren has donated 20 hardcover copies of Hinges Book 1: Clockwork City. This is beautiful book collects the first chapter of Meredith's webcomic and each copy is signed and sketched.Grab one while you can! We are so very greatful for Meredith's donation and her support of our project.\nAs a thank you for your support in this project I am making two mini comics I've written, Adventures in Nate's Perilous Challenge illustrated by Jack Gross and Mother Made us to Die illustrated by Marek Jarocki available to all physical backers at $5 for the pair. You can click through on the titles and see a preview. Just add $5 to your pledge with a physical reward and both of these comics are yours!\nWe also have two original art tiers from Christa Dippel and Kristeen Parmeter and one digital commission from Julian Adkins, so be quick to jump on those if you're interested. These are available for international shipping as soon as the campaign launches.  \n  As you can see, most of the Kickstarter funds will be dedicated to printing, with a couple thousand going to Kickstarter fees and shipping out rewards. We are not relying on funding to pay the artists; they have been compensated prior to the campaign. However, if the Kickstarter is funded beyond all of the stretch goals (i.e. past $20,000), a portion of the excess funds will be divided among the creators.\n   Thank you so much for reading all the way through this.

Putting together a poker deck of cards allowed me to draw a lot of monsters, allow for anyone to have an entire collection in the palm of their hand, and make it easy to share the fun with others. My goal is for people to use these cards to share their film-viewing experiences, laugh at some of the hilarious monster designs, and arouse their curiosity enough that they track down and watch a movie they might have missed. And it all starts with this deck of obscure movie monster playing cards.\nWhat do I get for backing this?\nYou will receive an entertaining pack of playing cards featuring illustrations of obscure movie monsters. It could be that you\u2019ve seen one or two of these creepy creatures. You\u2019ll quickly be captivated as you flip through the cards. You may begin playing with the monsters before you start playing a game. Can you remember where and when you saw that green thing? Is it an old creature feature of the fifties or something more recent? As you flip through the cards, you will have the urge to compare your movie trivia with others. Their laughter is your reward as you share these maligned movie monsters. \nStretch Goal Rewards\nBecause of various stretch goals being achieved supporters will also receive: Four screen savers done by guest artists, and a set of four Horror Movie Bingo Cards. These will go out to all supporters on all reward levels. Scroll to the bottom to see what stretch goal is underway.\nCard Specs: Cards will be 300 gsm with blue core and smooth finish.\nExamples from the deck and the front of the card.\n Tuck Pack: All decks at all reward levels will come in a tuck pack.\nTuck Pack Design for Obscure Movie Monster Playing Cards\nFor those who just can\u2019t get enough of movie monsters, there are multiple reward tiers for your backing pleasure. All of the reward tiers include a pack of our uniquely gruesome cards. There are early bird specials for those who commit early, as well as unique offerings that will be made only for this Kickstarter. Select from multi-packs, book add-ons, prints, original art and much more, for a custom-tailored combination of rewards just for you.\nWow! this project has taken off. There are several award options listed below, so please keep scrolling to see them all. But first, this update: \nSeveral backers have requested that I provide the option of them being able to add one or more decks to their reward level.

Do not change the tier that you originally pledge at. 4) After the campaign ends, you will receive a survey that will ask you questions about how you would like the add-on money assigned.\nThese add-ons will cover the additional reward and shipping:\nAdd One (1) deck = $15\nAdd Two (2) decks = $25\nAdd Three (3) decks = $40\nAdd Four (4) decks = $53\nAdd Five (5) decks = $65\nAdd Six (6) decks =$75 \nAnd now the awards list:\n               \"The Comic Critic Presents Blockbusters\" is a 160 page compilation of cartoon reviews about some of the highest grossing films of all times.

Reaching this stretch goal mean that the production can be upgraded to 330 gsm with superior quality smooth. I did a test run with 300 gsm to make sure the colors would appear as intended. I'm happy withe the quality. But I've been asked by card collectors to increase the quality further if I could. Reaching this new stretch goal would allow for that upgrade. And with how well the project has been going, it's a goal that can be achieved.\nInternational Shipping\nWhile all of the levels have USA and Canada shipping calculated, only a few award levels are calculated for International Shipping. I've added these on a case-by-case basis. If you live outside North America and would like to support, please let me know what country and at what award level and I will arrange it with an edit. Currently the most popular awards are available in Australia and the UK.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNow that the stretch goal of the Horror Movie Bingo Card has been reached the only risk is creating art for the back and doing a series of layouts for the front. With help from the backers the content for card boxes has been taken care of.\n\nAll of the artwork and production for the initial project has been completed. The challenge has always been to create this deck at an affordable price point per unit. Reaching the project\u2019s goal will ensure this. An even larger challenge is to push into stretch goals so that with each backer, the print run can be increased. Packaging design has been completed for the individual decks. Should there be a strong demand for half and full brick order then packaging can be designed for display boxes that hold six and twelve decks.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Deck of Cards", "descp": "A pack of cards\u2014they\u2019re so beautiful.\nEnjoy your quality deck of obscure movie monsters.

Scroll down to see what we've got to unlock!\n  Peter Simeti here, founder and publisher of Alterna Comics and in case you haven't heard, we're bringing back newsprint comics in a big way this May (as covered by Newsarama) as we've also just brokered a distribution deal with PDG to distribute our comics to newsstands across the world. \nSo why single issues and why newsprint?  It's true that Alterna's only published a handful of single issue titles in our eleven years and that we've mostly published graphic novels and digital comics -- but the answer is a simple one.  I've been looking for a newsprint printer since I started Alterna and until we found one, I really didn't want to move forward with printing single issues on premium paper. Some exceptions were made over the years but by and large, it wasn't a direction I wanted to fully pursue. But finally, the search is over.\nSo why was the search so difficult? Newsprint is a really thin paper and because of that, it's only printed on a web press.  Web press printing is generally only affordable once you hit a range in the tens of thousands, while traditional offset printing can take thicker, premium paper stocks at minimum runs of 500 to 1000.  The small runs are more appealing to comic publishers sadly due to the fact that the current distribution system can make it hard at times to sell more than that.  Comic books just aren't everywhere like they used to be and the fact that merchandise is sold on a non-returnable basis to retailers means that your local comic shop has to be very choosy with the books they stock on their shelves.  It leaves a lot of purchasing up to speculation and the harsh reality is that the average Marvel or DC title is just less of a risk than the average independent comic.  So for whatever reason, when it came to newsprint, I decided to reach out to grocery store circular printers, catalog printers, magazine printers, and local town paper printers - we ended up finding a few printers that could do exactly what we needed.  It's ironic that we had to look outside traditional comic book printing companies to find a printer that could print a traditional comic book.\nWhy the low cover price of $1.50 an issue? Can that last? It absolutely will as we found that printing costs on newsprint are about 3 times less for these runs, so we're passing on those savings to retailers and readers.  We're also selling very affordable advertising to support the runs of these books and we're allowing other comic creators and publishers to advertise as well -- another break from the traditional in-house only ads of most modern comics. \nYou can see our first four offerings right here, available for pre-order at your local comic shop now. Read more about them below:\nADAM WRECK - created by Michael S. Bracco; this space adventure comic is a 3 issue mini series that is great for all ages and combines the feel of \"Lost in Space\" and \"Star Wars\".\nAMAZING AGE - created by Matthew D. Smith, Jeremy Massie, and Christine Brunson; combining \"Stranger Things\" and superheroes in this 5 issue mini series, three teenagers have to save the universe after getting sucked into the comic book world they created as kids.\nLILITH DARK - created by Charles Dowd; in this 4 issue mini series, Lilith Dark discovers that the monsters and beasties of her imagination are actually real and she must brave impossible odds to rescue her family before it's too late!\nCROAK - created by Cody Andrew Sousa, Francesco Iaquinta, Chris O'Halloran, and Dezi Sienty; in this 3 issue thrill ride, three friends get lost deep in the woods where their worst nightmares come to horrifying life.\n  Our second wave of titles will release to comic shops in June:  \nMOTHER RUSSIA - created by Jeff McComsey; a soviet sniper comes face to undead face with a zombie apocalypse during World War 2 in this alternate universe tale that takes place over 3 issues.  \nTHE CHAIR - created by Peter Simeti and Kevin Christensen; an innocent man on death row must find a way to save his life and his sanity before it's too late. Unfortunately, the prison's sadistic Warden and his murderous guards have other things in mind.  A film adaptation starring the late Roddy Piper, Zach Galligan, Naomi Grossman, Bill Oberst Jr. and Noah Hathaway is slated for a DVD & blu-ray release this Fall.  \nTRESPASSER - created by Justin M. Ryan, Kristian Rossi, and DC Hopkins; one father will go to unspeakable lengths to protect his daughter after a strange visitor crash lands in the forest. This 4 issue mini series is perfect for fans of \"The Walking Dead\" and \"The X-Files\".  \nSCRIMSHAW - created by Eric Borden, Dave Mims, and Spike O'Laochdha; the only ongoing series in Alterna's newsprint lineup! Cyborgs, pirates, cut-throats and mutants are the good guys in this action-packed series about a team of post-apocalyptic mercenaries.\n  Aside from distributing through Diamond Comics Distributors so that your favorite local comic shops will have these books on shelves, we've also secured a deal for newsstand distribution.  In fact - comic shops will have these books two months earlier than newsstands will as it's our way of saying thanks to all the shops that have supported us for our eleven years and giving respect to the retailers that have been the lifeblood of the comic industry. \nSince the books will be on a bi-monthly schedule (a series will release every two months until completion) by the time issue #1 is on newsstands, issue #2 will be in comic shops.  This will allow newsstand readers to seek out more titles in the comic shop and immediately get the next issue there if they wish.\nThe addition of newsstand availability also brings me to the reason why I'm running this Kickstarter to begin with.\nWhile we budgeted for the print runs that will go toward comic shops, we weren't able to foresee the budget costs of expanded print runs for newsstand distribution (this is relatively uncharted territory) or the cost of BIPAD numbers (unique - and costly - UPC numbers required by the magazine industry) and because of those two factors, we're hoping that the Kickstarter community will come out to support our endeavor as we'll be the first creator-owned publisher in decades to have comic books available on newsstands.  Newsstand publications also have to have different bar codes than their comic shop counterparts, which adds another bit of a road bump.  That's because the newsstand industry has a standard 2 digit supplement code and comic book distribution has a 5 digit supplement code.  The cost to print different covers is minimal (interiors will remain the same) but it's still something that we need to do.\nThe BIPAD numbers are about $150 each, which set us behind on our budget by $3K as we needed 20 of these to move forward with newsstand distribution (yes, that's right, we'll be releasing at least 20 newsprint comics over the next two years+!) - so the first $3K raised will go towards filling that unexpected expense.  The next $2K will go towards supporting increased print run numbers for our first 4 books.  \nSo as long as we reach our goal of $5K we'll be all set to move forward - but it'd be great if we could raise more, as every $1K raised will unlock a small BONUS stretch reward for every backer (stickers, trading card, pins, coasters, window clings, signed mini-poster) and every $2K raised will unlock the ability to purchase a larger stretch reward at a discounted price (tote bags, shirts, beanies). The extra funding will also enable us to securely move forward on future increased print runs, and support them fully with advertising and promotional materials for your favorite comic shops and stores.  From that point on, the line should be self-sustaining.\nUNLOCKED -- $5500 unlocks a random FREE newsprint comic from one of the four pictured below for EVERY backer that pledges for a physical reward!\nUNLOCKED -- $6000 unlocks an \"I Love Comics\" sticker for all backers that pledge for a physical reward!\n$7000 unlocks a 3\"x4\" \"I Love the Smell of Comics on a Wednesday\" clear window cling for all backers that pledge for a physical reward!

Faced with a new century and new steam technology, the social and political status quo is turned on its head. People are uncomfortable with change and, in fact, many people fear it. That fear and the violence which follows causes a psychic rift to puncture the veil of space and time allowing the entity known as \"The Shifter\" to escape. Feeding on the resentment and fear between the rich and poor, \u201cThe Shifter\u201d triggers a rash of murders.\nFour of the greatest minds of the time have banded together to try and stop this malevolent entity. Known only as B.E.T.H., they are:\n THEY FAIL.\nAgainst their better judgment, they look to a man driven by revenge \u2013 SAMUEL HUNTER.\n For the one mistake \"The Shifter\" made was killing Samuel\u2019s wife.\nAn ex-Pinkerton detective, Samuel gathers his unlikely team of\u2026\nCaitlin O'Sullivan, Medium and Spirit Photographer:\n and Granville Woods, Scientist Extraordinaire:\n They are the Boston Metaphysical Society.\nTheir job: Stop \"The Shifter\" before Boston tears itself apart.\nCOVER OF THE TRADE.\nCOVER ART BY EMILY HU.

With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship. I will be introducing three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain; Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nAnd for what the story is about, well I have two words for you - Airship Battle!\nThe complete story of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nHere's a teaser for you.\nHunter-Killer Colored Page 1\n  Hunter-Killer Colored Page 2\n SAMPLE PAGES FROM CHAPTERS 3, 4 AND 6.\n      BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is written by Madeleine Holly-Rosing and illustrated by Emily Hu.\nTHE MONEY:\nWhere the money goes...Your backing would enable us to pay for a print run of the trade paperback which means printing enough copies to send off to backers with some leftover to sell at conventions, incentives, shipping (which includes mailing envelopes, postage and handling.)

Not only does it bring my love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and entertaining way. For at it's very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY began as a TV Pilot which I wrote while I was in the MFA Program in Screenwriting at UCLA. It was somewhat inspired by a script I had written called Stargazer, which was about a real life astronomer who lived in Boston in the late 1880's. (Stargazer went on to win the Sloan Fellowship.) It was suggested that I adapt Boston Metaphysical into a six issue graphic novel mini-series. I agreed and the hunt was on for an artist. Many months later, I met Emily Hu through a mutual friend and a partnership was born. Her passion for the project matched my own and I knew the story was in good hands. I launched BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY as a webcomic in May of 2012. The following year we printed a special edition of the first chapter.\nThrough a combination of self-funding and the generous support of Kickstarter backers like you, we were able to finish the six issue series and now we are back to print this expanded version of the trade.\nHowever by wading into the deep end of the pool, I discovered a terrible truth \u2013 I love writing comics.\nSo I bring you Samuel, Caitlin, and Granville who represent the best, the worst, and every shade of gray of the society in which they live. They are products of their world yet strive for not only more, but better.\nMuch like you and I.\nBy backing this project, you would not only be supporting the printing of the trade paperback, but a vision of a future where the teamwork and sacrifice of a diverse group of individuals ultimately defeats evil.\nINCENTIVES\nIn addition to the 156 page trade paperback which includes a brand new ten page story, we have a BRAND NEW bookmark, the anthology, Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude, scripts of the new ten page story (pdf and in hardcopy), plus a NEW LAPEL PIN with Caitlin's box camera. It is 1 inch in diameter and will be an antique gold color. (See image below.)\nSample Image from Proof - Pin will be ordered after the campaign is funded\n(A big thank you to Bill Meahan for handling the technical aspects of designing the pin.)\nLapel Pin Set\nAnd for the first time, we will be offering a reward tier which includes the set of all three Boston Metaphysical pins (Dirigible, Tesla, and the 1800's Box Camera) in a lovely gift box with our logo.\nImage is for demonstration only. The set will include the following pins: Dirigible, Nikola Tesla, 1800's Box Camera. (Box Camera Pin will be ordered once the campaign is funded.)\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society:Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter. Several reward tiers include it as either a pdf or print version.\nCover of Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude\nNEW REWARD GOAL!\nGet Your Airship Wings\nJoin the flight crew of \"The Philadelphia.\" Inspired by the new short story, Hunter-Killer, these light weight pins with metal accessories are perfect for any steampunk costume. (The base is plastic and painted to resemble metal.)  The fun part is you get to choose which one you want. Please message me your choice after you pledge to lock it in.\nThese pins were made especially for Boston Metaphysical Society by Gears and Roebuck.\n  For those of you not familiar with Delilah Blast #1, here is the story\u2026 Science runs the world and the Earth is governed by the E.S.A., the Earth's Science Association. Everyone is allow to join the organization on their sixteenth birthday, but unfortunately for Delilah Blast she oversleeps, missing the entrance exams and putting her dream in jeopardy.

You could donate it to your favorite school, or keep it for yourself!\n\n$2,000 - HARDCOVER EDITION: If we sell a complete run of 45 AMERICAN PRESIDENTS it will be upgraded to a beautiful hardcover edition, so that it can live on forever and ever!

I failed miserably, so I formed an alliance with my artist friend Aage and turned my efforts to what I do know - designing and programming applications.\nWe've been slowly developing the application in our free time for years, but now that Dungeon Builder is nearing its completion, we hope that you will help us find the funds needed to take time off from our day jobs, in order to finally finish our map maker.\nDungeon Builder lets anyone, regardless of their art skills, make beautiful, isometric, high resolution maps that look hand drawn.\nAdditionally, if you want to add your own drawings to your maps, all you have to do is drop your drawing and a file with a bit of extra information into Dungeon Builder's Custom folder and you're good to go.\n See it in Action\nIf you're curious, we really recommend downloading our demo and giving it a try. Even though all the features are not in yet, we think you'll be able to see just how amazing Dungeon Builder could be with just a few months of further work.\nIf you don't feel like downloading the demo, you can check out the the video below for a demonstration of Dungeon Builder.\n Project Goal\nIf you back this project, your pledge will go towards doubling the number of art assets available in Dungeon Builder (compared to the demo), as well as completing the all basic functionality in the application.\nIn terms of functionality, that covers:\nSaving and loading maps\nExporting maps as images\nText placement and editing for notes and descriptions on your maps\nChanging map size and orientation\nChanging map background textures\nAdditional selection modes for better editing\nDragging map items to re-position them\nAs for doubling the amount of art available in Dungeon Builder, here's what we intend to add:\nCaves\nCage walls & doors\nBeds and other furniture \nMore building features\nLoads of smaller items to make your dungeons look inhabited and unique\nA look at what's available in Dungeon Builder's demo\n Please note: The floor symbol below the tables in the image above is a reference to the brilliant game series The Longest Journey. To avoid any potential copyright issues, this symbol will be replaced by another similar asset as soon as possible.\n Stretch Goals\nOur vision goes far beyond the initial funding goal. We want to add much more art, make the editor even better, and add a Play mode to Dungeon Builder as well.\nTo make all that possible, we have a lot of stretch goals. For each goal met, your map maker will become even better.\nWe want you to be able to build many different looking dungeons, so when we reach our first stretch goal, we'll add an additional wall type, an additional floor type, and three new door types.\nOur current walls are cool, but wouldn't it be great if you could stack walls to create multi storey buildings? If we reach this goal, we'll add at least two wall types that can be stacked.\nWe'd love to have really cool options for water on our maps, so if we reach this goal, we'll find a way to add \"watercolour\" rivers and streams to Dungeon Builder's palette. The watercolour effect will be reminiscent of the coloured portals available in the demo.\nMaybe we're biased from playing too much Baldur's Gate, but we think it would be awesome to be able to add train tracks, mine carts and large rock faces to Dungeon Builder's art collection.\nWhen we reach this goal, we're going to have a lot of art in Dungeon Builder, so it makes a lot of sense to start adding features that make it easier to find exactly what you want. Adding a way to specify precisely what colour map you want is also a priority, along with adding more background textures.\nThere are certain dangers in placing all our art in its original form right there in the application folder, for everyone to view and edit. However, if we reach this goal, we'll do just that. In order to give anyone who wants to add their own art to Dungeon Builder as good a foundation as possible, we'll include all the art made for this campaign as \"mods\" instead of \"baking\" it into the application.\nDungeons are cool, but dungeons with neat entrances are even better. At this level, we'll add trees, grass, and building roofs to the art collection. \nHaving a map centrepiece, where the big boss or the amazing treasure is, sounds pretty good. So at this level, we'll add three huge \"watercolour\" set pieces, including a waterfall for use with our rivers and streams.\nWhat if we could play our games right there in the application? That would be amazing! At this level we'll add a feature to reveal areas as your players explore them. We'll also add ten adventurer tokens and ten monster tokens to the art collection, add a dice rolling function, and allow the game master to hide certain map notes while printing or playing.\nIf we make it to this level, we'll implement some kind of \"fog of war\" feature, so only revealed tiles within your adventurer tokens' range of view is visible during Play mode. We'll also add 20 more monster tokens and make token movement more fluent by adding a sliding animation.\nAt this level, the simple adventurer and monster tokens are replaced by actual drawings. Do you prefer tokens? We'll find a way to add a configurable token that can be used with your own images. Finally, we'll add multi screen support, so players see a completely different screen than the DM. This will effectively allow the DM to change the map mid-game.\nFor those groups that can't meet in person to play, we really want to add a network multiplayer mode, enabling all the unlocked Play Mode features to be used over the internet.\nYou spoke and we listened: if we reach 750.000 DKK, we'll add a feature to export your maps to a Top Down View, allowing you to print battle ready top down maps for use with miniatures or tokens. Please note that this stretch goal was added after delivery was estimated, so to ensure that we do not delay the entire project if we reach this goal, work on the top down view will not start until we have delivered everything else from the Kickstarter campaign. If unlocked, the Top Down View feature will be added gradually during the two to three months after the release of version 1.0.\nProject Rewards\nCredit\nWe like to give credit where it's due, so if you help us in any way, we'd like to include you in our application credits. If you're the Batman of Kickstarter and would prefer to remain anonymous, you can opt to have an alias listed instead of your full name (or to not be listed at all).\nDungeon Builder\nAll pledge levels apart from \"A helping hand\" include Dungeon Builder, available from our website in May 2017. Dungeon Builder will include everything described in the Project Goal section above, and for every stretch goal we reach, Dungeon Builder will be improved for everyone.\nBeta Access\nCan't wait to start building Dungeons? All pledges from the Beta Builder level and up includes Beta Access. Backers at these levels will get a login to a special page on our website where they'll be able to download the latest Dungeon Builder releases throughout the development process. \nTechnically speaking, the beta phase starts when an application is feature complete, so by that definition you'll also get Alpha Access.\nThe first build available after the demo is planned to release two weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\nSpecify a Map Item\nIf you have a great idea for an art asset, and want to make sure it makes it into Dungeon Builder, the Dungeon Carpenter, Stonemason, Planner, Engineer and Architect levels are for you. At these levels you get to specify a map decoration, piece of furniture, building piece or similar. Items made in this way adds to everyone's art collection, so we'll give you credit in the item's tool tip and in the status bar when the item is selected.\nTool tip and status bar credits for backer items\n  The size of the item depends on the pledge level. To give you an idea of the item sizes, we've made a little illustration.\nAn illustration of the different sizes of map items\nCarpenter (Small): 1 tile\nStonemason (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nEngineer (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nPlanner (Huge): 4x4 tiles or similar\nArchitect (Gigantic): 5x5 tiles or similar\nSpecify a Creature\nHeroes, villains and monsters are similar to ordinary map items, but require a lot more work and attention to detail. Therefore, the pledge amount to size ratio is a bit higher for these types of drawings. As with Map Items, the size of the item depends on the pledge level.\nGuard (Small): 1 tile\nCommander (Medium): 2x2 tiles or similar\nLady/Lord (Large): 3x3 tiles or similar\nIndie and Pro Licences\nIndie and Pro versions of Dungeon Builder are identical in to Personal versions in terms of functionality and art. But with these versions, you are allowed to use maps exported from Dungeon Builder in published (print/e-book) material, royalty and attribution free.\nMultiple Rewards\nIf you would like multiple Dungeon Builder licenses, just add the amount listed at the reward level to your pledge amount, and we'll make sure you get your extra copies on release.\nTo ensure that one rich backer doesn't completely dictate the art direction, the \"Specify-rewards\" are limited to one per person.\n About the currency...\nBecause we're based in Denmark, we have to define our goals and pledge levels in Danish krone (DKK).This can get a little bit confusing if you're not up to date on conversion rates, so to make things a little easier for you, we've included the price of things in US Dollars, Euro, and British Pounds in our stretch goals and pledge descriptions. Note that the pledge amount in dollars is automatically converted by Kickstarter (and is therefore not included in the descriptions like euro and pound prices are). Also note that stretch goal amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred.\nThe converted amounts were all updated right before going live with this campaign, but please note that they may not be accurate at the end of the campaign.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs visible from our demo, the core of Dungeon Builder is already implemented, so the risk of the project failing altogether is virtually non-existent - as long as none of us get hit by a bus, that is. Having a team of two, makes the project vulnerable to unexpected deaths. \n\nAnother risk is missing the deadline. As any developer will tell you, estimating a programming task is difficult, so after estimating the programming completion date (including all stretch goals), we've added two months for pledge extras and stretch goal art, just to be sure we're not underestimating.\n\nHowever, if we reach many of our ambitious stretch goals and then run into unexpected and very time consuming challenges e.g. with networking, there is risk that everything will not be finished by the end of May 2017. In that case, we'll give all backers beta access from the 1st of June until the beta closes and we release Dungeon Builder version 1.0.\n\nFinally, if we reach all art related stretch goals and have a lot of Specify-rewards to fulfil, there is a risk that the art side of the project will not be completely done by the end of May 2017. Should this be the case, Dungeon Builder will release as scheduled, and the remaining art will be included in updates as soon as it is ready.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge DKK 25 or more", "title": "A Helping Hand (\u20ac3 / \u00a33)", "descp": "Our thanks for helping Dungeon Builder become a reality.

Technology was developed to the point of perfection, wars were won in days and fought with squadrons of giant, piloted mechs. Nations grew greedy, their thirst for land and power was never quenched and almost all of Earth's resources were diminished.\nAfter generations of war, desperate for a resolve and each side too arrogant for a peace treaty, they began to research a type of weapon that no amount of armour or firepower could save the fragile human body from. Wave after wave of biological weapons were released - thousands of species extinct, the air left un-breathable, cities vacant and what was left of humanity had to live underground in bunkers. Any trace of government slowly dissolved, morals tossed aside for resources, land and weaponry.\nMany factions spawned as a result, humanity divided yet all living for the same purpose - to survive. Stuck in a perpetual war, will mankind exterminate themselves or find peace? You decide.\n              Collect parts and weapons to outfit your own giant mech. Once you've crafted your own custom masterpiece, test out its mettle by dropping into one of the many dangerous conflict zones in the Antraxx world. It is here where you will get to test your might against other pilots. Acquire your own land in one of the many wastelands of the world in order to grow your own faction and cement your power. Special additions such as jetpacks, rocket launchers, lasers, teleportation, and cloaking devices allow for you to select your own unique playing style.\nThere is the opportunity for endless creativity with our map creation tools. Join in-game player-hosted public events, giveaways, and battles. As a massively multiplayer game, you\u2019ll get to fight against hordes of other players.\nCharge and fire your lasers for a big impact, fire cluster missiles from great distances, or get up close and personal with a heavy machine gun. You can choose whether you want to casually meet others in the world of Antraxx and show off your mech, or wage war and conquer lands with a team. There are countless ways to achieve peace in the never ending war known as Antraxx.\nTEAMWORK\nThere is a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay between your faction members and allies. No matter how powerful, one lone mech cannot withstand the might of an entire army. There is strength to be found in numbers. Join an existing faction, or if you wish you can even start your own and build a loyal following of friends and comrades-in-arms.\nSilver tongue? Every pilot has the opportunity to use the chaotic politics and economy of the world to their advantage and earn riches, power, land, and mechs through diplomacy alone. Will you take down empires with persuasion alone? Remember though, the taller they are, the harder they fall.\nARCADE-ESQUE\nWith tight, responsive controls, you can pilot your own giant mech to either aid or destroy your fellow pilots. Establish dominance by destroying all of the gun turrets and beacons on the field. When you have done so, the map will start a reinforcement timer to allow for the enemy team to defend their map and re-establish their rule.Inspired by classic arcade games, each battle is full of high adrenaline and explosive action.\nPlayers will fight for the control of special power-up points on the map which will allow them to restore energy, health, or even grant them special powers such as invisibility. Each map has its own individual mechanics which must be learned and mastered in order to provide a fresh but familiar experience every time. Individual maps will have different player limits, so choose your team wisely.\nAntraxx will immerse you in a detailed, 1980's themed post-apocalyptic world. It is up to you to dominate the battlefields with only your guns and armored mech to your name.\nSOVEREIGNTY\nEstablish dominance by destroying all of the gun turrets and beacons on the field. When you have done so, the map will start a reinforcement timer to allow for the enemy team to defend their map and re-establish their rule. After the timer lapses and the enemy team is unable to defend themselves, you\u2019ll have conquered the map and claimed sovereignty. Upon conquering the map, you can completely customize the turrets using a feature similar to the mechbay (details below). We will only allow limited re-positioning of turrets on the conquerable zones to prevent abuse.\n        No one mech is alike. You are able to choose various individual parts from multiple default mech builds and combine them into an unstoppable force. Trade resources and your own mechs parts in favour of others, or blow them off of another mech and steal them. The choice is yours.\nCUSTOMIZATION\nIn Antraxx you can collect mech parts and weapons to outfit your own individual mech. The character is fully customisable from legs, left and right arms, to cockpit and shoulder rocket packs. After selecting the desired parts, you can even choose colours for each individual part. In the game itself, you can find mech parts laying around from dead mechs in the map. You can also purchase them from the in-game store with your experience points, or you can trade with players. We are even allowing users to come to a battle agreement with a specific mech part as a reward!\nAntraxx offers many different colours and skins for mech parts, as well as supporting . Each piece such as shoulders, cockpit, legs and weapons will individually fit onto your mech in any combination you like.\nAnd, to make things more interesting, there will be special faction mech models that have a different print.\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\nThere are a lot of interesting gameplay mechanics. As for your mech character, you are dealing with damage, armour, speed and energy. For instance:\nENERGY\nOur game features powerful laser weapons and teleportation that requires the use of energy. Some use and require more energy than others.\nDAMAGE\nYou will receive damage when shot. The amount of damage depends on your armor stats and the strength of the opponent\u2019s weapon. If parts of your mech body become too damaged, they will explode and become malfunctioned. If a part malfunctions, you will not be able to use it anymore. This also means that if one of your guns is destroyed, you will deal less damage. The same goes for all other parts. If your legs are destroyed, you will not be able to walk. If your torso malfunctions, you can no longer rotate your upper body.\nSPEED\nThe more you fit on your mech, the slower you become. It is also dependent on the attributes of your parts. The above mechanics are boosted by your character's attributes. When you level up, your attributes gain points and your parts will increase points proportionately according to those attributes. You could potentially become faster, have more hit-points, or use less energy. We are still debating if we should develop the characters by restricting certain parts before you reach a certain level. For instance, not having shoulder parts would mean not being able to fly until you level up, or you could start with only two out of the four guns.\n          FACTIONS \n  We have spent so much time creating countless art assets and tools to assist us in development. We feel it would be a waste to not open it up to you. Using our editor, players can create maps and host their own games, events, and social meetups within them. The \u201cBATTLE\u201d mode allows for users to join other user hosted games. Battle mode will offer different game types compared to anywhere else in the world map, such as: free for all, team death-match, king of the hill and more. We aim to create various map construction kits to support multiples themes such as city, desert, space and more all containing over 2500 combinations of tiles/entities.  \n     We also have an in-game \u201cwired entity\u201d system, that allows you to place and use contraptions that involve things such as buttons, elevators, shield walls, cables and more. Of course a game wouldn\u2019t be complete without pickups and boosters which you will grow to rely on. These tiles randomly spawn boosters that will restore your mech to full energy, health, or activate a shield that will stay active until it breaks due to damage.\n        To get the merchandise pledge any of the 'MECH MODEL' tiers OR add 100 euros (110 dollars) to your pledge.\nWe create a high-poly, detailed model of the mech to print out with each mech piece split up and printable by itself (shoulders, cockpit, legs, weapons etc). We have attachments that can be fitted together to create a full mech from various pieces, meaning you can customise the printed models almost as much as you can in-game - with the added benefit of being able to paint it yourself if you choose to.  \n      Twitter & retweet this pinned post \nFacebook & share our pinned post\nYouTube\n  We have been developing Antraxx for over 5 years now\u2014at least since the initial concepts. When we first began we were far too naive (and ambitious) to achieve what we wanted to achieve. We have spent a lot of money over the years on art assets, server hosting and feeding ourselves all from our savings - but we can\u2019t continue that way. We\u2019ve built up a great fanbase, a loyal following and we know this is a game that people want.\nTo fully realise this dream we need financial support. We\u2019ve had talks with multiple publishers, but we don\u2019t really want to go down that route. We want this project to be an ever evolving world. Antraxx is not just one game, its a universe, a franchise and hopefully a legacy.\nSPECIAL THANKS TO\nWhile working on Antraxx we've had the chance to meet a lot of amazing people on our way to work with, and would like to take this opportunity to introduce them to you.\nINDIGO 2016 - Antraxx premiered at INDIGO, the showcase for the finest, most outstanding games by independent developers. The games range from brand new playable prototypes to completed games offering impressive and rich experiences. We took this experience to gather feedback and to stress test the client and server.\n  Kongregate is a great webbrowser gaming website that is part of the gamestop network. Kong is supporting us by giving away Kong+ to backers of Antraxx with a special pledge pack of \u20ac40,-. The original value of Kong+ alone is $29.99 A YEAR!\nKong Plus gets you more out of your Kongregate experience. Take advantage of ad-free gaming, cool profile skins, automatic beta access, and private chat with Kong Plus. Learn more on the Kongregate website\nAlthough we are currently not working together with MANA on the marketing for Antraxx and the promotion of our Kickstarter campaign we would like to thank Mana Marketing for a huge role in building our player base and getting the word out. We wouldn't have been able to be where we are today without them. A true recommendation to other indie game developers also. Check them out here.\n        DEVELOPMENT\nWe began prototyping Antraxx a few years ago under the old name \u201cMETA4\u201d, that had to change due to legal reasons. We initially used Actionscript with FlashDevelop in a custom 2D engine that ran on mobile devices, the web and desktop using Adobe Air. This worked well for our initial prototype and it helped us see many flaws in the game. \nLast year we decided to re-write the game and redo some of the initial concepts, no more point and click and more action. We are now utilising some of the latest technologies, such as WebGL and ES6. The engine is written to be scalable, networked and run on many platforms from the ground up. So far we support: Web, Windows, Mac, Linux and Android devices (tablets/mobiles) running Chrome. A mobile/tablet version of the game has been one of our goals since the project\u2019s inception. With your help we may be able to achieve this through stretch goals. It will require a lot more time and testing on physical devices, therefore more money but the technology is there already.\n    The game engine can be ran headless as a server or graphically as a client, which supports a full 3d environment (we use sprites and clever uv mapping tricks to achieve the isometric pixel art style), positional audio, lighting, dynamic shadows and much more that you\u2019d expect to find in modern games - all running in the browser. Antraxx runs entirely on custom proprietary software with support from libraries such as socket.io and THREE.js, there is no game engine such as Unity used.\nWe tweet more than daily @AntraxxGame - follow us to keep up with our development.\n    You may be wondering why it takes so much time and costs so much to create a mech, well let's break it down. A mech is composed of 8 individual components which have to be drawn separately in 16 angles (besides the legs which use 8, however their animation is the most complex). We need to ensure that each of these components is able to fit onto other mech models and still look good. Once the initial angles are drawn, certain pieces need animating. Let's count the frames:\n- Legs: 8 angles, 10 frames of animation = 80\n- Cockpit: 16 angles, 2 frames of animation = 32\n- Shoulder: 16 angles, 2 frames of animation = 32\n- Weapon (left): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\n- Weapon (right): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\n- Side weapon (left): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\n- Side weapon (right): 16 angles, 6 frames of animation = 96\nTotal: 528 individual frames per mech\n    GLOBAL BUDGET BREAKDOWN\nOf the aimed 30,000 euros (roughly 33,000 dollars), we will dedicate 29% to both artwork and continued development of the game, as well as initial server upkeep at launch. From our projected estimates we will be spending around 400 euros a month initially to run two regions of game servers (Europe and US). If we go over our goal we will be able to allot more funds to the servers which opens up more regions (such as Asia, Africa). The game engine has already been developed to a point where it is ready to fully flesh out the game world.\nIf we reach our stretch goals we can get friends who are very good pixel artists to help rapidly create art pieces that we can plug into the game. This includes but is not limited to: map construction kits, mech pieces, promotional artwork and in-game ui. Most of our rewards are digital or physical art pieces, which is why it is included in this tier. Our physical mech model is also included in this cut, we have a deal arranged with the manufacturer to produce as many as we require after Kickstarter is completed at a low rate due to the 3D model and prototype already being completed several months ago.\nYou may be wondering, why are we only aiming for 30k as an initial goal? Well, we have already invested over 35,000 euros into the project (near $40,000) over the course of development, with costs ranging from artwork to promotional material and server upkeep. Unfortunately, we have spent what we can afford to spend on the game without your support to help get it to completion.\nKickstarter and taxes take quite a large chunk, about 31% in total which leaves only 11% to audio for sound effects and music. We already have a large collection of in-game SFX, and we plan to produce a Noisia-ish style with heavy drum and bass influences combined with the old original starcraft OST. Leendert has 10 years experience in audio production, he has spent the majority of his time managing artists, producing art and promoting the game - but with your funding he cant wait to get his hands on more of the audio aspects of Antraxx and produce a full OST.\naccording to google on 3 October 2016\n MISC \n        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping any type of game is a huge undertaking and challenge, especially a multiplayer one. However, with over 10 years experience in programming, game development and networking, the technical issues, for the most part, have been overcome. We have had a demo available online on the browser which was connected to our server, providing a constant online world for a few months. It had a few issues to begin with but were smoothly ironed out and many optimizations were possible thanks to our dedicated fanbase that help us with testing and load balancing. So far we\u2019ve had over 1,500 individual players in the game and hope for many more as the game progresses. We\u2019ve had overwhelmingly positive feedback on how the game performs, how it plays and how it looks. After years of fine tuning, we finally have a solid direction.\n\nThere are still issues to face, however. The primary issue for us would be server upkeep, mainly because of the costs involved for the amount of players we want. This is one reason Kickstarter is a great idea, as it allows us to definitely have the funds there to be able to run the servers we require.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it won\u2019t be an easy road to balance the game and ensure its compelling and accessible to new and experienced players alike. This is something that only comes with extensive testing and user feedback. As our fans know, we frequent on our social channels requesting feedback and working with players to implement the ideas that they have or to resolve issues. To help solve this issue, we will run in early access for a few months before the game\u2019s launch to perfect gameplay as much as possible.\n\nRegardless of issues we will face, here is what we can promise:\nWe engage directly with the community and listen to feedback, and will continue to do so while we develop this game and maintain it. This isn\u2019t a game where we release it and then never touch it again\u2014we want it to be an ever evolving universe.\nWe'll have full transparency in regards to the development process, delays and issues we face.\n\nWe\u2019ve come this far. Now we just need your help to fully realise our's (and many of our fans') dream game.

Please see the FAQ for more information.\nGURPS (the Generic Universal RolePlaying System) turns 30 this year, and Dungeon Fantasy focuses its award-winning power on hack \u2018n\u2019 slash fantasy roleplaying, where stalwart heroes kick down doors, kill monsters, and take their stuff in order to grow powerful enough to tackle the next quest . . . which naturally features stronger doors, tougher monsters, and better stuff! \nAll images shown are work in progress and not 100% final.\nThis standalone boxed set contains everything you need to play: cardboard figures, combat maps, dice, and five full-color rulebooks that feature original art.\nAdventurers (128 pages). GURPS is famous for letting you play any character you can imagine. Dungeon Fantasy keeps this flexibility while trimming away unnecessary details, concentrating on just what matters to monster-slaying, treasure-hunting action: Pick from 11 classic professions and nine playable races, customize your alter-ego using quick-start templates and a powerful point-build system, and gear up with an equipment list that offers dozens of weapons and lets you assemble exactly the suit of armor that fits your image.\nExploits (112 pages). Learn how the heroes actually use their abilities and gear. That means combat, of course \u2013 and dozens of other activities, whether your thing is sneaking around, swinging from the scenery, exorcizing evil, or getting rich through cunning deals in town. This book also describes countless bad things that can befall adventurers (poison, traps, dismemberment, lava pits . . .), as well as good things, namely loot. And it\u2019s full of practical advice to the Game Master who leads this three-ring circus: challenging the players, keeping the action moving, settling arguments, and much more.\nSpells (80 pages). What would fantasy be without magic? Adventurers features four spellcasting professions (bard, cleric, druid, and wizard), and this volume describes over 400 spells to help you customize them. It also includes complete rules for how spells work \u2013 whether their power comes from the gods, Nature, or creepy tomes of forbidden wizardly knowledge.\nMonsters (64 pages). Once the adventurers are ready, and armed with weapons and magic, it\u2019s time to test their mettle! This catalog starts you out with more than 80 things that want to bite, claw, grab, sting, and curse the heroes \u2013 not just the predictable orcs and zombies, but also several Dungeon Fantasy originals. Each offers notes on tactics and variants, and the whole collection comes with advice and rules for adventurers dealing with monsters . . . and monsters dealing with adventurers.\nDungeon (24 pages). I Smell a Rat is a simple (but not simplistic!) quest designed to show new gamers the ropes. Like any classic hack \u2018n\u2019 slash adventure, it starts at the inn. From there, the heroes will find themselves facing traps, enemies, and unexpected twists \u2013 and finding treasure, although not necessarily gold and silver. Advice and \u201cadventure hooks\u201d let the Game Master challenge advanced players or spin the tale into a series of adventures.\nWhile based on the GURPS Basic Set and its GURPS Dungeon Fantasy and GURPS Magic supplements, this is a standalone roleplaying game, ready to play out of the box! It\u2019s compatible with GURPS, but the famously detailed rules have been streamlined to be friendlier to new gamers and veterans alike. For existing GURPS fans, revisions made in response to nearly 10 years of customer feedback on the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy series \u2013 along with completely new content unique to this set \u2013 make this a \u201cmust have.\u201d\nCheck out these stretch goals!\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All stretch goals listed below are only eligible to backers pledging $50 or more. Pledges of $49 or less do not receive any of the listed stretch goals.\nIn addition to your pledges, every dollar spent on GURPS and Pyramid Magazine goodies on Warehouse 23 during September 2016 counts toward the Kickstarter stretch goals.

Except for Pyramid: The Dungeon Fantasy Collection and future issues of Pyramid subscriptions, they will be delivered to backers after the campaign ends via Warehouse 23, the one-stop online shop for all your Steve Jackson Games needs.\nAll of these PDFs assume the reader has the GURPS Basic Set and usually GURPS Magic; most refer to earlier supplements in the series. With a little effort, however, you can use any of them with the Dungeon Fantasy RPG. \nThese items are especially easy to add to Dungeon Fantasy RPG games, with little reference to other supplements, or lots of material that can be used as-is.

A story about the value of science & skepticism, and their conflict with religion and narrative-based thinking. After the Gold Rush is a return to optimistic Science Fiction - the idea that the world can be better. \nThis Kickstarter aims to print the second chapter in the saga. Each issue is 22 pages long, with extra features such as web comic pages, a scientist of the issue section, write-in science corrections, etc. \nWe ran a Kickstarter last year to start After the Gold Rush, and thanks to all of our awesome backers we have enough to keep the story going for 4 issues! However, the plan was to keep them digital. Due to popular demand we are planning to print them now. And that is why we are back on Kickstarter. \nSee the cover for ATGR #2 close up.\n    This image will also be the logo on the T-Shirts!\nIt is good to have warnings, but it is better to have goals. Science Fiction is full of important stories warning us about the dangers of our hubris. That is a useful lesson, but it shouldn't be all we use the genre for. I grew up watching Star Trek, a show about exploration, progress, and ethics. While it didn't always nail the details, it cared about science and reason. After the Gold Rush is my small attempt to return some of those ideas to modern Science-Fiction.\n   This comic is also about the value of skepticism, and explaining what that means. Too often skeptics are synonymous with cynics. I want to show what skepticism is really about - caring about what's true. \nIf you want to know more, check out the episode of Skeptics Guide to the Universe I was on. I go over my aspirations for the book in more depth. \n  Isaac La Russa & Miles Greb\nMiles Greb - Creator & Writer - Former Bob Dylan impersonator whose obsession with Star Trek is annoying to everyone.\nIsaac La Russa - Lead Artist & Concept Artist -Based in Illinois, he wears motley flannels and owns two ungrateful cats.\nAdrian Geller - Colorist - Like Mario Paint for the SNES, but with nearly twice the personality\nAndrew Pierce - Editor - Lovable goof. Escaped Kipling protagonist.\nJamie Me - Lettering - Letterer who spends his time wearing pajamas called a 'gi' while learning the art of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\nBarry Blankenship -Cover Artist & Logo Design - Amateur cursing cat ventriloquist.\nLauren Uhde - Science Adviser - PhD student and all-around Biology Babe.\nBen Rodgers - Assistant Editor - Historian of historical biographies, at least he was historically. \n Poster Team - David Hovey ,Natasha Alterici, Chris Lewis Lee. \n You can follow the project closer at - @Goldrushcomic. \n Some of the characters and technology you will find in After the Gold Rush. I have some more concept art to show from things to come in future issues - see the stretch goals for more details! \nScout, the last scientist.\n  Exploration and Family.\n  The Beagle II, first manned mission to Titan.\n    What's left behind?\n    Scout and her chemical synthesizer.\n    The Axman.\n    A look at After the Gold Rush #1.\n  \"What a cradle.\"\n  A page from Issue #2.\n  This page is still in production. :)\n   Of course we have the comic book itself, and some beautiful prints. But first, I wanted you to take a moment and check out this amazing work by Milsae Kim.\n This print will be available as an 11\" X 17\", but it will also be part of a limited run of variant covers for After the Gold Rush #2. There will only be 100 printed. This is your best chance to get one. They will all be signed by Miles Greb.\nIf you didn't get a printed copy of #1 yet...\nIn case you missed out last time. :)\n New Reward! 48 hours special, a one of a kind sketch cover. \nThis reward, the Luna Level, features this one of a kind cover, the variant cover, and a signed copy of ATGR #1. \nThe Reward Levels\nA Look at the Art Pints\nAll the prints are 11\" x 17\" except for \"Inspire Science\", that is 8 1/2\"x11\". They are all printed on a high quality glossy card stock, and look great. If you back at a reward level with a large art print, you may choose whatever one you fancy. Here are your options. \nShirts\nThey are print on demand, so sizes S to XL are available!!\nBy popular demand we have included After the Gold Rush T-shirts as reward options! Wear this to show your science-loving comic support around town, and wherever cool comic-people hangout. The T-shirts are print on demand, so sizes should not be an issue. I think they look pretty cool. \nCustom Profile Art, by Isaac La Russa\nWant to see yourself in a Cyro suit or a Titan Explorer uniform? There are reward tiers with both a full body commission like the one you see below. or, you can get a profile done that is perfect to use for facebook or twitter. The art will be delivered to you digitally.\nA Comission we did last time. The Cyro Suit.\nFull body art commissions by Aimee Zhou\nWe also have the amazing storyboard artist Aimee Zhou on staff. The $125 dollar reward level includes a hand drawn commission of you in a Titan Explorer or Cyro suit! And the original art will be delivered to you! Pretty cool. \nAimee will draw you in a ATGR suit, and you get the actual copy!\n Stretch Goals\nIf things go really well I would love to be able to continue the ATGR webcomic. It precedes the events of ATGR, and follows Scout as a young girl growing up on Titan. You can check it out here for FREE.\n    As some of you know, we ran a Kickstarter last summer to get the whole story started. Thanks to everyone's support we have the funds needed to finish all the art for ATGR #2. We had planned to release it digitally only, not printed. \n    However, demand for a printed copy has been really high, so here is your chance to make it a reality. Most of the budget will go directly into Printing Costs and Shipping. Another small chunk will go into art fees for commissions done especially for this Kickstarter - the variant cover and some new art commissions. Lastly, fees from Kickstarter, taxes, stuff like that.\n  This graphic shows the normal cost for an issue, it's different for this Kickstarter however. But, it gives you a good idea of the costs\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAside from any tragedies among the creative team or when shipping the freight, I feel confident everything will work out. \nThis is my second comic book campaign, and the first one went well.

Whether you pledged on day one or you pledge on the last day you will receive these! If you are getting 3 full games, you also get 3 sets of stretch goal rewards!\n*the only tier not eligible for stretch goal rewards is the first ($16) tier, which was created exclusively for the purpose of reducing shipping cost to international backers.\nOrganATTACK! brings to life medical and pseudoscientific concepts in a twisted, hilarious, very fun, and surprisingly educational card game for anyone who owns organs.*\n\nDeveloped, designed and illustrated by The Awkward Yeti, creator of four successful Kickstarter campaigns,* including this one to make Heart and Brain plush toys. Awkward Yeti comics reach millions each month on the web, including a portion of 1.2 million Facebook fans. (*100% of The Awkward Yeti's campaigns have reached or exceeded their goals!)\nA beta test was held with about 30 participants to help refine the game\n  Gallbladder's Last Day\nThe Awkward Yeti is the New York Times best selling cartoonist behind Heart and Brain, as well as the cartoonist behind Lars on LINE Webtoon, Medical Tales Retold on Tapastic, and a variety of viral comics. A great deal of care was applied to the development of the game over the past year - making sure there was a good balance between randomness and strategy, that the medical themes are often informative but requires absolutely no medical understanding, and that the representations of characters were true to the comics.\nI've been wanting to make a board game for much longer than that, but could never quite figure out the details. With card games seemingly making a comeback (or at least with me becoming aware of this comeback last year) I started thinking of ways I could simplify my mindset. One day I went for a run, accidentally forgetting my headphones at home, forcing me to use my brain for entertainment. That's when I came up with the initial concept for the card game in its entirety. All during one run. Since then of course I spent countless hours developing and re-developing that concept, and that's where we are now...\nAbout the Game\nThe object of the game is to remove your opponents' organs using corresponding afflictions before they remove yours. The last person to still have at least one organ is the winner.\nIn addition to Affliction cards (like Pancreatitis, which can be played on either Gallbladder or Pancreas), the game has instant defensive cards, and lots of crazy tactical moves that shake things up. What you end up with is a pretty fast-paced, very fun, and often intense gameplay that's suitable for all levels of players.\nThe game is best enjoyed by 2-5 players.\n\nORGAN DECK (20 cards):\nThere are 19 organs in the deck, plus one Organ WILD card. The 19 organs were chosen based on the most used Awkward Yeti characters, and include most of the major organs like Heart and Brain, as well as fan favorites like Tongue and Teeth. \nOrgans require 2 afflictions for removal and the Organ WILD requires 4 afflictions for removal (however, it is susceptible to any affliction card)\nATTACK DECK (72 cards):\nAfflictions: It takes two corresponding afflictions to remove an opponent's organ. Afflictions match up with one or more organs and can only be played on that organ (unless you play it along with Metastasis, which turns an Affliction into a Wild)\nWilds: Wilds can be played as one affliction on any organ, except for Necrosis Wild cards, which instantly remove an organ\nResistance: Defensive cards that resist attacks or instantly block attacks\nTactical and Bureaucracy: These cards shake the game up in a variety of ways. For example, \"Kidnapped\" allows you to take an opponent's organ for yourself. \"Sedate\" skips an opponent for two turns, etc\nPoisoned: As soon as the card is drawn, the player must remove one of his/her own organs.\nThe two decks will be packaged side by side in a nice box along with the rule book (I will update as I have more specific info/design available)\nHyperthyroidism\nAbout the Kickstarter\nSome specifics are subject to change\nThe Awkward Yeti has successfully completed multiple Kickstarter campaigns to raise money for new projects, including this campaign for Heart and Brain plush toys. Without these campaigns, major product launches simply would not be possible. It's one of the best ways to show support for a webcomic cartoonist!\nThe game has been in development for about a year and has been through multiple revisions and a full beta test, so it should be ready for production within a few weeks of the Kickstarter's end (pending any improvements).\nThe goal was set to be the minimum amount I believe will be needed for production of the game, shipping to backers, and Kickstarter and credit card fees. I am prepared to cover additional fees myself if necessary. Of course, there's great hope that it will go well beyond the goal!\nNote: Backers are charged AFTER the Kickstarter ends, ONLY IF the original goal is met.\nThe game should be produced and shipped out to backers before the winter holidays, so keep it in mind as a gift!\nSHIPPING RATES: These have been calculated based on the lowest USPS rates available to us after their recent price increases. These were calculated based on estimated weights, which will exceed the low weight threshold of 13oz. Higher tiers have been given discounted shipping due to the amount pledged.\nGoals:\nThe more money we raise, the lower the price per game will be, and that means room for bonuses! Here's what Kickstarter backers can expect at each level (goals in color have been reached):\n  We hit the goal in less than an hour! WOW!\n  Enjoy your stickers!\n  ooh la la, these games will look nice!\n  The gift will be a set of customized Poker cards! All backers at a $20 tier or higher will receive this at no extra charge!

My story is about Scout, a family dog who gets lost in the woods, runs into a lonesome bigfoot, and how they work together to survive all kinds of deadly hazards and emotional peril. The comic was just an experiment at first, but it caught on, and people liked it. And I\u2019ve never had more fun working on anything.\nWho's it for?\nUntold Tales of Bigfoot is great for comic fans of any age. There's no swearing, no nudity \u2013 just good clean fun, adventure, a little mystery and a lot of heart.\nWhat are we all doing here?\nIf we reach our goal, this Kickstarter will get Untold Tales of Bigfoot into print and into your hands.\nWhat else can I get?\nBesides the book (printed & pdf versions) we'll have digital wallpaper, bookmarks, stickers, button sets, one-of-a-kind commissioned artwork \u2013 even some fun options for putting you right there in the woods with Bigfoot and Scout!\nReward Tiers\nIf you just want the book, you can get just the book. But If you want to stack custom art and other fun rewards on top of that, I've got you covered. Here's a quick breakdown:\nSometimes it's easier to visualize what you're getting with actual images. So here are some featured reward tiers.\nThe Scout Tier ($26) is your basic, printed book tier. You get the book, the bookmark, and the digital assets.\nThe Sleeping Bears Two-Pack ($46) is for anyone who needs a second book for collecting, or gift-giving, or whatever.\n The Naturalist Tier ($55) is a great value that offers a lotta' bang for your buck and includes a custom cartoon illustration of you deep in the woods with Bigfoot and Scout.(NOTE: If you're caricature-shy, you could have your friend, spouse or child take your place in the woods next to Bigfoot. No problem! And a great gift idea!)\nThe Cave Drawings Tier ($100) Gives you everything from The Naturalist Tier PLUS you can get me to draw any single character you want (no nudity) and I'll hand ink it, color it with grey marker, sign it and ship it out with your book. Imagine the possibilities!\nThe Sweet Baby Corn Tier ($350, limited to 4 people) puts you right in the action as a character in a 6-page Untold Tales of Bigfoot short that'll run online. You'll also get a special Kickstarter Edition Comic Book of the printed story.\nStretch Goals!\n$9,000 Book Upgrade! If we reach $9,000, everybody who bought a physical copy of the book gets an upgrade to a more elaborate, deluxe version of the book! That includes a more substantial cover, an introduction by award-winning author Matthew Cody (whose books are fantastic fun for middle-grade to adult readers -- check 'em out), and an afterword by me discussing the origins of this comic.\n$10,000 Patch! If we reach $10,000, everybody who bought a physical copy of the book gets a 3-inch, fully-embroidered Friend of Bigfoot Patch to show the world that you and Bigfoot are good buddies!\n Want to add an extra copy of the book?\nI've had a few requests about add-ons from folks who'd like a second copy of the book for collecting, gift-giving and even donating to their school library (way to go!). Kickstarter doesn't make it easy, but the prevailing method seems to be clicking the \u201cManage\u201d button and adding the price of a book to your pledge. In this case, if you've pledged to get a physical book already ($24 and above), an extra, signed copy of Untold Tales of Bigfoot is just another $20. Here's how to do it:\nI ask you to remind me twice that you added an extra book because I want to make sure I get your order correct. I'm nutty that way.\nNote to International Buyers: Adding one (1) extra copy of the book to your bundle ($24 or higher) won't raise your shipping, thank goodness. Message me if you'll need more than one extra. Also, I know the international shipping rates are high and there's not much I can do about that. But, to try to ease the pain just a little, any international backers who pledge for a physical copy of the book get this free sticker.\nWhat's this now? Samples and blurbs?\nI didn't want to give too much of the story away to those who aren't familiar with it, but here are some sample pages from the book and some very nice things a few very talented folks had to say about Untold Tales of Bigfoot.\n        Where's all the money going?\nMost of the funds contributed go toward printing the book, having it shipped to me, and then mailing it out to you. Another smaller percentage goes toward art and shipping supplies, and some of the smaller rewards. The final chunk of change is handed over to Kickstarter/Stripe for their fees.\nAnd I'll be using PrintNinja for the books because they've done a fantastic job with many of the Kickstarter Graphic Novels I've backed.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBook One is done. Art and story. So that's a load off. But, having backed a few Kickstarters myself, I'm aware that even with great preparation, sometimes a monkey-wrench is tossed into the gears (production issues, illness, backers dropping out, etc.). But if we get the books shipped to us in a timely manner, I'll begin signing/sketching in them as soon as they're in hand. And I hope to start any commissioned pieces as soon as I can collect the information from the buyers. That, too, takes time but literally all I do all day is draw, so I'm used to that. So it's really just a matter of getting the art done and sending it out. And, while all these variables prevent me from pinning down an exact date, overall, I feel confident that, as long as we get the money to print this book, I can fulfill the rewards as promised in a timely manner. \n\nFor those who choose \u201cThe Naturalist\u201d tier, I'll send out your physical rewards as soon as I'm done signing/drawing in your books. The digital file of you with Bigfoot & Scout will be finished as soon as possible and emailed separately.\n\nIf anyone chooses the \u201cSweet Baby Corn\u201d reward tier, they'll receive the bulk of their rewards as soon as I'm done signing/drawing in the books. The digital file of you with Bigfoot & Scout will take some time and will be emailed separately. But the 6-page short will take longer. I'll be drawing that and posting it as quickly as I can, but that'll take longer to accomplish than the single Bigfoot/Scout image. The story is outlined, but receiving your photos, doing character studies, and drawing your characters in multiple panels will take a while. I don't have an exact date set for when the 6-pager will post, but I'll send out updates along the way to keep you apprised and after it's had it's run online I will have the pages printed and bound and ship that special Kickstarter Edition comic to you separately.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Untold Tales of Bigfoot Nominated for another Reuben", "update_content": "Apologies to anyone who\u2019s had to hear this news a dozen times so far this year, but I just realized I hadn\u2019t posted it here, in Kickstarter, where some of my biggest supporters connect with me.\nIt might seem like deja vu from a year ago, but Untold Tales of Bigfoot was once again nominated for a Reuben from the National Cartoonists Society in the category of Online Comics - Longform.

Now you can get extra rewards just for being a generous fan of quality comics.\n I've been involved in the roleplaying game industry for most of my career. I run my own freelance illustration company, James Stowe Illustration. Four years ago I started an online comic project called Sidekick Quests that combined my experience with roleplaying games with my love of illustration in a project that I could share with my kids and ideally other geeky parents could share with their kids.\nInitially I created a simplified version of 4th Ed. DnD for my then 6 year old son\u2019s birthday party. I had been toying around with some long form comic ideas and once people really started responding to the work I did for that party I decided to expand upon it.\nAnd now here we are. I really want Sidekick Quests to be a living roleplaying game. I find the idea of a comic that can be played as an ever changing and expanding roleplaying game setting is something I\u2019ve always wanted to play. And if it is also a way to introduce a new generation to tabletop RPGs, all the better. It was from the ideas and solutions I worked into those initial sheets that I developed Sidekick Quests, both as a comic and as a stand alone roleplaying game for kids. Two of the characters from the sheets (the ranger and the bard, see above) actually converted directly into characters in the comic (those being Benton the Scout and Dalea the Amateur Minstrel respectively. I have always enjoyed world building, so taking those sheets and creating an entire world around them was one of my favorite parts of the process. I have pages and pages of notes and thumbnail sketches about the World of Adventur (the setting of Sidekick Quests) and its denizens and lore.\n  Sidekick Quests is one of the great joys of the internet. Part roleplaying game, part web comic, it's unique, and delightful. Kids and parents alike will love James Stowe's lively, wonderful creation - as my daughter and I already do.\nJohn Kovalic - innovator of fantasy roleplaying comics since 1997, creator of Dorktower and Munchkin artist extraordinaire!\n(James Stowe\u2019s) world and characters captures imaginations in young and old alike. Sidekick Quests is doing a huge part to seed the next generation of tabletop gamers with positive messages and healthy table habits that encourage inclusiveness and fair play. You cannot go wrong laying down your hard-earned dollars on this campaign.\nBrian Patterson - creator of d20Monkey  \n(Sidekick Quests the Roleplaying Game) feels like the best game of DND you played as a twelve year old indoor kid, in all the best ways.\nChris O\u2019Neil - Kobolds Ate My Baby and 9th Level Games  \nSidekick Quests is engaging, dynamic, and everything that a kid's RPG should be. It's got old-school charm, indie sensibilities, and is just plain fun.\nTracy Barnett - Exploding Rogue Studios\nJames took what could've been a one-off internet meme and turned it into an earnest love letter to fantasy adventure.\nDaniel Solis - Creator of more fantastic indy tabletop games than you can shake a Kodama branch at.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is James Stowe's very first Kickstarter. While the updated comic and script for the adventure are complete the 10 bonus pages, art prints, and maps still need to be created and the adventure copy needs to be edited and laid out.Every publishing project carries risks. Sidekick Quests is created, illustrated, written, game developed and directed by one guy, James Stowe (with some amazing assistance from his editor/internet guru Anna Izenman and writing/playtesting help from his family) If James were to be struck my lightning or choke on a ham sandwich, it would have a big impact on the completion of this project than a larger company might see. Sidekick Quests uses outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks and delays there James can\u2019t foresee or control.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "Just 72 hours left on Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hello everyone!  \nThank you so much for your support.

In a few months from now you will receive the package with your documents and rewards. \nIn the meantime, should an officer randomly request your documents, use this temporary pass. We've also added a gift coupon, courtesy of the Ministry of Information.\nThere is just a bit more information I need to share with you and then you can proceed to the nearest Tech-Bar to celebrate your registration.\nConcerning the budget: All costs and potential extra expenses have been calculated and re-calculated by the most advanced mech-accountants. Almost half of the funds will go to the production of the books and the extras. A big print run will be produced with the maximum quality possible. The rest will cover the shipping, the fees for the Ministry of Kickstarting and our mighty Corporate Payment Overlords, and general Taxes from the Robotic Union.\nThe content will be finished and sealed with the stamp of approval from the Robo-President by the end of August. The production will be done in early September, followed by a quality check on every book and extras, and the packaging phase. \nBy the first of October the shipping phase will begin, and by the end of the month all the proud Robo-Citizen will have their packages.\nThank you for your cooperation.\nLong live the Robo-President!

We actually started with a successful Kickstarter, and have been aiming to publish around 12 comics a year ever since.\nSo why another Kickstarter?\nWe want to make sure the printed quality of our comics stays as high as possible to match the vision of all of our artists, but we also want to be able to pay our artists more upfront! Creating comics is a slow and difficult process, so more money in advance helps the artists instead of waiting to be paid after their comic has been selling for a long time.\n\nWhat comics are you going to publish?\nWe've got a lot of artists we are super excited about! We'll publish 6 in the spring and 6 in the fall.\n We All Wish For Deadly Force by Leela Corman\n72 color pages, 6x8.5 inches (140x152 mm), perfect bound softcover graphic novel\nWe All Wish For Deadly Force is a collection of Leela's short stories.\nLeela Corman is an illustrator, cartoonist, and Middle Eastern dancer who lives in Gainesville, Florida, with her husband Tom Hart and their daughter, Molly Rose.

If you find love in many places, can you see it when it is right in front of you?\nJames Kochalka is the first Cartoonist Laureate of Vermont and lives in Burlington, Vermont. His works include Monkey vs Robot, SuperF*ckers, the Johnny Boo and Dragon Puncher series for children, and his 14-year span of daily diary comics American Elf.

His other new comic Talk Dirty to Me will be published by AdHouse in May!\nThe 6 comics for the fall are still being finished by the artists, so those will come out throughout the fall as they are finished but should all be finished by December!\nWhen are these coming out?\nWe will be printing and shipping 2 comics together, to get printing discounts and to save you shipping when they get mailed out!

Plus you'll receive the DRM-free PDF copy and digital comics bundle!\n   My name is Josh Trujillo and I am a writer based in Los Angeles. Comic books are a lifelong passion of mine, and I have spent many years learning to navigate the industry. This has meant internships at publishers including Dark Horse, and Archaia, visiting conventions all over the United States, and trying to hone my skills as a creator.\nIn the past few years I have taken it more seriously, getting work published in anthologies like ANYTHING THAT LOVES, UNLAWFUL GOOD, and having short stories featured in books like THE REASON FOR DRAGONS. In addition, I self-publish my own comics and last year launched the fantasy gaming anthology, DEATH SAVES! Next month ADVENTURE TIME: THE FOUR CASTLES, an original graphic novel I wrote for BOOM! Studios, debuts. I'm very excited about it!!\nLOVE MACHINES has been my main project during this whole time. I'm a bit of a romantic at heart, and put way too much thought into the way that we interact with technology of all sorts. Publishing, and trying to market these technological romance comics has not been an easy task. Action is what most often sells in mainstream comics, not heart. Having said that, it has been a hugely rewarding experience taking my comics on tour, interacting with fans and my fellow creators, and trying to find a place for it in the complicated comics cosmology.\nWhile there are a few other romance titles out there, nobody is doing quite what I am. It is my hope that, like with DEATH SAVES last year, LOVE MACHINES is able to connect to a wider readership through this campaign. It would be a huge deal to be able to collect these stories in a more permanent format.\nIt would be humbling to fund the printing of this hardcover collection. If we're fortunate enough to achieve that goal I have some ideas on what to do next...\n$5,000 - BONUS STORY - AN ELECTRIC MOON - UNLOCKED -If we reach this total an additional 16-page story will be added, \"An Electric Moon\" by the amazing JT Cole! This tale serves as a perfect endcap for this collection, and deals with how a complicated love is threatened by the latest technological innovation -- electricity. This would bring our total page count up to 176 pages!\n$8,000 - ANOTHER BONUS STORY - RISE TO VOTE - Oh man this seems like a lot of money! But if we get there you will get a second bonus LOVE MACHINES story, \"Rise to Vote\" by SM Vidaurri. This 16-page story touches on the delicate physical (and social) machinations we use in elections. This would bring the page count up to 192 pages!\n   Most of the money will go directly to our North American printer. The remainder of the funds will allow us to fulfill our pledged Kickstarter rewards, cover miscellaneous production/promotional fees, and cushion us in case shipping costs go over (they often do!)\nThe creators of this project have already been compensated for their work, independent of whether or not we reach our fundraising goal.\nA thank you to everyone who has helped make LOVE MACHINES a reality! It is exciting to be so close to realizing my vision for the project. I never would have been able to make it this far without the support of the talented friends, family, and peers who have guided me up to this point.\nAn especially big thanks to the artists who were willing to help tell these stories. It has taken enormous commitment (and often sacrifice) on their part to make these comics happen. I only hope that this collection will properly spotlight all of the amazing talented I have had the pleasure of working with over the years.\n\"Lung\" art and colors by Patrick Horvath.\n\"Workers of All Lands, Unite!\" art by Ryo Kawakami, colors by Mike Dake, letters by Adam Pruett.\n\"Solenoids\" art by JB Wolfe.

That series is now being collected into a 104-page softcover graphic novel, but in the meantime we've got another three Semiautomagic stories we would like to include in a special, expanded edition of that graphic novel: a box set including a second, 80-page softcover of new stories.\nSemiautomagic follows the highs and lows (mostly lows) of occult investigator Alice Creed, an average girl from a bad part of town who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. A decade after the wrong turn that changed her life, she is who you call when magic ends up in murder. \nBut the magic of Alice's world isn't the cozy, familiar magic of Vertigo books: no myths and legends, no Bast and Queen Mab here. Just the void, and inexplicable, incomprehensible things coming through from other dimensions, other colours of space. Magic itself is a thing with barely understandable rules and many, many unforeseen results. There is a strong element of J-horror, too: one of the ways that predators and parasites come through into our world is via technology, and via places that have some profound impact on our cultural consciousness -- NATO nuclear test sites, for example. This is modern horror, set in the strange nooks and crannies of America, the forgotten places of shadow in our nation. Stay weird, America.\na panel from Semiautomagic: The Bomb That Will Bring Us Together\nAlice is a character that Alex and Jerry developed together, and Jerry was crucial in so many aspects, from her design, to story ideas, to pushing for Alice to be based in New England, an area very familiar to both of us. The book is very scary and very disturbing, but is technically PG. While there is body horror, it is not sexual in nature, nor is there excessive gore or indeed any nudity. To be fair, we didn't need to resort to cheap thrills in Semiautomagic. It's more a book of creeping, unsettling horror that stays with you long after you're done.\nRead the first eight pages of our first Semiautomagic story below! It was published in Dark Horse Presents #4, in 2014.\nThe 104-page softcover is 100% complete. Of the new stories, all are written, and Jerry is well into drawing the longer of his two stories, \"Childhood's End\". Lara has begun work on her story, \"A Town Called Malice\". The series' original editor, Brendan Wright, has joined us on a freelance basis, and Dark Horse is handling design and printing because they have fabulous deals with their printers that we can't even imagine (this means you get a much better quality book, and we get a much lower print bill!).\nDark Horse will be releasing just the 104-page softcover in June. (It's in February Previews right now). They will NOT be selling the box set, or the 80-page new book. The new book is only available as part of the box set in this Kickstarter, and we're only planning to print 1,000 of them. Our box set should be ready to send to backers in August.\nWhat you're getting:\nFunding goal: $21,000\nPrinting, shipping, covers, kickstarter fees, plus art for \"Childhood's End\". \n*Book 1: 104-page softcover collection of Jerry, Alex, and Marissa's two Semiautomagic arcs in Dark Horse Presents: The Bomb That Brings Us Together and Throne of Blood. \n*Book 2: 28-page new Semiautomagic story, drawn by Jerry Ordway and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"Childhood's End\". Alice plunges into Seussian madness while investigating a Howard Hughes-esque recluse in a shuttered Maine mansion. See updates for Jerry's pages in progress!\n*Hardcover case / box with cover by Jerry Ordway.\nnb: printing, shipping and fees is most of this goal. Le sigh.\nStretch goal #1: $26,000\nArt for \"A Town Called Malice\".\n*Book 2 becomes 60 pages, adding a 32-page story drawn by Lara Margarida and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"A Town Called Malice\". Alice's friend Harriet, who is unstuck in time and falls into a different timestream every 24 hours, attempts to rescue a woman who made a wish while burning her wedding bouquet... and is now dealing with the horrifying consequences of that wish coming true. It's about what happens to manic pixie dreamgirls after they marry the damaged hero, and when the manic pixie-ness isn't enough any more to paper over that damage.\nBut why have Lara draw this and not Jerry? Lara is an amazing artist in her own right, and as this is a story about Harriet (not Alice, our usual main character) we thought it would be lovely to bring in a rising star alongside Jerry. Plus, with Jerry already providing almost 40 pages of new story, we wanted all three new stories to be drawn and the box set to be out within a reasonable time after the Dark Horse collection came out -- not practicable if we added another 32 pages to Jerry's workload. See updates for Lara's pages in progress! \nStretch goal #2: $28,000\n Art for \"The Hollow Man\".\n*Book 2 becomes 80 pages, adding a 12-page story drawn by Jerry Ordway and coloured by Marissa Louise: \"The Hollow Man,\" as Alice goes to Los Angeles and finds out what is eating a famous actor. \nStretch goal #2: $31,000\n A Tomer Hanuka cover.\n*Hardcover case/box gets an exclusive Tomer Hanuka cover. Tomer Hanuka is a legendary Israeli illustrator who also provided the cover to Alex's Smoke/Ashes book, and Alex kinda has a thing about unifying design across her books. \n* * *\nOriginal cover for debut instalment of Semiautomagic in Dark Horse Presents #4\nI have questions! Course ya do, sunshine.\nI love Jerry Ordway! Yeah, we do too :D. But I'm really sad you don't have more sketch or commission rewards! We don't have them because we love Jerry. He is already setting aside a massive chunk of time to draw the Semiautomagic pages, and frankly we don't want Kickstarter to eat his life. We also want any commission income to go straight to him. So, if you DO want a Jerry Ordway commission to go with your book, at his normal commission rates, please message us and we'll put you in touch to work that out directly with him!\nAlso where are the prints and posters and buttons and stuff? Do you dig those? For real? Because I've backed like 50 Kickstarter projects and all I really want is the darn book. I have whole drawers of cards and mini-prints and other kerfuffle that got sent along with the darn book that I just... ignore. But hey, you're the boss. If enough of you message us and are like \"we will die if we all don't get buttons\", heck, we'll do buttons.\nBut why isn't Dark Horse just publishing this? Why do you have to Kickstart? Everyone involved in this project has families, and does comics as their full-time career. That means it's pretty hard to be like \"I'm just gonna take three months off getting paid and do some pages for fun\". Alas, our mortgage companies don't take \"exposure\". And graphic novels just don't make enough money that Dark Horse can hand us $30k and be like, \"sure, you crazy kids run along and write/draw more horror stories!\". For example: we are likely to sell as many copies of Semiautomagic in this Kickstarter as Dark Horse will in the first month of the 104-page collection's release. We are so, so thrilled that Dark Horse is being supportive of us and is already helping us so much with design and by letting us leverage the agreements they have with their printers... let's not be greedy, shall we?\nThe first panel of Semiautomagic: Throne of Blood\nWould you do more Semiautomagic stories after this? Heck yes. We have so many we want to do... but we're not cheap dates (we can't actually afford to live on the sort of indie-comic page rates projects like this usually get), and we're doing the book in an unfashionable format: short one- and two-issue stories that sometimes build into other things and sometimes don't, rather than six-issue arcs \"for the trade\" (and the option). I'm really hoping this Kickstarter is successful so we can come back and do another one for more new work after this... perhaps a \"Semiautomagic Annual\" that we could send separately? Oh the dreams we have! But let's get this baby funded first.\nAre there zombies or vampires in Semiautomagic? No.\nWhy not hardcover editions? $$$$. Like, maybe if we hit all our stretch goals and then overfund, I'll upgrade everyone? But for us, more story content is a higher priority than hard covers. What do you think?\nSo what if you do crazy-overfund? Kinda just got a temptation to divide any overfunds around the entire creative team, rather than killing ourselves to do extra stuff. You don't make a lot of money in comics. We're all just scraping by, honestly, and a little bonus would be nice.\nWhy aren't you willing to suffer for your art? Because that's charming at 20 and truly tedious by 40.\nCan I have just the new book? No. \nNo points for guessing he's not a good guy.\nHow did you come up with the pricing for the books? (Cost of creation) / (Print Run) + (Error margin) = Book price. Yeah, we wish it was a bit cheaper too, but even with DH on our side, a box set print run for 180 pages of content ain't cheap.\nI'm a retailer and I want to sell this set in my store. Do you have a retailer package? OKAY FINE I ADDED ONE JEEZ GUYS. Please bear in mind there is the $12.99 Dark Horse 104-pager (eg half our box set) that comes out in June, and our box set won't come out until August at earliest. \nIs this your first time at the rodeo? Oh, heck no. I raised $32,000 in the early days of Kickstarter for my graphic novel Ashes. It proved a far more challenging project than expected, and we did deliver 9 months late. Hopefully making up for that, we delivered twice the book we promised (it became a collected edition of Ashes and its 2005 prequel Smoke), in a better format than promised (cased hardbacks for everyone!), and with a more exciting lineup of artists than promised (Sienkiewicz! Doran! McNeil! Gu\u00e9ra!). And we turned around every book to ship to backers in less than a week after they arrived. So, when life gives you lemons, punch them so hard you shatter the space-time continuum. Or something.\nSEMIAUTOMAGIC: OPENING 8 PAGES\n(Originally printed in Dark Horse Presents #4. These are my old lettering copies, so the magenta dotted line and crop marks obvs aren't there in the final version. You can see Harriet, the lead in \"A Town Called Malice\", on page 8!)\nSemiautomagic P.1\nSemiautomagic p.2\nSemiautomagic p.3\nSemiautomagic p.4\nSemiautomagic p.5\nSemiautomagic p.6\nSemiautomagic p.7\nSemiautomagic p.8\n THE TEAM!\nAlex de Campi is an Eisner-nominated comics writer. Her recent books No Mercy and Archie vs Predator have achieved both critical and commercial success, and her Grindhouse series at Dark Horse started the recent revival of exploitation-cinema comic books. Valentine, her groundbreaking fantasy-thriller digital comic with Christine Larsen, is widely credited as having established the digital-native storytelling techniques used by the flood of later digital-native graphic stories It's also been downloaded over half a million times. Alex lives in Northern New England with her daughter and a pair of rescue dogs.\nJerry Ordway is a legendary comics artist and writer, known mostly for his work at DC. He has famous runs on Superman, Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Captain Marvel. He can draw anything, from the sweetest and most romantic Superman / Lois portrait to the most visceral horror. He lives in New England with his family.\nMarissa Louise is a Portland-based illustrator, colourist and thinker who has brought her dazzling and modern touch to Semiautomagic from the beginning.\nLara Margarida is a comics and storyboard artist based in the UK. We all love her and she's gonna be the next big thing. You heard it here first.\nBrendan Wright is a freelance editor with nearly a decade of experience in in the field, between Dark Horse Comics, Top Shelf Productions, and independent projects. He was the original, developing editor on Semiautomagic. He is based in Portland.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk with this project is it being late. Though one book (the 104-page Dark Horse Presents collection of Semiautomagic) is already complete and Jerry and Lara have already started on their pages for the 80-page second book, it is never beyond the realms of possibility that an artist could have something come up in their life that means a deadline needs to be missed.\n\nWe have a pretty good infrastructure in place to manage this: the series' original editor Brendan Wright is riding shotgun on everyone; we have Dark Horse itself managing the design and printing; and lord knows I've successfully managed and delivered on a comics Kickstarter before where a lot of unexpected issues came up. (Unlike Ashes, however, this project is: smaller, far more substantially complete, and involves a team I already know well and trust. In other words, maybe I learned my lesson.) \n\nI also feel that the experience of Ashes taught me that backers should be able to ask for refunds at any time up until the book is in the mail, if they are unhappy with the way the project is going or any delays in it. Although we do not expect delays, I really loved the \"anytime refund\" policy we had at Ashes and will continue it with Semiautomagic.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "New ONE WEEK ONLY Kickstarter for two sci-fi graphic novels", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "ALL BOOKS ARE SENT", "update_content": "Hey everybody!
