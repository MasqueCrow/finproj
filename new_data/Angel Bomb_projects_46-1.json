[{"backer": "Angel Bomb", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Antarktikos is a printed magazine, published once a year. This annual journal combines artistic and scientific exploration within the awe-inspiring and thought-provoking context of Antarctica.\n\nFounder\nMy name is Esther Kokmeijer and I am the editor, creative director and graphic designer of ANTARKTIKOS magazine. Since 2013, I have been seasonally working as a guide and expedition photographer in the Arctic and Antarctic.\n\nAntarctica is the last great untouched wilderness, and there is not a more merciless place on Earth. The landscape is of such incredible and unparalleled beauty and being immersed in it fosters an extraordinary sense of wonder.\n\nFor a long time, I have wanted to publish a magazine dedicated to Antarctica. That dream is about to come true. I believe in the effectiveness and potency of combining art and science and in the potential for gaining new insights by compiling many ideas around one theme.\n\nCreating this magazine in collaboration with many artists and scientists provides me with the opportunity to research how art and science can reinforce each other.\n\nMy work has been widely exhibited and published worldwide. For various projects, I have visited 84 countries. Furthermore, I participated in long term art residency programmes in The Netherlands, Indonesia, South Korea, Greenland, Antarctica, Spitsbergen, Germany, France, Mongolia, and China. For more info about my works you can have a look on my website. www.estherkokmeijer.nl / www.facebook.com/estherkokmeijer\nAntarctic Sound, Antarctica (photo: Yanina El Kassisse)\nWhy\nThe vast continent of Antarctica is an isolated location whose harsh conditions and heavenly natural serenity have long appealed to the imagination. However, the remaining opportunities for this untouched no man\u2019s land are not without responsibility.\n\nSince the signing of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, Antarctica has been a scientific reserve for peaceful purposes, scientific investigation and environmental protection. The continent covers 14 million square kilometres, 5.4 million square miles, and has no native human population or weapons and remains under no right of ownership. Despite Antarctica belonging to no one, and thus to us all, the continent plays a significant role, at many levels, on the world stage. Antarctica could be seen as the main protagonist in the issues and challenges facing the contemporary world.\n\nVery few people have the opportunity of visiting Antarctica \u2013 a limitation necessary for Antarctica\u2019s preservation. This magazine\u2019s goal is to allow those for whom Antarctica remains inaccessible to experience its richness and magic. For the roughly 75,000 people a year that travel to Antarctica, the ANTARKTIKOS journal will provide substantive background information that will support in making the visitors into ambassadors for the protection of Antarctica and our worldwide environment.\n\nAntarktikos: Where art meets science meets art\nANTARKTIKOS combines art and science to engage with the challenges and inspiration Antarctica presents. In many respects, scientists and artists share an immaterial and mental ownership of Antarctica. They are not interested in conquering or ownership. Instead, they temporarily engage with the continent to bring knowledge, ideas, inspiration, confusion, beauty and acutely urgent questions to the world.\n\nANTARKTIKOS is aimed at professionals in the field, scientists studying Antarctica and artists and scientists whose research is related to the kinds of environmental questions that Antarctica proposes. The journal intends to inspire international science-based collaboration. Specifically, it aims to encourage partnerships between art and science.\n///\n\nContent\nANTARKTIKOS will be the first independent and international magazine entirely dedicated to Antarctica. The first printed issue is expected in Autumn 2021.\n\nEach issue of ANTARKTIKOS is preceded by an open call for a broad range of subjects from diverse disciplines. The theme of the first issue of ANTARKTIKOS is Mapping Nature.\n\nProspective contributors, including scientists, artists, designers, architects, academics, activists, cities, universities, public institutions, companies, and social organizations, are invited to apply and submit their definite proposal.\n\nSubmissions can be any kind of research, story, or visualization related to the mapping of Antarctica. From ice cores containing the information trapped in 20,000-year-old air bubbles, to the architectural drawing of research stations, to imaginary maps of Antarctica in the year 3000.\nClimate Archive - Suzette Bousema (Ice cores, Antarctica, approx. 20,000 years old)\nhttps://www.antarktikos.com/Open-Call-1\nThe open call deadline is 21 June 2021\n\nNext to all kind of content in all kind of forms an essential part of ANTARKTIKOS is the appendix of scientific papers.\n\nThe magazine is published using high-quality, sustainable offset printing on FSC\u00ae-certified paper with biodegradable ink. We use plastic free packaging for shipping.\n\nThe open call process and subsequent design of the magazine are still in progress. We promise that the magazine and design, like Antarctica, will be awe-inspiring.\nAdele Jackson. Antarctic Colour Swatch, 2014.

To ensure you get the first issue of ANTARKTIKOS, please place your order in advance.\n\nWe count on that for next year Antarctica lovers will find us. But for this first year, we could use your help in spreading the word and reach everyone interested in Antarctica.\n\nIf you are interested in Antarctica, art and science, environmental issues, world wide contemporary challenges or anything related to the topic of Mapping Nature, we also invite you to support this project and become an ANTARKTIKOS friend.\n\nANTARKTIKOS friends come in different varieties\nBrash Ice (photo: Esther Kokmeijer)\nBrash Ice friends - Crowdfunding backers 1 (see rewards\nBrash ice is an accumulation of floating ice made up of fragments no more than two metres (5.6 ft) across.\n\n///\nPack Ice (photo: Esther Kokmeijer)\nPack Ice friends - Crowdfunding backers 2 (see rewards)\nPack ice is made up of ice fragments frozen together into a solid body.\n\n///\nGrowler (photo: Esther Kokmeijer)\nGrowlers friends - crew, staff and contributors\nA growler is less than 1 metre (3.3 ft) high and 5 metres (16 ft) long.\n\n///\nBergy Bit (photo: Esther Kokmeijer)\nBergy Bits friends (ambassadors)\nBergy Bits are small icebergs that rise between one to four metres (3\u201313 ft) above sea level.\n\n///\nIceberg (photo: Esther Kokmeijer)\nIcebergs friends (institutions and associations)\nTo be classified as an iceberg, the ice must be more than five metres (16 ft) above sea level.\n\nTo show our appreciation, all ANTARKTIKOS friends are mentioned in the magazine.

The ancient Greeks wrote about a large landmass at the globe\u2019s southern tip, assuming it existed despite having never seen it. Aristotle theorized that this southern land allowed the spherical Earth to maintain a geophysical balance with the northern lands. Hence he called it Antarktikos. Arktikos is ancient Greek for \u2018near the Bear\u2019, referring to the Great Bear constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. Thus Antarktikos means contra to the Bear or opposite the north.\n\n///\nwww.antarktikos.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nANTARKTIKOS magazine will definitely get there.

The photos and the experience of being photographed give people a chance to participate in a larger cause, providing a feeling of togetherness within our community. We are both separate and together, simultaneously. The death of George Floyd, just nine blocks from my house, and the subsequent, ongoing demonstrations have intensified the desire for unity and highlighted the strength of solidarity.\nInitially, participants for the series were located by placing notices for free portraits on Nextdoor and Facebook and reaching out to community leaders. The portraits were offered free of charge as a way to include everyone who was interested in participating. Identifying subjects for this project has now become self-sustaining as word has spread, and I have photographed more than 400 families and individuals, and \u201cPorch Portraits\u201d has been featured on Minnesota Public Radio, Art Hounds, and Fox 9\u2019s Morning Buzz.\nThis book captures a collection of these portraits. It is an honor and privilege to be able to capture this history in real time and share it with you.\nThe Book\nMinnesota Front Porch Portraits \u2013 Staying Apart Together will be an 8.5 x 11,\u201d 100-page, hardbound book, and will include approximately 180 images printed on heavyweight, archival paper. It will have a registered ISBN. Book design is by Dan Woychick. The book will be printed locally to assure the best quality, and to invest back into the local community. The print run will be limited to 500 books, all of which will be signed and numbered. There will not be a second-printing.\nBONUS: With each book sold, I will donate $2 of my own money to Twin Cities Rebuild For The Future. No funds raised through Kickstarter will be donated. \nAbout the Artist\nScott Streble is a Minneapolis-based photographer who uses photography to help people. He has spent 30 years working with non-profits and non-governmental agencies throughout the world. His clients include homeless shelters, food banks, relief organizations and those who work in affordable housing, health care, and education. He has worked with Doctors Without Borders, Habitat For Humanity, The United Way, American Red Cross, and more than 50 homeless shelters in the US and Canada. \n\u201cPhotos can help shine a light on both those who need help and their helpers. Images help organizations grow awareness, inspire donors, and encourage volunteerism. It pains me to see an organization without quality images to accurately represent the valuable work they are doing.\u201d\nScott also has several ongoing personal projects: he photographs senior citizens, providing photos to families who might not otherwise have a current photo of their loved one, and also periodically takes free portraits for those who are unemployed or underemployed to use while they look for work. \nHe has dedicated his career to using photography for good, to help others, since we are all in this together.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere aren\u2019t many risks associated with this project, as the bulk of the work has been completed.

Spaceship stickers, extra pages, colouring book, digital wallpapers, and a set of three spaceship bookmarks for every backer of the physical book.\n I'm Rob Turpin, but you might know me as thisnorthernboy on social media. I'm an illustrator and designer from the UK, and I LOVE spaceships. I've been drawing them since I was a little kid, from X-Wings and Tie Fighters to the Nostromo and Galactica. After a long time drawing only as a hobby, in the last four or five years I've begun working as an illustrator - producing work for books and video games, as well as private commissions. It's finally time to introduce you to my latest personal project\u2026\nWeird Field World is a science fiction, world-building book. Several years ago I began wondering what a spaceship might look like, if it had an entirely alien form of propulsion. No rockets, no warp drive, something weirder. I started sketching craft with odd canisters, pods, and spheres, all protruding from a small living module with a bubble canopy like a modern submersible. Once I'd started drawing, I started thinking about who built these spaceships and why. I decided pretty early on that I didn't want this story to be about a crazily futuristic world, I wanted it ground in the Solar System, so that meant that the builders of the spaceships had to be human - but perhaps they were built using alien technology?\nIn 2089 a message is received on Earth. It's come from the region of space containing the constellation Pictor - the Artist's Easel. The message is the instructions for how to build a new type of spaceship. One that can reach Mars in days rather than months, Jupiter in weeks rather than years.\nThe Weird Field World book is the story of that message, and of the messages that follow. It's the story of the multitude of spaceships that humans go on to build with the help of an unknown alien race. The book is filled with illustrations and sketches of these new exotic spaceships, and of the people and technology that surround them.\nThe book will be hardback, over 70 pages (with even more if we hit the stretch goals), and full colour. Part art book, part future history it will explain and describe the Weird Field World of Earth and the other planets, moons, and asteroids in the Solar System. Containing lots of my black and white sketches, full colour illustrations and spaceship data sheets, as well as background information, maps, and diagrams. Every copy of the book will be hand signed by me.\nI've been working on this project for a couple of years now, and I'm really excited to finally be sharing it all with a larger audience.\nALL NOW UNLOCKED - \u00a34K spaceship sticker sheets for backers of the physical book. \u00a36K extra pages for the book. \u00a320K 20 page downloadable spaceship colouring book. \u00a322.5K wallpapers for your phone, tablet and computer. \u00a325K set of three spaceship bookmarks for every backer of the physical book\nObviously the key reward is the hardback copy of the book. 70+ pages in full colour.

You may know me as Dibujante Nocturno on Instagram or Facebook. \nThank you for taking the time to check out this Kickstarter campaign for my art book Dibujante Nocturno: The Art of Fran Garc\u00e9s. \n Together with 3dtotal Publishing, I am creating a book that reflects who I really am as an artist, by giving insight into my creative experience and processes. The book will also include my ballpoint pen sketches, many of which I have scanned and colored especially for this project, and some new digital paintings, which I can't wait to share!\nDibujante Nocturno: The Art of Fran Garc\u00e9s will be beautifully presented in hardback with grained leather-effect binding and gunmetal foiling, making it a stunning addition to your art book collection. \nI see my sketchbooks as personal journals, recording important thoughts and moments in my creative journey. To offer a glimpse into my artistic mindset, I have chosen to include unseen personal sketches in this book, accompanied by notes and inner musings.\nIn addition to showcasing diverse galleries of my fantastical works, I will be sharing my workflow through a series of step-by-step tutorials and a collection of tips and tricks I have learned over the years as a freelance artist. Through this book I hope that I can help you to grow and develop as artists and offer inspiration for years to come.\nI hope you will consider supporting this project to help make this book a reality. Thank you all very much!\nBelow are the exclusive items that are available in addition to the book. Some tiers and gifts are limited, so be sure to pledge quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out! We have put a lot of love into these items and we hope you enjoy them.\nPlease note that as this is a live project, all designs are examples of content I would like to include but these are subject to change.\n\n\n\n\n Launching this book through Kickstarter means we can thank those who support the book by adding extra stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed high-quality bonus rewards to be given away if we can meet certain targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3dtotal like to give the best and most exciting stretch goals possible to their backers. For that reason we only reveal one stretch goal at a time. This allows us to respond to the success of the campaign, offering more exciting and adventurous items when the campaign does well, rather than having committed to multiple smaller inexpensive products.\n\n3dtotal publishing is committed to having a positive effect on the environment. From 2020 they have committed to planting one tree for every book they sell by partnering with re-forestation charities. This includes books sold in their Kickstarter campaigns. If you support this campaign we would like to thank you for helping us take on this mission.\n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.\nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service, and parcels sent to the rest of the world will be sent with tracked shipping. Due to complications to logistics caused by the Coronavirus, some countries have introduced surcharges to receiving international postage. This is why shipping prices will seem slightly higher for some backers than it has done on our past campaigns.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in October. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\n  As seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time.

They were partly right: she had grander plans than a world, though, she was already creating the universe of the Sholan Alliance, where Magic, Warriors, and Science all co-exist.\nShe began writing when she was eight because she couldn't find enough of the books she liked to read.  How difficult can it be to write them myself, she thought with all the confidence of a child.  After all, the libraries were full of books.  It must be easy.\nReal life took over as she entered college and began to work for the first time, but thanks to the constant nagging of two very good friends, one of whom is the sister of her editor, she finished a novel she'd started back in 1979. It was called Turning Point, and her friend's sister at DAW bought it. The Sholan Alliance Series is now nine novels long. She also has several short stories out in DAW anthologies, and one in Defending the Future series number IV, \"No Man's Land\" called \"Valkyries\".\n Jody Lynn Nye lists her main career activity as \u2018spoiling cats.\u2019 When not engaged upon this worthy occupation, she writes fantasy and science fiction books and short stories. \nHer newest books are Moon Tracks (Baen), a young adult hard science fiction novel, the second in collaboration with Dr. Travis S.

She also runs the two-day writers workshop at DragonCon. She and her husband are the fiction reviewers for Galaxy\u2019s Edge Magazine. In 2016, Jody joined the judging staff of the Writers of the Future contest, the world\u2019s largest science fiction and fantasy writing contest for new authors. \nJody lives in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, with her husband Bill Fawcett, a writer, game designer, military historian and book packager, and three feline overlords, Athena, Minx, and Marmalade.

Although the skin is the body's largest organ, many of us take it for granted.\n               As part of Orijin's mandate to promote self-care and mindfulness, we\u2019ve developed the 100% all-natural and biodegradable Orijin Sponge. Made from Japanese Konjac Plant Root and infused with anti-microbial bamboo charcoal, the Orijin Sponge will provide your skin with the TLC it deserves while also heightening your showering experience. \n Most bathing sponges you\u2019ll find in-store or online today are made with the use of chemicals, synthetic oils, plastic and artificial coloring. These \u201cglorified plastic bags\u201d as we like to call them, are a breeding ground for dank smells and bacterial growth, do absolutely nothing for our skin and take over 150 years to decompose!\nMade completely from 100% all natural Konjac plant root, the Orijin sponge's powerful fibers are naturally alkaline and hydrating. In addition, the Orijin Sponge exfoliates even the most sensitive skin without irritation.\nInfused with Bamboo Charcoal, the Orijin Sponge is anti-microbial allowing the konjac fibers to absorb debris and impurities without allowing bacteria to grow or linger.\nThe Orijin Sponge is ergonomically designed to fit perfectly in hand while providing great coverage for an easy and thorough full body scrub down.\nSaid to have been discovered by Japanese farmers who used konjac to wash their babies' skin because of the plants gentle and natural features,  Konjac is native to Japan and has been used since the 6th century. \nWhen Dry, the Orijin Sponge is 3x smaller dimensionally and more than 11.5x lighter in weight. When dry the Orijin Sponge weighs only 17grams and when fully hydrated it increases to the perfect weight of 198g.\n Feel free to use the Orijin Sponge all over your body, especially on the chest, back & face.  These areas are easily acne-prone and need an extra deep clean. The Orijin Sponge is gentle enough to be used on sensitive areas, like around your eyes, while tough and sturdy enough for a full body scrub down. \n3D Design Rendering | Orijin Sponge\n The surface of the Orijin Sponge was designed to help channel water away from the surface for a better lathering experience and for more efficient drying time when the Orijin Sponge is not in use.   \n There\u2019s no comparison. Based on our ergonomic size, design properties and environmental footprint we take the lead by a long shot. \nJust last year more that 4,000 awesome supporters brought The Thinking Egg (our previous campaign) to life, making it the most successful mindfulness tool to ever launch on Kickstarter. The feedback after having shipped on time to all of our supporters was awesome. We'll be continuing that tradition come fulfillment time for your Orijin Sponge!\n \n   At Orijin, we intentionally design products that harmoniously intertwine form and function.\n Our hope is that we can provide you with products and ideas to help live a more present, aware and conscious life.\nThank you for taking a look at our campaign. If you have any questions, please reach out, we'd be happy to help!\n   This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them. \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we have budgeted sufficient resources and time, we know that there might be things outside of our control and current visibility.

Once it's begun to fray, you'll still be able to use the Orijin Sponge, but you will not receive the same benefits as you would with a fresh Orijin Sponge.\n\nWhen you're done, you can simply compost the Orijin Sponge or put it in your planter to provide extra moisture and minerals to your good ol' plants!\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nBecause the Orijin Sponge is 100% natural, it'll simply decompose once you're done with it.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 2 or more", "title": "Good Vibes", "descp": "THANK YOU.\nYour support is appreciated & every dollar counts!\nIn return for your donation, we'll send you DM with our quote of the day.

I couldn't put it down if I wanted to.\u201d ~  The Phantom Star.net   (REVIEW FOR: LOVECRAFT P.I. THE CURIOUS CASE OF ReANIMATOR vol.2)\nCover Illustration by Paul Shipper\n   Greetings from the land of eldritch horror. My name is D.W. Kann  and I am the writer/creator of the LOVECRAFT P.I. - THE CURIOUS CASE OF ReANIMATOR graphic novel. In the latest installment of the series, a  bizarre case file takes our chain smoking, lantern-jawed detective Ward Lovecraft to New Orleans circa 1932. \n\n                 I'm  looking forward to sharing this new adventure with you all. Fans of H.P. Lovecraft will discover some wonderful Easter eggs hidden throughout these pages. I've spent the last two years deeply immersed within H.P.'s works and personal biography to expand the story\u2019s scope beyond the happenings in Volume One.\n\n                 I\u2019ve  been a Lovecraft fan myself for decades. It began with my first introduction to his work in 1985 when, at the tender age of 14, I saw Stuart Gordon's RE-ANIMATOR for the first time. The gory masterpiece blew my mind. In re-imagining  such an iconic character, I wanted to explore the psychological depths of Herbert West and elaborate on what I believe he would accomplish under certain circumstances. So sit back and enjoy this tale over your favorite cup of coffee or delicious absinthe. Let this Curious Case  creep into your subconscious.                   \n~ Keep it Dark\n \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic! He\u2019s like old school Columbo.\u201d  ~ Petesbasement.com (REVIEW FOR: LOVECRAFT P.I. A SHOT IN THE DARK vol.1)\nTelegram from G.G.

Lovecraft. \nVolume One's case file; A SHOT IN THE DARK written by Fritz Striker and D.W. Kann, takes us to 1937 Innsmouth, Massachusetts where  Ward Lovecraft, unearths a secret cult, solves a murder, and locates a  rare volume of the sinister Necronomicon text before unspeakable evil is unleashed on the world. This  three-issue series is now a trade paperback and available for the first  time on Kickstarter. We were fortunate enough to have world-renowned  illustrator Paul Shipper create three fantastic covers. THE CURIOUS CASE  OF ReANIMATOR will be our fourth collaboration.\n  Cover illustratons by Paul Shipper\nAfter  completing the first issue we brought the project to Kickstarter and raised an incredible $12,323 with 248 backers. In the midst of completing these books we toured the U.S. and attended various Comic Cons to spread the word to new fans.   \nNone  of this would have been possible, we owe it all to you, dear backers, and your faith in a group of writers and artists who came together. To create an ever-expanding universe, based on the works of one of our favorite authors, H.P. Lovecraft, and one simple idea. \n\"What if...?\" \nWe hope you all join us in supporting this new book, we've had a blast creating it and look forward to further adventures of DET.

Skies was launched in 2014 has remained 100% independent through crowdfunding and the support of our fans. Last year we created a beautiful clothbound hardcover trade edition collecting our first four issues. This year, we're back with the second half of the series! \nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to print the fifth issue of Skies of Fire. Any additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of future editions of the series. \n\n\nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.  \n\nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince. His actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.  \n\nIn Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.  \n\nIssue Three follows the pair as they recruit members for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead. \n\nIn Issue Four, the crew of the Zephyr comes together despite their differences. \nIssue Five follows the Zephyr as they finally embark on their mission into the Expanse...\n\n\n\nVincenzo Ferriero and Ray Chou have been creating stories together since 2008. They met in college and continue to collaborate despite being 5,437 miles apart.\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art. \nBryan Valenza is a prolific artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects from top publishers in the industry. \n\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army.    \nJosephe Vandel is a German cartographer and graphic designer with a love for RPGs and creating fictional worlds.\n The majority of funds from this Kickstarter will go into covering the cost of printing issue #5 and fulfilling orders from this Kickstarter. Any remaining money will be put back into further production of Skies of Fire. \nSkies of Fire Book I is 8x11\" clothbound hardcover with 120 pages including sequentials, codex documents, and variant covers.. The book features a new wraparound cover by Pablo de Bonis featuring the city of Monterey. \nSkies of Fire Book I. Collects the first four issues. 8x11, Clothbound, 120 Pages. Includes past covers and variant documents.\nInterior of Book I featuring issue four.\nLike our previous single issues, Skies of Fire #5 will be an 8x11 saddle-stitched floppy comic with 38 pages of interiors.  \nSkies of Fire single issues are beautiful oversized 8x11 comic books printed.\nThis issue's featured variant cover features the dark and gothic work of  Gabriela Bacila. \nThe illustration will depict the two elder gods, Nihil and Amika, raging against their eternal prison walls that form the Expanse. \nThe full variant will be revealed towards the middle of the campaign. \nCollector's Edition Limited Bookplate (numbered out of 1000).\nZephyr Papercraft Model designed by Guardadobosque.\nAdd-Ons will be handled post campaign by our partners at Backerkit. You will be able to select additional a la carte items for purchase after you confirm your shipping information. Funds in excess of your chosen reward tier can also be used to purchase add-ons in Backerkit. If you have a specific question about an add-on, please don't hesitate to directly message us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our eighth crowdfunding campaign.

But if you still have questions, we\u2019re here to answer them!\nYes, it\u2019s a comic book with 24 pages filled with chills, humor and a little real-life pathos. \nWell, do you like\u2026\nFun comic books like Sabrina, Saga and Crossed?\nFun movies like Evil Dead 2, The Breakfast Club and Beetlejuice?\nFun TV shows like Stranger Things, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Friday Night Lights?\nThen you\u2019ll probably like this comic too! (However, if you don\u2019t like fun, we have a tedious copyright disclaimer written in our best legalese that might be right up your alley!)\nFive teens take on H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s monsters and their small-town high school \u2026 They\u2019re just not sure which is worse.\nMiskatonic High is an ongoing series packed with light horror, tongue-in-cheek humor and the amazing artwork of Ryan Mendoza (who can draw just about anything with a tentacle).\nParental advisory: There\u2019s so many great series for young adults nowadays that you might be fooled into buying this for your five-year-old, but this series is rated PG-13 and more for teens and above.\nIn the rustic hills of a small New England Berkshire town lies the prestigious Miskatonic High School. When the Community Service Club goes on a field trip, they\u2019ll be launched on a terrifying adventure that will change their lives while birthing an evil into our modern century. \nThis is the beginning of the six-issue first season of the new high school horror series Miskatonic High.\nWe hope so, but here are some unbiased reviews.\nJenn Marshall of Sirens of Sequentials said:\n\u201cMiskatonic High is a fun story that balances everything you want in a good horror story. There is some gore, but not so much that you get overwhelmed. The jokes are funny, but they don\u2019t make the story feel like a parody of something else. It was well thought out, and I cannot wait to see where it is going to go next.\u201d\n\u201cArtist Ryan Mendoza brings a level of detail to the story that perfectly compliments the writing style. It fits the spooky storytelling by adding shadow to hide monsters, and the detail in the backgrounds make you want to spend time on each panel.\u201d \n\u201cThe monsters are very Lovecraftian. \u2026 Because they have that Lovecraftian feel to them, the monsters really are both written and drawn in a way that affected my Lizard Brain.\u201d Read the full review\n\"...so many tentacles...\"\nThe Pullbox called it \u201cthe bastard lovechild of John Hughes & H.P. Lovecraft.\u201d (We\u2019re pretty sure they meant that in a metaphorical way, because if that\u2019s literal, well\u2026 ewww.) \nHere\u2019s more from Paul\u2019s review: \u201cIt brings a mismatched group of high schoolers together, throwing them against evil the likes of which you\u2019d find in a dusty tome full of impossible to pronounce names. The beauty is in the execution. Despite some pretty heavy themes -- mounting madness, eternal torment, human sacrifice -- Mike Shea\u2019s story stays fairly tongue in cheek. [Artist Ryan Mendoza] knows how to get his Lovecraft on. So many tentacles\u2026\u201d Read the full review\nMiskatonic High #1-6 will be available as a collected edition and issue 1 has been approved and will soon be available digitally on Comixology. So they think it\u2019s pretty good, too.\nBefore you back Miskatonic High, check out some of the rewards we have to offer. We offer shipping to anywhere in the world, but shipping costs are separate from the reward costs.\n\nStretch goals\nWe've completed two stretch goals and are working on our third:\n\nHelp us unlock this reward by sharing this Kickstarter with a friend or classmate who likes fun comics  or Lovecraft-style horror and ask them to give us a try. Just send them  this link: http://kck.st/2VBd3db \nOf course. Here\u2019s the first few pages of Miskatonic High #1 so you can see if you like it.\nStick with us as through the six-issue first season, Alex, Matt, Sarah, Simon and Ren will travel through time to come face to face with Abdul Alhazred and his Necronomicon, descend into the darkest pits under the earth, and learn what is really going on in the public library when no one is looking.\nSo please join us for the fun!\nWe\u2019re raising funds to pay for a small print run for our Kickstarter backers and the old one lurking down in the basement. But comics are expensive to make. Printers, the Postal Service and shipping supplies will be taking most of what we raise. Kickstarter takes their percentage, as does payment processing. If anything is left over, we might go nuts on McDonald\u2019s Dollar Menu!\nIs that an existential question, because we haven\u2019t gotten that far in AP English Lit yet. \nYes, there are two guys working hard to bring Miskatonic High to life. The comic was written and lettered by Mike Shea and drawn and colored by Ryan Mendoza. We\u2019d say more about ourselves, but we\u2019re actually really busy putting the finishing touches on issue 6, the last issue in Season 1! \nSo you can feel comfortable getting invested in Miskatonic High, because you\u2019re sure to find out the answers to what is really going on!\nAdditionally, you can follow Miskatonic High on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Plus there's a Miskatonic High website where you can sign up to our mailing list for the latest updates.\nAdd-ons\nWe've gotten some questions about add-ons, and they're a little confusing (mainly to us, but it doesn't take much to confuse us), so here's the simple explanation. The only add-ons we have at this time is:\nAn extra copy of our standard issue 1. Each additional copy costs $5.\nAn extra copy of our 8.5\" x 11\" print from the second stretch goal. Each additional print costs $2.\nIn order to buy them, simply go to the top where it says \"Manage your pledge.\" It'll take you to the level you pledged. In the pledge amount box, just add $5 for each additional copy you want and/or $2 for each additional print.\nAfter the campaign ends, you will receive our survey, which will tell you that you have extra money to \u201cspend\u201d on add-ons. You just need to let us know how many extra issues/prints you want then (according to the tutorial that I found on Google which is hopefully not even older than the box of baking soda in my fridge...wait, I never put a box of baking soda in my fridge!). \nThat's simple, right? If you have any additional questions, just let me know.\nAttribution\n\"Hey guys, who did that amazing music in your video?\" \nGlad you asked, it's a track called Wizard by Jahzzar, which is available on the Free Music Archive. We edited the track to fit our video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe cover and pages for the issue are completed and are just waiting to go to print.

It will take another week or so for all of the items to ship. You should receive the rewards around the end of March, but we will send out alerts on the schedule as we have them.\n\nSo, really, the biggest risk is an aquatic monster dismembering you and dragging you down your drainpipe.

More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form and is used for the fine art printing of books, greeting cards, posters, and other artistic purposes. Its distinguishing characteristic is creating a deep impression of the type and image when printed on soft cotton paper.\nLetterpress printing creates a deep impression when printed on soft cotton paper.\nInlaid photo prints: Letterpress printing doesn\u2019t allow for reproducing high-quality photographic images so we inlaid a photo on top of the letterpress print. This allows us to produce an archival quality photographic art print while maintaining the luxurious feel of letterpress printing on 100% cotton paper.\nLeft image shows the letterpress print before the photo is added. The right image is the final product.\nMORE INFORMATION\nA note about the photos\nSome of you may be wondering whether we retouched some of these photos to make the hearts. Some seem too perfect, don't they? That's the beauty\u2014when you start doing this you start seeing hearts everywhere and some of them are pretty amazing. To date we've taken over 1,200 of these heart photos and there's bound to be some pretty perfect hearts in that many photos. So, while we did some color correction, cropping, and even a little sharpening on some to make the photos look the best possible, we can honestly say that we never did any photo-retouching (or \"Photoshopping\") to alter the heart shapes in any way. We also made a pledge to each other \u2014 and to you \u2014 that we do not purposely make hearts, stage them, or alter the hearts before we take the photos. The photos are exactly as we found them. Start looking, and see for yourself. Once you start, it's easy to find them.\nInternational Shipping\nWe are happy to offer this special gift to everyone in the world. Unfortunately, anyone outside the USA will not get their cards by Valentine\u2019s Day. The cards are a great gift for any occasion though and international customers can expect delivery by the end of February. Because of the high costs of international shipping we have to charge our international customers to cover the costs. We appreciate your understanding.\nIn some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. If this is the case then you will be charged for these additional fees. We have no way of knowing if these charges will be incurred or how much they might be.\nInternational supporters who receive tracking numbers should track their packages very closely. Shipments may get stalled in customs and you will have no way of knowing this unless you keep tracking your package. You need to contact the shipping agency to resolve any hold ups. If you don't catch it in time the shipment may get shipped back to us.\nSchedule\nPrinting will begin once the funding goal is met in order to get things moving well before the Kickstarter ends. Help us start production early by pledging early.\nJan. 28, 3:00 PM CST \u2014 Kickstarter ends\nJan. 28, 3:30 PM CST \u2014 Questionnaires get sent\nJan. 29, 3:30 PM CST \u2014 Questionnaire must be answered if you want to receive your prints by Valentine\u2019s Day (USA deliveries only)\nFeb. 5 & 6 \u2014 All orders get shipped out via USPS Priority Mail with tracking (1\u20133 day delivery within the USA, 6\u201310 days international).

The project also includes the first collection of Darryl Banks' artwork, BLACK BOOK: THE ART OF DARRYL BANKS!\nHarken's Raiders and Black Book: The Art of Darryl Banks\nFamed for creating Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, writer Ron Marz and artist Darryl Banks are again teaming for a tale of heroes facing long odds and implacable enemies. Measuring roughly 9x13 inches HARKEN'S RAIDERS is a 64-page hardcover classic World War 2 adventure created by Army vet Allen Cordrey, as Captain Harken leads a crack Special Operations Executive team of American commandos behind enemy lines. The mission: retrieve a German scientist who holds the key to stopping the Nazi war machine, and safely escort him to England. The problem: everything goes wrong, and Harken's men find themselves in the fight of their lives!\nOffered along with HARKEN'S RAIDERS is the first career-spanning art collection from comics master Darryl Banks. BLACK BOOK: THE ART OF DARRYL BANKS contains more than 100 pages of artwork and commentary culled from Darryl's files. Measuring roughly 8.5x11 inches, the hardcover volume features classic comic images, sequential pages, private commissions, and much more, most of it never published before. This the next volume in the ongoing Black Book Series by Ominous Press. \nMasterminded by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1940, the Special Operations Executive branch conducted espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance missions in occupied Europe. Captain James Harken, on loan from the U.S. military, has assembled a team of American operatives to execute sensitive missions behind enemy lines.\nThis mission, retrieving a valuable German scientist in Finland and bringing him and his secrets to England, is supposed to be an easy in-and-out affair. But when their transport is attacked by German fighters and their airdrop is compromised, their milk run turns decidedly sour.\nHarken's team must not only engage the enemy, but also race against the clock to get to the extraction point. And the very fate of the war effort may depend upon their success!\nHarken's Raiders Pages 1-7, created by Allen Cordrey, Ron Marz, and Darryl Banks\nAcclaimed artist Darryl Banks is most closely associated with his creation Kyle Rayner, who took over the mantle of Green Lantern following the landmark \"Emerald Twilight\" storyline. Staying with the title for nearly a decade, Darryl left an indelible mark on the iconic franchise. But Darryl's career has spanned a multitude of comics publishers, as well as commercial projects and private commissions. Now, for the first time, an expansive array of Darryl's work is being gathered for a career retrospective in BLACK BOOK: THE ART OF DARRYL BANKS. The hardcover volume contains more than 100 pages of rare artwork and commentary. This is the fifth volume in the Ominous Press Black Book Series.\nA selection of preview images from Black Book: The Art of Darryl Banks\nHarken's Raiders S.O.E.

I already have proof copies, so once the campaign ends we can put the books right into production.

He\u2019s a producer on the Netflix documentary series The Toys That Made Us (The Nacelle Co.), and in 2014, he released the documentary Plastic Galaxy: The Story of Star Wars Toys through his own production company, X-Ray Films. Plastic Galaxy is distributed world-wide by Gravitas, LLC, and is available on Amazon Prime, Hulu, iTunes, and most other digital outlets. Brian has written articles and produced videos for numerous magazines, web sites, and non-profits, including Guitar World (where he was also an associate editor), Future Music, Super 7, the music magazine Revolver (where he was also managing editor), and the New York Post. He is co-editor, with ArtOrder\u2019s John Schindehette, of the upcoming The Owlbear Almanac: The Handbook of the Owlbear Appreciation Society.\nCAVEGIRL PRODUCTIONS\nCavegirl Productions, headed by founders Kelley Slagle and Seth Polansky, began producing independent films in 2004, including 13 short films and the award-winning fantasy web series The Broken Continent, which successfully raised over $50,000 on Kickstarter. In 2014, Cavegirl released the award-winning dramedy feature film Of Dice and Men - \"a geek movie without the self-loathing\" - now available on Amazon Prime.\nIn 2016, Kelley was named a Docs In Progress Fellow, a selective program for emerging DC-area documentary filmmakers. Seth, a contracts, business and entertainment attorney, is also a sound designer and composer.\nBRIAN: I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the art of D&D. As a kid, the art was as important as the game, and I\u2019d spend hours just flipping through the pages and letting the illustrations inspire my own imagination. That love has stayed with me all these years, and the film is an opportunity to share it with the world. I also want to shine a light on all the artists who contributed to the game. Some have gone on to become recognizable names, but many deserve a lot more recognition than they\u2019ve gotten over the years. And finally, this is an opportunity to show how the art goes from concept to creation to publication - it\u2019s an insider\u2019s look at the process that goes into bringing this art to market.\nSETH: D&D has, for as long as I can remember, been a part of my life. My oldest, best friends are the people I\u2019ve gamed with throughout the years; some of my fondest memories include spending entire weekends curled up on my parents\u2019 couch just reading through the core books. In the intervening years, I\u2019ve come to realize that the images in those books have become an indelible part of my subconscious. This film is, in many ways, a love letter to my childhood - and an opportunity to share my love of the game and its art with the world.\nKELLEY: For the longest time, I was \"gamer-adjacent\" - and finally became a D&D player (and a miniature painter!) during the making of our feature film OF DICE AND MEN. The art of D&D is key to immersing yourself in these worlds and characters, and I'm thrilled to highlight this work and bring the behind-the-scenes to life!\n  With your help, we'll be able to complete post-production, including music composition and licensing, animation, and color correction.

Lovecraft's first novel that fell into my hands more than two decades ago. The fascination of his reading hooked me up with the author's cosmic horror, leading me, long after, to set up Cthulhu Project, a creative space in homage to Lovecraft.\nElder Thing\nThis journey led to the development of a board game that we expect to release this year, on the idea of a scientific expedition sent back to the mountains to investigate the events of the story. \nAs part of the setting, we have given life to two key creatures of the tale: the Elder Thing and the giant Albino Penguin, which you can get in limited edition through this project of the series Kickstarter make/100.\nThis is a limited edition, sculpted and hand-painted by Marta Lopez, following our Lovecraft collection.\nElder Thing \nElder Thing, views\nThe Elder Things are the most emblematic creatures of At the Mountains of Madness. Scientists from Miskatonik University who ventured into the mountains tried to unfreeze specimens, but the aliens woke up and killed them!\nElder Thing, trapped scientist\nIn this piece you can appreciate the scientist captured by the Elder, as well as the details of the creature. The figure has a base of 4.3\"/11cm, the distance between the wings is 9.1\"/23cm, and a height of 6.5\"/16.5cm. It is hand-painted and ready for exhibition.\nAlbino Penguin\nAlbino Penguin\nGiant albino penguins are horrendous creatures imagined by Lovecraft's mind, descendants of archaic penguins bred by the Elder Things. When Antarctica became glaciated, the penguins retreated to a heated underground abyss, although years of evolution in these depths \"destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits.\". \nAlbino Penguin\nIt measures 4\"/10cm in diameter at the base, 6\"/15cm in height and 7.2\"/18.5cm in diameter at the body. It is hand-painted and ready for exhibition.\nAlbino Penguin details\nThis project lasts only 14 days so get your reward before it's over!

War rages across Europe, some empires collapsing, others being born. In snow-covered St. Petersburg, Russia, the mad monk, Rasputin, is invited to dinner at Moika Palace by Prince Felix Yusupov. Among the dinner guests is a British secret agent named Oswald Rayner. This much is historical fact.\nDespite the monk's supernatural might, Rayner succeeds in assassinating Rasputin. But his death only presages far darker events. The secret cabal known as the Black Hand is plotting to unleash otherworldly horrors upon Europe.\nIt falls to Rayner to stop the Black Hand's insidious plot. But standing in his way is Maria Rasputin, daughter of the mad monk and agent for the Black Hand. Their paths cross with near-fatal results in St. Petersburg...\n...and then again in 1919 Paris, as world peace hangs in the balance at the Versailles Conference. Joined by allies like his aide Biffy Dunderdale and American war hero Henry Johnson, Rayner again must face Maria Rasputin, leading to confrontation that yields shocking revelations and deadly consequences.

We\u2019ve been left asking questions like, \u201cAre we more divided than we thought? Is it even possible to make the world a better place? Is the world getting worse?\u201d\nThere are no easy answers to these questions but one thing is for sure: we need hope, maybe now more than ever. We need something that reminds that there is still good in the world, and we can be part of it. We need something like the Goodnewspaper.\nThe Goodnewspaper is a reminder that there\u2019s good news in the world to be hopeful about, a map for how to move from feeling helpless to taking action, and a tool for those confused on how to get involved in the march against division, terrorism, fear and injustice.\nThe Goodnewspaper helps you celebrate good news by sharing hopeful stories you might not know about, and helps you become good news by providing tangible action steps on how to make a difference in the world in big and small ways. The stories and tools inside will leave you feeling less overwhelmed, and more capable of being a part of the good in the world. \nThe Goodnewspaper's ethos can be easily summed up by a beautiful quote from Mr. Rogers:\nWe believe that there are helpers even in the most dire of situations.\nWe believe that the world is filled with good news \u2014 we just have to know where to look.\nBy celebrating the good being done in the world, we deliver a message of hope and change it takes to grow that good. When we do this, we're invited to be a part of the good in the world ourselves.\nThat's what The Goodnewspaper is all about.\nWe seek good news. We celebrate good news. And we become good news.\n Each issue will feature:\nGood news stories from all over the world.\nProfiles of inspiring people who are making a difference.\nSimple action steps you can take to be a part of the good in the world.\nThe Goodnewspaper will also feature cultural recommendations of the most beautiful, hopeful, and thoughtful pieces of media (films, books, music, and podcasts), analyses of hopeful trends that show the ways the world is becoming a better place, and highlights of ethical companies and brands you can feel good supporting.\nYou won\u2019t feel overwhelmed by the brokenness of the world while you read the Goodnewspaper. You\u2019ll feel refreshed, encouraged, and ready to take on the world.\nWe need your financial support through Kickstarter so that we\u2019ll be able to:\nActually print and ship something real. (That\u2019s the really expensive part.)\nHire a talented and diverse team of writers and designers to take this to the next level.\nTell compelling, important, and nuanced stories of the good in the world in a time when it feels like we need it most.\nFull Color\nPrinted on 52gsm Recycled Paper (pending printer availability)\nTraditional Tabloid\nSize: 11.5\" x 15\" (608mm x 790mm)\nAdditional Rewards\n$80 - Ten copies of our first Goodnewspaper.

Knowing this allows us to make sure we don't go into the red while working hard to provide a beautiful and hopeful final product.\n\nOf course it's worth mentioning that the quality of the newspaper (both in terms of aesthetics and content) is of utmost priority to our team.

But none of these brave men would have gotten there without the leadership and expertise of some of the most brilliant women most of us have never even heard of.\nThat\u2019s why we're making \u201cLaunch Ladies.\u201d A beautifully illustrated board book for children, introducing them to all the brave, bold women of the space program\u2019s past, present and future. And, for those of us with kids, we're excited to share all the space stories we\u2019ve grown up loving, through a slightly different frame.\nWe've got an unbelievable list of women spanning from the inception of NASA all the way up to those leading programs that will take us to Mars and beyond. \nTo us, this is the important story of women\u2019s courage and brilliance that kids so often don\u2019t hear when we they learn about space. We want to change that.\nSo this is where we need your help! We\u2019ve gotten a great start. Leila has pulled together an amazing list of women we want to share, Jamey is finalizing the story and layout as we speak, and Lydia has a solid start on a handful of the book\u2019s spreads, but we\u2019ve still got to finish the book AND get it produced.\nWe have an American manufacturer lined up to print the books for us, but their minimum order is in the thousands, so it\u2019s going to take a hefty amount of time and money to get this project\u2026 launched.\nWe know we can\u2019t be the only ones out there who want to see this book take off. So we\u2019re counting on all you space nerds out there to help us make this happen.\nYou can check out a few sample pages and other additional information below.\nTogether, we can make this happen. \nThank you SO MUCH for your support!\nTHE BOOK\nBook Cover Mock Up\n  Margaret Hamilton Spread\n  Mae Jemison Spread\n  Marleen Martinez Spread\nEnamel Pin\nThis will look spectacular on your jumpsuit.\nEnamel Pin Mockup\n  Pin Mockup from Supplier\nEmbroidered Patch\nA die cut embroidered patch to iron on your backpack!\nEmbroidered Patch Mock Up\n  Patch Mockup from Supplier\nLimited Edition Print\nA framable 12x18 high quality print.\n12x18 Poster\n Letterpressed Print\nWe're working with our friends at Angel Bomb Press to get a beautiful letterpressed version of the poster artwork, at an 8x10 sizing.

Our assumptions are that they will look better than the digital one-off prototype we have, but we won't know that until well see a proof.\n\nAlso timing. We're aiming to get these done by late spring, early summer at the latest, but getting them in our hands, packed and shipped on to you will take between 6-7 weeks from the time we place the order. We're hoping to place the order as soon as funds clear at the end of the campaign, so end of April/beginning of May.\n\nAll things considered, having done a digital printed prototype with this production house once before, we're confident it will all go smoothly and we'll have an amazing product in your hands by summer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "An out of this world Thank You", "descp": "We'll thank you to the moon and back, by listing you on the big Thank You wall on the book's website when the campaign is complete.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Enamel Pin", "descp": "We'll send you a lovely little enamel lapel pin as a thank you for helping us reach our goal.

Today we are in a very different moment, one that requires new images that reject the hate, fear, and open racism that were normalized during the 2016 presidential campaign. So on Inauguration Day, We the People will flood Washington, DC with NEW symbols of hope.\nThis art has been already been commissioned by the Amplifier Foundation. Some of the greatest activist artists working today, including Shepard, Ernesto Yerena, and Jessica Sabogal, have collaborated with photographers to create a series of images that capture the shared humanity of our diverse America.\nNow the tricky part: printing and distributing these images on a massive scale in time for Inauguration. \nMuch of Washington will be locked down on Inauguration Day, and in some areas there will be severe restrictions on signs and banners.  But we've figured out a hack.  It's called the newspaper!  On January 20th, if this campaign succeeds, we're going to take out full-page ads in the Washington Post with these images, so that people across the capitol and across the country will be able to carry them into the streets, hang them in windows, or paste them on walls.\nEvery dollar you put into this campaign will buy six ads printed and distributed for us.\nAmplifier will also distribute these images as large placards throughout DC at Metro stops, out the back of moving vans, at drop spots to be announced in the coming week via our social media feeds, and, on January 19, as free downloads for you to print and share as you like.\nAnd for every donation over $5 we will even send a postcard of the art of your choosing to the incoming President after he takes office! (Stay tuned for the text we will use!)  \nThis art is meant to spark a conversation, and after January 20, our work will continue. What does WE THE PEOPLE\u2014these three famous words in the preamble to the Constitution\u2014mean in the 21st century? Over the next several months, Amplifier will partner with organizations, schools, and everyday families to create spaces across the county, in both red states and blue, where we can speak, listen, and share our answers. Watch for updates on this as the campaign funds and moves into the world!\nWHO ARE WE?\nSHEPARD FAIREY is one of the most accomplished street artists in the world, and creator and founder of Obey Clothing and Obey Giant, first becoming known for his \"Andre The Giant has a Posse\" sticker campaign while at the Rhode Island School of Design. He became widely known during the 2008 presidential election for his Barak Obama \"Hope\" poster. \nJESSICA SABOGAL is a first generation Colombian American muralist. Her art serves as a haven, a tribute, a creative outlet of adoration and exaltation for women with stories often untold. Her pieces possess a vision of female identity that is revolutionary and powerful, brave and beautiful. Most recently she has created a visual campaign entitled, \u201cWomen Are Perfect\u201d which attempts to spread this simple but necessary notion worldwide.\nERNESTO YERENA is an artist living in Los Angeles.  His art brings political concerns to light with subject matter that depicts cultural icons, rebels and everyday people voicing their stance against oppression. While Yerena identifies as Chicano he also strongly identifies as Native/Indigenous to this continent which is often seen in his work. Highly recognized for his activism, Yerena is the founder and curator of the Alto Arizona Art campaign (2010) as well as a founding member of the We Are Human campaign (2009).\nTHE AMPLIFIER FOUNDATION:  Our non-profit is dedicated to amplifying the voices of grassroots movements through art and community engagement. We do this by funding collaborations between those movements and contemporary artists so that their messages can reach a wider audience. Our goal is to flip artists into activists and observers into participants.  \nOur work has supported Criminal Justice Reform projects with Cut50.org, Environmental campaigns working with Indigenous groups against the KXL pipeline and in defense of Treaty Rights in the Black Hills, and we have, just this week, commissioned, and started printing and distributing the majority of the art for the Women's March on Washington as an official partner.  \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe are here to find partners as much as funding.  When this message is heard we want them to know it comes direct from the people.  Our goal is 10,000 backers in this Kickstarter and ten times that many participants after Inauguration day. \nTHE REWARDS:\n STAY TUNED FOR PHASE 2!\n___________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo matter what, we have the ability to get tens of thousands of pieces of this art printed to distribute for free in public. We also have guarantees from the silkscreen and offset printers that our product can be made in a timely manner. There is a very, very small chance the Washington Post could reject our ad at the last minute, though we have been talking to their ad department for some time and they know what we are running. If that were to happen, we would buy ad space in other DC papers that day, and we would continue to spread the art beyond Inauguration Day via billboards, bus-shelter ads, etc.\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nCREDITS \n\n/ PHOTOGRAPHERS /\nDelphine Diallo: www.delphinediallo.com\nRidwan Adhami: www.ridwanadhami.com\nArlene Mejorado: www.amejorado.com\nAyse Gursoz: www.aysegursoz.com\n\n/ ARTISTS /\nShepard Fairey: www.obeygiant.com\nErnesto Yerena: www.hechoconganas.com \nJessica Sabogal: www.jessicasabogal.com\n\nFILM\n\n/ SOUNDTRACK /\n\u201cRock The Nation\u201d by LA Symphony \n\u201cThe War\u201d by The Procussions\nSoundmix by Split Rock Studios: jasonsarubbi.com \n\n/ CINEMATOGRAPHY /\nEric Becker: www.weareshouting.com\nMax Basch: www.maxwellbasch.com\nMike Lawrence\nMelinda James: www.aboutherfilms.com\nAdrien Oneiga: www.oneiga.com\nLenny Mesina: www.therapystudios.com/editors/lenny-mesina\n\n\n/ Produced / Edited / Directed by May Day / www.maydaycreative.org /\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard to the President", "descp": "We will send a postcard hand signed with your name to the president with the art of your choosing.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["498 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "We The People Sticker Pack", "descp": "Five stickers from the \"We the People\" series, one from each of the 5 art pieces.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card to the President", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,756 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Amplifier Sticker Super Pack", "descp": "Super pack of stickers which include 20 mixed Amplifier Stickers from a selection of renowned international artists including Shepard Fairey, Ernesto Yerena, Chip Thomas, Josh MacPhee, Roger Peet, Gregg Deal, Jessica Sabogal and more!

Because I believe artists should be paid at least something upfront for both their time, and more important, talent.\n2. $1,000 for marketing. This will involve either a direct mail postcard campaign to virtually every comic book store in America or preferably, a promotion fee (read: wheel-greasing money) paid directly to Diamond Comic Distributors, who will essentially perform a similar type of promotional push, but by telephone calls to comic shop stores and ads placed in \"Previews.\" \n3. $1,000 for printing\n4. $1 (because I want to show some profit in order to prove this idea is commercially viable).\nSTEVE GEIGER explaining to me what it takes to launch a comic title after drawing the next 2 covers of RAZ\u2122 (read: he loves the idea and wants to continue being a part of it)\nFirstly, iconic MARVEL artist STEVE GEIGER (Hulk, Punisher, Spider-Man, X-Men, etc.) has already illustrated the covers for the next two Issues (#1 and #2). Both signed rough sketches are available as backer rewards. \nSigned Rough RAZ\u2122 Issue #1 Cover Sketch of FAT SACKS by STEVE GEIGER (original available as backer reward)\n  Signed Rough RAZ\u2122 Issue #2 Cover Sketch of EMPTY SUIT by STEVE GEIGER (original available as backer reward)\n  RAZ publisher Charles Moisant having a cigarette put out on his ass by this year's Dark History best costume winner and early RAZ\u2122 fan\nIn addition, I\u2019m partnering with a professional publisher (CHARLES D.

The script for the second issue (featuring a villain named FAT SACKS whose elephantiasis of the testicles represents the living embodiment of corporate greed) is already finished, with an art completion date of mid-November. And I have already begun writing the script for the third issue, which centers on a corrupt politician with an oversize right mitt for handshaking who is literally an EMPTY SUIT. The 4th and 5th issues will feature an overly child-friendly villain who motors around elementary schools districts whose given himself the nickname \u201cUNCLE HOT TUB,\u201d and a pre-emptive \"Special Issue\" strike against The Special Olympics Committee, respectively.\n100+ creative awards and counting (no B.S.)\nNext, I\u2019m a professional advertising writer known for my unique brand of edgy irreverence along with east coast wit, with over 100 creative awards to my name as proof of such.

Much to our surprise and delight, RAZ\u2122's initial fan base has been 50% female, including high schoolers eager for the kind of mature content that requires hiding from their parents but sharing with all their social media savvy friends.\nRAZ\u2122's #3 fan!\n  RAZ\u2122's #4 fan (thank you random paper delivery guy!)\n  Corrupting yet another Gen Z mega-fan by explaining life through the warped philosophical lens of The Real American Zeroes\u2122\n  It's only appropriate to have a real life porn star sign a copy of the comic that features an ex-porn star superhero who sports a perpetual mushroom bruise (V.D.)

Helmes and W. Gaglione Rubber Stamp Archive.\nBy uniting the extensive private collections of Scott Helmes and William \u201cPicasso\u201d Gaglione under one roof, the H/G Archive is one of the largest repositories of rubber stamps and stamp-related materials in the world. Comprised of hundreds of commercial and one-of-a-kind boxed sets and over 70,000 individual stamps spanning a period of 120 years, the H/G Archive is both comprehensive and incredibly diverse. In addition to physical stamps, the collection includes original stamp art, artists\u2019 books, limited edition publications, journals, catalogs, reference materials, correspondence art, assemblings, design specifications, posters, and production materials.  \nThe mission of the H/G Archive is to preserve historical, rare and unique tools of artistic expression while maintaining their accessibility to artists wishing to incorporate them into their creative practice. It is a living archive where use by artists and researchers is encouraged.\nAn exhibition in Open Book\u2019s second floor Literary Commons presents just a few examples of the H/G Archive\u2019s holdings. It offers a rudimentary history primer and demonstrates rubber stamp use by contemporary artists. From Dada and Fluxus practitioners to concrete poets and correspondence artists, rubber stamps facilitate creativity through their inherent immediacy and operative flexibility. They allow artists to simultaneously reference and critique a range of topics from banal day-to-day life to long established social institutions. \nThe S. Helmes and W. Gaglione Rubber Stamp Archive will officially open to the public in mid-2017 after initial documentation and cataloging has been completed. At that time it will begin fulfilling its mission by providing unique resources for art-making to emerging and established artists; serving as an educational collection that demonstrates history and social change; supporting future exhibitions and workshops; preserving and maintaining a traditional creative practices; and enhancing Minnesota Center for Book Art\u2019s programming.\nRUBBER STAMPS: A VERY BRIEF HISTORY\nThe history of rubber stamps dates to 1851, when Charles Goodyear patented a process that turned the viscous sap of South American rubber trees into the hard red rubber we are familiar with today. He called the process vulcanization, after the Roman god of fire and forge. Soon, dentists across the country had vulcanizing pots in their offices to mold dentures. The first rubber stamps were likely produced in one of these dentist pots.\nThe earliest sets were sold to businesses for making signs and marking merchandise. They were advertised as cutting-edge technology, replacing hand-lettered signs, stencils and more expensive printing.  \nBy the 1920s, stamps had moved into the schoolhouse and were being used by teachers to create flashcards and worksheets. These became especially popular during the Depression, when few schools had funds for textbooks. Sets like \"The Story Printer\" contained not only letters and words, but also shapes, mathematical exercises and images of common objects like tractors and chickens.\nRubber stamps also found their way into children's hands. Beginning in the early 20th Century, youth entertained themselves by stamping scenes with sets of circus animals or trains and ships. There were sets based on early comic book characters, construction equipment and cowboys. Children were also encouraged to become printers through smaller versions of commercial printing outfits. \nUse by artists escalated in the 1960s when pop artists working in New York, such as Ray Johnson, used them in \u201ccorrespondence art.\u201d These anti-establishment artists wanted to break art out of what they saw as the confines of galleries and museum walls. They sent their visual puns and wordplay through the mail to an international network of like-minded people. They also enjoyed appropriating symbols of authority. Correspondence art grew out of two older traditions: Dada and Fluxus.\nToday, rubber stamps are still enjoyed by children and used in businesses. While their popularity in the crafting community has waned, they remain vital, versatile, and efficient tools for artists, writers, poets, and others interested in visual language and popular culture.\nABOUT THE FOUNDERS\nSCOTT HELMES  \nScott Helmes is a visual poet who began collecting rubber stamp sets in 1974. His poetry stretches the limits of language, explores the multifaceted concepts of meaning, and encompasses all manners of reading. His work also investigates typographic concepts, printing methods, and alternative letter forms within the modern meaning of communication. Helmes\u2019 poetry is realized through a variety of techniques and materials such as rubber stamps, stencils, and collage. He has exhibited internationally and his work is in the collections of some of the world\u2019s leading institutions, including Minneapolis\u2019 Walker Art Center, New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, London\u2019s Victoria & Albert Museum, Paris\u2019 Bibliotheque Nationale de France, and Frankfurt\u2019s Museum f\u00fcr Kunsthandwerk.\nWILLIAM \u201cPICASSO\u201d GAGLIONE\nAn avid collector of all things, William \u201cPicasso\u201d Gaglione was the original owner of Stamp Francisco and has been involved with rubber stamp art and rubber stamp manufacturing for decades. He is currently the co-proprietor of Chicago's Stampland. His artistic influence on the world of rubber stamping has been documented extensively through numerous international exhibitions and publications. As a publisher, he has produced multiple boxed exhibition catalogs and assembling periodicals such as Stampzine. Gaglione has created many aliases and identifications during his long career as a conceptual artist (Picasso, Dadaland, etc.) and he continues to prolifically create and perform as a neo-Dadist, Fluxus practitioner, and correspondence artist.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary challenge of this project is also its most exciting strength: it has never been done before.

He\u2019s a regular contributor to Show Class Magazine, and worked for, recorded, and performed at the legendary NYC club CBGB's.\nAs a kid, Granda used to pedal his BMX bike to the local 7-11 to buy the latest issue of Heavy Metal Magazine. Inside he discovered the works of Moebius, Druillet, Caza, and Corben, and his mind has been terminally warped ever since.\nHis passion for animation began at an early age when he discovered the film Yellow Submarine, and before long he was making stop-motion animated films with his parents Super-8 camera. He cites the work of Ren\u00e9 Laloux (Fantastic Planet, Gandahar) and Ralph Bakshi (American Pop, Fire and Ice) among his biggest influences.\nDAVID PAUL SEYMOUR\nWriter/Art Director\nSeymour is a Mississippi-based freelance artist and illustrator, mostly doing record covers, t-shirts, and poster artwork for rock and roll bands. He's done work for some of the biggest names in independent label rock and metal, notably Pentagram, Agnostic Front, The Sword, Red Fang, Graveyard, Earthless, and Kadavar. Seymour has also been commissioned by numerous noteworthy companies for apparel design, craft beer packaging, event posters, and skateboards.\nGrowing up in the \u201980s in the DIY punk and metal scenes, he made lots of friends drawing cheaply xeroxed handbill flyers for bands and venues in his hometown of Biloxi, MS.\nThroughout his life, Seymour has been influenced heavily by the likes of Frank Frazetta, Pushead, Brian Bolland, Bernie Wrightson, John Buscema, and Todd McFarlane; and of course, all manner of heavy music.\nArt by Scott Trerrotolla\n\u201cThe Planet of DOOM is a tribute to heavy music and the art that accompanies that type of music.\" said David Paul Seymour. \"With this film, we're seeking to encapsulate the music and art community that Tim and I are a proud part of with one epic body of work. We are also naturally bringing in all sorts of fringe countercultures who've attached to this same community: bikers, skateboarders, comic book and sci-fi fantasy fans. It's a really vibrant and diversified community, and we've certainly brought in the right ambassadors to represent it properly.\u201d\nTim Granda adds \"Blowing minds and kicking ass is always a challenge, and we're gonna savor every twisted, tripped-out minute of it! David and I have been dreaming of making a movie like this ever since we were kids, and with the talent, passion, and commitment from everyone on board - plus knowing you all have our backs - WE WILL NOT FAIL!\"\nPlease help spread the word about The Planet of DOOM's Kickstarter to all your friends and enemies!

I made the mistake of sanding early and you can't take sanding back. This is absolutely not a plug and play item. It takes a lot of work. So anyway, work with the plant and save sanding for the last resort.

We exceeded our funding goal by more than 540% and hit all of our stretch goals, which means we\u2019re going to be able to make an AWESOME comic for you!\nGoing forward we\u2019ll post our progress on Lovecraft: The Blasphemously Large First Issue to the Updates section of this page. You can also follow Craig on Twitter to find out more about the future of Lovecraft.\n---------------------------------------------------\nA Kickstarter Staff Pick!\nLovecraft is a dirty, gritty story about magick, monsters and the occult. It takes place in a modern-day world where H.P. Lovecraft the writer never existed but where all the horrors he wrote about are real. In this story, the man named Lovecraft is the world's foremost magician and alchemist who maintains a secret library of forbidden knowledge which includes books like the Necronomicon.\nLovecraft is a classic Byronic antihero: \u201cMad, bad, and dangerous to know.\u201d He functions as the semi-reluctant guardian of mankind, one of the few who can traffic with occult forces without becoming (totally) corrupted by them. In his world, magicians are a secret culture within the culture who vie for power and knowledge, leading to feuds and wars that can unleash unspeakable terrors. When they do, Lovecraft is the guy who cleans things up.\n(Note to International Backers: When you select a reward you will be shown shipping costs to your country.)\nRead about us on Boing Boing, Bleeding Cool, Comics Beat, Horror Society, Nerd Bastards, Shoggoth Net, Comics Bastards, The Lovecraftsman, The Scrawl of Cthulhu, GeekOut SW  and The Cthulhu Project.\nFINAL STRETCH GOAL: ADDING ISSUE 2!\nOur FINAL STRETCH GOAL is something you've all been asking us for: Issue 2! If we can get to $50,000, EVERY tier at the Digital Insanity level and above will get an exclusive black & white digital Issue 2 of Lovecraft that will only be available to backers of this project. (Expected delivery of issue 2 is April 2015)\nIf you're already a backer, you can help us reach the new goal by tweeting about the project and posting it to Facebook. And if you were thinking of upgrading to a higher reward tier, now is the best time to do it.\nThanks to hitting stretch previous goals, everyone in the Digital Insanity tier or higher will already be getting a bigger version of the comic that includes more content and enhanced digital rewards. And everyone who backed any print tier will get the extra digital rewards plus a bigger print issue, an exclusive tentacle sticker, signed and numbered bookplates and a higher quality book.\nReminder: The $20,000 reward will be added to the digital version of the comic. The $22,500, $25,000, $30,000 and $37,000 levels will be added to all versions of the comic (print and digital). The Tentacle Sticker and $40,000 level will be included with all print comic tiers. The $50,000 reward will be added to everyone in the Digital Madness tier or higher. \nA sample page from Lovecraft\nA sample page from Lovecraft\nThe Awesome Stuff You'll Get\nLovecraft: The Blasphemously Large First Issue is going to be an oversized 64-page (increased since we hit our stretch goals!) limited edition comic. That's TWICE the size of a typical comic, and so big Cthulhu is going to need all his tentacles to hold it! It's going to include:\nA 32-page main story written by Craig Engler with art by Daniel Govar and colors by Mat Lopes\nSix behind-the-scenes pages of character sketches and concept art from Dan\nSix pages of pinups from special guest artists Brian Hurtt (The Sixth Gun), Dennis Calero (X-Men: Noir), Richard Luong (Cthulhu Wars), John Bivens (Dark Engine), Lukas Ketner (Witch Doctor) and Jamie Tanner (The Black Well)\nCover art by Lewis LaRosa, who's worked on tons of Valiant covers including Shadowman, Bloodshot and Archer & Armstrong\nOther rewards include the original script, more concept art, commissions, and portfolio reviews\nA page torn from the Necronomicon itself and mailed to you (at your own risk)\nA limited-edition green foil variant cover ONLY available for this Kickstarter\nEXTRA STUFF! Thanks to meeting our stretch goals, every version of the comic will now include four pages of the Necronomicon and a new back cover drawn by Dan, four pages of \"Strange Lovecraft Facts & Insane Trivia\" illustrated by Ryan Dunlavey and four additional pages of Dan's concept art. The digital version of the script will now include Craig's scripts and Dan's layouts for the issue. And everyone getting the print version of the comic will also receive a tentacle sticker. \nA sample page from Lovecraft\nA page torn from the Necronomicon\nA sample page from Lovecraft\nThe Team\nWe've got a great, experienced team working to bring Lovecraft to life:\nCraig Engler, Writer - Craig has written several films including Zombie Apocalypse starring Ving Rhames. He also co-created the new TV show Z Nation, which currently airs Friday nights on Syfy, and has written for The New York Times, Wired and many other publications. \nDaniel Govar, Pencils & Inks - Dan has done work for both Marvel and DC and most recently worked on the comic book adaptation of NBC's hit show Grimm for Dynamite.\nMat Lopes, Colorist - Mat has colored projects for many of the major comics companies including Dark Horse, Image, Dynamite and IDW.\nLewis LaRosa, Cover Artist - Lewis is a highly sought after cover artist and is currently under an exclusive contract with Valiant Comics (we got special permission for him to do our cover). \n1 of 6 original Lovecraft pin ups that will be featured in the book (this one is by Brian Hurtt)\n1 of 6 original Lovecraft pin ups that will be featured in the book (this one is by Lukas Ketner)\nCharacters\nLovecraft is the most powerful magician and occultist in the world. He\u02bcs also a misanthrope who\u02bcs determined to save humanity despite itself. Not because he especially values human life but because if humans manage to kill themselves, they\u02bcll take him with them. He\u02bcs also not immune to the corrupting influences of the occult. While he thinks of himself as a guardian of magick and mankind, many worry he\u02bcs the real danger.\nLovecraft Character Sketch\nJohn Dee was a legendary mathematician, astrologer and occultist in the 1600s. In real life he spent years trying to commune with angels so he could divine the universal language of creation. In our story Dee has been resurrected by modern-day occultists who are after his long-forgotten secrets. Dee covets Lovecraft\u2019s library and wants to perform the \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d ritual in the Necronomicon that will summon the Old Ones.\nJack Crowley is the great-grandson of the infamous real-life occultist Aleister Crowley. In terms of natural ability and talent, Jack could well be the most powerful magician in the world ... if he wasn\u02bct such a cowardly fuck-up. The only reason he isn\u02bct dead is because of his sister, Jane, whose lesser magickal ability is offset by being smart and cunning enough to keep them both alive.\nJane Crowley is the great-granddaughter of Aleister and twin sister to Jack. Jane is the brains to Jack\u2019s magickal brawn and the one who keeps them alive. But even though she\u2019s better and smarter than Jack in every other way, she resents the fact that he\u2019ll always be a more powerful magician than her. This drives everything she does, leading her to both save Jack from harm while also finding ways to keep his power in check.\nJane Crowley Character Sketch\nNyarlathotep, or Nya for short, is the human embodiment of the vast and unknowable gods in the Lovecraft Mythos. He\u2019s called the Crawling Chaos and true to form, whenever he appears disorder and confusion arise. However, he\u2019s neither good or evil, at least as we understand it. He\u2019s just as likely to seemingly help our characters as harm them. In appearance his features are those of an Egyptian Pharaoh, but his skin is the color of obsidian. And, oh yeah, HE HAS NO EYES.\nWhere the Money Goes\nThe funds pledged will primarily be used to cover our printing and shipping costs, as well as some of the artist fees. We'll still be going out of pocket on the project, but your pledges will ensure we're able to put out the biggest and best first issue possible so YOU get the best rewards possible. \nConcept Sketches For Lovecraft's Monster-Fighting Tools", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe typical challenges faced by a project like this are 1) Making It 2) Delivering It and 3) Eternal Madness. Here's how I'm tackling all three:\n\nMaking It - I've done my homework on how to make comics and talked to top comics creators who've used Kickstarter, and I'm confident that from inception to production to shipping there will be no significant issues that will prevent this project from getting made. I have an amazing team of experts working on Lovecraft both in front of and behind the scenes, and all of their experience will ensure this project gets completed.\n\nDelivering It - I've done a project on another site that's experienced delays and the good news is, I've learned how to overcome them. The biggest challenge on that project was writing my part of it (a 55,000 word book). For this project my script for Lovecraft is already done, so delivering it is just about me managing the remaining pieces the other expert team members are working on. They're experienced pros so we anticipate finishing and delivering on time.\n\nEternal Madness - I can't make any promises on this one. In fact, I may already be doomed to madness by daring to write about the indescribable eldritch horrors of H.P. Lovecraft in the first place. If insanity should occur, you can visit me in my cell at Arkham Sanitarium and I'll verbally recite the comic to you (assuming I'm still capable of human speech).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Mr. Trunk Builds A Wall - A Children's Book", "update_content": "Hi Lovecraft backers,\nDaniel Govar, who did all the art for Lovecraft, has a new project on Kickstarter.

We have now setup an alternative pledge system using PayPal. All pledges made through PayPal donations will be counted towards your desired reward tier. PayPal donations will also be counted towards Stretch Goals.\nOnce our home and record of modern civilization, the Earth is a ruined wasteland engulfed in perpetual darkness. Older than any recorded texts, an ancient evil descended upon our world without warning, consuming the population and leaving despair in its wake. The unfortunate survivors of this purge now struggle to overcome the horrific terrors of the Nocturnal.\nNoct is a 2D top-down multiplayer survival horror game that blends arcade combat with RPG survival elements. You are a survivor of the apocalyptic purge that formed the desolate wasteland now known as Noct.\nWhen I first considered creating this game, I approached the idea with some friends as a \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if\u2026\u201d What began as a network demonstration and simple proof of concept soon developed into the game prototype shown now. Noct has been shaped and moulded by the community following it, resulting in the game it has become today.\nThe game world is viewed through a thermal imaging satellite observing the aftermath of an apocalypse. Accompanied by an eerie and engaging musical score, your journey through the desolate world is filled with terrifying roaming monsters, intense combat, and perilous situations.\nSurvive Noct by maintaining your three key vital systems while you explore. Find unique weapons and items to increase your chances of survival against the elements and unknown horrors awaiting you.\nFind other survivors in multiplayer procedurally generated worlds, or journey solo and on your own terms.\nExplore vast wastelands of relentless carnage, destroyed and ruined cities, and treacherous, claustrophobic environments, all rendered in a unique art style utilizing a high contrast thermal camera viewpoint of the world. \nDestroy and annihilate your way through multitudes of unique and highly dangerous monsters found inhabiting the landscape, each with their own frightening presence and set of terrifying abilities.\nUnique Line of Sight System - You see only what is within your actual awareness area. You can see down every hallway around you, but not around the corners. \nWeapons - With abominations eating everything around you, anything you can get your hands on is a weapon. From fully automatic squad weapons to the reliable board with a nail in it, keep them maintained and they may just keep you alive. Different locations may yield higher grade weapons.\nTerrifying Monsters - You will encounter horrific creatures that exist solely to hunt and eat you. Procedurally generated throughout the world, no one location encounter will be the same. Different locations may also yield more deadly and dangerous foes for you to face\u2026 or to flee from, screaming and flailing in fear.\nSpecial Utility Items - Specialized items help lower your risk as you advance through areas. Some may be super effective on certain types of bosses.\nHardcore Survival - You have one life. Your one chance of survival depends upon your evaluation of the risks involved in certain situations before committing to actions. Lose that life, and you will have to start over again.\nNoct features some of the most vile, eldritch, Lovecraftian-inspired creatures I could put on-screen. I\u2019m a big fan of huge monster bosses from classic games like Contra and Gradius, and an even bigger fan of their unique encounter mechanics. I\u2019ve channelled that classic awesomeness into the terrifying monsters you see in this game.\nEpic Monsters - The gigantic unworldly abominations that now occupy Noct come in many different forms, some so large that they occupy half of a structure. These large monstrous entities may require special tactics, friends, or even special items to defeat. They are considered rare occurrences compared to other monsters inhabiting the world.\nLarge Primary Monsters - These large creatures are the overlords of the minions. They are hunters, relentlessly stalking their prey. Armed with unique abilities and very sharp teeth, they exist to eviscerate.\nMinion Monsters - These are the little creepy crawlies that go bump in the night. The majority of the larger monsters are too big to follow survivors into buildings, so these smaller \u201chorde\u201d style monsters do the dirty work. Each type has its own vile abilities. You will wish you could have barricaded the door to the building you just entered.\nAn endless wasteland; entire cities razed to the ground; decimated landmarks of human civilization: this is the world I envisioned for the game. Somewhere between the films \u201cThe Road\u201d and \u201cThe Mist\u201d lies Noct, fully functional, where you can enter almost every structure and explore every landmark site while roaming the desolate, ruined world.\nExplore and adventure through vast open wastelands and random world events which may yield rewards to aid your survival.\nSeek out Ancient Eldritch Artifacts and unlock the secrets and mysteries of Noct\u2019s formation.\nCross treacherous terrain and other violent natural disaster areas while seeking refuge.\nUnlock World Stashes such as audio recordings of personal accounts from the purge of humanity, secrets of monster weaknesses, and hidden supply cache sites yielding weapons of immense power.\nThe soundtrack is extremely pivotal, providing a crucial element to immersion in the game environment. We want to ensure that it portrays the right emotion throughout the narrative of the game world. Wordclock (Pedro Pimentel) from Cryo Chamber is composer of the stunning musical score, which will follow you into the darkest depths, slowly raising tension to heights of sheer terror and dread. We will also be expanding the soundtrack with B-side remixes with the help of local Toronto sound engineer Ellis Iyomahan.\n    We have spoken at length about releasing a vinyl record for the game. Because the costs are significant for having well-made records pressed, we have included this in our stretch goals. This would be a limited quantity reward for $$$-tier and higher backers.\n\n$65,000 Goal - A solution to many hats:\nThis is the first of the most significant milestones, as it will allow me to hire an additional programmer so that I can spearhead other aspects of development more aggressively. Being the sole developer/artist/programmer on this game can be extremely taxing on time. It takes far longer to develop certain aspects of the game solo than it would with the help of an additional mind. This in turn translates into a better gameplay experience and a better value for all of our backers.\n$80,000 Goal - Audiophiles Rejoice:\nThis is a personal favourite milestone for me and our musicians. Not only will we be able to create an additional soundtrack for the game, we will also be able to create a vinyl record copy of the soundtrack and make it available to YOU, our backers, as an add-on. How cool is that?!\n$150,000 Goal - Expansion:\nSince initial conception, we have discussed the prospect of players eventually leaving the world of Noct and venturing into the monsters\u2019 world as additional content and exploration. The difficulty would increase significantly, and the content would be very otherworldly. Naturally, this feat would be a huge undertaking. This milestone would open up the additional resources required to offer the additional content sooner.\nThe game is currently in multiplayer prototype stage running on Mac and PC, with Linux testing in the works. The majority of the core systems are in place and awaiting additional asset creation. We are in a very good position to begin alpha testing shortly, with the current goal of having a playable alpha in the hands of testers for Halloween 2014.\n\nWe are currently on Steam Greenlight and about half way to our Greenlight goal already!\nCurrent targeted release date is July 2015, with beta testing commencing a few months prior to iron out bugs and make adjustments that the community requests.\nFrom the very beginning, Noct has been an ambitious project. The entire game runs within a network environment, and all testing/debugging must also happen in that same environment. Being the sole developer has necessitated that I change hats frequently to bring new features and content into the game world for testing. This has been manageable so far, but it slows development immensely. In order to launch this game within a reasonable time frame, we will need the community\u2019s help to get it out there.\nWith a release target of July 2015 and alpha testing projected for October 31, we have a heavy workload to tackle. With your backing and support, we will be able to breathe more life into this project sooner.\nOperations costs - We will need to establish a company from which to launch the game. This involves, licenses, time, and paperwork. Studio space and associated expenses are also factors.\nStaff - Generation of the stark visuals and good support for the game are among the many hats I wear, but in order to provide a great auditory experience I have needed to bring in additional help. External help results in significant additional costs, and this is where our stretch goals really come into play. Achieving them will allow for the hiring of additional programmers and artists, which in turn results in a more refined and polished product for all of our backers.\nAdditional Out-of-Scope Costs - Bugs in the code; hard production delays; hardware failures: challenges always find a way to present themselves. So long as solutions are kept on-hand, challenges can be overcome. Sometimes this requires additional funding to ensure that small delays don\u2019t grow into catastrophes.\nChris Eskins (c3sk) - Lead Developer/Artist/Programmer \nThis game has been my baby for the past few years, slowly creeping towards creation and forward to its current state. I have worked in Toronto\u2019s graphic design and advertising industry as a freelancer for the majority of my career. I frequent the Toronto Game Jam in my spare time. Developing games has always been a passion of mine. Finally, to be able to display my title publicly, is something I am still coming to terms with. This has been a wild journey so far. Let\u2019s continue this adventure!\nPedro Pimentel (Wordclock) - Composer, Lead Musician \nCurrently working on multiple indie game projects. As an up and coming experimental musician he is in extremely high demand. We are lucky to have such talent on board. Without Pedro's unique dark ambient offerings, Noct wouldn't be possible.\nEllis Iyomahan (Studizzy) - Sound Engineer, Musician \nA local Toronto artist and a great friend. He has supported this project from the beginning, helping to shape it into what you see today. Ellis will be providing awesome remixes of the core soundtrack for your listening pleasure, as well as refining the core audio into perfect alignment.\nAlan Chan (Lest) - Contributor \nJack of all trades. Charismatic and dependable. Without him this project would be lost, as I would be a disorganized mess. Ensuring that a quality product is created and that the community gets the support it deserves.\nOriginal Soundtrack\nThe haunting and atmospheric soundtrack by Wordclock (Pedro Pimentel) accompanies your journey and fight for survival in Noct. The full OST with B-side remixes by Ellis Iyomahan is available in digital format (FLAC/MP3) at the $5 backer level.\nThe Game\nAll copies will be available in 2015. Planned platforms are Windows, OSX, and Linux. All copies are to be DRM-free or Steam keys. Everyone in the $10 tier and above will receive the Windows/OSX/Linux game at release.\nCompanion Art\nA highly detailed art book in PDF format, it will come complete with concept art, \u201cmaking of\u201d sketches, and monster renderings.\nEpic Swag\nReceive a custom Noct survival t-shirt with unique artwork design by Chris Eskins. Done in the same high contract, minimalist style as the game, shirt will be available in small, medium, large, or XL for backers at the $50 tier.\nMonument\nYour name will appear on an in-game monument inscribed with the names of all those whose contributions have made possible the continued existence of lives on Noct. Real names only, please.\nFuzzy Friend\nPet and animal lovers rejoice! An exclusive in-game companion accompanies you on your journey for survival. It remains persistent to your game, and will return to you after death.\n\nI Will Survive!\nYour name will appear in-game as an NPC reference in one form or another. It may be as a snippet of wisdom on a found item, an audio recording, or a character you interact with directly.\n\nFilet Minion\nYour direct input will help us breathe life into a minion creature. Help us design the look, name, and behaviour of the creature.\n\nBack Like a Bawss\nDo you love boss encounters? Have you always wanted a say in how a boss behaves? Do you want to bring your epic creation to digital life? We will work together to translate your unique monster design into the world of Noct.\nROM Nom Nom\nSpend a day with our intrepid dev team! You\u2019ll work up an appetite exploring the ROM and/or downtown Toronto before dining at one of the many fine local establishments. Spend the evening with us as we chat, relax, and maybe act a little silly. Your name will appear under a special thank you section.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA lot of heart and soul has been poured into this project to advance it to its current stage. One of the most daunting hurdles remains to be public exposure, not knowing exactly what the result could be. You toil for months and even years on a single project in order to see it released into the wild, hoping it is nurtured and supported by the community, but knowing full well that it could be left out in the cold to succumb to starvation. These are the risks that indie devs face every time we decide to embark on one of these adventures.\n\nThus far, communities like TIGSource, Steam, Reddit, IndieDB, and Imgur have been overwhelmingly supportive of the project. This has been hugely encouraging and continues to drive me as I push forward through development solo, which has been a major challenge. Thankfully, friends and fellow artists have climbed aboard to see this project through. Their dedication and contributions, coupled with the support of our backers, drives my zeal for this game.

Development is messy, and I won't bore you with the gritty details of it all or a life story. I'm just going to cut right to the good news. Noct is going to be releasing a single huge update, and the new version of the game is #*&$ing rad. Not only that, but it will hit here October 27th, just in time for Halloween.

Instead, the game will be entering into Private Early Access for BACKERS ONLY. To keep this update neat and tidy, I have condensed everything into a basic FAQ below. If you have any additional questions, I can quickly respond to them via the comments section or on the Noct Steam Forums.\n\n\nAs mentioned in the previous update, this means any backer who bought a copy of Noct ($10.00 tier and up) will be granted access to the game early via Steam. Anyone who backed for the Beta/Alpha Tier will receive an extra copy of the game for a friend + access to the game early via Steam as compensation for delays suffered. Thank you for your patience and support guys, it has been a long road but we're almost there.\n\n\nOriginally, the plan was to enter into Early Access which would help drive more funding towards the game to support more Full Time Development. Since then, I believe the Early Access landscape has changed, and it is no longer the best fit for Noct. As a solo developer, running a complex Public Early Access battle plan while still developing the game could potentially overwhelm me and harm the project. I would rather keep things private so that I can get everything right the first time, and avoid Early Access Purgatory. With the support and help from Devolver Digital, we can keep our testing phases intimate, and more manageable."}, {"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Jared", "content": "Pretty sure we all got scammed.", "time": "3 months ago"}, {"username": "Jeff Schmidt", "content": "The Steam listing for this should be reported and removed.

Watch the video above to learn more about the Travelling Font Salesman typographic font display book.\nThis project is fully funded, but we could still use some extra support to help make an even better book for you. \nSo, to entice new backers and celebrate our success so far, we've created a new Bonus Reward Font that will be sent to every backer at any level. Read all about the new font in UPDATE #4.\nCheck out the 20 new fonts that are in this new typographic book and help back my Travelling Font Salesman Kickstarter today!  \nMy name is Chank Diesel and I'm a font designer and a travelling font salesman.\nI'm making a new book with designer Anne Ulku and writer Peter Hajinian. It's a typographically dramatic mini-novella. A book zine thing. A typographic novel. I don't know exactly what to call it. It's kinda \"different.\" So let's just say it's a book. And I need your help to publish it.\nI make fonts and I sell them to designers, developers and publishers all over the world. My fonts have been used by big, great big corporations, startup small businesses, and also some of the most respected non-profit agencies in the country. Books, websites, packaging, movie titles, billboards\u2026 fonts are everywhere! And the hundreds of fonts I've made are seen worldwide by millions of people daily.\nI wanted to find a distinctive way to introduce my new fonts to the world and celebrate some of my best work from the last few years, so that's why I'm making a book. It's an impressive and inspirational design book, a celebration of the printed page. And it\u2019s even entertaining to read. But I need your help to get it published.\nIts main goal is to be an impressive type specimen book, showing a bunch of new display fonts in a variety of sizes and contexts. But it is not just a bunch of arbitrary words and letters, it is also a story of a guy who goes door-to-door across the country selling his wares and talking to people. You can read it straight from cover to cover and it is a good story about the places he goes and the people he meets.\n--And it is more than that, too. It is all the fonts in the book! There are about 20 new fonts displayed in the book and they are all nearing completion and almost ready to release to the public. These are exciting new typefaces to help add more personality to your written words. 20 new OpenType fonts, surely there must be at least one in there that strikes a chord with you and might make a nice addition to your font library.\nThe book is all written. We're almost done designing it. It's almost ready to go to the printers. I think it's great typography book and it will be a precious artifact to hold in your hands soon.\nYou can get yourself a copy of the book. You can get yourself your favorite font from the book. You could get yourself a copy of the book and ALL of the 20 fonts used in it.\nGet yourself some creative inspiration by adding some of these new typefaces to your design repertoire!\nThere\u2019s a superextended font! There\u2019s an extracondensed font! Both are totally timeless, utilitarian and useful. There\u2019s a historic-revival font inspired by skyscraper architecture. There's a nice new geometry-inspired \"heavy-lifting\" font. There's a chromatic, multi-layerable, super-huge poster font full of tiny, delicate inlines. A street art font! A drunken but smart story-telling font! A pseudo-scientific sci-fi font that looks like it came from a galaxy far far away! There's a handwriting font that's full of action!\nI hope there's one or more fonts in this collection that you'd like to use in your designs.\nI hope you choose to pledge a few dollars and help my Travelling Font Salesman Kickstarter and get some great reward items for yourself.\nThanks for listening to my story.\n-chank\nUPDATE #1: Have a look at the new Foshay-inspired font-in-progress.\nUPDATE #2: Learn a bit about the book's designer Anne Ulku and writer Peter Hajinian.\nUPDATE #3: Project of the Day!

Every backer at any level gets a copy of this cool new 3D-looking OpenType font:\n\"BUILDING A BETTER BOOK\" STRETCH GOAL MET!\nWow, in addition to meeting our basic funding goal for this project, we've also met our stretch goals and can now confirm this first edtion of the book will be a HARDCOVER BOOK probably featuring some embossing or foilstamping on the cover, with HIGHER-QUALITY PAPER upgrade on every page, making a better book for everybody.\nWe've still got copies of the book available for you to pre-order by backing this project.

That could maybe get the book printed and done by the end of this year, but we're promising it by February next year just to be safe.\n\nAnother obstacle is relying on a printer to turn the book around as quickly as we need it.

We're raising $50,000 to distribute our feature length documentary. We\u2019ve spent the last year and a half exploring money in politics, divisiveness, broken promises and the lack of choice in our electoral system. Whether you've given up on politics or you're a political junkie, OF BY FOR will surprise you with it's honest, incisive exposition of our broken system. It\u2019s not about right versus left. It\u2019s not for or against any one politician or party. It seeks to strike a different chord...not one of division, but of commonality and respect. \nThe film is complete \u2013 we just need your help getting it out. Please check out our video, reward tiers and read more about our project. \nHumble thanks,\nChris, Chad, Andy, Sergei and the entire OF BY FOR Production Team\nThis film is about how we have lost our way. It's about human nature. It's about how well meaning people go to Washington and are rapidly caught in the powerful tide of special interest money and power, and why they must increasingly resort to division as a strategy to maintain power. And it's about the way that you and I have increasingly accepted and furthered this crippling division.\nA journey across America\u2019s Route 66 finds a country united in disappointment with the status quo in Washington.\nCitizens from all walks of life discuss money in politics, divisive campaign tactics, broken promises and the helpless feeling that as the election nears they must choose between the lesser of two evils.\nOf By For features in-depth analysis and candid conversations with some of the country\u2019s most notable politicians, campaign consultants and psychologists. Uncovering the powerful interests that corrode our political system and divide the people, Of By For finds that hope for real change still exists \u2013 we've just been looking in all the wrong places.\nHere\u2019s why we need your help. First, this isn\u2019t the kind of film that the mainstream media is going to get behind. It\u2019s not divisive or inflammatory, and the film harshly criticizes much of the media for their roll in the degradation of our society and discourse. But even more than that, we can't imagine a better way to launch a film devoted to the idea of a government Of, By, and For the people than through Kickstarter.\nThe bulk of the funding amount will go toward Blu-ray and DVD production. Through the reward tiers, there are also kits that enable you to host your own OF BY FOR screening, to fund a public screening in your town, or even to sponsor a screening event with the filmmakers. We're literally putting the film in your hands, and we would love nothing more than to meet with you, watch the movie and discuss where we go as a nation from here. \nPlease check out the rewards and drop us a line if you don't see something that's right for you.\nWe will be updating this section with pictures as the Kickstarter pushes on, so keep checking back in.\nA look at the \"Host a screening\" packages (the quantities will reflect the corresponding tier, of course) :\nThe New York premiere posters were all over the streets of Brooklyn.\nWe have 30 sets left of the three 18x24 poster series with quotes by Dan Rather, Jack Abramoff, and Dennis Kucinich from the movie, so don't worry \u2013 we'll be sending you nice unused ones. \nLimited Edition, Numbered Letterpress Hero Cards\nWith all the divisiveness that permeates our country today, we offer these words for remembrance and reflection. In times harder than ours, these men choose to speak of commonality, reconciliation and peace.\nOur good friends at Igloo Letterpress are generously donating the printing.\n The three quotes are:\n\"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate \u2013 we can not consecrate \u2013 we can not hallow \u2013 this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us \u2013 that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion \u2013 that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain \u2013 that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom \u2013 and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" \u2013 Lincoln\n\"I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children \u2013 not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time. I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age where great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense in an age where a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn. Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need them is essential to the keeping of peace. But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles \u2013 which can only destroy and never create \u2013 is not the only, much less the most efficient, means of assuring peace. I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary, rational end of rational men. I realize the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war, and frequently the words of the pursuers fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent task.\" \u2013 Kennedy\n\"Let us move now from the practical how to the theoretical why: Why should we love our enemies? The first reason is fairly obvious. Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says \u201clove your enemies,\u201d he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition. Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies-or else? The chain reaction of evil-hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars-must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation. Another reason why we must love our enemies is that hate scars the soul and distorts the personality. Mindful that hate is an evil and dangerous force, we too often think of what it does to the person hated. This is understandable, for hate bring irreparable damage to its victims. We have seen its ugly consequences in the ignominious deaths brought to six million Jews by a hate-obsessed madman named Hitler, in the unspeakable violence inflicted upon Negroes by blood-thirsty mobs, in the dark horrors of war, and in the terrible indignities and injustices perpetrated against millions of God\u2019s children by unconscionable oppressors.But there is another side which we must never overlook. Hate is just as injurious to the person who hates. Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man\u2019s sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.\" - King\nAnd for those of you that like the idea of the Hero Cards but are maybe a bit more cynical or at least find contemplation eased by the soothing effects of a beer or two, we offer the Hero Pints.

Lovecraft that will be told with 30 inch tall bunraku puppets and old fashioned in-camera special effects.Featuring the voices of Jason Flemyng (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,X-Men:First Class) and horror legend Barbara Steele (Black Sunday,The Pit and the Pendulum) , this film celebrates two of my great loves: the art of puppetry and gothic horror.\nFrom my experience working as a special effects artist in Hollywood for over twenty years and now collaborating with some of the most talented creature effects artists,concept artists, and puppeteers in the industry, The Mill at Calder's End will be unlike any puppet film you have ever seen before.\nA FEW EARLY REVIEWS\n\"BREATHTAKING...AN INNOVATIVE AND ENGAGING USE OF PUPPETRY...\" -Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings)\n\"CREEPY...FILLED WITH SOME REALLY COOL HORROR IMAGES... I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS...\" -Rick Baker, Special Make-Up Effects Artist, Winner of Seven Academy Awards\n\"HAUNTING AND ATMOSPHERIC...IT IS VERY RARE THESE DAYS THAT YOU SEE AN ORIGINAL STORYTELLING FORMAT, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT SUITS THE SUBJECT MATTER SO WELL...\"  -Mike Mignola, Creator of HELLBOY, Contributing Artist for \"The Mill at Calder's End\"\nTHE TRAILER TO MY FIRST VICTORIAN GHOST STORY PUPPET FILM, THE AWARD-WINNING SHORT, \"THE NARRATIVE OF VICTOR KARLOCH\": \nBACKGROUND\nThe Mill at Calder's End is a passion project that is heavily influenced by the classic Hammer horror films of the 1960s and the films of Mario Bava (most notably, his gothic masterpiece Black Sunday). I have also always had a great love of puppetry and traditional in-camera special effects. The work of Jim Henson (The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and his Storyteller television series) is a great inspiration to me and I am hoping to bring his sense of wonderment and artistry to The Mill at Calder's End. \nIn 2012, I was honored to work with Heather Henson (Jim's youngest daughter) on my first film. Heather produced The Narrative of Victor Karloch as one of the short films for her Handmade Puppet Dreams Film Series and was a guiding force in helping me create the haunted world of Victor Karloch. \nThe Mill at Calder's End is a gothic tale that will be told with the traditional Japanese theater puppetry technique known as bunraku. Each puppet figure is controlled by three (or more) puppeteers dressed in black and hidden behind each character. It is my goal to make a film that celebrates practical effects and therefore there will be almost no computer generated imagery in the final film. In my first film, The Narrative of Victor Karloch, I utilized several silent film era camera techniques, such as a shot of a miniature ship on a stormswept ocean (which, in fact, was made up of painted flowing garbage bags). I plan to continue to use many more of these techniques to give a hand crafted look to The Mill at Calder's End.  \nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nKevin McTurk | Director\nA professional creature effects artist, cinematographer, model maker, and puppeteer, Kevin McTurk has been working in the effects industry for over 20 years.

Every frame of this film is essentially an effects shot. The \"actors\" of this film are the sculpted puppet characters that are controlled by three puppeteers dressed in black (or green screen) behind each puppet. Therefore, one of the single greatest challenges is how to film the puppets and hide the puppeteers from camera. There will definitely be a number of shots that will require \"rotoscoping\" ( digitally erasing puppeteers from the shot, frame by frame). In addition, every element of the puppet world - wardrobe, props, and sets - must be custom built for the film. \n\nIn terms of production scheduling, \"Calder's End\" should be completed within a 10 month time frame.The shooting schedule could possibly be delayed if puppeteers and/or technical crew members are unavailable on shoot days due to better paying jobs or out of town work and would therefore force us to reschedule. But the ultimate goal is to start shooting this summer and reach post production in the fall/early winter.\n\nHow will the Kickstarter money be spent? \n\nHere is a short breakdown of the budget:\n$8K to $10K - Puppet Construction,Costuming,Sets,and Props\n$10K to $12K - Camera/Lighting/Stage Rental/ Crew\n$10K - Post Production (Sound Mixing/Digital Compositing/Color Correction)\n\nOnce the Kickstarter goal of $32K is surpassed, a new \"stretch goal\" will be set. With additional funding, THE MILL AT CALDER'S END will become an even more extraordinary work of puppetry art. The new budget will allow for more intricate in-camera effects, higher quality cameras and lenses, and an enhanced sound mix.\n\nTHANK YOU in advance for supporting THE MILL AT CALDER'S END...\nYour contributions will enable this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision that few have ever attempted!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN - Final 6 Days!

(See more information in the Rewards section below)\nFor Fathers who Enjoy Having Fun with their Kids.\nWe are Cooper & Kid and we are all about Dads. We believe in helping men embrace and optimize their mission as fathers, and enhance the critical rite of passage into fatherhood. Dads of today are very different than previous generations. Unless you have been sleeping under a rock for the past 30 years, you know the American family has changed. Men are spending more time being dads and are proud of it. And more often than not, doing a great job at it.  So, for all those dads out there, we want to create a year of monthly boxes that are fun, but also help you tap into your inner child as well as your power as a man to raise the next generation.\nWhat is the Cooper Kit?  The Cooper Kit is the instant 'Dad is Awesome' box that caters to fathers who enjoy spending time with their children. These dads have expressed a desire for resources to be good fathers, including activities that they can do with their children (ages 5 and up), maximize their time and explore the greater world together. Each month, we will create a new kit with a new theme, such as The Science of Magic, First Responders, and How Things Fly. The kits will contain activities that fit within the monthly theme, incorporating elements of fun, hands-on learning, building projects, self-expression, special information just for dad, cooking, and even a bedtime story. Fathers will discover ways to interact with their children that, in addition to being really fun for dads, are active, creative, adventuresome, unique, and memorable. Men will also appreciate the inside humor woven into the kits targeting their intellect with a tasteful irreverence.\nThe Cooper Kit will retail for $85, but we are offering our Kickstarter backers the kit for $75 (and early birds for only $65). Also, the Kickstarter quarterly kit package will include the extra swag for free that the retail customers won't receive. Lastly, the Kickstarter annual kit package is $60 less than the planned retail price PLUS you get all the extra goodies for free!!\nOur Goal\nAfter a year of research, dad interviews and team product development brainstorm sessions, we have selected and compiled the essential elements to make these kits fun and appropriate for both dads and kids. Each kit will contain several beautifully cool, graphically designed pieces that will give the box a collector-worthy quality. In fact, each BOX (the actual shipping box) will be different in design and shape, and every box will convert into a toy that fits the theme of the kit. (See video).\nWhile spectacularly special, this requires additional design, printing plates and sometimes die-cuts for each box. Our current goal is to raise $22,000 to pay for this extra feature so that each month both dad and the kids will be amazed and surprised by the box that arrives in the mail. Our long term vision is to create an online magazine and community just for dads and anything we raise above $22,000 will go towards this goal.\nSpecs for the first box plate\nKit Attributes:\nBesides being adventuresome, functional, fun, unique, honest and pioneering, we endeavor to design a monthly kit that is:\nActive\nEducational via discovery\nHands-on building\nThemed for both dads and kids\nMulti-activity (6-9 activities)\nGeography Neutral (i.e. no snow required)\nGender Neutral\nA catalyst for self-expression and creativity\nBoth Nostalgic and Current\nIn addition to curated products and activities that we both source and design ourselves, the monthly kits will also contain:\nAn activity book that guides you through the month's theme and the contents of the box\nA bedtime story\nA separate website of related digital resources\nLinks to even MORE theme-related activities that are 'Beyond the Box'\nParenting and topical links to resources that are 'Just for Dad'\nA themed dinner menu with recipes (guys are doing a ton of cooking for the family these days)\nA cardboard shipping box that converts into a theme-based activity or toy\nThis is a lot!

Our company, HyperV Technologies Corp., has extensive experience designing, building, operating, and deploying extremely high performance single-shot plasma accelerators of many different shapes, sizes, and power levels. These plasma jet accelerators have been developed for applications in fusion energy and high energy density plasma physics research [www.hyperv.com].\nWe believe this same basic pulsed plasma jet technology can be adapted to increase the robustness and decrease the cost of spacecraft electric propulsion, thus opening the door to many new exciting robotic and manned space missions. Our first step with this project is to successfully demonstrate repetitive operation as a thruster.\nWe invite you, the citizens of Earth, to join with us as we design, construct, test, and execute this demonstration. The culmination of this project will be an all-up, laboratory demonstration of our prototype thruster. You will be updated via our Kickstarter Blog, Facebook, Twitter and uploaded video of the firing posted to our website.\nOur technical objectives for this thruster development project are to meet or exceed the following thruster performance goals:\nDesign and construct a high density gas fed plasma thruster operated at an average continuous input power level of about 1.0 kW\nAchieve a specific impulse (Isp) of 2000 sec (which means an average exhaust velocity of about 20,000 m/s)\nOperate at 5 pulses per second (5 Hz) for a minimum duration of one minute\nA Plasma Jet What?:\nA plasma accelerator is a device which forms a slug of hot, ionized particles, or plasma, and launches these plasma pulses at high velocity. Our plasma accelerators, one of which is shown in Figure 1, consist of two parts: A formation section and an acceleration section. The formation section forms and ionizes a plasma armature or slug from a source material and injects it into the next section. The acceleration section consists of a pair of straight parallel metallic electrodes separated by a pair of ceramic insulators. A large current is then driven through the electrodes and plasma armature, accelerating the plasma slug using the resultant self-generated magnetic Lorentz force. The performance of our existing single shot plasma accelerator designs has already been demonstrated [poster presentations from the 2009, 2010, and 2011 American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics annual meetings www.hyperv.com/papers.html ]. We must now adapt this existing low cost, scalable technology to transform it into a repetitively pulsed, continuously operable, compact plasma thruster.\nFigure 1: Mark 1 plasma accelerator.\nFigure 2: End view of Mark 1 plasma accelerator showing metallic rails (top and bottom) and plastic insulators (left and right)\nWhy are plasma thrusters important for space travel?:\nSpacecraft electric propulsion is extremely fuel efficient and dramatically reduces the amount of propellent mass and volume that a spacecraft needs to travel to and/or return from its destination in space. Because a spacecraft's size and weight are reduced, the overall cost of launching that spacecraft into orbit or onto an interplanetary trajectory is significantly reduced. Since the 1960's there have been nearly a dozen different types of electric propulsion thrusters which have been developed, some of which have already flown in space. Yet while many of today's modern communications satellites employ a variety of electric thrusters to maintain their precise orbits above earth, to date, only four robotic science spacecraft have flown missions using electric propulsion as the primary means to propel the spacecraft through deep space. Because of its great potential, NASA, which was the first to launch a deep space mission using electric propulsion, is using and continues to study electric propulsion for greatly expanded space missions in the future. For many future missions, electric propulsion is the only viable option. It is therefore imperative that we investigate all useful forms of electric propulsion, including pulsed plasma jet thrusters.\nFor fun here is a fascinating Walt Disney clip from around 1957 of a massive manned mission to Mars using electric propulsion as envisioned by Wernher von Braun: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wIXZsbjIxA. Today we could also use solar panels instead of nuclear to generate the electrical power. Yes indeed, spacecraft electric propulsion has the potential to bring back the magic of the early years of space exploration!\nSo why bother to develop Plasma Jet Thrusters if there are other types of electric propulsion systems that have already flown in space?:\nBecause, quite simply, we think ours will be better! We believe our thruster technology has the potential to be just as efficient as existing electric thrusters (such as ion and Hall effect thrusters) and with similar specific impulse. But our advantages will be derived from a thruster that is less complex (and much more robust), which can use a variety of propellants including gases, inert plastics, and propellants derived from asteroids, Mars, the Moon, etc., It will also be far cheaper to build, and can be more readily scaled to larger sizes and very high power levels than current electric propulsion systems. Our plasma thruster technology should be scalable from a few kilowatts all the way up to megawatts of average power. The electricity which is needed to power electric thrusters would most likely come from new high performance solar panels, but could also utilize other compact energy sources. From a practical viewpoint for satellite design, our thruster will have much higher thrust per unit area than ion or Hall thrusters, thus taking up less room on the rear of the spacecraft.\nFigure 3 : Open shutter image of an approximately 10 microsecond long plasma pulse in visible light.\nDue to the efforts of a number of private space companies, there is significant potential for the cost to reach orbit to be significantly reduced, but even these lower launch prices will still be expensive. This means that once a spacecraft reaches Earth orbit, there is still a need for more cost effective methods of in-space transportation. That's where we come in. With our plasma thruster project we want to work on reducing the cost of space transportation further by cutting the mass and volume needed for spacecraft fuel, while increasing the transportation capabilities of the spacecraft. Cheaper robust spacecraft thrusters will serve as an enabler for daring low-cost robotic and ultimately new manned space missions. These missions could return samples from near-Earth asteroids, or support a more ambitious effort to return samples from Mars and beyond.\nPlus, since our technology stems from our already scalable single-shot pulsed plasma accelerators, our plasma thruster design also promises to be scalable, including up to sizes large enough to support future large interplanetary manned space missions. We believe our thruster technology will be best suited for spacecraft with minimum masses of 100 kg (about 220 lbs) and larger.\nWhy you should be involved:\nYou should be involved because not only are we offering to let you help us lay the cornerstone for a new type of robust spacecraft electric propulsion which is well suited for use in heavy robotic and manned interplanetary space missions, but also because we are offering to take you behind the scenes for the prototype development process. We will be providing progress reports and status updates to the Kickstarter blog, and on Twitter, and the latest test results and preliminary analysis will be available to our friends on Facebook, including post-experimental summaries. You should also know that in addition to our limited ticketed main firing event, we will be hosting tours where you can stop by and see our facility. See our laboratory! See our plasma accelerators! We are offering you a chance to see plasma physics in action. Plus we are going to take some really cool high speed photos of plasma which will also be available to our backers.\nSo who are we?\nWe are a team of three scientists, Dr. Doug Witherspoon, Dr. Andrew Case, Dr. Sam Brockington, and an energy & space entrepreneur, Chris Faranetta who quite frankly build the world's best plasma jets for nuclear fusion and plasma physics research. But did we mention that we really, really like space too and we would like to see the cost and complexity of deep space exploration come down so that lots more cool manned and un-manned missions can happen? Our company is called HyperV Technologies Corp. The HyperV part stands for HyperVelocity - we are all about moving plasma fast, really fast, I mean hyperfast! Check out our website at www.hyperv.com where we talk about the cool stuff we've done in plasma physics research funded through competitive government research grants.\nFigure 4: HyperV Technologies' plasma jet testing facility.\nHyperV Technologies Corp is based in Chantilly, Virginia USA. We have a machine shop from which our existing accelerator designs and high power switches have already been produced. Our 9000 square foot facility contains not one, but two fully functional very high voltage/high vacuum laboratories, complete with high voltage charge/dump control systems and high vacuum ( 1 microTorr) chambers, and other experimental support. We have over 80 channels of 1-2 Gigasample per second state-of-the-art, computer-controlled, data acquisition, and multiple high voltage charging supplies already installed and operating. We also maintain an extensive suite of plasma and pulsed power diagnostics, including ICCD fast-framing cameras for high speed (nano second gate) photography, digital cameras for long exposure color photography, photodiode arrays for real-time streak photography, batteries of magnetic probes, collimated optical and interferometric density diagnostics, as well as apparatus for survey and high-resolution spectroscopic measurements and other diagnostics for high-voltage high-current measurements.\nHow far along are you?\nHyperV has already designed, constructed, and operated multiple single-shot, linear plasma accelerator configurations of several bore lengths and bore cross-sections ranging from 3mm square to 50mm square and up to 30cm long. HyperV has working designs for both gas fed and ablative capillary fed plasma accelerators. Adaptations of the gas fed designs would be used for the thruster, but ablative concepts using simple plastic as the \u201cpropellant\u201d are also being explored.\nFigure 5: A small 15cm long plasma accelerator similar in size to the proposed project thruster. This 2cm square bore uses boron nitride insulators to reduce wall ablation.\nExisting HyperV accelerators are already very compact. For example, the main body structure of our 1 x 30 cm accelerator weighs in at about 2.5 kg (5 lbs), and our existing 0.5x10 cm accelerators can be as little as 0.25 kg(0.5 lbs). And since none of these devices was especially designed for low mass, we can probably reduce them another factor of two lower!\nThe principal focus of this new project would be on adapting one of our existing minirail accelerator designs to a 5 Hz repetitively pulsed system capable of producing 2000 sec specific impulse. We have a plan for the first round of testing, including an initial design concept for the driver circuit, an initial concept for the plasma thruster, and estimates for diagnostic requirements, and the modifications necessary to support burst mode operation and data acquisition.\nThe next step is to finalize the first experiment plans, construct the device, prepare the diagnostics necessary for the first test, and perform the tests.\nFigure 6: Dr. Witherspoon holds a 15cm long plasma accelerator similar to that seen in the photo above showing size comparison between a thruster and a group of three of our high performance single shot accelerators.\nFunding Goals\nOur initial target funding goal is $69,000. At this level of support we will be able to achieve the following:\n1) We will design, build and test a prototype plasma jet thruster that can operate repetitively. This will be a proof-of-principle demonstration that our plasma jet accelerators can indeed be transformed into a working plasma thruster.\n2) We will demonstrate basic repetitive operation of the thruster at 5 Hz, i.e. 5 pulses per second. A space qualified thruster would ultimately operate at many hundreds of pulses per second, even as much as 1000 pulses per second, in order to provide an average steady thrust with high Isp. Our present plasma accelerators can fire once every few minutes, but operate at extremely high performance, i.e. about 8000 micrograms of argon at 50 km/s. The repetitive thruster will operate at perhaps only 10 micrograms of argon (or xenon) at 20 km/s. We will accomplish this by reducing the size of the accelerator and reducing the pulsed drive current from 600,000 amps, down to only about 10,000 amps. This will allow us to operate at high rep rates.\n3) We will make basic measurements of thrust using a ballistic pendulum. This is accomplished by directing the plasma slug onto a pendulum where the impact causes the pendulum to recoil. Measuring the amount of recoil tells us how much momentum was in the jet. By using other optical techniques to measure the velocity we can then infer the mass of the plasma jet. Once we know the mass and velocity, we can calculate things like the specific impulse and average thrust.\n4) We will make additional basic plasma diagnostic measurements so we know what's going on in the thruster. These will include things like measuring the density of the plasma using a laser interferometer, and measuring its temperature using spectroscopic techniques. Using very fast framing cameras in which the shutter can open and close in 50 billionths of a second allows us to get snapshots of the plasma plume. We'll also use open shutter photography with a DSLR camera to observe the plume evolution exiting from the thruster nozzle. This is going to make some really cool high speed pictures of plasma blasting out from the thruster.\n5) Using all these diagnostic measurements will allow us to make calculations of the overall thruster efficiency, Isp, and thrust/power ratio \u2013 parameters critically important to the success of the thruster.\nFigure 7: One of the really cool items available only to our backers.\nThat's going to be a lot of work for our basic goal of $69,000, but we are confident of success. This will provide the basic demonstration and data we need to confirm that our plasma jet units can indeed function successfully as a high performance thruster. Our hope, of course, is that we will receive more than that from you our supporters. If that occurs we have a plan for advancing the thruster development process even further. We intend to go all the way with this thruster and we'd love to see you come along with us!\nFigure 8: The HyperV butterfly 'galaxy' image resulting from a symmetric implosion configuration of 32 capillary discharge jets.\nIf we exceed the initial funding goal, we will be able to\nachieve even more!\nFor example, at the $100,000 level, we will also be able to:\nBuild a simple thrust stand to make direct continuous thrust\nmeasurements, to compare with the ballistic pendulum measurements. This\nwill be important for definitively measuring the thrust as opposed to\ncalculating it from other parameters. We will also be able to build and\ntest a breadboard energy recovery circuit. This circuit is crucial for\nmaximizing the long term overall efficiency of the thruster. At the end\nof each thruster pulse, there is some remaining energy stored in the\nmagnetic field of the current pulse just as the plasma blob exits the\nnozzle. We need to recover this energy and reuse it on the next pulse\nto maximize the overall efficiency of the thruster. We plan to design a\ncircuit that stores this energy capacitively so that the voltage for\nthe next pulse only needs to be \u201ctopped-off\u201d instead of charged all the\nway from zero. We'll also be able to increase test run time and thus\ngather more data for future design modifications to the thruster.\nAt the $150,000 level, in addition to the above accomplishments, we\nwill also be able to: Add additional pumping and cooling features to\nallow even longer run times. Like all electric thrusters, our thruster\nwill ultimately need to incorporate some heat management features to\nensure it does not overheat when operating for months at a time. We\nwould also be able to add a functional energy recovery circuit (not\njust a breadboarded circuit) to the thruster and operate them together\nto demonstrate an high efficiency system. Our goal is an efficiency of\nabout 50%, meaning the kinetic energy of the thruster exhaust is 50% of\nthe amount of electrical energy delivered by the power supply.\nAt funding levels above $150,000, we would be able to accomplish\nfurther tasks such as: 1) Perform more extensive lifetime testing of\nthe thruster components, 2) Build an improved thrust stand with\nimproved fidelity, 3) Perform test runs with xenon gas (which is more\nexpensive than using argon gas), and 4) Test the thruster entirely in\nvacuum, which provides a better thermal test of the hardware in an\nactual simulated working space environment. This will be important for\nlearning how best to incorporate cooling features.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks and challenges are mainly technical, but the technical risks are low for achieving the stated project demo goals of 5 Hz, 1 kW, 2,000 sec specific impulse operation. The specific impulse goal of 2,000 sec is pretty straightforward, since we have already achieved over four times that number in our previous work. The main risk is actually getting a repetitive pulsed thruster working smoothly and dissipating the heat generated from the drive current. For the 5 Hz burst mode planned for the project demo, heating should not be a problem as long as we limit the run time to a few minutes. If it survives that, we'll try running it for longer duration times to learn more about its thermal characteristics. The external drive circuitry will need to be modified so that the capacitors are charged and discharged in a quasi-continuous manner, but again, this is relatively straightforward. We feel the parameters set forth in this project are sufficient to prove the thruster is worthy of further development. We plan to build an energy recovery circuit to recycle the stored magnetic field energy at the end of the pulse that would otherwise be wasted, but that effort is beyond the resources of our initial funding goal. Such a circuit would be able to increase the overall efficiency of the thruster to a level that is attractive for a space qualified system. None of the technical issues really affect whether we can pull off the project demonstration, but only affect what specific parameters we might achieve for that demo. We plan to aggressively push the parameters as far as we can during the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Announcing HyperJet Fusion Corporation", "update_content": "Hi folks I wanted to provide you with a detailed update on our company HyperV Technologies Corp. and its future.

The primary technical goal of HyperJet Fusion Corporation is the rapid development of a safe, clean and economical approach to utility scale fusion energy. If fusion energy can be developed in a timely manner, it can be a major clean energy solution to the urgent environmental and resource scarcity problems of our time. Fusion is the ultimate form of green baseload power that uses a fuel with near-zero cost (deuterium from sea water and lithium, a common mineral) and minimal environmental impact.

When our company was founded in 2007, I was so disappointed by food brands whose quality would go down over time, and brands who would compromise their integrity. I was inspired to make a company that existed for its products, not solely to create profits. \n    We started production in a small 400 square foot facility in Northeast Minneapolis. From there, we began trying to make some of the worlds finest chocolates by hand, with the goal of creating a company that doesn't compromise. Very early on we were fortunate enough to get some major press coverage and thus began a long journey. Along the way we've won numerous accolades, including winning Best Chocolate at the Good Food Awards two years in a row!  Our guiding light has always been and will always be the pursuit of excellence in what we do. To this end, we are launching our Kickstarter project to fund a newly developed manufacturing process that is going to take us to the next level. \nWe already use a variety of proprietary processes in manufacturing our chocolate. In fact, we go through so many extensive steps to produce our chocolate that it takes a week to produce a single batch! We are very fortunate right now to be in a position of having a persistant backorder in our sales, but of course there are obvious drawbacks to this. The experience of the last six years has lead me to develop a new, but extremely elegant solution to our production that increases our capacity by 50% and at the same time will improve the flavor, aroma, and texture of our bars. I wish I could tell you more, but I will say that it is a new method for milling and conching. This method solves one of the major problems with milling high percentage dark chocolate, which is that the certain particles mill preferentially. Furthermore, it solves a major issue with  dark chocolate conching by improving the quality of results, which are often hindered by the properties of high fat compositions. The solutions to complex problems are often so simple they seem effortless, even if you spend years trying to solve them. Needless to say, I am elated at the prospect of finally implementing this new technique. I think our customers(you!) are going to be really excited with the results. \nUnfortunately, even simple, elegant solutions cost more than we have capital for at this time, so we are asking for you to help us with this project through Kickstarter. We want to be able to continue to develop new ways of approaching and improving chocolate, and this is the first step to get us there. Remember that Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding system, so if we can't reach our goal we get nothing and you get your money back. Also, we only have 30 days to pull this off.\nOnce we have the funding, we will commence to purchase the necessary pieces of equipment, and within two months will be able to start producing our first batches with this technique. We are excited to be offering the first batch using this new method to you, our Kickstarter backers. We are so grateful for your support.

No startup borrows money to pay back angel investors! If the business doesn't have the money the investors lose out, end of story. Everyone tried their best, on to the next effort.

Patent Pending.\nWhat The Press is Saying\nWhy Smarter Stand?\nThe Smart Cover is one of the best accessories for iPad, but it's too limiting as an iPad stand: either its so reclined you can't see the screen or it's so upright that I have to back-up. What you really want is the iPad facing you directly, but the Smart Cover doesn't do that...until now!\nThe perfect iPad stand\nIf I back Smarter Stand, when will I get mine?\nAll orders of 1 or 2 Smarter Stands are scheduled to ship in early October. BUT if you order 3 Smarter Stands or more, your order will ship 2 weeks sooner. If you're curious as to why, it's explained in Update #11.\nWhy order 3 or more Smarter Stands? Imagine you're getting your Smarter Stand and it's already autumn, the leaves are turning yellow and the holidays are right around the corner\u2026 wouldn't a few extra Smarter Stands make great stocking stuffers? How about birthdays coming-up?\nWhich pledge levels qualify for free accelerated shipping?\n$39 pledge level: 3 Smarter Stands of the colors of your choice*\n$125 pledge level: 10 Smarter Stands \"\n$339 pledge level: 30 Smarter Stands \"\netc.\n* color choices will be collected in a survey sent to you after the project ends.\nHow Smarter Stand Works\nSmarter Stand is composed of 2 clips that attach to either side of the Smart Cover or the Smart Case. For the Smart Cover, a polyurethane pad that sticks to the back side of the iPad is also provided to prevent the iPad from slipping. For the Smart Case, no pad is needed since the neoprene of the back cover provides the grip necessary.\nYou can achieve different stand positions by sliding the clips so they block the folds of the Smart Cover.\n33-degree stand position - great for watching movies\nBy moving the clips to different spots and combining them in different ways, you'll discover new stand positions including a private typing position that hides your screen from someone across from you (think job interviews, business meetings, ...).\n45-degree stand position achieved by sliding the 2 clips over 2 different folds\nThe clips are designed to slide perfectly on the Smart Cover (or Smart Case) yet they're tightly attached enough to stay on as you carry your iPad around. \nJust like the Smart Cover and Smart Case products, the Smarter Stand is sleek, minimalist and easy to use. It doesn't add any weight or bulk to the iPad. \nThe clips are designed to slide smoothly on the Smart Cover yet stay firmly attached\nCan't it do even more stand positions?\nAppadvice recently reviewed Smarter Stand and commented: \n\"The instruction manual shows that the Smarter Stand adds three additional viewing angles to the Smart Cover, but I found that, with a little imagination, the clips can give your iPad at least six different angles.\"\nWe also recently discovered this variable 10 to 20 degrees PORTRAIT stand position explained in update #10:\nBonus portrait position\nWhat stand position will you discover when you get your Smarter Stand? :-)\n\nWait... can't this be done with a couple of binder clips?\nIf you want to try to do this with a couple of binder clips to save $12 (shipping included), you absolutely should... Just be aware that:\n1) You'll have to take your clunky binder clips on and off the cover and store them somewhere when you're not using them whereas Smarter Stand can stay on your Smart Cover all the time and slide into the position you need when you need it. \n2) Binder clips will eventually damage your $39 Smart Cover and might also scratch your $500+ iPad's screen. \n3) You'll need to stick some kind of non-slip pad to the back of your iPad to stabilize it. Just make sure you never need to remove this home-made pad since it will definitely leave marks unlike the one provided with Smarter Stand.\nSo as long as the above doesn't bother you and you're ok showing up at Starbucks with good old binder clips oddly attached to your iPad, you can save yourself all of $12 to buy 3 Grande Cappuccinos with! \nThere's a zillion iPad stands out there. Why this one?\nTrue. There are a lot of iPad stands out there. I know because I own about half of them :-) And believe me... none of them were as affordable as the Smarter Stand. And no, that's not why I need your backing (more on that below).\nThe reason I came up with the Smarter Stand is that I never used my other iPad stands: They're all heavy and bulky to carry around which defeats the core purpose of the iPad: being an ultra portable device.\nWith Smarter Stand I always have my iPad stand with me. No added bulk or weight. And all that for $11. You get my point.\nWhy I Need Your Backing\nAfter many rounds of prototyping, I have arrived at a final prototype that works perfectly and which I've been using successfully for many weeks. So I'm now ready to submit the 3D model to begin mass production.\nHowever, I got a few quotes from manufacturers and the initial tooling/molding along with the first production run will cost 20k+... ouch! I don't want to involve investors who will tell me how to run my business. That's why I need your support to fund this phase of the project. I also want to get a sense for the quantity of clips to make in each color to make everyone happy while keeping production costs reasonable.\nYou can back this project for as little as $11 and you'll even get your own awesome Smarter Stand as a reward. So please back this project now and spread the word! \nThanks to you, no Smart Cover/Case should ever be limited to its 2 native stand positions ever again!\nWhat's included in 1 Smarter Stand?\nPick your color\nIMPORTANT: You will actually pick your color(s) right before I ship the orders. So for now, you only have to decide whether you want white or color clips and pledge for the corresponding reward level.\nPledge $14 or more and receive your own Smarter Stand in the color of your choice to match your smart cover or create a nice color combination.\n9 colors to choose from\nMatch. Mix. Express yourself.\nYou can match the color of your Smart Cover or even create your own coordinated style by combining colors. Not sure which colors to get? Get the Family Special and order 3 different colors to keep your iPad on the cutting edge of cover fashion!\nMatch, mix, express yourself.\nGet an extra clip FREE!\nLikeus on Facebook after you back this project and we will include one extra clip for FREE to your order when it ships. You can use an extra Smart Stand clip to unlock exotic additional stand positions (by blocking more folds in the Smart Cover) or just use it as a backup in case you lose one of the other 2 clips.\nSpecial Thanks:\nThe video was masterfully directed and edited by James Mills. DP: Tim McCombe.\nThe 3D modeling work was skillfully executed by David Rowan Johnson.\nPlease don't hesitate to hire these fine craftsmen for your own project.

On the project Web site, you'll meet Minnesotans across the spectrum of religious faiths making the biblical case supporting same-sex marriage. These videos\u2014a mix of sermons, rallies, panel discussions and personal interviews\u2014illustrate the moral right of the religious left.\nMy hope is that people will share these videos in the run-up to the November 2012 election, when Minnesotans and voters in four other states will have the chance to defeat measures that would constitutionally ban same-sex marriage.   \nWHY THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT\nThrough AM radio, Sunday morning cable TV and mainstream media, the religious right has owned the conversation about gay marriage. Faith Forward counters the prevailing narrative that conservatives define and monopolize so-called family values.\nToday, progressive faith leaders are banding together to help people understand how religious texts and histories support same-sex relationships. Through Faith Forward, I'm gathering video at sermons, rallies and panel discussions and interviewing priests, rabbis, scholars and other devout progressives. \nAs a collective religious calling, progressive faith leaders are fighting Republican anti-marriage measures that would prevent loving same-sex couples from ever legally marrying. They point to scripture and say YES to committed couples of all stripes.\nThirty other states have already branded discrimination against same-sex couples into their constitutions, and Minnesota is one of five states (also Maryland, North Carolina, Maine and Washington) fighting against this from happening in November. Now is the time to make history by standing up for our families, neighbors, friends, maybe even yourselves.\nHOW YOU CAN USE FAITH FORWARD\nOn the project Web site, you\u2019ll find people illustrating the progressive, inclusive, hopeful side of faith. My hope is that people will share these videos\u2014that they\u2019ll send these expressions of faith forward\u2014and bring them into conversations around this issue.\nAre you close to people who aren\u2019t sure how to think about same-sex relationships? Do you know of people who oppose same-sex relationships on religious grounds? The videos at Faith Forward Minnesota are your ammunition.\nWHO IS PRODUCING FAITH FORWARD?\nI\u2019m Matt Peiken, a longtime journalist in the Twin Cities. I\u2019m a straight Jewish atheist, but I'm driven to make a difference in defeating the anti-marriage amendment in Minnesota. I see real power in this realm of \"advocacy journalism.\"\nWHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THIS KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN\nYour investment in Faith Forward will help me amplify more voices from the left and counter the prevailing narrative that conservatives hold a monopoly on so-called \u201cfamily\u201d values.\nWith your support, I'll spend the summer outside the core Twin Cities, interviewing faith leaders and other devout progressives all over Minnesota. It's important that voters in rural Minnesota see their friends and neighbors talking about their faith and support for same-sex couples. Winning these voters will make all the difference in this election.\nCheck out the great rewards I have for you\u2014from awesome T-shirts to a limited-edition letterpress poster from Minneapolis artist/designer Todd Thyberg.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "\"God Votes No\" \u2014 Free public screening this Saturday, Nov. 3", "update_content": "Hi everyone ...\nThe only public screening before election night for \"God Votes No\" is 11am this Saturday, Nov. 3, at the Trylon Microcinema in Minneapolis.\nHere's a Facebook event page with all the details and a trailer created just for this screening:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "My documentary is now online.

Should we surpass this goal, we wanted to let you in on some of our future plans for the project.\nWe aim to make information about the screen printing process more accessible to the community. In turn, screen printing makes creative work more accessible to the masses.\nWhat is the book?\nThis is a do-it-yourself manual that instructs how to screen print from your living space and design a semiprofessional shop on a modest budget. By utilizing cumulative knowledge from industry professionals throughout Minneapolis, it's the most comprehensive how-to book about screen printing at home.\nWhat is our game plan?\nOur project has evolved organically and lives in many forms. We have created a visual identity, instructional videos and a website, are doing workshops and live demos and continue to engage an entire community here in Minneapolis.  \nWe plan to print a small run of a first edition book with a screen-printed cover this summer (basically once our Kickstarter campaign wraps up). From there we\u2019ll distribute the book via bookstores, art retailers, boutiques and cooperatives and get it into the hands of artists, designers, educators, entrepreneurs, crafters, DIYers, James Franco and whoever else expresses interest as we gain momentum.\nWe also plan to develop more curriculum, run larger workshops, publish an e-book and extend far beyond Minneapolis.\nWhy did we decide to make a book?\nWe\u2019re doing it to fill a gap we\u2019ve experienced in the educational system.  \nFirst of all:\nWe\u2019ve been taught that to make art we must rely on funding from others. But, in public schools, art is always one of the first subjects to receive funding cuts or become cut altogether. Many people don\u2019t see the value in art. So, rather than rely on a handout, we\u2019ve found something that allows us to control our own destiny. We want to share that knowledge. \nSecondly:\nWe\u2019ve been taught to rely on making art in facilities we simply cannot afford. Specifically, in higher education, we pay somebody a lot of money to teach us this way. So, rather than put that money into the hands of a stranger, we\u2019ve realized we can keep it in ours and do it ourselves. We want to share that knowledge.\nLastly:\nThere are exceptions but for most schools that teach printmaking, screen printing remains on the backburner, is neglected or is rejected as fine art altogether. This is a huge disservice to the student. True, screen printing walks a fine line between art and production, but upon graduation students need to be prepared to produce. Screen printing is a sustainable way to produce art. We want to share that knowledge.\nWhy screen printing?\nWe started for the\nimmediacy (very few things in life come so quickly).\nWe stayed for the \nsustainability (this is art that pays the bills); \ncommunity (cool people print!); and\ndepth (there are a million and one variables, and with every print run, we learn). \nWhat makes this book different? \nIt\u2019s comprehensive. We present inside knowledge from both sides of the counter. \nIt\u2019s honest. Cheap isn\u2019t always the answer. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for.\nIt\u2019s relevant. This book is made for artists by artists and for the beginner from the beginning.\nWhat are some of the sweet rewards? \nA preorder of our book, the first edition with the sexy hand-printed cover.\nPreorder our book & a one-color t-shirt press for $250, so you can really hit the ground running!\nA preorder of our book + a two-color art print.\nAn SPOTC tote bag for carrying all your bowling ball and bobby pins. \nWho is the book for?\n\u00b7       artists\n\u00b7       designers\n\u00b7       educators\n\u00b7       entrepreneurs\n\u00b7       crafters\n\u00b7       hands-on do-it-yourselfers\n\u00b7       cooperatives\n\u00b7       small businesses\n\u00b7       schools\n\u00b7       James Franco\n\nWho are we?\nAuthor: Andy McInnis\nDesigner: Nate Johannes\nProducer: Caitlin Hargarten\nVideographer/photographer: Sam Thompson\nWeb developer: Bjorn Hagstrom\nCopy editor: Rusdon Torbenson\n\nWhat we've been up to:\nWe\u2019ve created:\n\u00b7       a visual identity\n\u00b7       video tutorials\n\u00b7       a website\n\u00b7       a forum for the community\n\u00b7       workshops\n\u00b7       setups for mom-and-pop shops\n\u00b7       live demos\n\u2026 And we continue to engage an entire community here in Minneapolis.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "The book is out, let's party!", "update_content": "Thanks to YOU, Screen Printing: On the Cheap exists in book form!

We\u2019ve spent $42,500 on development so far and just need another $20,000 to see us through to completion. Mob Rules Games believes transparent business practices are vital to earning your trust, and will make our budget, expenses, sales, and schedule publicly available. Every $5 pledged earns you additional copies of the game, which you can give away or sell as you please. We plan to release Haunts: The Manse Macabre in time for Halloween this year.\n FUNDED! Now We Stretch!\nThanks to the 1000 or so generous donors, we have done it. Now, we can try for even more. We had a survey of supporters a few weeks ago, asking which monsters we should add to the game. You all picked some great winners, but there were plenty of popular runners up. We thought we'd see if you wanted to put them in the game too.\nFor Every $1000 we raise over the $25,000 original ask, we'll add in another of these Denizens. Since we're already over $26k, the obvious first Bonus Denizen is the exactly tied Ancient Ones. The rest will come online in the following order:\n\n$27,000 Unlocks The Runner-Up Evil Genius\n\n$28,000 Unlocks the Runner-Up Vampire\n\n$29,000 Unlocks the Runner-Up Psychopath\n\n$30,000 Unlocks the Alternate Creepy Child\n\n$31,000 We'll look at other Abominations and see what people like.\n$26,000 - Already Unlocked! Both Ancient Ones\n$27,000 Unlock: Evil Genius\n$28,000 Unlock: Vampire\n$29,000 Unlock: Psychopath\n$30,000 Unlock: Creepy Child\nThe Game\nHaunts: The Manse Macabre is a turn-based game for PC/Mac/Linux that allows players to take control of either the haunting denizens that have earned this infamous home its dire reputation or as the intrepid intruders determined to pry loose the Tyree Manse\u2019s dread secrets. It can be played versus another player or versus the AI, online or all alone. A lengthy single-player campaign tells the house\u2019s horrifying history and unlocks new denizens and intruders to use in the game. Scores of maps combined with variable goals, customizable rosters, and a variety of opponents offer endlessly unique and re-playable games. \nEach side begins the game by choosing their forces in secret, so that their opponent has no idea what kind of units and abilities they\u2019ll face. The Intruders recruit a squad of three people, each of which can have different equipment and special abilities. There are weapons, psychic or magic powers, special scientific gear, ancient relics, and so on. They also secretly pick what kind of goal they\u2019re trying to achieve by searching the Tyree Manse. The Intruders could be trying to recover an artifact or dark tome, cleanse the house of its evil spirits, or solve one of the house\u2019s many mysteries. \nThe Denizens will have to defend against any of the goals the Intruders might be after, but the haunters have plenty of surprises of their own. They get to choose the nature of the haunting. Phantasms, Cultists, Abominations, Undying, Psychopaths: each comes with its own set of leaders, servitors, and minions. Creatures range from powerful monsters that can tear a foolhardy explorer to pieces, to small orbs that can spy on the intruders. Each leader has unique powers used to plague the Intruders, which range from temporary pools of darkness, to poltergeist attacks that damage and disorient, to reality warping changes to the house itself. \nPlayers have no idea what their opponent is doing, until they discover it for themselves during the game. Light and darkness have crucial roles in determining how the game plays out, since it\u2019s always in your best interest to hide your movements from your foe even as you try to suss out what they\u2019re up to. With its mercurial maps, hidden agendas, and stealthy maneuvers punctuated by macabre attacks, Haunts: The Manse Macabre builds tension like a great ghost story should. Whether or not it has a happy ending depends, of course, on your point of view. \nEvery $5 Buys You Another Copy of the Game\nFor every $5 you give to support Haunts: The Manse Macabre, you will receive a code good for downloading one copy of the game. You can (and are encouraged to) give away the extra codes to friends, to sell them to strangers, or print them out and frame them as a testament to your generosity and fine taste. \nSo, for example, if you donate $25, you\u2019ll not only get a copy of the game for yourself, but four other copies. That\u2019s one for your best friend as a Halloween present, one for that special someone you\u2019re trying to woo with promises of digital horror, and two that you can sell to other gamers who\u2019re just looking for a good time.\nWe consider each $5 a pre-sale of the game. We might well ending up actually selling it for a few bucks more than that, but we\u2019re happy as hell to book the sales now. What happens to those copies of the game afterwards is up to you - they\u2019re yours.\nWhy We Need the Money\nHaunts: The Manse Macabre has been under development since December, 2011, when we let everyone who registered on our site vote to decide which game we would make. Haunts was the winner, and we\u2019ve been working hard on it ever since. The Lewis Charitable Foundation invested in the initial development. Spread out over three milestones - all of which we have met - the investment totalled $42,500. We\u2019re still using that money to pay salaries for two of our three developers, along with other basic business costs like licensing software and promotion. We need another $20,000 to finish the game and make sure it\u2019s as good we can make it. We're asking for $5000 more than what we need in order to cover the cut Amazon and Kickstarter take as well as promotional costs.\nMob Rules Games believes that radical transparency is the best way for us to do business - that if we are as open and straightforward as possible with our customers and the world, we\u2019ll both earn their trust and be able to operate in an open and honest manner. We post our budget, schedule, progress, investors, and corporate policies on our web site. We will tell you exactly how much money we\u2019ve spent and how we use every dollar that comes in through this Kickstarter. Once the game is released, we will tell you exactly how many we\u2019ve sold, how much money we\u2019ve made, and so on. \nAnd you don\u2019t just have to take our word for it. Thus far all of our operating capital has come from investments by the Lewis Charitable Foundation, a non-profit with the goal of promoting radical transparency in business. We\u2019re already accountable to them, but we want to be accountable to you as well. For those who want to know more about our open business model, check out mobrulesgames.com. There we have details about the budget and schedule, an explanation of our rather unusual, project-based investment model, and a description of our worker-controlled corporate structure.\nWhy We Need Your Voice\nMob Rules Games is just three full time developers plus a few talented part-time contractors. We have a vision and a plan and we\u2019re working hard, but we want input from our customers and players too. Our first vote chose our game, and we think that worked out really well. With limited time and resources, there are other decisions to make as well. Which denizens should we include? Which intruders? What other features does the game need? Is it any fun? We want to put these questions to you, the supporters. So before or after you\u2019ve pledged support, we hope you\u2019ll come over to mobrulesgames.com, register with us, and make your voice heard.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Problems Persist", "update_content": "Things are not going well.

As I\u2019m sure many of you suspect, things haven\u2019t been going well for Haunts and Mob Rules Games. I am still determined to get the game out, but I no longer have any way of knowing when and how that will happen.\nThe principal cause for our dire condition is that there are no longer any programmers working on the game. Our lead programmer, Jonathan, was always going to move on to something else after a year or so. We had hoped that he would be able to work on the game in his spare time, but now that he\u2019s going back at Google, he has told us that his spare time will be very minimal and not enough to make progress on the game. Our second programmer, Josh, has quit the project entirely to take another job. He does not want to work on the game in his spare time."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Single Player Clarifications and New Announcement", "update_content": "I did not explain things very well yesterday. Let me clarify the current single player plan before I then announce something new and exciting.\n\nWhat we\u2019re not going to do, and what I was referencing yesterday when I mentioned the single player campaign being pretty much dead, is the massive, inter-woven single-player story we\u2019d been working on where every chapter was connected to every other in decisions you made. It was way too unwieldy and poorly paced, in addition to being overly complicated and seemingly impossible to execute and balance.\n\nWhat we are doing (and what I failed to explain well yesterday) is a series of individual levels that tell the overall story of the house and are discrete from one another. Each level tells a story inspired by an era and a horror movie from that era, and together they tell the story of the house. There are lots of characters in each story, and that is where the cameos will come in. Indeed, since these levels are meant to be replayed against opponents, the cameos will probably get much more screen time with each player than under the old, multi-level spanning story mode.\n\nThe other big change is that, unlike what we were doing before where the levels were serving a giant, Rube Goldberg Machine plot and suffering for it, each level is designed to be a compelling multiplayer map that plays differently depend on if you\u2019re the Denizens or the Intruders. Each level has some unique mechanic or set-up that matches the story and setting. For example, level four is about the vampire denizen, and centers around the Intruders with limited sight range placing lights that weaken the denizens and the denizens moving very fast in the dark around them. These are not simply multiplayer deathmatch arenas with no plot behind them. The plot came first and we came up with mechanics that were a fun match.\n\nEach of these levels will have an AI you can play against as you go through them, for either side. What I was clumsily alluding to yesterday is that the AI will probably not be very competitive after the first couple times you play a level and know some basic strategy for it. So they are rich in theme but designed to be rewarding to replay, especially against a living (or intelligently undead) opponent.\n\nI hope that clears up a lot of the very valid concerns supporters expressed yesterday. But there is more! We heard you and we are not giving up on expanding on more story-focused single player levels.The game I described above will release to Kickstarter supporters as soon as its ready - by Halloween is the plan.\n\nWork on Haunts will not cease with that release! We will press forward with more story-centric, single-player content. Monday\u2019s announcement and the wave of feedback we received got me thinking long and hard and looking for ways to take your advice and keep trying to work on compelling, story-centric content into the game. At the same time, I was still trying to figure out what to do about another lingering problem I hadn\u2019t told you about, because it was part of a future expansion project we haven't announced yet.\n\nIt has long been the plan to make a follow-up, extra content release for Haunts that consisted of single-player stories with plots written by some of the coolest horror writers going right now. Originally we were going to sell this separately, as a follow up DLC pack, but now we are going to roll all of that content into the core game. This solves two problems - it gives us a great base to build single-player, story-driven levels around and it allows me to keep working with these great writers and figure out the best way to execute their creepy creations in Haunts.\n\nOver the coming months, we\u2019ll work with those writers and the community to find the horrific fun in these single-player stories. All of those updates will be part of the Kickstarter Supporters edition of the game. When we\u2019ve got them ready, we\u2019ll push the content out to you.\n\nEventually, we will do a full retail release of the game, which will have all the content you supporters get, but for a higher price. Additionally, we\u2019ll release some bonus content for the Kickstarter editions only, either new story or multiplayer maps - maybe one of each, we\u2019ll see.\n\nSo, meet some of The Writers -"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "More on Single Player", "update_content": "Right, so, I totally hear you folks who are disappointed about the single player campaign not coming together.\nI will refund the pledges of anyone who feels cheated, absolutely. \nLet me explain a little more.

These work just well enough for us to use, but the experience is pretty terrible from a lag point of view - those screen sharing things are not meant for video games, even turn-based ones. So we want to wait until we have at least the basic online gateway up so people can actually play versus one another (which is the real way to play this game)."}, {"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Doug K", "content": "Every time I look through my list of Kickstarted things I find this and am sad.", "time": "almost 2 years ago"}, {"username": "TAGG", "content": "Any chance there's someone out there toying with this a pet project?

They are designers who dream big and burn the midnight oil to forge their own paths. \nIn December 2011, we started the blog, 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship where we share our process and research for the book. Each day, we post an inspiring story, article, or interview on design entrepreneurship. We have worked hard to curate interesting content and the outpouring of kind words that we've received has reinforced our excitement for the project.\nThe blog presents short, inspirational excerpts from our discussions. The printed book expands on these conversations and presents long-format features, interviews, pivotal essays, original writing, and interludes from the Kern and Burn authors. \nWe encourage our peers to challenge the traditional role of graphic designers by presenting the perspectives and experiences of those who have used design to do more. We celebrate designers who solve big problems, aim to delight their audiences, make meaningful work that benefits others, and most importantly, live their lives to the fullest. We believe good design is all about good people. Our book is about good people who happen to be designers.\nWe have talked to design leaders and innovators at startups like Twitter, Airbnb, and Kickstarter, founders such as Khoi Vinh and Cameron Koczon, designers that craft products like Peter Buchanan-Smith and Studio Neat, those who champion side projects like SwissMiss and Christian Helms, and those who believe in the importance of writing and self-publishing, like The Manual. See our website for a complete list of contributors. We will continue to add new contributors as we progress through the 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship.\nWe're honored to share their stories with our readers. The launch of our Kickstarter project marks the beginning of a wonderful collaboration with an even larger community. As always, thanks for joining us on the journey.\nThe Book\nWe are making a book that captures the energy and excitement of design entrepreneurs. A book that inspires the design community to Kern and Burn\u2014to perfect our craft and to work obsessively hard. It is a book that focuses on designers' lives, decisions, and aspirations rather than their techniques and color palettes. A book that challenges our peers to believe in themselves, and think about their lives as a design problem.\nAs we make our way through the 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship we edit our discussions, curate our interviews, compile essays, reflect on what we've learned, and work to craft a book that is as beautiful as our content is rich. The format and narrative of the book will evolve through the process.\nThe book's title is also in the works, we'll announce it when the time is right! We've adopted the startup mentality and are putting this project out there before it's perfect, packaged, and ready to ship, (heck, before it even has a title), but we like that. That means we get the chance to involve the design community in our design process, the book's production, and we get to share the reward of creating something meaningful, together.\nRewards\nIf we reach our goal, with your contribution, we will use the funding to hire an editor, refine our design, and begin production.\nOur reward levels include some fun additions to the printed book, including a digital copy, a small-format process book with highlights from the 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship, a letterpress pica ruler bookmark (for the Kern in all of us), and a series of hand-pulled screen printed posters.\nSupporters will receive exclusive updates as we develop the book. We encourage your feedback throughout the process, and are excited to see it all take shape.\nKern and Burn Team\nKern and Burn is a collaboration between Jessica Karle Heltzel and Tim Hoover. They are both finishing their MFA degrees in graphic design at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).\nThanks to Public School and Christian Helms for starring in the video, and Eric R.

Like wine, honey from each neighborhood has its own taste profile. Bee Local is dedicated to producing healthy, pollen rich honey using sustainable techniques and educating the public about how important honeybees are. This is not your average honey. \nWhat is the Funding is for?\nI currently have micro-apiaries in 4 neighborhoods within Portland, OR. I provide honey and honeycomb to individuals, a few retail stores and a restaurant. The response has been overwhelming and demand is more than I can produce with my 6 hives. \nThe next step is to expand within Portland and to other cities; Seattle, Olympia and San Francisco using the current model of micro-apiary hosting. The goal is to establish at least 20 more hives. I have people who have committed to hosting hives in the locations mentioned above. \nAchieving this goal requires the purchase of critical beekeeping equipment; hive bodies, bees, queens, frames, foundation, an extractor, and other necessary tools. This equipment is very expensive for a small scale beekeeper such as myself. It is important to Bee Local's success.  \nWhy is Bee Local different?\nHoneybees typically forage for nectar within a 4-mile radius. The honey they produce in each geographic location has flavors, textures and complexity that are completely unique to that location. Honey from one neighborhood tastes completely different than honey from another.\nThe result is small artisan micro-batch honeys that directly reflect the unique characteristics of each neighborhood. For example Bee Local currently has 4 varieties from 4 different Portland neighborhoods: Mt. Tabor, Brooklyn, Powellhurst, and Laurelhurst.\nBeyond Honey\nBy placing hives in varied locations we are increasing the productivity of our cities gardens, increasing awareness of the importance of the honeybee, our relationship to the land around us, and utilizing previously unused urban spaces for food production. This process begins a conversation about sustainability and the current challenges that the selfless honeybee is facing.\nPeople begin to see the connection between our environment and food sources. They love the idea that their flowers, gardens, and trees are contributing directly to the flavor of the honey. Our communities begin to take an increased stewardship of the land around them. \nBee the Change\nFunding this project will allow Bee Local to expand into several different cities, purchase critical beekeeping equipment, help to educate our communities about the plight of the honeybee and provide healthy honey for consumption. \nThank you!\nDamian", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Rewards Update", "update_content": "Backers, \nThank all of you for your continued patience. \nRather than delay rewards further I am going to begin sending out the honey portion of your rewards.

Don't mind if I do!\u201d \u2013 LightSpeed-Gaming.com\nWHAT IS GUNS OF ICARUS ONLINE?\nGuns of Icarus Online is a team-based, first-person multiplayer airship combat game set in a post-apocalyptic, steampunk/dieselpunk-inspired world. Join a few of your friends to serve aboard an airship, or get a captain\u2019s license and your own ship, crew it with your friends or some hired hands, and set sail for adventure as you brave danger-filled skies to deliver precious cargo and fight off air pirates and rival factions.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is contained in the three classes of Gunner, Engineer, and Captain. Each has a specific and vital role to fulfill, be it manning the guns, making repairs, or piloting the ship, and each player must respond on the fly to rapidly changing conditions. Gunners may abandon their guns to repair a vital component, or the Captain may ditch the wheel to add a little more firepower to a broadside sweep. \nOn the small scale, the game is about the thrill of flying and moment-to-moment airship combat, with its strategy, skill, and frantic action, and the teamwork of a well-knit crew where everyone has a job to do. These experiences are the core of the PvP combat mode in the initial release.\nLater we will expand the game to include a multiplayer campaign mode that\u2019s all about the politics of alliance and conquest, and the economics of nurturing the growth of struggling towns while increasing your own profits through trade. As the captain of a merchant ship, you will be the one that towns depend on to deliver the supplies they need to survive. Lose the cargo en route, and shortages will hamper growth and affect the local economy. As a warship captain, you\u2019ll be on the front line defending or expanding your faction\u2019s territory, protecting merchant fleets so shipments get where they\u2019re going -- or raiding them and bringing the spoils home.\n\nGuns of Icarus Online is the spiritual successor to our previous game Guns of Icarus, which followed the journey of the pioneering solo captain Gabriel aboard his airship the Icarus through pirate-filled skies. Guns of Icarus Online is the expansion of that idea into a broader, richer, more exciting world, and represents the game we always wanted to make. We hope you\u2019ll help us make it a reality!\n\nFEATURES\nCompetitive multiplayer \u2013 Co-op & PvP\nUnique combat system \u2013 Shooter, time-management, navigation\nPost-apocalyptic steampunk/dieselpunk look\nExtensive customization with lots of weapons, engines, and decorative ship parts\nRobust skills system and player classes\nEnvironmental effects playing a key role in ship status and combat strategy\nCampaign with mission, factions, trade, and crafting - dynamically affecting battlefronts and alliances\nTRAILER VIDEOS\nTHE WORLD OF GUNS OF ICARUS ONLINE\nThree hundred years have passed since the Great War consumed the planet. Three hundred years since the human race ate hungrily of mother earth, squandering resources that could have carried them forward for millennia.\nIn the heat of the sun, there is an unsettling, inescapable truth: man has fallen from his throne.\nHumanity now lives among the ruins left by a century of conflict, but from the wrecked steel of the past they will forge their own future. Lighter-than-air technology has inspired intrepid pioneers to take to the skies in search of trade and resources to support their towns and families. Enterprising craftsmen fashion elaborate machines out of scavenged scraps. The desperate and ruthless take what they can by force.\n\nDespite all that was lost, a renewed passion for invention has emerged, along with a deep respect for the fragility of life. Explorers and philosophers travel in search of forgotten knowledge now scattered beneath the wastes.\n\nThe survivors are inventors, pilots, captains, craftsmen, adventurers, fighters, privateers, merchants, engineers, farmers and scholars. They herald a new age for humanity: an age of rebirth.\nHOW WE GOT HERE\nWe are a small indie studio in New York, and we released the first Guns of Icarus in May of 2010 on Steam and later on the Mac App Store.  Before that, we had developed a few small web and iPhone games, but Guns was our first important release where we actually made money on a game! Because our budget was really tight (as it always is, what else is new...), we tried to innovate on the game mechanics but kept the scope small, with a total development time of about five months. The game generated a lot of enthusiasm and did really well, and we received a lot of feedback from players and fans about features they wanted to see and where we could take the game in the future. There were a ton of ideas we still wanted to explore, and the concept and setting seemed ripe for development as a larger-scale, multiplayer game. With Guns of Icarus Online, we are finally able do some of the things we\u2019ve wanted to do since the original game and bring that expanded world to life.\n\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\nWe were fortunate to have done well enough with our previous projects Guns of Icarus and CreaVures to have the opportunity to make Guns of Icarus Online. This game is our biggest and most ambitious project by far, and we are pouring pretty much everything we have into it.  \nThe funds we raise in this campaign will help us finish and polish the game and go toward things like music and sound design, creating additional art assets, and server hosting and maintenance costs.We want the end product to be as awesome as it can possibly be, which is why we\u2019re asking for your support.\nWe also want to get the word out and reward our early supporters with goodies like discounted preorders, closed beta access, and special limited-edition items. We had great support from people on Kickstarter for our last game CreaVures, and hope people will continue to support us so we can make Guns of Icarus Online a reality!  Help us spread the word!  \nIf you are interested in just lending moral support or helping out in other ways, that's still awesome.  We can definitely use help testing the game and giving us feedback along the way.  We're still working on getting a forum up on the website, so stay tuned for that.\nREWARDS!\nGuns Pilotwing Logo t-shirt! This is a unisex 100% cotton t-shirt from American Apparel adorned with the sweet steampunk \u201cPilotwing\u201d logo by artist Tim Doolen.\n\nGuns of Icarus Poster and Signed Poster! This is a high-quality print of our iconic and beautiful \u201cEvening Airship\u201d wallpaper. Signed posters will be limited to a run of 13 and will be signed by members of the Muse Games team.\nExclusive Costume.  This is one of our favorite costume designs.  The in game costume will have a male as well as a female version.  \nCaptain's Log Book. It is 4x6 in size, which is great for carrying it around, and it features leather covers and a classical, clean look.  We will also have a special Guns of Icarus Online logo stamped on the inside cover, along with a signed sketch by our artists on the first page of each book.  \nCustom USB design.  Please note that this image is a mockup only! The actual USB will have the Guns of Icarus Online logo etched, so it will look even better than this.  \nArt Book.  It is going to be 40 pages of Guns of Icarus Online artwork with a black and white cover and perfect bound softcover. \nThanks so much for checking out our project!  \nIf you\u2019d like to reach us or get updates on our progress:  \nLike us on facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/GunsOfIcarusOnline\nOur twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/MuseGames\nOur website:\nhttp://www.gunsoficarus.com\nhttp://www.musegames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Steam Retail, soundtrack, and costume Status", "update_content": "Charging Ahead to Launch...\nIt's been a busy time for us at Muse Games!

Bound in a canvas cover with a leather strap and matching impressed lettering, and utilizing archival heavy weight paper and printing methods, this edition far exceeds the possibilities available through traditional publishing avenues. Somewhere between the Artists' Books tradition and the high-end photographic monograph, these books will maintain the integrity of both the content and form of the original. \nThese books are heavily discounted for the purpose of raising necessary capital, and also for acknowledging early, much needed support. The financial hurdle and immense time needed to produce a factory-direct edition is formidable. I thank you for your time, and for your early assistance in helping to bring this project to the public.\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION \nI began working on this project ten years ago, though I didn't know it for the first five. Profoundly affected by the events of September 11th, and still deep in shock as we began our invasion of Afghanistan, I unknowingly stopped shooting skate videos and began documenting the up-turned social landscape of my North Jersey world. Out of reflex and a need to cope, I became a photographer, and soon found myself traversing the country, to document, collect, and preserve. Unbeknownst to me, this project was born. \nYears later, after photographing war and losing several friends to it, I rediscovered this early archive. It held acute personal significance, as it held the remains of my youth; however, I also felt it provided an early view of the national moral and corporeal collapse that loomed around me. I re-opened this project full time, revisiting the country I had once known, hoping to tell what was then the unheard story of an exhausted American homeland drained by its relationship with war.\nAfter a couple of years, the world caught up. The toll of the homeland became the doublespeak of politicians and headlines, and I watched as the noise of the \"recession story,\" diluted and stripped of larger and longer standing causes, drowned out a trauma that, like my subjects, I too could no longer escape. \nMy subjects are as much a reflection of myself as they are products of this time. But, I too am a product of this time, and it has been my primary task with this project to reclaim my story from the fog that is the last decade. Ultimately, this work is autobiographical and it is my hope that, in my search, you see yourself, too. \nHOW THE MONEY WORKS / WHAT HAPPENS NEXT\n>>UPDATE: WE HIT 100% What NOW? <<\nALL MONEY UP TO 25,000 WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE BOOK PRODUCTION: MATERIALS, PROCESSES, AND SHIPPING. \nOriginally, it was my plan to cap the spending on the book and to use additional funding past the kickstarter goal to support the creation of a traveling exhibition, and to help finance a tour for the book+exhibition. I have slightly modified this plan. \nALL MONEY RAISED THROUGH 25,000 will be used directly toward the book itself, first to improve on the materials and production, second to improve shipping speed. I want to make this edition as exceptional as possible; I will be using all resources from kickstarter (and most likely beyond this platform) to achieve this. \nBook sales of the first edition will be used to fund the creation of the traveling exhibition and to carry the books+exhibition around the country. This will also allow for a third chapter to be produced. \nI currently have noted bookstores in New York City and San Francisco ready to sell the book (If you know great bookstores elsewhere, please be in touch). I have preliminary arrangements with several DIY spaces and galleries throughout the country interested to host the books and traveling exhibition (I'd love to know more). It is my hope for this work to return to as many of the communities that have participated in it's creation as possible.\nTHANK YOU COMMUNITY!
