What a beautiful campus and mothership! Credit: Straton Roberts\nHiya! I'm Straton. As a user experience (UX) designer, I'm passionate about the beauty and usability of great design. Naturally, this makes me an Apple fanboy. I'm also a nerdy pin collector.\nLast year, I launched my first Kickstarter campaign for a set of iOS pins. I was blown away by the amount of support from people (in 11 countries!) who are also passionate about Apple. I received a ton of great feedback from my backers and those who have purchased the pins after the campaign. One theme has consistently stood out \u2014 people love feeling the digital world come to life.\nWith that theme in mind, I'd like to introduce you to my second Kickstarter campaign for a set of Mac-inspired pins and a special bonus set for WWDC 2021.\nWear 'em on your jacket, slap 'em on your backpack, jam 'em into your corkboard, or magnetize them to your fridge \u2014 the choice is yours!\n\nThis set of eight (8) unofficial enamel pins pays tribute to historical moments in the life of the Apple Macintosh and commemorates Apple's WWDC 2021 conference.\n\u2705 The $5,000 Stretch Goal unlocked June 2, 2021! The Click Wheel pin will be included for free with every \"Complete Set\" reward.\n\u23f3 If the project reaches $10,000, a new 10th pin will be included for free with every Complete Set reward. The twist? You get to decide! Right after the WWDC keynote on Monday, I will send everyone a link to a survey where you can submit your own pin ideas. Shortly after that, you'll get to vote on your favorite finalists. Let your imagination run wild!\nRewards\n1 single pin (your choice of design) - $10 \n1 full pin set (8 pins) - $40 \n2 full pin sets (16 pins) - $60 \n\nAdd-ons\niOS pin set (all 6 pins from my last Kickstarter) - +$25 \nThis add-on set includes all six (6) iOS-themed pins from my last Kickstarter.\nPaint: 3\" x 2\", black dyed, soft enamel with epoxy dome, 3 black rubber clutches or soft fridge magnet\nThe Spinning Beach Ball of Death: 1.0\", silver nickel plated, soft enamel with epoxy dome, 2 black rubber clutches or magnet w/ holder\nPhysical Escape Key: 0.68\" x 0.45\" (SAME SIZE AS THE REAL THING!), black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nSystem 7: 0.9\" x 0.7\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nDark Mode: 0.85\" x 0.75\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nFinders Keepers: 0.75\" x 0.75\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nWWDC21: 1.25\" x 0.37\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nGlow and Behold: 0.75\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nClick Wheel (Unlocks at $5,000): 1.18\", matte silver plated, 2 black rubber clutches or magnet w/ holder\nNOTE: The actual designs, materials, and dimensions may vary slightly from what is shown here, depending on if anything needs to be adjusted for the manufacturing process.\nThis is an example of what the back pin clutches will look like.

Based on my previous orders with my manufacturing partner, the actual defect rate is much lower.\n\n\nManufacturing and shipping delays:\n\nAs we've all learned this last year, it is reasonable to expect that there may be some delays in manufacturing and shipping due to circumstances out of our control.

Every track was created using only the sound chips inside of a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and a Gameboy (DMG).\nHere's the first cut of the full album playing on the 'Nintendo Entertainment Turntable' for your listening pleasure while you browse the project details! This is a one-off copy that was lathed so it's a bit crude compared to the polished album. The quality of the sound on the full press will be far superior to what you hear in this example. Additionally, all of the tracks have since been improved upon based on valuable feedback from friends and fellow musicians.\nI've been creating chiptune music for over a decade and have been composing video game style themes since I was a child. I've also played piano for most of my life and have always enjoyed learning how to play songs from my favorite TV shows, movies, video games, and bands. With the possibilities of using a digital audio workstation to create music, I have spent countless hours over the years arranging and composing midi based tracks. This will be my fifth album and second release on vinyl.\nAbout two years ago, backers just like you from around the world pitched in to bring my first vinyl release, \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\",  to life and they were handsomely rewarded for their support and  pledges. As with that project, I will spare no expense to create the  best album I can, complete with plenty of extras!\nA pledge of $12 or more gets you a high quality digital download of \"Soft Bits In\", including a number of digital album cover options. With a pledge of $25 or more, you get three additional full album downloads: After These Messages, Shamroctoroc, & In The RP2A Over The Sea. All digital album downloads will be delivered via email as download codes that can be redeemed at any time.\nThis reward includes an album package containing two expertly pressed black vinyl  LP records in white sleeves in a beautifully designed album jacket, all kept protected by a clear, collector-grade poly bag rather than shrink-wrapped. With this, you also receive a digital download of the album!\nThe Special Edition Vinyl Press has been designed specifically with the collector in mind. In addition to  everything that comes with the \"Vinyl Press\" reward, it includes the Deluxe Digital Album Download and the following:\nFor those interested in the process of creating the album or looking to get into making chiptune music, this two hour long, one-on-one 'master class' session will walk you through it all. I'll share what software & hardware I use, how I work within the inherent limitations, utilize creative techniques, and more! I will answer any questions you have or we can just chat about classic video games, art, music, technology, etc. This reward includes everything that comes with the Special Edition Vinyl Press.\nAfter previous album releases, I've received commissions for chiptune tracks, so I'm offering select backers the same service bundled with the Special Edition Vinyl Press in which I'll create a track just for you using the same setup I used for this album. This can be an original or an arrangement, up to five minutes in length. The recorded track will be sent to you in your preferred format when completed.\nThis is for the ultimate fan of chiptunes and vinyl - a record player built into a classic Nintendo Entertainment System! In addition to getting everything included with the Special Edition Vinyl Press, I'll create a NES Turntable just for you! It may be a novelty item with the internal components of a Crosley Cruiser but it's fully functional with multiple speeds, adjustable volume, component and headphone audio out jacks, built in speakers - and it is one heck of a conversation piece!\nIf you're a collector, you might be interested in picking up an extra copy of the album, or second Special Edition package as a special gift for someone. If you're a true collector, you'll definitely want to grab a test press of the album! For anyone who backs the \"Vinyl Press\" reward or above, you'll be able to add one of these to your pledge! For those who back at any level, you can get the same two-hour chip-tunes 'master class' included with the \"Chiptunes 101\" reward or, if you've already backed the \"Chiptunes 101\" reward, you can add more time to your session (or schedule multiple sessions).\n\nI've done meticulous calculations to determine the outcome of this project whether it barely reaches the goal or maxes out every reward. If the campaign just meets the goal, I will have a small buffer to cover anything that doesn't go according to plan. If it reaches its peak potential, however, I will be upgrading rewards!\nIf the campaign reaches $10,000 then I will be pressing the records in two different colors of vinyl - purple and yellow. Kindercore offers this option for a better cost than many other pressing plants so with just a bit extra, we can make this happen!\nAlso, as of June 14th, I've decided that an extra album insert will be included with all copies! That means standard presses will have one insert and the Special Edition will come with three! You can read this update for more info but the short version is this: this insert will follow the design of the album (purple/yellow) and contain the names of every single backer who helped bring the project to life! The more you're able to pledge, the more prominent your name will be. You will be able to choose how your name will appear, or you can choose to dedicate your spot to someone special! I'll get this info from everyone on the surveys at the end of the campaign.\nSurpassing $11,000 in funding will get the Special Edition Vinyl Press backers four more 5x7\" pixel art prints with colorful designs inspired by the lyrics of \"The Soft Bulletin\". Can you guess which songs might have inspired these designs?\n$12,000 gets all backers of $40 rewards or more a 4-in-1 sticker strip designed after the Gameboy Printer paper feed. These additional images of the band that inspired \"Soft Bits In\" look like they came fresh off the GBP press and can be cut down to smaller, individual stickers or left intact to resemble the paper strips torn from the thermal paper roll!\nAt $14,000, all albums will be upgraded with gatefold jackets. For the true double album experience, a gatefold is the perfect packaging. With this upgrade, I'll also include  a 'Special Thanks' section on the inside of the jacket where I'll list the names of everyone who backs the campaign!\n$16,000 in funding gets Special Edition Vinyl Press backers a sleek obi strip! Many collectors love these extras that are common to releases in Japan.\nAt $18,000, all Special Edition Vinyl Press albums will include a lenticular cover art insert with an interlaced image that animates an exploding Gameboy when you tilt it up and down! I haven't cemented the design quite yet but I will be working with the  company producing these to come up with the best sequence of images to take full advantage of this unique technology and this is more or less how I want the final effect to look in action.\nFor any backer who pledges $90 or more and will be receiving at least one copy of the album with their reward, I'm offering a unique high pigment color swirl variant of the records! You can read all the details in this update but a few things to note. These are limited to one-per-backer (possible exceptions for high rollers) and their appearance may vary wildly from what you see below - but this is the overall look I'll be going for. Also, if this isn't your thing and would prefer the standard black vinyl instead (or solid yellow/purple color if we reach that stretch goal), you'll have the option to opt out on the survey at the end of the campaign. I know many of you will enjoy this perk but it's not for everyone so I don't want to force it on you if you don't want it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter campaign has potential risks and many challenges but I've taken every precaution to ensure that whatever funding is raised will be more than sufficient to cover all costs of production and that I am well prepared to take on the challenges of fulfillment. As of now, the tracks are all completed, recorded, mastered and backed up on multiple devices. In addition, all artwork for printing the album packaging, posters, art prints, stickers, etc have been finished, formatted and ready for submission to the printers. In other words, my work here is done and all that's left is for backers to help me reach the funding goal and the production companies to do the rest!\n\nWhile I will be relying on third parties for production needs, nearly everyone that is working on the creation of the physical items is someone I have used in the past. They are reliable, professional, and have done work that exceeded my expectations so I have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver.\n\nReward delivery dates have been conservatively set to account for unexpected snags so they will likely arrive well ahead of schedule but in the event of delays, updates will be posted regularly and digital downloads will be delivered right after the close of the campaign regardless, so you can start listening to the album right away!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "Digital download of the full album in high quality with HD digital album pixel art.\nINCLUDES:\nSoft Bits In (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["13 backers", "Limited (87 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Deluxe Digital Album Download", "descp": "Digital download of the full album in high quality with HD digital album pixel art, plus digital downloads of my \"After These Messages\", \"Shamroctoroc\", and \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\" albums.\nINCLUDES:\nSoft Bits In (Download)\nAfter These Messages (Download)\nShamroctoroc (Download)\nIn The RP2A Over The Sea (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (93 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Vinyl Press", "descp": "Double LP vinyl press of \"Soft Bits In\", plus digital download of the album.\nShipping is included in the pledge amount for backers in the continental United States (supplemental shipping added for international backers based on location).\nINCLUDES:\nDouble LP Vinyl Press\n(Shipping included within the U.S.)\nSoft Bits In (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["53 backers", "Limited (47 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Special Edition Vinyl Press", "descp": "Everything included with the \"Vinyl Press\" and \"Deluxe Digital Album Download\" rewards, plus a set of exclusive pixel art prints, album inserts, an assortment of stickers, and as a bonus, a physical copy of my 6-panel digipak \"8-Bit Jesus\" album on CD.\nShipping is included in the pledge amount for backers in the continental United States (supplemental shipping added for international backers based on location).\nINCLUDES:\nDouble LP Vinyl Press\nAlbum Inserts\nArt Prints\nSticker Set\nBONUS: 8-Bit Jesus CD Digipak\n(Shipping included within the U.S.)\nDeluxe Digital Album Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["58 backers", "Limited (42 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Chiptunes 101", "descp": "Everything included with the \"Special Edition Vinyl Press\" reward, plus we'll schedule a two hour long 'master class' session where I'll answer questions and show you how I made the album.

CAN WE REACH OUR THIRD & FINAL STRETCH TARGET OF \u00a330,000?!\n\nWe have reached our second stretch target of \u00a325,000! Thank you so, so much for believing in us and our dream of making this documentary.\n\nWith only 24-hours to go, now is the time for the final push. If you've been thinking about supporting us then every donation (seebelow) will really, really help us push forwards with our documentary to tell the untold stories of Scottish girl bands.\n\nCould we reach our third stretch target of \u00a330,000? It would allow us to do everything we want to make the best documentary possible.\n\nOur next MAJOR GOAL is to actually FINISH MAKING THE FILM in time for launch at festivals like Glasgow Film Festival in March 2022 ...  not an easy task. The average Netflix documentary costs \u00a3300k+. \n\nSo we still need support.\n\nWe have some STRETCH GOALS which, should we reach them, will help us make the best film possible \u2013 something that really does justice to the cause, whilst celebrating the music and the incredible bands behind it.\n\n STRETCH GOAL 1 \u2013 \u00a320k - MET (THANKS SO MUCH)This will help us secure AS MUCH PRECIOUS VIDEO ARCHIVE AS POSSIBLE (it can cost up to \u00a33k to clear one minute of archive for theatrical, broadcast and streaming release. Expensive right?)\n   STRETCH GOAL 2 \u2013 \u00a325K - MET (THANKS SO MUCH) This will give us the chance to include a few more tunes, which in turn, also supports the artists... as well as bring an archive producer on board part-time to help with sorting out commercial footage licenses, royalties, publishing fees etc in order to make sure no stone is left unturned...\n   STRETCH GOAL 3 \u2013 \u00a330K: This will enable us to enlist the help of an animator full time for 4 weeks to create bespoke content for use in the film where the archive that's sadly already lost would have been, bringing the story to life and providing visual representation for the  'movements that might have been' had these women been given the same  support as their male counterparts.\n  We can\u2019t even imagine being so lucky but to  reach these goals but if we did we could commit to preserving a definitive catalogue of  everything that\u2019s out there, from stills, to audio recordings, rare  interviews, TV appearances, John Peel sessions... and provide the best  possible platform for these bands to tell their stories in their own  words. \nABOUT \n'Since Yesterday: The Unsung Pioneers of Scottish Pop' celebrates the songs,  stories and journey of Scotland's all-female bands from 1960 to 2010. \nThis feature-length documentary seeks to explore the social impact of women making music collectively in a male-dominated industry and rightfully acknowledge their place within the history of popular music.\n\nLungleg, by Graham Gavin\nWith over 40-hours of new footage recorded, we now need your help to push our feature length documentary \u2018Since Yesterday - The Unsung Pioneers of Scottish Pop\u2019 in to a bigger arena. This is our little country's perspective on a global issue.\n\nTHESE STORIES NEED TO BE TOLD; THIS DOCUMENTARY NEEDS TO BE MADE\u2026.\n(TW) There are some incredible things about a legion of undersold Scottish girl bands that might surprise you: John Peel sessions, concerts in prisons, cult followings, opening for The Beatles and The Sex Pistols, world tours, \u2018handbag\u2019 roadies, a little guitar cameo from Jimmy Page, even more John Peel sessions.\nThe Ettes - Scotland's first all girl 'punk' band, Edinburgh 1979 (Photo Courtesy of A. Morrison)\n\nThere are also things that, sadly you won't be surprised to hear; a world of sexual assault, getting fired for becoming a parent, being told you\u2019re too old, too fat, too short, too tall or \u201cthe problem with girl bands is that you all just get pregnant in the end...\u201d\n\nA story is always best when it is told by the people at the heart of it; Strawberry Switchblade, The McKinleys, The Twinsets, The Ettes, Lungleg, Sophisticated Boom Boom, His Latest Flame, The Hedrons and TeenCanteen, plus many more.\nSophisticated Boom Boom, by Simon Clegg\nThe McKinleys\nScotland's musical output is world reknown; yet whenever women work collectively, their output is curtailed, compromised out of existence, or just left unsigned. Why?\n\nThe statistics are hard to stomach. The story doesn\u2019t seem to be changing.\nThere is anger, hurt, desire, determination and fierce passion for change. There are movements, campaigns and hard evidence in report form. #MeToo, Key Change, #womeninmusic and Vick Bain\u2019s report on diversity in the music industry. \nWe started this documentary because we want to shine a light on the issues, but also, as hard as some of the story is to hear, we want to celebrate the determination, the individuality, the occassional success, the history of these incredible women, their music and these brilliant bands. We can\u2019t continue to write women out of the history of music. There will be bands and stories like this in every city and country across the world.\nPlease help us tell this story. It needs to be told.\nTwinsets 2018 EIF\nWHY NOW? \nThe music industry may consider itself culturally progressive but at PRS for Music, only 17% of its 140,000 registered members are female (2018). Similarly, 108 (17.5%) of the 616 songwriters nominated for Best Single Brit Award since 1999 have been women. 14.18% of the 12,040 writers represented by UK publishers are women, while female artists make up 19.69% of the rosters of acts signed to labels. This is also an industry that\u2019s been slower to reckon with its abusers post-#MeToo than other art forms.\nLastly, the festival line ups recently announced for 2021 are woefully under representative of all-female acts. In the sixty years since women demanded equal rights in every sphere, not all that much has changed for women with guitars.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to put us and our story front and centre. The game changers, the rule breakers, the iconoclasts, the ones who never compromised. Why? Because the system is broken and it\u2019s high time, we changed the record\u2026\n\nTHE TEAM / WHERE WE'RE AT: \nCo-directed by musician Carla J. Easton (shortlisted for Scottish Album of the Year; member of all girl band TeenCanteen) and prominent Scottish director Blair Young; produced by producer/filmmaker Miranda Stern (one of Scottish Documentary Institute\u2019s New Voices of 2020) and the award-winning production company The Forest of Black. We\u2019ve been soldiering on for four years now with nothing but blood, sweat and tears to fuel the drive. We have over 40 hours of new footage, having tracked down and interviewed and struck up friendships with these pioneers and trailblazers. They have openly shared the highs, lows, heartbreaks and outrages of their chequered musical history. Now we just need a little help to get it over the finishing line\u2026\nWe have invested 4-years of personal time and money into this project. We now need \u00a325,000 or more to unlock the buried chest of archive that lies in television vaults, and license other material to help colour the film to its best potential.\nWe know the interest is there \u2013 we\u2019ve been selected for In Edit festival and we have interest from broadcasters and distributors.\nWe've just received a development grant from Creative Scotland to develop, research and write this documentary, allowing us to employ key personnel and extend our research professionally; however it is not a production fund, and with the prohibitive cost of rare archive from broadcasters, we can't pay for everything out of our own pocket. \nIf we can obtain this important footage and music for our documentary, it effectively releases it in to the public realm, collated nicely in our film.\n\nWe are seeking to raise \u00a325-\u00a330k to go towards the cost of usage rights and licensing fees for the following:\nUnreleased audio from John Peel sessions\nRare TV appearances from, amongst others, Something Else; Ready Steady Go!; Top of the Pops \nStills\nMechanical royalties and publishing fees\nCost of rewards for our Kickstarter supporters\nREWARDS\nEXCLUSIVE MUSIC, MERCH, TEST PRESSINGS AND EXPERIENCES ALL AVALABLE\nLimited Edition Ettes Cassettes of never before released demos, Signed Debut Album TeenCanteen, Limited Edition The Twinsets 7\" Pink Picture Disc, Lung Leg Screen Printed T-Shirt and 7\" Bundle, Private Screening Tickets for 2, Shout Outs in Credits, your chance to be an Executive Producer, Bands Names T-Shirts and Limited Edition Bespoke Film Poster - loads of items in return for your support to make this film happen. \nEttes Live Review, Mark Hagen (supplied by Lindsay Hutton)\n\nIf funding exceeds our original target, the money will go towards our postproduction costs (we will also be seeking additional finance to cover this). The stories are there, recorded, nearly good to go. We just need to get it out there.\nEvery single donation will help us get closer to getting this story out there. If you can make a contribution and share our Kickstarter then we would be incredibly grateful.\nNeedless to say, you\u2019ll have our thanks and HUGE HUGS when allowed. \n\nIt's time to provide accessible historical context to women making music.

After a lot of product development and so many noodles eaten, we are ready to launch it. Backers of the ABO Ramen product launch campaign will be the first to try it and will also help with:\nLab work - all the tests and analyses that are necessary to distribute a new food product. Think things like shelf-life studies.\nRaw ingredients - while some ingredients we do have in stock for our other product lines, some are entirely new and in order to purchase the quantities needed for mass production, it's a pretty big investment.\nPackage development - we know about jars and pouches, but boxes and sachets are new to us. We are working on the best packaging option for our new product.\n\nThe Problem \nWe get it.\nYou\u2019ve been busy with your 10th Zoom meeting today, the emails are piling up, and you\u2019ve only finished half of what\u2019s on your to-do list. The last thing you want is to spend 45 minutes prepping, cooking, and cleaning the dishes when you\u2019ve had a long, tiring day.\nSo you go to the kitchen and cook 3-minute instant ramen. Now that\u2019s yummy and fast. The problem is, you bought that very unhealthy pack from your grocery store, and for a WFH goal-getter like you, you realized you needed something healthier.\nSo now you wanted to level up your ramen game and decided to go for a healthier option. Still, you needed it ninja fast so you tried looking for a quick and healthy ramen fix. Big Problem: that \u201cdelicious factor\u201d is missing the equation.\nWe see you. And we know just what you need:\nWhat if we reinvent ramen so you can have a meal that\u2019s fast, healthy, and absolutely delicious?\nIntroducing, ABO Ramen! \nABO Ramen is a delicious, easy, 100% GUILT-FREE ramen meal kit! The kit will contain miso-based ramen broth seasoned with our award-winning OKAZU condiment and wheat-free noodles. Umami yum!\nOur new ABO Ramen is a great choice compared to regular instant, or restaurant ramen, which are very high in fat and sodium. ABO Ramen is non-GMO, gluten-free (wheat-free), contains no artificial flavouring, and is completely plant-based.\n\nLet's Talk About Our Souper Healthy Miso-Based Ramen Broth\nYou and ABO Ramen FER-MENT to be!\nIf you don\u2019t know by now, We L-O-V-E miso for so many reasons.\nWe are all about adding depths of flavor to food while loading it up with nutrition to keep you satisfied and nourished even on days when you literally have a few minutes to prepare your meal.\nFor ABO Ramen, we are using a rich, flavorful, and naturally fermented miso soup base to give you that much-needed probiotic boost in the most delicious way. Yes to gut health and improving your overall mental and physical wellness!\nMiso is also rich in essential minerals and is a good source of Vitamins B, E, K, and Folic Acid, so much good stuff for your body. \nSo on those Mondayest-Mondays-that-ever-Mondayed kind of days, you know you have a quick way to power though your day.  ABO Ramen Miso goodness all the way!\n\nGame-Changing Lean Ramen\nHow about we take a peek at that fitness essential checklist of yours?\nYoga mat, check. Adaptogens, check. Now add this: ABO Ramen, check!\nWe\u2019re innovating the reasons why people consume ramen, and we\u2019re doing this, one high-protein ABO Ramen bowl at a time.\nABO Ramen's vegan protein noodles are made from a green lentil base and has at least 22 grams of plant-based protein (the final product may have more) which is equal to a glass of protein smoothie (standard smoothies contain 20g to 25g of protein per scoop of powder). Your post-workout meal will never be the same again! \nImagine enjoying a warm, hearty bowl of ramen after every workout to fuel up, recover and build muscles? Talk about ultimate fitness goals & foodie dream combined!\nSo when they say \u201cabs are made in the kitchen\u201d, now you know ABO Ramen is one solid proof to that!\n\nYou Think You Know Umami\n...until you try ABO Ramen.\nABO Ramen has a rich umami flavour \u2013 the key to any delicious ramen \u2013 but unlike other ramens, we use only plant-based ingredients.\nAside from our incredibly tasty miso-based broth, we are adding our award-winning OKAZU condiment to ABO Ramen to create that delicious complexity of flavour and perfect umami bomb that elevates your entire ramen experience. \nYour dream ramen could finally exist in reality (almost, we need your help to make it happen!)\n\nFlavor In, Sodium Out!\nFACT: We are ramen-obsessed like you, but the truth is, most traditional instant ramen brands out there are loaded with less than ideal ingredients including salt-laden powder packets made in big factories. So harmful for your health.\nNo need to worry, ABO Ramen has 80% less sodium than regular ramen. It is also minimally processed and made only from REAL food.\nBest of all, we didn\u2019t compromise that familiar, satisfying, savory ramen flavor you love coming back to. Ahhh, perfect nourishing meal especially in this difficult pandemic time!\nSo next time your taste buds crave some piping hot ramen brimming with flavor, you can drop the guilt because you can eat ABO Ramen everyday!\n\nUpcycled Ingredients\nAs a company, we\u2019re all about fighting food waste and creating a positive impact to the environment. We are a part of the Upcycled Food Association (UFA), which is an organization that elevates food to its highest and best use.\nAccording to the United Nations, \u201cReducing food losses and waste is essential in a world where the number of people affected by hunger has been slowly on the rise since 2014, and tons and tons of edible food are lost and/or wasted every day\u201d\nLast year, our Instant Miso Soup helped divert 2 tons of sake brewing by-products. This year, we want to do more to help people and the planet.\nThat's why we are tapping into the powerful world of fermentation as a technique to create one of our key ingredients for ABO Ramen\u2014 \u201cSake Lees\u201d\nThe art of fermenting sake lees from our local brewery helps us create a food masterpiece that mitigates food waste.\nTHE RESULT: A product that is filled with new and exciting ferments, highly nutritious, has a unique flavor profile, and helps divert food waste\n\nWhat's in the box?\nEach kit contains two servings of ABO Ramen, complete with:\ntwo portions of ABO Ramen noodles, made with green lentil and quinoa (it tastes waaaay better than it sounds)\ntwo pouches of umami-rich ABO Ramen miso soup broth seasoned with our award winning OKAZU miso chili oil\n\nNutrition Facts\nHere's the nutrition facts for our latest prototype. We know it's already really good, but we're trying to pack in even more protein and nutrients, without compromising the taste, of course.\nIngredients\nGreen lentil, quinoa, Organic  miso paste (ORGANIC SOYBEANS, RICE, SALT), Sakekasu, OKAZU (SUNFLOWER OIL,  SESAME OIL, GARLIC, MISO PASTE {ORGANIC SOYBEANS, RICE, SALT}, TAMARI  SOY SAUCE {NON-GMO SOYBEANS, SALT, SUGAR}, ORGANIC CANE SUGAR, CHILI  POWDER, WHITE SESAME SEEDS, CHICKPEA FLOUR), salt.\n**Some ingredients may not be present in the final product, but no new ingredients will be added to this list.**\nRewards\nAs a company, we are very proud of our products, we consider them our work of art. Our community continues to inspire us to make vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO products that also have a positive impact on the environment.\nAs our thank you for your support, our backers can enjoy our Sofi Gold Award 2020 OKAZU condiment, our food-waste diverting Instant Miso Soup, our wild organic ceremonial grade ABO Matcha and immerse in a special cultural experience called \u201cKintsugi Class\" or the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold.\n\nOur Award-Winning OKAZU CHili Condiment (Chili Miso, Curry and Spicy Chili Miso)\nOKAZU is an umami-rich chili, miso, and sesame oil-based condiment often eaten with rice in Japan, which can also be used to top chicken, burgers, fish, eggs, potatoes, and more.\nUse it as a marinade or as an ingredient in your own homemade salad dressing, this condiment is versatile and we encourage you to experiment.\nOKAZU gained an initial following at farmers' markets in Toronto and has been featured in The Toronto Star, The National Post, Toronto Life, FoodiePages, and is a winner of the Foodie Pick Awards and prestigious gold Sofi Award winner in 2020.\nOur Healthy and Delicious Instant Miso Soup (Original, Black Pepper, Chili)\nOur Instant Miso Soup is made with nutrient-rich sakekasu, the by-product of making Japanese sake. In Japan, miso soup is something we eat everyday, usually in the morning, to keep a healthy and nutritious diet. \nAbo Matcha: Organic, Ceremonial grade Uji matcha\nThis is the best matcha you will every try. It\u2019s not just about an organic certification, but rather it is a philosophy to live with and preserve our Mother Earth.\nABO Matcha is certified organic in Canada, USA, and EU, but it is so much more than \u201corganic matcha\u201d. It is grown in Wazuka town, in the Uji region of Kyoto, Japan where tea farming has an 800 year history, starting during the Kamakura-era (1185-1333AD). The area\u2019s tea became known as \u201cUji-matcha\u201d and is of such high quality that during the Edo-era (1603-1868AD), it was reserved for consumption by the Emperor. Currently, Wazuka produces 50% of all tea produced in Kyoto, also Wazuka produces 40% of Uji-matcha.\nSpecial Collaborator\nWe are offering a very special kintsugi experience as part of our pledge rewards. \nYoshiko sensei was our pottery teacher in Tokyo and she also teaches kintsugi, the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold. Supporters who select this pledge for this reward will have a private online class with Yoshiko sensei. All the required materials for the class, including some broken antique pottery, will be supplied to the participant beforehand.\n\nAllocation of funds raised (plus if it's over)\nTo bring ABO Ramen to market we need to do some final testing and scale up production. Your Pledge will be used for necessary lab tests, such as a shelf-life study. It will also help us invest in the ingredients and packaging we need to launch.\nIf this campaign exceeds our target of $10,000CAD, we will also accelerate our wholesale distribution plan, start work on a new flavour, and enhance our community outreach by developing more recipes and other fun ramen-related content.\nDelivery Timeline\nWe expect to start shipping rewards by the end of August 2021.\nAbout Abokichi\nThe launch of ABO Ramen follows our exciting gold Sofi Award in 2020 for our OKAZU chili miso oil! We love that people enjoy and eat our products every day, and we hope you will be among the first to eat our delicious, healthy ABO Ramen.\nAbokichi is dedicated to sharing the creativity which can emerge when different cultures interact. Abokichi  means \"Fortunate Avocado,\" a coinage from \"abogado\", a South American fruit which has found a place in cuisines all over the world, and \"kichi\" which means fortunate in Japanese, to express the blessing of the diversity of different cultures in the world.\n\nOur Team\nJess, Fumi, and Bobby\nThe Abokichi story story began when we, Jess and Fumi, met in Tokyo, fell in love, and enjoyed eating our way through the city. After relocating to Toronto, we decided to start a business to share some of the delightful tastes and traditions of Japan with a North American market. Abokichi started out selling at farmers markets, then opened a small brick and mortar shop, and eventually focused on delicious and high quality grocery products. Along the way we welcomed Bobby to the team. He is in charge of  production and logistics.\nToday, the three of us entrepreneurs work tirelessly, along with our dedicated team, to deliver you healthy and delicious Japan-inspired food.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProject is Delayed or Fails to Launch\nThese are common risks when producing any new product.

My name is Alia Synesthesia, I am an operatic classically trained singer and a one-woman chaotic powerhouse. I am a composer, performer, multi-instrumentalist, designer and developer. I run live/stream series called Horror & Opera where I perform operatic/instrumental improvisation to public domain horror films LIVE or via twitch streams online. I have been running Horror & Opera since 2019. \nOn April 30th 2021, I performed a live Horror & Opera twitch stream where I showcased my original score of Haxan (1922). The event received incredibly flattering feedback, and I decided to organize this Kickstarter campaign in order to create a professional, studio-quality re-scoring of Haxan and offer my soundtrack on DVD together with the film, since Haxan is in public domain. \nWhy so cheap? \nI do everything myself: operatic singing, instruments (cello, bass, drums, synth), production and design. All I need is time, since, like many others, I work full-time to make the ends meet, and I would greatly appreciate time off work to bring this project to fruition.  \nWhat's in it for you?\nA lot of things! First and foremost, you are supporting a one-woman powerhouse! But secondly, you get some neat perks too.  \nWith $5 pledge you get an official 'Thank You' and a zip with fantastic Haxan wallpapers made by yours truly.\nWith $15 pledge, you get a  re-scored digital version of Haxan + soundtrack download card. You can watch the fantastic restored version of the film with the new soundtrack  OR listen to my soundtrack separately on your preferred device.

Her film\u2019s breezy wit and pastel color palette disguise dark truths about national identity, gender, and coming-of-age, making it the first essential road movie about the TikTok generation.\nOn the edge of adulthood, Alma leaves her mother's home in the Netherlands and travels to her native Bosnia to visit the father she's never met. From the start nothing goes as planned. Her cousin gives her a frosty reception and mocks her easy life in the West. At the same time undeniable sexual chemistry leads Alma into a passionate affair with her cousins' best friend. As the obstacles mount, Alma stays fearlessly determined to follow her plan and find her father. She just has to figure herself out first. \nIn its breathless series of hotels, cars, buses, and waiting rooms, Take Me Somewhere Nice captures the dreary, fish-out-of-water isolation of the unfamiliar highway. An endearing update of Chantal Akerman\u2019s Les Rendez-Vous d\u2019Anna, fused with the jazzy cynicism of Wim Wenders\u2019 and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s 70\u2019s road movies, and the stark, sunlit despair of a David Hockney painting.\nAbout The Musician\nElla van der Woude is a Swiss-Dutch, Amsterdam-based musician, songwriter and composer. A versatile artist who scores movies,  has performed in bands and immerses herself in a number of projects, including the turbofolk inspired soundtrack for Ena Sendijarevic's debut feature Take Me Somewhere Nice.\nEna Sendijarevi\u0107 and Ella van der Woude in studio\nAbout the Music\nThis Soundtrack EP is comprised of 4 source music tracks and the credits music of the film. The initial idea for the music in Take Me Somewhere Nice was to make use of diegetic music only, creating music for specific scenes and places - a club in Bosnia, a clothing store in The Netherlands and a car ride with our three young protagonists. \n\"We simply let ourselves be inspired by the kind of music that would be played in these places and situations, and slightly exaggerated the features of the genres we were mimicking. Ena\u2019s guideline for the music was to underline the estrangement felt by the protagonists from their environment, amplifying their feelings of detachment from the different worlds they inhabit.\" - Ella van der Woude.\nBeing Ella\u2019s first time making techno and dance music, the music is naturally a little off and detached from its context, which contributes to giving the scenes a comic and surreal tone. \n The Album\nWhy a 10\"? The score to Take Me Somewhere Nice consists of 5 songs, and is approximately 16 minutes long. It is too much music for a 7\" and not enough music to justify a full 12\".\nThe Budget\nThe 10\" vinyl record is an oddity, and not often released these days. As such, a limited number of companies within the United States manufacture this specific size. Luckily for us we've found Pirates Press. \nBased on their minimum order requirement of 250 copies, Dekanalog has set out to produce a limited edition run of the Take Me Somewhere Nice soundtrack. In full transparency, please see our budget breakdown below: \nAdding in a small buffer for taxes and any unforeseen expenses (and because we like even numbers), we've landed at a final funding goal of $4,000.\nAbout Dekanalog\nLaunched in March 2021 with the release of Quentin Dupieux's Keep An Eye Out, Dekanalog is a film and music distribution company with an emphasis on presenting international titles for U.S. audiences; along with vinyl editions of some of our favorite film soundtracks.\nIn theaters June 11th, Take Me Somewhere Nice will be our fifth film release and first soundtrack release.

It sounds basic, but in live action cinema the camera is often moving either left to right, up or down, in or out. In stop motion animation, this is not so simple. It's almost impossible to move the camera during animation, because it would have to move such a tiny amount between each frame that it becomes unrealistic to achieve smoothly by hand. So motion control rigs and mechanisms provide the solution!\nThe motion control rigs that edelkrone manufacture will unlock camera movement for us, meaning beautifully smooth results. The start and end keyframes are set, and as we animate, it moves incrementally, changing tilt, pan, slide and focus. \nCheck out their stop motion product video below:\nExhibition Night! \u00a313,000 \nTo celebrate the film's completion, we'll hold an exhibition night where you can come and see all the models and sets on display before they head to their home planets! We'll have art from the project, from rough scribbles on notepads through to complete designs, and drinks and nibbles too. Every person who has pledged to the film will be invited. We're looking forward to seeing you there!\nWe\u2019re so grateful that you\u2019re here and considering contributing to the project! We hope the perks will be of as much value to you as your donation is to us.\nReally, genuinely, thank you for supporting us. It means the world, and we can\u2019t wait to show you what we make!\nCasting Call! \u00a311,000  - Complete!\nAt the end of Root Note, our four botanical heroes are discovered by a miner, who tries to communicate with them but fails. Root Note is told without words, just music. What we hear from the miner are shapes of sounds, but no meaningful words we can understand. We will cast a named actor to play the role of the miner for these lines. It will be a fun, exciting little easter egg in the film!\nThe Band - Signed Prints\nGroup concept art - Digital art on paper.

Here is the concept art for our five models on offer, Vine, Rocker, Flatcap, Combover and Miner.\nFive physical animation puppets available: Vine, Rocker, Flatcap, Combover and Miner. Models approx. 6-10 inches tall.\n Root Note is a stop motion short film about how finding your passion makes a harsh world more bearable. \nOn the edge of an arid slate mine, four starving plants scavenge to survive, until they accidentally discover something that allows them to thrive - jazz music.\nRoot Note is a film that celebrates difference.\nAs a strange, purple sun beats down on an even stranger landscape, we meet our four heroes on the wall of an abandoned miner\u2019s cottage.\nThey live in a world where flowers shouldn\u2019t grow. It\u2019s lunar, dusty. Stone and concrete has crushed most of what they need to live.\nEvery day, they watch an endless line of miners march to and from the quarry. They steal and scavenge what they can to survive.\nTheir routine is monotonous. Until one day they lift something unusual - a postcard from home. A picture of four happy jazz musicians having the time of their lives. In their element.\nMusicians - storyboard panel\nOur plants are inspired. They steal and cleverly assemble makeshift instruments from rusty mining equipment: a drum from oil barrels, a trumpet from some old piping.\nUsing the trudging drumbeat of footsteps, their jazz comes alive. Finally, the plants play with life and energy they\u2019ve never had before. They\u2019re loud and colourful. They have a place in this world.\nOur protagonists are a ragtag, motley jazz group. They\u2019re psychedelic and unusual - they don\u2019t fit in here at all.\nTheir character design is inspired by real plants that exist on earth (there are some truly mind blowing ones!). Our characters aren\u2019t going to be a single recognisable species of plant - they\u2019re unique. Each will have distinct ways of expressing themselves despite the world around them - with lots of creativity and flair.\n\nVine | Piano\nVine is the leader of our group. They are a tangle of long tendrils - resourceful, and an excellent pickpocket. Their long vines can effortlessly branch out and lift objects from far away. It is this that allows our gang to gather what they need to survive.\n\n Rocker | Double bass \nTall and lanky, Rocker\u2019s main feature is a mushroomy mess of woolly hair. Even though they are the tallest, they are quite shy. Rocker\u2019s expression is in their roots, which act as arms.\n\n Combover | Trumpet \nCombover is the short, rotund member of the group. Their wispy cactus fluff blows over from one side, giving them the appearance of a combover. Two central flowers give them two bright eyes that protrude outwards.\n\n Flatcap | Drums \n Flatcap is the loud, wild member of the bunch. Their distinctive feature is a large, overhanging floral \u2018flat cap\u2019. Two thin branches give them excellent arms for drumming.\n Miners | Ensemble cast \nWe want our miners to be totally alien - we\u2019ll see them through our heroes\u2019 point of view. It should be as difficult to determine their gender, race, as it would be for us to determine that of a flower. Their heavy overcoats, strange machinery and gas masks hide any indication of who they are. Their uniforms strip them of any individual identity.\nOur story is about the joy we feel when, despite a world that doesn't seem to care, we find our passion.\nWhen the world works against you, it wears you down. The path of least resistance is often to change - to fit in. To live up to the weight of others\u2019 expectations.\nRoot Note is a story about doing the opposite. It\u2019s about being loud and passionate and proud when the world wants you to downplay what makes you you. There is a joy in finding your passion - and that deserves to take up space. It deserves to be heard.\nAnd what\u2019s louder than a jazz trumpet echoing around a cavernous slate quarry?\nJazz is about improvising and collaborating - taking turns in the spotlight. Being in sync with one another. It\u2019s also about relying on instinct over language. Our film is told without words. It\u2019s really important to us that anybody can watch it.\nMusic is such a big part of Root Note - we knew we had to find the right musicians to bring our characters to life.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra\nThe Chineke! Foundation was established in 2015 by double bassist Chi-chi Nwanoku OBE with the mission to champion change and celebrate diversity in classical music.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra, Europe\u2019s first majority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra, made its critically acclaimed debut at the Southbank Centre in September 2015, and became an Associate Orchestra at the arts centre in September 2016. Alongside traditional orchestral repertoire, the Chineke! Orchestra enables audiences to discover work by Black and ethnically diverse composers.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra works closely with its sister ensemble, the Chineke! Junior Orchestra, with senior players acting as mentors, teachers and role models to the young musicians. In its brief and pioneering existence, Chineke! has performed at the BBC Proms, premiered works by Black and ethnically diverse composers, helped to launch stellar careers, including that of Sheku Kanneh-Mason, and won the Royal Philharmonic Society\u2019s first ever \u2018Game Changer\u2019 Award in 2019.\nChi-Chi Nwanoku OBE\nAs well as classical music, many of the members are keen jazz players. We\u2019re so excited to be recording live jazz instruments with members of the talented Chineke! Orchestra for Root Note.\nBen Squires | Composer\nBenjamin has recently had his music featured in trailers for Spider-Man: Far From Home, How to Train Your Dragon and His Dark Materials, as well as writing music for brands such as Superdry, HSBC and The Economist. Primarily, Benjamin scores films and TV, including Netflix\u2019s Tiny Creatures, additional writing for MTV's The Shannara Chronicles and countless short films.\nJuan-Miguel Hernandez | Music Consultant \nJuan-Miguel was a founder and member of the Harlem Quartet, which performed at the White House in 2008. In 2016, he was appointed as a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\nHe has regularly performed with jazz living legends Gary Burton, Paquito D\u2019Rivera and Chick Corea, for which his collaborative disc won a Grammy Award. He has also collaborated on Nora Jones\u2019 album \u2018Broken Little Hearts\u2019, and is a close collaborator of five-time Grammy winner Stanley Clarke. He has played regularly as principal viola with the Chineke! Orchestra and Chineke! Chamber Ensemble. He has a strong commitment to educate and engage young people in music, and has taken part in outreach projects across the world.\nWe're animating this film using stop motion animation. That means every little thing you see on screen will be hand-made and painstakingly adjusted between frames to create movement.\nTo make stop motion look real, you need consistent light in the room. The tiniest change in light (e.g. the sun moving through the day) will cause a flickering effect that gives it away. So after a year stuck indoors, we can't wait to black out the windows and spend our summer in the dark!\nWe want to tell this story in stop motion because of the natural charm it brings to a story. There's nothing quite like seeing an object that exists in the real world move as if it's really alive. Stop motion allows for so much imagination that can be more stylised and 'hand-crafted' than CGI - perfect for endearing plants in an alien world!\nCavetown - Green\nWe have a track record animating inanimate objects! In 2019 we released a stop motion music video for Cavetown's single 'Green'. This story had some similar themes to Root Note - emphasising the importance of equal relationships, mutual respect and understanding. We really enjoyed the challenge of bringing these citrus fruits to life, and to create characters people could identify with and feel for.\nWe were overwhelmed by the response. As well as being watched by over five million people, the film also screened at London Independent Film Festival and Encounters, a BAFTA/Oscar qualifying festival in the UK. It won at the Berlin Music Video Awards for 'Best Narrative', and was honoured at The Webby Awards in the Animation category!\nWe're branching out (!) with Root Note when it comes to style and materials, but we hope the heart and emotion of our stories will stay the same.\nWRITER/DIRECTOR | GUY LARSEN\nGuy is a director born in Southend-on- Sea. His style has been described as dark, playful, irreverent and grotesque.\nIn 2016, he founded Penny4, a production company with a keen interest in making artistic, offbeat films for the internet. Combined with his love for illustration, this led him to explore animation.

But it does have a bit of a reputation for being slow and expensive! One shot - sometimes not even a second long - can take a whole day to animate. That's a lot of time and commitment. \nBut we love it! And so we're only fundraising to cover our project expenses as filmmakers. Mostly costs associated with the materials, the kit needed for such a long shoot and to make our music the best version of itself.

We are in the best possible place to shoot this film - we have a wonderful, dedicated team volunteering their time and skills to make this happen, we have the Penny4 studio and hopefully, with your help, we will have the resources we need to bring our characters to life. \n\nWe can't, however, control Covid. We're hopeful that over the summer, we'll have all been vaccinated and case numbers will be low. But on the off-chance we have another wave, we have to be prepared to push the project back. After all, stop-motion requires handling sets and models!\n\nHappily, whilst this would affect timeline, it won't affect whether or not this project happens. We're so lucky to have the Penny4 studio. We can build our sets and characters and keep them safe for a time where we can all bundle in the studio together again. We don't have to worry about booking out expensive non-refundable locations and camera equipment.

Not only is it the directorial debut of the extraordinary Aramaki Shinji (Bubblegum Crisis, Megazone 23 III, Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045, just to name a few), it was also the first title AnimEigo released, well over 30 years ago!\nMADOX is one of our personal favorites because it not only combines action and comedy with realistic mechanical designs, but also delivers a powerful moral lesson -- \"Read the @^#^@ Manual\".\nWe have wanted to release MADOX in HD for many years, but have been unable to do so because suitable film assets were not available. Everyone thought they had been lost, but in reality the original print was at Tokyo Genz\u014dsho, sitting in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying \"Beware of the Leopard Tank\", wondering why all the other OVAs were getting released in HD and it wasn't.\nAs far as we can tell, the only record of its location was mangled by a manically depressed fax machine, and only the heroic efforts of our crack team of Combat Archaeologists managed to uncover the truth.\nAt which point, we emailed Tokyo Genz\u014dsho and the reply was, \"Yeah, sure, we've got it. Also, we like Gojira.\"\nThe TLDR\nWe'll be doing things in much the same way as our previous Anime Kickstarters, so everything should be familiar to you because you backed those, didn't you? As usual, the goal is to do a definitive reference edition of the title. The Basic Blu-ray will be packed with everything MADOX-related we can dig up, and the Premium Set will add a detailed artbook and a chipboard case. We'll be doing one of our embroidered patches, and may do extra goodies if there is enough interest. As with our previous releases, this will be a limited edition, one pressing, and once it's gone, it's gone!\nOVA Synopsis\nIn the first test of a revolutionary personal battle-suit, the MADOX-01, Ace female test-pilot Kusumoto Elle smashes an attacking tank force and humiliates Lt. Kilgore, Japan's most-macho tank-jockey, in the process.\nKilgore swears he'll get even, and he gets his chance when the prototype MADOX literally falls off the back of a truck in the middle of Tokyo.\nMeanwhile, the MADOX, which fell off the back of one truck, off a bridge, and into the back of another truck, has found its way into the hands of college student Sugimoto K\u014dji. Intrigued by the MADOX, K\u014dji makes the big mistake of fooling with it without reading the manual first, and soon finds himself locked in the suit and zooming around downtown Tokyo.\nUnfortunately, the homing signal the now-active MADOX transmits results in a no-holds-barred response by Kilgore; even more unfortunately, even though K\u014dji doesn't know how to fight, the MADOX does a pretty good job on automatic (it's got \"Full Self Driving\" capability), resulting in a firefight the likes of which the local residents haven't seen since the last time Gojira hit town.\nConcerned about the property damage being caused to some of the world's most expensive real-estate, Elle dons a second prototype MADOX and tries to find and rescue K\u014dji before Kilgore's many minions totally trash Tokyo.\nAnd apart from the attempts to destroy the suit (and it's driver), K\u014dji has his own problems: if he breaks his date with his girlfriend, he will lose her forever -- and he's a tad overdressed for the occasion!\nWill K\u014dji be late for his date? Or will Kilgore make him \"the late K\u014dji?\" And more importantly, is it possible to eat Convenience Store shrimp in a battlesuit? The answers to these and many other questions await you in the 41 action-packed minutes of Metal Skin Panic: MADOX-01!\nDisc Contents\nWe're packing the disc with as much content as we can gather, and the contents will almost certainly expand as we go through production. However, at a minimum, you'll get:\nA new HD transfer of MADOX-01, created especially for this edition, in both the original 4:3 presentation (pillarbox) and a 16:9 version approved by Director Aramaki.\nThe original SD \"Weapons of MADOX-01\" featurette, that describes the real-life weapons systems featured in the show.\nEnglish subtitles, both our regular colored subtitles, colored SDH subtitles, and SDH captions.\nOur English dub, with SDH captions.\nColor and Line art galleries.\nAll the bonus features included on the 2003 DVD release,  including a commentary track, two interviews (one of which is mostly Robert embarrassing himself), the original Japanese documentary, and an Easter Egg IMDB describes as a \"disturbing behind the scenes look at AnimEigo.\"\nList of all Kickstarter backers on the disc.\nNew package art designed by Director Aramaki and illustrated by Mercy Rabbit. Director Aramaki will create 3 draft designs and the backers will vote on the one that will be fully realized. Also available as a limited-edition poster in both JIS B1 and B0 sizes (the latter hand signed by the artists).\n6-panel printed insert containing a poster on one side and a list of backers on the other.\nEaster Eggs and other hidden content. Or maybe not. It'll be up to you to find out.\nAs with all our Blu-rays, the disc will not be region-locked.\nDesign sketches for the new artwork\nA frame from the transfer (click for full-resolution version)\nAbout the New Transfer\nThe new transfer of MADOX was performed under the supervision of Director Aramaki at Tokyo Genz\u014dsho from the original print of the film, and clocks in at almost 700GB of uncompressed 2K video. If the project reaches the second stretch goal, we will also perform a digital restoration pass on the film, doing additional color grading, dust and scratch removal, image stabilization, camera flicker reduction and splice removal. Film grain reduction will not be performed, as some of you have strong opinions about that... :)\nIf restoration is performed, both the original transfer and the digital restoration will be included on the disc. All additional work will be supervised by Director Aramaki.\nReward Levels\nThe @^#^@ Manual (Digital Production Materials) - $5\nOnline access to all the art and other production documentation, plus you will be listed on the disc and Amaray poster insert.\nBasic - $30+ shipping\nThe basic set, a region-free BD-25 Blu-ray + poster insert.

All backers who select this reward will get the same price as the final backer.\nDue to the way Kickstarter works (we can't change the price of a reward after someone selects it), all backers will be initially be charged what the price was when the first person selected this reward ($2500), but we will issue partial refunds shortly after the campaign concludes.\nExample of Mr. Aramaki's shikishi style. For the colored Shikishi, he plans to use colored markers on top of a greyscale Shikishi..\n\n\nAdd-ons\nWe have a tradition of producing limited-edition bonus \"goodies\" with our sets, available only to backers. They vary from set to set (we tend to do weird things backers suggest), but one thing we always do is a commemorative embroidered patch. For the Unobtainium Edition, we're going to do posters and a \"RTFM\" patch. Is that \"Read the @^#^@ Manual\" or \"Run the @^#^@ Mecha\"? You decide.\nThe patch and posters are available as an add-ons.\nIf you have an idea for a fun item, let us know. If enough of your fellow backers want one, and it won't hasten Robert's inevitable descent into madness (too much), we'll make it!\nStretch Goals\nWe're going to try something a little different this time. We've developed a menu of stretch goals, and each $25,000 raised in addition to the basic goal of $50,000 will allow the backers to collectively allocate a point towards menu selections.\nDuring the campaign, we are running a public poll so everyone can express their preferences and see what menu items are the most popular. Then, after the campaign, we'll have a private vote by the actual backers of the project to decide the final preference order (and since Robert is a voting systems nerd, we'll use his favorite system, Wright-STV)\nRegister your preferences in the poll here\nThe Current Menu\n New Commentary featuring Director Aramaki, Yamane Kimitoshi, and Koizumi Satoshi. (1 point)\n Digital Restoration Pass. The resulting restored version will be included on the disc in addition to the original transfer. (2 points)\n Madox Redux. It turns out there's a scene with an animation mistake that Director Aramaki would like to fix. We'll hire him to do so, and make any other tweaks he deems necessary. These changes will be incorporated into the restored version, and we'll create a special feature that A/B compares the changes. (2 points)\n New Trailer. Director Aramaki wants to create a new 90 second MADOX-01 trailer, with new original music and sound effects. Are we going to have to tell him \"no?\" Well, are we?! (3 points)\n Shipping Fees\nWe have World-wide English-language rights, excluding Japan, including orbits gravitationally bound to the Earth (seriously!). The ongoing drama that is Brexit has made it difficult for us to provide EU-friendly shipping, and we also have to charge VAT on UK sales now. Thus, the situation for International Backers is as follows:\n Canada: We will ship from a Canadian warehouse or direct from the USA using DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping; the shipping fee includes all customs duty, taxes and fees.\n UK/EU: We will ship from a UK warehouse or direct from the USA using DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping; the shipping fee includes all customs duty, fees and VAT (and is higher for this reason). \n Everywhere Else: We will ship from the USA; you will be responsible for any customs duty, taxes and fees.\nCurrently estimated shipping costs for the blu-rays:\n US: $5 for Basic sets, $7 for everything else.\n UK/EU: $25 for Basic sets, $30 for everything else.\n Everywhere Else on Earth, except Japan: $20 for Basic sets, $25 for everything else. \n Everywhere Else not on Earth: contact us for a quote.\n Japan: Don't contact us for a quote. We can't ship to Japan.\nCurrently estimated shipping costs for the posters:\n US: $10 (Priority Mail Service).\n Everywhere Else: contact us for a quote after the campaign; these items are too big to ship by USPS International First Class!\nEU customs rules are changing in Summer 2021, and we're not quite sure right now how this is going to affect shipping logistics. If it turns out we have to ship directly without DDP service, we will refund EU backers the appropriate amount to move them into the \"Everywhere Else of Earth\" category). Similarly, if something happens that significantly reduces our shipping costs, we'll make an adjustment.\nQ&A\nWhy is it the Unobtainium Edition?\nFirst, because for the longest time, the print was unobtainable. Second, because when this limited-edition goes out of print, it will become unobtainable. And finally, to build a MADOX, you need unobtainable materials. \nHow are you making the 16x9 version?\nThe raw resolution of the film transfer is 2400x1743 pixels, but as you can see from looking at a raw frame of the transfer, not all of that is actual image. For the 4:3 version, we find the largest 4:3 region of each film reel that always has image in it and scale it down to 1440x1080. For the 16:9 version, we find the largest rectangle on each film reel that always has image in it, and scale down it so it is 1920 pixels wide. This results in an image that is more than 1080 pixels tall, so for each shot in the film, we pick the 1080 pixel segment that results in the most pleasing presentation. In both cases, the film transfer resolution is higher than Blu-ray resolution, so we are always downscaling, never upscaling.\nThe 4:3 version has the full original presentation of the film, while the 16:9 version crops off a bit at the top and bottom of each frame, but presents the remainder at a higher effective resolution.\nOriginal 4x3 presentation\nFull transfer image with maximal 16x9 centered framing\nFinal 16x9 framing (adjusted vertically to maximize interesting image; in this case, so you see Kilgore's chin)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we should be able to meet or beat release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays. In particular, one side-effect of the excellent feedback we get from backers is that we expect a certain amount of \"feature creep\" as people come up with great ideas that \"simply must be done\", and these tend to stretch the schedule a bit.\n\nOur policy is that when a critical-path item causes a delay, we use that extra time to try and improve other aspects of the project. All of our previous projects have ended up shipping a few months late (each time for new and \"interesting\" reasons), but what we ended up shipping was better than what it would have been if we'd hit our schedule.\n\nThe bottom line is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- we typically post updates at least once a month.\n\nSome people tell us that the stories we recount about things going wrong are one of their favorite parts of our projects, but we promise we don't do it deliberately. We don't have to fake incompetence, it just comes naturally (for Robert, anyway).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The @^#^@ Manual", "descp": "High-resolution artwork, settei, and more.

BulletVille is going to become a reality thanks to you. \n\nAlthough time left is limited, we prepared a stretch goal for the campaign. \nIf we reach $125k, we will design a hero through a polling system with our backer community!! We are very excited to think about what the result could be!\n * Pre-alpha footage captured in-game.\n\n\nBulletVille is a badass, brutal, fun, fast-paced third-person parkour hero shooter & platformer inspired by the classic team arena shooters of the past, mixed with modern game mechanics, featuring unique parkour movement, hero classes, vehicles, tons of guns and many game modes for unlimited hours of gameplay.\nBulletVille is currently planned for release on PC and Mac, PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and mobile (iOS, Android).\n\nWant to get a feel of the game? \nYou can play a teaser of the Alpha 1.0 on G.ROUND.\n\nAnd join BulletVille's 150,000+ fan base?\nHave a look at our Discord server.\n\n\n\nBulletVille borrows inspiration from many great games to create a new, unique experience.\n\n Frantic shooting gameplay from games like Quake 3 Arena\n   Diverse cast of game modes like Overwatch\n   Character progression from games like Paladins\n   Third-person high mobility from games like Warframe and Infamous 2\n   Vehicle combat from games like Borderlands 2 or Battlefield\n And much more in development to keep your eyes on!\n\nFrom bandits to robots to cats in boxing gloves, vagabonds and marauders of any shape and size are welcome on New Montana! Choose your hero, master their abilities, and blow new holes in your enemies with their unique weapons and play-styles!\n\n\u201cHand over your booze, your money, and your guns. In! That! Order!\u201d\nThe reigning king of the biggest bandit clan this side of the District. Formerly a top surgeon on Earth, Hunter Cassidy\u2019s life came crashing down around him when bandit loan sharks from New Montana killed his wife and daughter. In a drunken rage, he hijacked a shuttle, took his revenge, murdered the bandit clan\u2019s leaders, and assumed command of the whole clan as its new king - just in time to wake up with the worst hangover he ever had!\n\nHunter's Gameplay\nDue to his troubled past, Hunter has learned clever ways of getting revenge. He\u2019ll act as a comfortable place for most players to immediately pick up and play, with Recon capabilities and powerful weapons. His signature Rocket Launcher is his pride and joy, but he might break a bottle over your head instead just for fun.\n\n\u201cA dance costs extra, but I\u2019ll kill you for free.\u201d\nThe sharpest shot to ever sling suds. A troublesome teenage genius, Lacey Rose\u2019s bad attitude and cynicism turned an honest life of jumping between minimum wage jobs into a living nightmare. Her zeal for life returned when she heard of the Treasure Rush on New Montana, where she now works as a saloon dancer and moonlights as a treasure hunter, on the hunt for a fortune or an awesome death.\n\nLacey's Gameplay\nLacey brings her moves from the Saloon to the Battlefield and will dance, roll or slide her way to victory. Before the dust settles, she\u2019ll wrangle her enemies or force them to break out in a boogie before ending their misery with her trusty Shotgun.\n\n\"SOMEBODY GET GEARTOOTH A GUN TO EAT!\"\nGeartooth is the human equivalent of a cannonball-sized bullet shaped like a fist, with a heart of gold to fall back on. Once the most decorated (and most cybernetically-repaired) commando in the entire galaxy, a life without war left Geartooth with a whole in his soul. He\u2019s come to New Montana seeking the thrill of warfare, the bounty of treasure, and the constant sound of gunfire.\n\nGeartooth's Gameplay\nTrue to his backstory, the man really does eat bullets and brushes off explosives like flies. Being in the military, he\u2019s seen some tough things, but always knows how to bring up the morale of his troops. And if he ever gets lonely in the jungle, his AI turret, \u2018Milkshaker\u2019 is there to keep him company and watch his 6.\n\n\u201cWill he scratch? Will he bite? WILLY PUNCH!\u201d\nA cat in boxing gloves with an addiction to monster hunting (yes, you read that right.) Willy\u2019s existence is, in and of itself, a complete head-scratcher. Is he the last in a long line of universally renowned beast-hunting cats? Is he the end result of some mad scientist\u2019s experiments that escaped and embarked on a never-ending quest to rid the universe of monsters? Is he God itself? Nobody knows, and if you ever get close enough to ask him, he\u2019ll put out your lights before you get the chance.\n\nWilly's Gameplay\nWilly is little but he packs one hell of a punch. His weapons are his Left and his Right and he truly only wants to hurt people. Watch out for his pounce and uppercut, but you may as well call the morgue yourself if you piss him off. Sometimes he\u2019s cute and will take a nap anywhere though. Strange fella.\n\n\u201cWould you be willing to fill out a survey regarding your death?\u201d\nThe greatest mind in the universe with the heart of a child and an endless hunger to discover the meaning of life, through the study of death. Born in the heart of a dying star with no known creator, the Angel is a hyper-advanced AI entity based on New Montana for one reason: to satisfy her unexplainable fascination with life itself, by gathering test subjects for her experiments into death.\n\nAngel's Gameplay\nA flying Cyborg with precision aim and a real threat to life as we know it, Angel holds celestial power inside of her waiting to burst out. She has some extra mobility layered in to make her quite agile which helps get into great vantage points to give her Sniper Rifle a deadly angle..\n\n\u201cI was born to murder. I learned to charge for it.\u201d\nThe highest-rated, highest-priced assassin in the universe. The last surviving Mechassassin created by a pseudo-religious terrorist sect called the Order of the Dark Light, K-05 racked up over 1400 kills before they said their first word. Due to a glitch in their programming that causes them to envision the extinction of all life in the universe, K-05 currently plots to fund a campaign of omnicide by working as the galaxy\u2019s most expensive mercenary.\n\n K-05's Gameplay\nA killer that moves in silence, or can disappear in a puff of smoke, K-05 is a master of Murder. His Katana slices through enemies quickly from close, but his Sai can pin targets down at range and pull himself in to get a swift kill. The Premier Assassin in New Montana.\n\n\u201cMurderdogs! Murderdogs! Murderdogs!\u201d\nRunaway child of the universe\u2019s richest man and last of the Murderdogs. Born the last of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s daughters, Orion found an escape from her extremely sheltered and strictly-controlled life by joining the New Montana Murderdogs, a hyper-derby team known for their violence. Soon becoming their star player before she was discovered, Tarvos bought and immediately dissolved the team to spite his daughter, for which she burned down his estate and escaped into the night, vowing to take on her own father and everything with his name on it.\n\nOrion's Gameplay \nOrion has a strong penchant to burn everything!..and skate around peacefully while the fire rages. When you\u2019re on her team, she\u2019ll get you back in the fight quicker in multiple ways and when she\u2019s not burning or smoking the place out, she\u2019s picking up penalties for aggressive behaviour.\n\n\u201cToday is the greatest day since yesterday!\u201d\nThe biggest bucket of bolts that ever blew a hole in the hull of a Hypercruiser. A hobby project by an apprentice roboticist/mechanic, Trax is made of all the scrap her creator Trish \u2018liberated\u2019 from bandit vehicles, with a couple of heavy assault cannons thrown in. His personality upload was interrupted by an invasion of Trish\u2019s workshop, during which the half-baked happy-go-lucky Trax blew away the assailants. He now eagerly jumps at the chance to join in the fun with his murderous friends while Trish is away.\n\nTrax's Gameplay\nExplosive weapons for hands means some great zone control tools at Trax\u2019 disposal. Being made of car parts, Trish made sure to keep power under the hood and some Spy Gadgets just in case. If the rocket hands weren\u2019t enough, he\u2019s got a few more tucked away for the right time.\n\nGrind on rails, climb up walls, commandeer vehicles and mechs\u2014if you\u2019re standing still, you\u2019re doing it wrong! With a million ways to move around the battlefield, you\u2019re sure to find a method of murder that\u2019s right for you!\n\nSlide\nDouble Jump\nHop over rails\nRun on walls\nClimb walls\nSlide down walls\nGrind on rails\nGrapple swing\nGrapple Pull\nGlide\nHang onto ledges\nTeleport using portals\n\n\n\nNew Montana is a beautiful place to live, once you look past the constant death and destruction. Fight in the city, in the desert in the sky, or on the moon, among other scenic vistas! Don\u2019t stop to take in the landscape, or else that castle might be your crypt!\nTarvosham (Old London)\nIn its glory days, Tarvosham was the pet project of Tarvos Wayward, whose love of Victorian aesthetics inspired him to design the entire district of New Montana just a short distance from his front door. Powered entirely by steam (generated by underground nuclear power chambers), Tarvosham was strictly for people of class, sophistication, and proper dress sense. On her way out of the burning Wayward Estate, Orion personally lay waste to Tarvosham until its citizens were forced to evacuate. \n\nHigh Stratos (Sky City)\nUp where the air is clear and the hum of the neutron thrusters lulls you to sleep at night. High Stratos was originally designed to host dignitaries and officials from the Union of Galactic Species on New Montana; with features like luxury accommodation, furnished conference rooms, free WiFi, and a two thousand kilometre vertical separation from the planet\u2019s surface.\n\nOsaka-Ku (Nu Tokio)\nProof that gentrification can happen anywhere, even in space. Osaka-Ku was green-lit as part of a business deal between Tarvos Wayward and macro-industrialist Makemake Gyokai. Gyokai planned to use Osaka-Ku\u2019s economy to buy New Montana for himself, and turned it into a bustling sector for small restaurants and high-rise apartments. However, when Tarvos Wayward began the Treasure Rush and scrapped New Montana\u2019s laws, most of Osaka-Ku\u2019s citizens ditched the planet altogether. \n\nMarauder Mesa (Wild West)\nTechnically not a mesa, but bandits aren\u2019t exactly topography majors. Marauder Mesa started out as little more than a camp for the planet\u2019s first settlers. Once its treasures and history were unearthed, they established Harmony Vale with houses, a general store, and\u2014of course\u2014a brothel.\n\nThe District\nThe District is what happens when the guy who owns the planet you\u2019re building a highway on announces he\u2019s scrapping every law on the planet during your lunch break. The District was originally meant to be an interchange and layover spot along highways across New Montana. When Tarvos Wayward threw all of the already crime-riddled planet\u2019s laws into the fire, the entire construction crew abandoned the site to flee the planet before the carnage began. \n\nThe Golden Wasteland\nBecause of course a planet as worthless as New Montana is half-desert. Don\u2019t let the name fool you; the operative word here is \u2018Wasteland\u2019. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a tumbleweed in this arid landscape. But one thing you\u2019ll find plenty of? Bones. Just below the shifting, never-ending surface of the sand dunes is a graveyard of foolish treasure hunters, mercenaries and people who never learned how to use a map.\n\nCastle of Aarrgh (The Frozen Post)\nEither the owner of this castle died while naming it, or they were just a big Monty Python fan. Not even Tarvos Wayward can explain the existence of this random medieval castle built on a random craggy shore. (Or is it a reef? Maybe a delta\u2026?) The only logical conclusion is that some rich asshole with more time than sanity decided they wanted a castle and spent their life building it. It\u2019s a solid castle, but without a king. Or a kingdom. Or any point to its existence. \nWaypoint Station\nThere\u2019s a Waypoint Station on almost every planet in the Union of Galactic Species; a contract between them and the Wayward Group made sure of that. One of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s thousands of interstellar spaceports, New Montana\u2019s Waypoint Station is built on its moon, Helenia. With space fore even the largest commercial vessels, every Waypoint Station is complete with fuelling points, overnight rooms and a members-only commissary, as well as transports to the planet\u2019s surface. \n\nThe Scarlet Temple (Forest Temple)\nThe Scarlet Temple is a dark red stain on the Union of Galactic Species\u2019 history. Before the UGS claimed the planet that would eventually be named New Montana, it was the base of the Order of the Dark Light, a pseudo-religious fanatical sect responsible for the abduction and slaughter of millions of children across the universe. They built the temple to house laboratories, where they spliced the DNA of their victims to create the genetically-perfect Mechassassin. Only one such soldier, K-05, ever left the temple. \n\nAnam-Ka\u2019Rui (Alien Temple)\nA mysterious, unsettling structure in the heart of the Golden Wasteland. Its name is said to have been whispered by its discoverer, after he fainted upon setting foot inside. Tarvos Wayward has yet to formally acknowledge this citadel\u2019s existence, but theories as to its origin continue to pop up on conspiracy networks across the galaxy.\n\n\nKickstarter-exclusive \"Star Hunter\" skin concept - Make it yours!\n\n3D Glass Sculpture of Hunter\nNOWWA (Now, Winners Announced) is an independent studio run by Yohami Zerpa, which develops casual games for mobile platforms. In 2017, after nearly two decades of developing games for other studios, Yohami decided to go indie and create a game that mixed all his favourite influences from media and culture, ranging from victorian horror to futuristic cyberpunk, talking boxing cats and AI androids, ninjas and pirates. A few months and prototypes later BulletVille was born. Yohami is the main driving creative force, art director and manager.\nNOWWA is comprised by an all-stars team:\n\n Robert brings his AAA experience with networking, replication and server side code, and a vast knowlege of the intricacies of the Unreal Engine, supported by Mohamed \n Lewis polishes the locomotion sets and makes sure everything runs smooth and feels smooth for the players, with an obsessive eye for detail\n Phil and Nicola use their genius in marketing and social media to make sure the world knows about BulletVille\n Garrett works as game designer, level designer and keeps an eye on all tasks and brings structure into the project, with a cool head and a calm hand\n Robbin and Blaze are talented level designers that know how to adapt their creations for BulletVille's high mobility. \n Breiner, Aaron and Siavesh do the rigs and animations\n Joshua, Scott, Russ, Dragos, Alexandr bring the very diverse locations of New Montana into life with environment design and stylized textures\n Siavash is an amazing animator who brings our heroes to life! \n AkiraX3, Jesus, Mauro, Arty work on 2D design, interfaces, banners and logos\n Kyle, Joe, Kevin, Romain and Christian turn the concepts into 3D models, characters and props\n Peter, Crackers, Alexis take care of the lighting and shaders\n Stiven is a talented kid who works on UI and game modes\n Nick uses his long experience with SFX design to make our sound palette unique and distinctive\n Jask takes care of our community, especially the huge BulletVille Discord\nEmmy-winner Oscar Fogelstr\u00f6m creates our lush and rich soundtrack, with collaboration from Murray Atkinson \nMega-talented writer / voice actor Reece Bridger brings life to Trax, is writing every line of dialogue & lore and, last but not least, handles casting and management of other voice actors - our illustrious list includes Aimee Smith, Alexis Monteith, Cassie Ewulu, Daniel Dorse, Griffin Puatu, Jenna Kathleen, Lizzie Hofe, Malcolm Ray, P.M. Seymour, Terrance Drye, Thaddeus Walster, Tom Schalk and Yong Yea! \nAnd Tim watches in the back taking care of admin and finance \n\n\n\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big goals and bigger dreams.\nWe\u2019ve gotten this far bootstrapping the project as a REAL indie game, untarnished by pesky big corporations and dirty publisher tactics, and we\u2019d like to keep it that way!\nWe\u2019ve got private backing that allowed us to get this far, and enough to finish the core game.\n\nHow does this Kickstarter campaign and a backing of 100,000 USD help us? \nWell, the funding will allow us to grow our team and do QA, pay for artists and external developers to speed things up, do more skins, maps, game modes, and heroes.\nEvery dollar above our target will speed up development of the game and extend its scope even more - your pleasure!\nHere\u2019s what you can do to help!\n Like, share and retweet this video (link) recapping our kickstarter to new players!\n   Back our campaign! \nhttps://discord.gg/xP32KCRj", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting highly complex software such as video game code with numerous components has the implicit risk of bugs that cannot be easily identified or fixed. But our indie studio team consists of people all around the world who really know what they're doing. The accumulated experience of certainly more than 100 years in game development and the transparency we always provided on our progress with BulletVille is the insurance that you get your reward in time.\n\nWe are self-funded out of personal income and proceeds from casual games we made so BulletVille will be launched in any case, it's just a question of time and scope - your backing will allow to deliver the beta/full version earlier and with more maps, heroes, modes and skins.\n\nCovid is a risk and could slow down development but will not prevent us from delivering BulletVille and the most impacted part is the time and place of the BulletVille release party due to travel and social gathering restrictions. We will communicate according to the further developments.\n\nBy far the biggest risk, which we are also unable to mitigate completely, is\u2014Tarvos Wayward himself. \nGiven his fortunes, he may snap up all available rewards, just to show he can.

THERE'S NO MARGIN FOR ERROR. AS SCIENTISTS, WE NEED DATA TO KNOW WHAT WORKS.\nRight now, in 2021, that dataset DOES NOT EXIST. \nThe answer? A high-resolution LiDAR scan of the Earth's surface, starting with the areas most threatened. \nCourtesy of Conscious Design // Unsplash\nIT SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION, BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THIS.\nAnd, it\u2019s happened before.\nIn 2019, we watched in horror as the Notre Dame Cathedral went up in flames. The iconic spire collapsed and the roof was all but destroyed.\nMiraculously, though, art historians Andrew Tallon and Paul Blaer scanned the Cathedral using LiDAR in 2010.\nImage created by Andrew Tallon & Paul Blaer\nNow, their LiDAR scan is the most comprehensive record of the Cathedral and it\u2019ll be invaluable to the reconstruction.\n WE NEED A SCAN LIKE THAT, BUT FOR THE AMAZON \nWe\u2019ve already lost 50 percent of the world\u2019s rainforests, we\u2019re losing 18 million acres of forest each year, and rising sea levels will make whole cities, countries, and continents unrecognizable.\nUnless we have a record of these places, no one in the future will even know they existed.\nOrganizations like CyArk are doing incredible work to scan historical monuments. But nothing similar exists for the earth\u2019s landscapes \u2013 until now.\nProfile of a LiDAR point cloud from a tropical forest\n\nI\u2019m Dr. Chris Fisher, National Geographic Explorer, archaeologist, husband, and father.\nI was trained as a traditional archaeologist, using methodologies that\u2019ve been around since the 50\u2019s.\nThat all changed in July 2009 in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, when I stumbled across an ancient urban megalopolis \u2013 26 square kilometers \u2013 a lost city with thousands of building foundations. An archaeological site so big that it would take me decades, the entire rest of my career, to survey fully.\nInstead, my colleague Steve Leisz, suggested using a new technology, LiDAR, Light Detection And Ranging.\nLiDAR involves shooting a dense grid of infrared beams from an airplane toward the ground. What you get is a high-resolution scan of the earth\u2019s surface and everything on it. Not an image but a dense 3-D cloud of points, like this:\nPLAY\n\nIn just 45 minutes, the LIDAR scan collected the same amount of data as what would\u2019ve taken decades by hand!\nEvery house foundation, road, building, terrace, and pyramid in incredibly high resolution, representing thousands of people who were born, loved, lived, and died in these spaces. And what\u2019s more \u2013 the quality of these data was not comparable to traditional archaeological research \u2013 it was much, much better.\nI knew this technology would change the entire field of archaeology in the coming years, and it did.\nThe next time we used LiDAR in my work, it became the subject of Douglas Preston\u2019s book, The Lost City of the Monkey God.\nCourtsey of Douglas Preston\nThat book became an instant bestseller (maybe you\u2019ve read it!) but most importantly, it showed the potential of LiDAR \u2013 as a tool for archaeologists, ecologists, and geologists. But also, for conservation.\nIt made me wonder -- what if we used LiDAR to scan the entire Earth? It would be one of the greatest data sets in human history. A perfect record of our planet at one moment in time.\nThat idea became The Earth Archive, a non-profit organization & mission I launched from the TED Stage in 2019:\nTHE EARTH ARCHIVE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SCIENTIFIC EFFORT TO LIDAR SCAN THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE EARTH, BEFORE ITS TOO LATE\nIts purpose is threefold:\n1) Create a baseline record of the earth as it is today to more effectively mitigate the climate crisis. The only way to measure change is to compare two sets of data \u2013 a before and an after. Right now, we don\u2019t HAVE a high-resolution \u201cbefore\u201d data set for most of the planet. So we don\u2019t know how things are changing and whether our efforts to combat climate change are making a positive impact. These data can be used by local stakeholders and indigenous groups to help solve issues of land tenure and conservation. Part of our mission is to help build grass roots capacity to store and use these data at the community level. \n2) Build a virtual planet, a digital twin, accessible to any number of scientists so we can better understand our world today. Archaeologists like me can discover undocumented settlements. Ecologists can study forest composition, tree size, age, and distribution. Earth scientists can study hydrology, geology, and ecosystems. And planners can use all this information to design sustainable conservation areas, the best places to put needed infrastructure, and resilient and sustainable communities.\n Preserve a record of the earth for our grandchildren\u2019s grandchildren so they can study & recreate our lost cultural and ecological heritage. As science & technology advance, they\u2019ll apply tools, algorithms, and AI to LiDAR records collected today, ask questions, and analyze them in ways that we can\u2019t currently conceive of. We see this as the ultimate legacy that we can leave for future generations. \nLike Notre Dame, we can\u2019t imagine how these records will be used, but we know that they\u2019ll be critically important.\nWE'RE MAKING THIS DATA AVAILABLE TO SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD -- FOR FREE.\nThe Earth Archive is what scientists need to more effectively fight the climate crisis\nCourtesy of Ryk Porras // Unsplash\nWE KNOW IT WORKS BECAUSE WE\u2019VE DONE IT BEFORE\nSince founding the Earth Archive, we\u2019ve brought together a broad coalition of partners including:\nInstituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais\nInstituto Colombiano de Antropolog\u00eda e Histor\u00eda\nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Pereira\nMapBiomas \nLeaning on 30+ years of research experience in Latin America, we\u2019ve cultivated relationships with local government officials, indigenous peoples, scholars, and stakeholders who are eager to get started. We are helping to jump-start local grass roots efforts.  In other words --\nWe have the technology, our team is ready, we have permission to do the scans, and the only thing we need to scan is YOUR support.\n\nAn example of recent deforestation\nImage taken from LiDAR showing deforestation\nHERE\u2019S HOW YOU CAN HELP\nEvery $60,000 we raise covers the cost of scanning a 300 km2 region of the Amazon \u2013 that includes hiring local pilots to fly & operate the LiDAR machine, then transfer, backup, and store the data.\nThe more you fund, the more we scan!\n\u2026 and the more we understand, conserve, and preserve.\nThe more we scan, the cheaper it gets. Scanning the entire Amazon will cost roughly $20 million. We will accomplish this \u2013 it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU\u2019LL RECEIVE\nCheck out the side panel for full details on our 10 INCREDIBLE prize backs >>>\nBut first, a preview:\nCourtesy of Chris Sarsgard // Unsplash\nJoin me on a fly-fishing day trip in my home state of Colorado, capped off with a night at one of Fort Collins\u2019 most beloved restaurants.

No one explicitly told me that to be trans was to be othered or hated or laughed at, but they didn\u2019t have to -- it was written into the media I consumed.   \nNan Goldin\nWhen I finally came out as nonbinary, I had already been dating my partner Beck, a ciswoman, for about two years -- it was as much a reckoning with her own identity as it was for mine. Based on a true experience, VALENTINE explores how shifting identities can affect a romantic relationship and test the strengths of love between two people. \nBlack Swan (2010)\nToo often do I see movies with this type of story end in total rejection of the trans character. In our film, we hope to show a more nuanced relationship in all of its complexities, one that feels authentic to our own lives.\nEuphoria (2019)\nAs a filmmaker, I am committed to creating stories that center the trans experience, so that the next generation of trans kids searching for validation and affirmation can see themselves and their stories reflected back to them onscreen. To have that in my own childhood would have been everything -- perhaps I could have spent more time just living my life, rather than imagining it.\nPhilip-Lorca diCorcia\nChris McNabb (Co-Writer/Co-Director/Editor)\nCHRIS MCNABB (they/them) is a Brooklyn-based filmmaker, two-time Emmy Award-winning editor, and Sundance Documentary Edit & Story Lab Fellow.

Also, the narrative of the story is completed. All the animations for the players, the NPCs, and objects are 90% ready. The scenes are 20 % ready. The rest of the artwork is in the process of being digitalized.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge of this campaign is the sound effects. Yet, I\u2019m working on it, and I rely on the technical support needed to deliver a proper result. Once the stretch goal number 3 is reached, the sound effects will be delegated to a specialist. \n\nThe risk is that I\u2019m currently looking for a job. In any case, I\u2019m very good at managing my time and I\u2019m fully committed to this campaign and to give the rewards in the stipulated times. \n\nI\u2019ll notify all the advances of the production to the supporters through the Kickstarter account,Twitter and Instagram.

It has also prevented a lot of charlie horses in my calves because I can stretch them throughout the day.\u201d - Tysons Grandma\nLUNAR is not responsible for irresponsible movement on the mat. LUNAR is not actually made of moon rock and gravity is still in play.  Tripping and stumbling on the mat is not common however LUNAR takes no responsibility for face plants caused by irresponsible day-dreamers running, jumping and playing on the mat.\n*Quick Story*\nHey Backers, It's Tyson. I've been working from a desk for the past 8 years. I've been through numerous desk setups and ergonomic options. I've tested almost every option on the market. From standing desks, ergonomic keyboards & mice, balance chairs, exercise balls, height-adjustable stands, monitor arms.. the list goes on and on.\nSometimes during the day, I\u2019d straight up fall asleep, wake up an hour later in a drool puddle on my desk. (It was the classic \"fall asleep at my desk scenario..)\nSo I started doing research on ways to \u201cstay awake\u201d.\nOne of the most common things that were coming up in my extensive google search was the term \u201cstanding desks\u201d...\nI learned they helped with productivity, and STAYING AWAKE.\nSo I ordered one immediately.\nIt arrived in a record breaking 2 days (thanks amazon).\nI earnestly put it together and started using it.\nI quickly learned within about a week of use I couldn\u2019t actually stand all day!\nMy feet would get fatigued and I\u2019d have to sit.\nThis was interesting, and so I did some more research and discovered this was a common issue.\nThe solution I found for this problem was a called an \u201canti-fatigue standing mat\u201d.\nThese have been around for decades, used in tons of commercial applications... you know the ones you see your 5th grade teacher standing on by the whiteboard? (Yeah those ones)\nSo I ordered one, and it arrived in all it\u2019s glory.\nAll it was, was a boring, flat poly mat, black, about 1in thick.\nSo I started using it, and it worked.. somewhat!\nI could stand longer, but not all day.\nI noticed my feet would still get tired.\nI noticed my feet would still get fatigued.\nI noticed I was still getting posture fatigue and my back would ache after a long 8 hour day.\nI noticed my arches hurt.\nThis sent me on a journey of thinking and designing.\nI wanted to come up with something that would allow me to move my feet while working without distracting me.\nI wanted to come up with something that would allow me to massage my arches.\nAnd that's how I came up with LUNAR.\nIt\u2019s a standing mat that isn\u2019t boring. It's a standing mat that also works for sitting. It's a standing mat that isn't flat. It's an active standing mat that helps you stay focused and get your work done.\nTyson started programming when he was 16.. so he was destined for the \"Desk Life\". The problem is Tyson cares about his body and doesn't want all the crazy side affects of the \"Desk Job\". That set him on a journey, testing every ergonomic office product available. That's what led him to create LUNAR.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome of the biggest risks involved with this project are getting the product to our backers on time. Depending upon backer support, manufacturing and shipping time could increase.

I'm Tanja, and I love making games. For the past 8 months I've been working on The Dream almost fulltime, alongside my studies. With yours and Kickstarter's help, The Dream can be completed and released by February of 2023.\nIt is my first project on Kickstarter and honestly, I am both excited and... yes, a bit scared. But I suppose I am not alone. I have you guys!\nThe Dream is a first-person puzzle and aventure game. It's quite simple - everything you need to do is just walk around and enjoy yourself! Both day and night. Well, day and night in the game, of course. You will encounter surprises almost every step. You will search for clues and solve puzzles. Or it may not be that simple after all...\nInitially, there will be a total of 200 puzzles in the game which can be solved in about 6-7 hours. But the more funding I receive, the more content and puzzles I can provide you. Which means more fun, of course. It's completely up to you!\nYou will also be able to walk under water and explore everything. Yes, it will be puzzles there too. Why always walk on land? It's so boring! \nSome time ago I was working as a system developer. That's when I tried to code in Unity for the first time. And I liked it more than making websites and systems for my clients! I wanted to make my own decisions about what to create. Making games gives me this posibility and I suppose that's why I like it so much. Now I am studying to be a virtual reality developer.\nI started making The Dream in my spare time and I soon noticed that I enjoy this more than my studies. Whenever I worked on this project I felt very good. I'm learning a lot in school, and although I enjoy the tasks and the process, I have to be honest with myself about what I want. Therefore, if the project is sponsored, I will focus on it full time.\n\nThe world and the environment is about 95% complete. Now I work with puzzles and I find it very engaging. My inspiration for the puzzles comes from literally everywhere. It's the most fun part of the project. Sometimes I don't even notice that the day is almost over. Puzzles are the biggest part of the project and that's exactly what I'll be doing for the next two years.\nEnjoy dynamic day and night\nEnjoy seasons and weather effects\nFeel no time pressure or stress \nGrab and move things\nDecrypt important messages\nWalk under water and explore things\nDiscover items and solve puzzles\nClick on different objects to rotate them\n  The Dream is planned to release on Steam (Windows, Linux and Mac). You guys, the ones who choose the Early Access tier, will get to play the game earlier then the others and give me your feedback. It will be so much fun!\nWell, it's only me. The strongest team in the world! I code, make 3d models and I do marketing. Believe it or not, I love all of them. Sometimes it is difficult to do it all alone, but since I am not afraid of obstacles, it makes me fearless and strong in front of other problems in my life. And I don't like to give up! It may be why I love puzzles so much. I am an introvert and although I'm quite social, I know nothing better then sitting alone in my cozy corner and working on my game.\nThe Dream is getting bigger and it's hard to focus on something else alongside it. I love this game and I am sure you will love it too so I would be happy to see it finished and see you playing it as well.\nIt would be difficult to consistently work on it, considering I'm studying full time. With enough funding, I can focus all my attention on the game instead. And one more thing. Kickstarter gives me the support of you guys - a strong community of honest people, who will not hesitate to give me the feedback I need.\nI need most of the money to pay my living costs untill I release the game. I will also promote my game. I promise you to pay my taxes. Everyone should.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA big risk is that the project is delayed or worse, not finished. I've seen this in many other projects and therefore I did my best to give myself enough time to complete the game. But it all depends on you, because it would be difficult to drive the project forward without you supporting me.\n\nThe challenge I recognize in this project are the puzzles themselves, which are the core of the game. They have to be outstanding, otherwise the game will feel dull and uninteresting. So, I've done much research to gather the knowledge I need so that the puzzles become engaging. But I will not stop there. I realise that the game can always become better. That's why your feedback is extremely valuable to me.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Tanja Leonova\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI am a system developer and study game development, live in Sweden in a small town next to Stockholm.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Giving new readers a huge 72-page chunk of our bizarre protagonist and the threats that stand between him and his end game.\nWe are fortunate to once again be blessed with the atmospheric and powerful art of future superstar Kris Wantowhy. \nKris has worked wonders in bringing our designs and vision for this dark, yet familiar world to life. \nIf you backed our Kickstarter for issue 1 - you\u2019ll already know that Bete Noir is a twisty journey of shocks and surprises. The Djinn is gathering resources, manipulating old friends and enemies, and settling old scores.\n(Plus he has a cool Robot.)\nWhere does he get all those wonderful toys?\nIssue 1 of Bete Noir was launched on Kickstarter last year and has gone on to garner critical acclaim: \n\n\"Writer Andrew Clemson has managed to create an indie superhero book that feels different from the flood of books we already see in the mainstream ... with a far fresher feeling than I was maybe first expecting.  That\u2019s an undoubted win to begin with but that\u2019s backed up with suitably gritty & atmospheric art from Kris Wantowhy who gives the world a weight that hammers home the twists in the tale.\" - Comics Anonymous\n\n\"The story took hold of me from page one, lulled me into a sense of thinking that I understood the plot, then smacked me back into reality with twist after twist...An incredible rush of adrenaline that you never want to end..\" - Fanbase Press\n\n\"Bete Noir leaves you with a lot of questions which you will find yourself thinking about long after you\u2019ve read it.\" - Pipedream comics\n\n\"This story whirls up like an air raid siren in its pace and structure, and it's maddeningly brilliant...Superbly immersive and exciting Bete Noir is for fans of comics with a dark tone, beautiful sketch and ink art with a story meatier than a bigfoot steak. A series not to be missed.\" - Comic Book News UK\nWe've streamlined the pledge rewards for this campaign to keep things nice and simple.

In the few days since our Kickstarter campaign launched we've had potential investors come forward to fund the series.  Everyone is committed to Mike Nawrocki\u2019s vision and agrees he should retain creative control over the series\u2019 content \u2014 which was our main reason for choosing Kickstarter vs. traditional investor funding.  As a result, we are suspending this Kickstarter campaign and hope to have more great news to share with you soon.\nFor all the latest updates and exclusive clips, please join our mailing list at www.deadseasquirrels.com.  And for more information on potential investment opportunities and/or for general questions, please email us at info@deadseasquirrels.com.\n\nTHE STORY:\nIt's a squirrelly age we're living in... and we need new heroes. THE DEAD SEA SQUIRRELS tells the story of Merle and Pearl, two 1st century squirrels from Israel who\u2019ve been preserved in sea salt in a cave alongside the Dead Sea. When 10-year-old Michael discovers them 2000 years later and sneaks them home in his backpack, hijinks ensue after this salty couple reanimate and take their new friend on adventures full of action, humor, music, and character-building lessons. \n I'm Steve Taylor, and as producer of The Dead Sea Squirrels I've convinced my longtime friend Mike Nawrocki that Kickstarter is the best way to fund it. Why? Because it's way more fun building a community on Kickstarter than pitching the concept to soulless entertainment conglomerates who would then become Mike's boss. And besides boatloads of money, what have they got that we don't? So put your paws together and let's bring The Dead to life!\nHere's Mike to tell us more... \nWhen I co-created VeggieTales with Phil Vischer in 1993, I never imagined the impact our stories and characters would still be having three decades later. From Silly Songs with Larry and 3-2-1 Penguins! to our theatrical movies Jonah and The Pirates Who Don\u2019t Do Anything, it\u2019s been quite a ride. But I\u2019ve always dreamed of launching another series that taught biblical values in an entertaining way\u2026 and maybe this time featuring characters with actual arms and legs and\u2026 paws?\nEnter The Dead Sea Squirrels, my new book series that launched in 2019. The response has been incredible, with Book One now in its third printing. I knew all along I wanted the stories in these books to come alive through animation, and to create another resource for parents to get their kids excited about the Bible.\n But animation is expensive, and (despite what the internet says about my very inflated net worth) I don\u2019t have anywhere near the financial resources to fund a new series myself. In fact, I\u2019m currently making a living as a professor at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee \u2014 where I teach film and animation in our excellent School of Theatre and Cinematic Arts. What to do?\nMy colleague Steve Taylor \u2014 who continues to make music and films while overseeing our school \u2014 had an idea. What if our animation program, founded by renowned Disney animator Tom Bancroft, created the series with us? Tom and his faculty of professional animators could work alongside our top students (who we would pay to work while they're still in school), and the combination would create world-class animation.\nTom Bancroft with students in Lipscomb's Animation lab\nLipscomb Animation major Zoe Fitzhugh on the job.\n Then we could partner with our friends at Mukpuddy Studios in New Zealand to beautifully craft much of the final animation. \nAnd as a bonus, each episode would feature an original song \u2014 assuming you like all those Silly Songs I\u2019ve written through the years \u2014 like this one I wrote with Steve... \nPLAY\n\nHow do we know this will work? Because we\u2019re weeks away from finishing the pilot episode. It was funded by some generous donors who asked, \u201cCan you pull this off?\u201d\nYes we can.\nWanna make history as a Founding Backer who brought The Dead Sea Squirrels to life?\nEven better, wanna see what it\u2019s gonna look like? \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nBut wait! There's more! While the majority of your donation goes to producing the series, we've lovingly crafted these soon-to-be-priceless collectibles as a thank you for your generosity, including...\nTo commemorate your role in bringing \"The Dead\" to life, we'll personalize this official certificate with your name or the name of a loved one and email it to you as a .pdf file. And unlike a college diploma, this one comes with minimal debt.\nBecause stickers go with everything: laptops, mirrors, sleeping foreheads..\n\n When worn in public, this functions as: 1) a secret handshake between backers (without the need for a post-shake hand sanitizer); or 2) a conversation starter that typically begins with, \"Why is there a dead squirrel on your lapel?\"\nThe traditional \"Dead Sea Squirrels\" design features our ready-for-adventure cast of characters posed deep inside a mysterious cave. \nThe less traditional \"We're Not Dead Yet!\" design \u2014 available in black and pink \u2014 is sure to turn heads and prompt questions like, \"Are those squirrel skeletons on your shirt?\" and \"Why are there squirrel skeletons on your shirt?\"\nAll shirts available in Youth sizes XS, S, M  & L and Adult sizes S, M, L, XL & 2XL\n We've assembled the first six books of the series into a boxed set that is being offered exclusively to our backers and will be lovingly signed by author Mike Nawrocki. And as a special bonus, we're including the time to read them.\nWe've hired Master Plush-maker Gregory Autore to design life-sized (10\") Merle and Pearl plushies so adorable that you may want to get them insured. (Merle shown above. Pearl is still being lovingly crafted.)\n\n Because if you pledge for the Complete Squirrel Works package, wouldn't you feel cheated if it didn't arrive in its own nut case?\n\n Are these premium perks more expensive? They sure are! But if you've squirrelled away a few extra (metaphorical) nuts this season, you could do worse than use them to teach and delight children.\nHigh quality animation is expensive, and depending on the studio and the content it can cost from $10,000/minute to over $1mil/minute. With the help of our faculty, students, and our partners at Mukpuddy Animation Studio, we've reduced those costs to make our series more affordable. But we need your help to make it happen!\nOur goal for the first 6 episodes (approx. 22 minutes each) is $1.2 million. \nPLAY\n\nAnd what if we exceed our goal? Do we dare dream even bigger?  Of course we do! We\u2019ve got a total of thirteen episodes planned (Mike is currently writing Book #10), so if we hit the \"stretch goal\" of $2.88mil, we can fund an entire thirteen episode series!\n And here\u2019s a sneak peak at the stories for the first six episodes: \n And now for your Soon To Be Frequently Asked Questions:\n What if you exceed your goal? We make more episodes! We\u2019ve got a total of thirteen episodes planned (I\u2019m currently writing Book #10). If we hit the goal of $2.88mil, we could fund an entire thirteen episode series!\n Let\u2019s get crazy and think even bigger: what if this campaign succeeds beyond your wildest dreams? We like the way you\u2019re thinking! More money allows us to up the quality even further on each episode, and adding to the workforce allows us to speed up our timeline.\n Speaking of timeline\u2026 what\u2019s the timeline? Once we reach our goal we\u2019ll immediately begin work on Episode Two. The plan is to produce a new episode every sixteen weeks, with the first six episode series ready to launch in Fall 2022. But if our campaign blows up and we\u2019re able to fund the entire thirteen episode series and beyond, we can use the additional funds to expand our team and speed up the timeline.\n Don\u2019t you want the series to be seen by as many people as possible? Yes we do, which is why we hope to land The Dead Sea Squirrels on a streaming platform or network to introduce it to the widest possible audience. But as beloved backers who are \u201cbringing The Dead to life,\u201d you\u2019ll be the first to see the pilot episode, along with other sneak peeks and exclusive content for our backers. \n Isn't it true that most networks and streaming platforms want to own what they present? Yes it is, and when a network puts up the money to have a series made, they ultimately have control over its content and messages. We\u2019re hoping to negotiate licenses to other broadcast and streaming platforms, but the main reason for funding the series through Kickstarter is that it will allow us creative control over these stories so we don\u2019t compromise on quality or biblical content.\n As a backer, when will I get to see the episodes? We\u2019ll send you a secret link to the pilot episode as soon as it\u2019s finished in April of this year. But we don\u2019t want to release individual episodes until the series is finished and ready to premier on a streaming platform (i.e. Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, etc.).\n What if I don't have access to that particular streaming platform? Great question... and we don't know the answer. For those who can't access the series, we'll do our best to negotiate with our distribution partner for some sort of \"backers only\" access portal (for the $25 and up level). Or maybe there's a DVD release in our future (since evidently that's still a thing). But since we don't know who our distribution partner will be at this point, we can only guarantee that you'll have access to the pilot.\n Tell me more about your partners. What is Lipscomb University? We\u2019re a Christian university here in Nashville, Tennessee, and our College of Entertainment and the Arts is rare within Christian higher education as it is situated in the heart of one of the top creative capitals in America, with access to some of the best entertainment industry veterans. Let us name-drop a little: our School of Music is directed by Grammy Award-winning producer Brown Bannister, our Animation program's founder is Disney animator Tom Bancroft, Steve Taylor leads our School of Theatre and Cinematic Arts, and our faculty is full of top practitioners in their field. (We\u2019re so connected that Steve Martin even gave our theatrical performance of his musical Bright Star a shout-out.) Here's a testimonial from storyboard artist Naomi Bethel, who was one of the first to graduate from our Animation program...\n\u201cI had a blast working on the storyboarding team.

The Things-Could-Be-Worse Travel Mug celebrates those long-gone days with a fine porcelain mug proportioned to fit in a cup holder.\nHere are the five qualities I cherish in a travel mug.\n1. Fits in my cup holder and holds up to 16 ounces of my favorite beverage.\n2. Has a tight-fitting, anti-slosh lid with a sliding cover I can open and close with one finger.\n3. Made of porcelain so it\u2019s food safe and easy to clean, even in the dishwasher.\n4. Has a handle.\n5. Decorated with reminders that my tedious and inconvenient journey could be even worse. Specific travel companions include pterodactyls, Sasquatch, giant frog, dubious musician, walking fish, robots, grim reaper, quadrupeds, pirates, UFOs, voracious sea monsters, zombie poodle, assorted dinosaurs, and other menaces.\nTapered profile means a snug fit in most cup holders.\nIf you are already familiar with the Classic and Big Things-Could-Be-Worse mugs (two of my previous Kickstarter projects), here's a drawing to help you understand the shape of this new travel mug.\nSome tedious technical considerations\n* Porcelain, so no metal or plastic flavors imparted to your beverage.\n* Food safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe. (Do not microwave the lid or abuse it in your dishwasher.)\n* Carry the mug upright. The lid fits tight with a silicone seal and will prevent most irksome sloshes. But lid isn\u2019t fully watertight. So you cannot just toss a full mug into your backpack without dire consequences. \n* Decoration can\u2019t wear off. In-glaze decoration means the images are melted into the surface like the porcelains you see in museums (if museums ever open again).\n* Mug will probably break when your chauffeur drops it on the driveway or garage floor.\n* Not insulated. But thick walls hold heat longer if you pre-heat them by filling with hot water for a minute before dumping and then filling with hot coffee or tea. If your beverage gets cold during the journey, consider moving closer to your workplace.\n* Most of our Calamityware porcelain is made in Poland, but these travel mugs are going to be produced in a workshop in China. The Chinese wizards have been producing porcelain for 3,000 years and do a great job maintaining precise dimension, such as when a lid needs to fit correctly.\nThe lid slides open and closed with the lightest touch of your finger. Or you can have your personal assistant make lid adjustments for you.\n\nWhat the critics are saying.\n\u201cCritters make excellent traveling companions!\u201d\n\u201cI plan to use mine at home on the couch. Lid keeps my coffee warm and reduces troublesome spills.\u201d\n\u201cAdds a touch of class to the succession of indignities that is my commute.\u201d\n\u201cCapybara, anyone?\u201d\n\u201cAlso works for milkshakes. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d\nNeed extras? Travel Mugs make great gifts for people with challenging commutes or for someone you wish would hit the road.\nTravel mug doesn\u2019t spontaneously rotate. This image is pure special effects, to allow you to see all the silly graphics. You\u2019re welcome.\nWhen can I expect these rewards? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be traveling with oddities by June 2021. Probably sooner. \n\n********\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because these mugs are heavy, shipping costs are astonishingly high. But acquiring distinctive porcelain that could be treasured for generations might be something that you can justify.\nJust the local neighborhood. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of these mugs will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Travel Mugs there.\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you Travel Mugs during their next trip.\nTracking number. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nFulfillment is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. A good place to find some unusual gifts.\n\nSign up for our newsletter here so you\u2019ll never miss a thing at Calamityware.\n\nDon Moyer, Pittsburgh, February 15, 2021", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors for a production run, I can green-light production right away. I\u2019m using a proven workshop that has been doing ceramics for decades. So technical problems are unlikely. The biggest risk is that delivery will take longer than anticipated because fewer ships are puttering around during the pandemic.\n\nI promise that I won\u2019t stop working until all my sponsors receive their Travel Mugs. My gloomiest prediction is that we will ship by June 2021. I will try to make it sooner.

a handful of scenes from this 2013 graphic novel were later developed into \"world of tomorrow\", including the story of david in the museum's stasis tube. this is a borderless print that measures 8.5x11\" on archival paper and will be signed in white ink: \nNEW REWARD:  dubious original post-it note drawings! i'm going to draw you a picture! i have no idea what it's going to be! seriously it might be garfield eating lasagna. i promise it's not going to be worth anything if you try to sell it in 50 years. it's going to be in pencil on a post-it note. yours might look something like this but who even knows \nyou don't want this\nno but maybe you should pick a different reward\nNEW REWARD: \"it's such a beautiful day\" signed print of bill, \"broken\" in his hospital bed, in a limited edition of 200. this shot was originally captured in-camera, by photographing the artwork with a shard of broken glass beneath the lens. 8.5x11\" on archival paper.\nNEW REWARD: a limited edition signed print of bill under the \"amazing\" stars, from \"it's such a beautiful day\", in a limited edition of 200. \n\noriginal \"it's such a beautiful day\" production art! ...wait, what??!\n\"it's such a beautiful day\" was shot entirely on an old 35mm animation camera. that means all the live-action looking shots in the movie were actually giant piles of sequential photo prints that were photographed one frame at a time under the camera, just like the character animation.\nfor a handful of scenes, the character animation was turned into large prints too: for these shots, my original drawings were scanned and composited in photoshop to add certain special effects, and then printed back out for photography.\nfor the first time ever, we're letting go of a small number of these composited prints, from the \"beings of light\" and the \"works of art\" scenes near the end of the movie. owning the actual physical piece that was photographed for the film, you could pause \"it's such a beautiful day\" at the right spot and point to the frame hanging on your wall, groaning in recognition.\nNEW REWARD: prints from the \"fireball\" sequence are also now available. as bill walks across the red earth, it is enveloped by the flaming sun, leaving him floating in space:\nsamples from the \"fireball\" sequence of production prints\neach production print will come with a signed note, stating, this production print was used in the final photography of \"it's such a beautiful day\", so everyone will believe you.  \n\"beings of light\" production print sample\n\"works of art\" production print sample\nplease note, because these were the prints that were used in the movie's final photography, they are probably going to have camera notes scribbled in the margins, possibly mysterious phone numbers that you should not call, a slightly bent corner or two, or smudgy fingermarks. we promise to send out only the most interesting-looking ones that are in the best shape, just please don't expect them to look brand new. all of the production prints measure 8.5x11\" and are all one-of-a-kind.\n\nNEW REWARD: the original animation photo prints that were used in the final photography of \"it's such a beautiful day\". as explained above, many shots in \"it's such a beautiful day\" were created by shooting stacks of sequential still photographs  under the animation camera, often compositing the images together through multiple exposures or other kinds of trick photography. other times, these \"animated photos\" took center stage, like in this scene:\nas seen on TV\nyou'll receive three original still photos that were used in the creation of the final animated film, along with a signed card certifying that they're the genuine props. we'll make sure to only select the most interesting images for you, like these samples:\nthe still photos you receive may vary in size but are all in the 4x5\" and 5x7\" range. the reverse sides have been electronically printed and dated by the original photo lab; depending on the scene, they mostly range in age from 2006-2009.\n\nBUT WHAT ELSE?\nadditional rewards will be added as needed!\nwe'll also be sending out bonus rewards and surprises to a large number of randomly selected backers. i'm sorry but i will know where you live and there's really nothing you can do about it. \n\n\nWHEN WILL EVERYTHING SHIP TO ME?\nwe're expecting everything to start shipping around june. we'll keep you posted through kickstarter as things progress -- to be safe, make sure we have your correct address on file as soon as possible.\nALSO: if you order a print of any kind, please note that most of those will ship separately, immediately after the kickstarter campaign ends. so expect prints to arrive very soon!\n\nI HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT THEY ARE LESS IMPORTANT SO I WILL WRITE THEM SMALLER HERE NOW\nIS THIS A PRE-ORDER?\nno, like before, if the blu doesn't reach the minimum fundraising goal we'd prefer to skip it. a helpful part of this for us has been to gauge the world's continued interest in physical media, if any, from a safe distance\n\nI'D LIKE TO RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE OF THESE REWARDS BUT I DON'T WANT THE \"EVERYTHING\" PACKAGE. HOW DO?\nif you'd like to pledge at more than one level, kickstarter recommends pledging from a second or third account\n\nCAN I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE COPY OF THE NEW BLU-RAY, FOR FRIENDS?\nyes,  please add $22 to your pledge total for each additional copy you'd like (up to 5), and be sure to make a note of it for us, explaining what the extra money is for, on your end-of-project survey so we don't miss it\n\nWILL THE NEW BLU-RAY BE REGION-FREE?\nyes\n\nWILL THERE BE A STANDARD-DEF DVD MADE AVAILABLE OF THIS RELEASE?\ni'm afraid not, these shorts just don't look right when downgraded to standard definition. here's a screenshot of \"world of tomorrow\" in standard-def:\nWILL THERE BE SUBTITLES AVAILABLE ON THE DISC IN EVERY LANGUAGE?\nright now we can only confirm english closed-captions for the hard of hearing\n\nPHYSICAL MEDIA IS DEAD, WHERE CAN I STREAM THIS STUFF?\nrenting or buying the titles from vimeo is still really supportive, thanks:\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/worldoftomorrow\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/worldoftomorrow2\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/worldoftomorrow3\n\nIT SURE IS NICE AND QUIET NOW IN THIS SMALLER FONT\nyes, yes it is\nWE'RE ALONE NOW, IT'S JUST YOU AND ME\nyes hi\nJUST YOU AND ME\nuh huh\nHERE WE ARE, JUST TWO DUDES HAVING A TALK\nyep\nTWO COOL DUDES JUST HAVING A CHITTY CHAT TYPE TYPE\nhmm\nTYPE TYPE TYPE HA HA HA\nwell i think maybe we've just about covered everything\nDID YOU KNOW I HAVE A DUNGEON\nyes actually we talked about that last time\nWE PLAY LITTLE GAME FOR LONG TIME NOW\nit really does seem like forever\nLOOK I MADE A PUPPET OF YOU.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

After two successful Kickstarter campaigns and thousands of satisfied customers, we\u2019re back with a customer-requested follow-up for sustainable pants that do it all.\nEcoTrek Trail Pants are fully-synthetic tech pants made with 70% recycled ocean waste and a modern, tailored fit. They\u2019re so versatile you can replace jeans, slacks, and outdoor pants with one pair of EcoTreks without compromising on style, functionality, or comfort.\nPlus, the lifetime warranty ensures they withstand all your adventures or you get a new pair or at-cost repair.\nWith 3 colors to choose from - Olive, Charcoal, and Caramel - there's an option for everyone.\nAt LIVSN, our mission is to empower you to own less and live more. We want you to experience all this world has to offer\u2014while respecting nature. As our company has grown, so has our sustainability initiative.\nWe\u2019ve successfully launched 2 pairs of technical pants on Kickstarter and we\u2019re back with our most innovative and sustainable pants yet.\nOur customers asked for fully synthetic pants that can go on extended hikes in both wet and cold conditions - so we got to work!\nAfter a long search, we found a material that can withstand the elements, keep you comfortable, and look amazing while carrying all the technical features you need. EcoTrek Trail Pants are made from Blue Ocean Nylon, a durable fabric that\u2019s lightweight and breathable, and withstands cold, hot, and wet conditions.\n\nOur EcoTrek Trail Pants are even more comfortable and versatile than our previous line of pants and we\u2019ve sent them to REAL people to prove it:\nBlue Ocean Nylon is a synthetic, nylon thread that\u2019s made from 70% ocean waste (specifically old buoys). The used or discarded buoys are recycled locally in Taiwan, which reduces the carbon footprint in the transportation of raw material. Plus, it\u2019s applying for the Global Recycled Standard certificate!\nThe material that makes our pants sustainable is also what makes them so exceptional.\nYour pants aren\u2019t just sustainable and built to last, they\u2019re backed by our Fair Deal Guarantee. We keep all LIVSN pants out of the landfill with our courteous warranty and replacement programs.\nTHE FIT\nEcoTrek Trail Pants fit well on most body types. They\u2019re tailored slim, but definitely not like Portland skinny jeans. They fit well on an athletic build and scale appropriately as the sizing grows, giving room for bigger builds. Sizes top out at 38x34 in waist/inseam. We also designed the roll-up system to be hemmable without any loss of function.\nTHE FUNCTION\nYour favorite technical features like roll-up cuffs, zippered pockets, water/stain resistance, quick-drying, and breathability are all incorporated into what looks like your most stylish pair of slacks. These pants aren\u2019t baggy or pocket heavy\u2014they\u2019re ridiculously stylish technical pants with higher abrasion resistance and less odor accumulation than comparable polyester fabrics.\nEcoTreks have strong reinforcements at all common failure points. The back pockets, front pockets, seams, and hardware are all reinforced to last as long as possible. Use and abuse them\u2014they can take it.\n\n\n EcoTrek Trail Pants are as comfortable as your favorite pair of sweats. The lightweight, breathable material makes them pleasant in even the hottest conditions and the relaxed fit makes them comfortable to wear with long underwear in the winter.\nYou never know what you\u2019ll face when you\u2019re hiking or camping out, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have protective pants that can withstand the elements. Rain, snow, rocks, and dust\u2014EcoTreks can handle it all while giving you convenient technical features.\nOur top customers are climbers for a reason\u2014we design climbing pants that, well, look way better than climbing pants.\nYou\u2019ll love EcoTreks for travel because of their low maintenance and high-end comfort.\nUltimate comfort when you\u2019re in the car for days or on a plane for hours\nLow maintenance means you can wash them in the sink\nLightweight & versatile means you have more room for souvenirs in your luggage\n \nNo need for suffocating lycra in yet another pair of skin-tight cycling pants. Slip into EcoTreks for your daily commute or long-distance trek. The roll-up cuff system with 3M reflective tape keeps your pant legs out of your chain, and the gusseted crotch and articulated knee design ensure there are no rips, discomfort, or unflattering stretched out knees.\nWith abrasion resistance, an EDC pocket, and a zippered phone pocket-EcoTreks make a perfect pair of fishing pants. Hop into a boat or put your waders on over them, you\u2019ll look good, feel good, and have easy access to all your essentials.\nEcoTrek Trail Pants pair perfectly with a button-down for a night on the town, dinner date, or coffee shop meeting.\nIf business casual is your attire, EcoTreks will be your new favorite work pants. No one will look twice when you saunter into work wearing your favorite weekend adventure pants.\nOur mission is to build durable and versatile outdoor clothing that encourages people to wear it more, keep it longer, and spend more time outdoors.\nWith 83% of clothing ending up in landfills or incinerators, we're not out to make products \"just because\u201d or add to the clutter of apparel waste. Instead, we make long-lasting clothing that can be worn in multiple use-cases while utilizing environmentally-friendly materials!\nWhen you buy LIVSN products, you can feel good about where you\u2019re spending your money and what you\u2019re putting on your body\u2014and that\u2019s never been more true than with our EcoTrek Trail Pants.\nBelow are reviews from previous backers and verified buyers on our website.\nWe will have stock for exchanges if you need to order a different size after delivery.\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own EcoTrek Trail Pants.\nAt the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll send you a survey to get your color, size, and shipping information, and deliver your EcoTrek Trail Pants when manufacturing is complete! We\u2019ve delivered on all our previous products and communicate to you every step of the way!\nYou can feel comfortable knowing we are backed by Techstars, \"the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed.\" Our experience going through the Austin '19 accelerator program gives us the tools and guidance we need to be a strong company for years to come.\nThe name LIVSN comes from the Swedish word \"livsnjutare,\" which roughly translates to \"one who lives life deeply; an enjoyer of life.\" This journey started with a mission to simplify our belongings. With less to manage there's more time in the day, and with more time comes flexibility. We know we won't regret more time outside with friends and family.\nWe believe clothing should perform well, look good, be ethically made, be environmentally friendly - and it should last. We want to own fewer, well-built things, and repair them before replacing them.\nWe make good clothing, we make it with tried and true methods, and we make it with high-quality fabrics.\nDURABILITY & REPAIRABILITY\nOne of our main beliefs at LIVSN is that a product that performs well and stands up to extended use is as sustainable as it gets. By buying once and with intention, we're able to consume less. We're designing our products so that when life happens and they inevitably fail, they can be repaired.\nSTYLE AND DYNAMIC USE\nOur way of approaching sustainable style is to use classic silhouettes, refined and tested materials, and clean, modern fits. We want you as the wearer to feel special, but not to call attention to it. What we want is for you to be able to wear LIVSN clothing to the trail, to the pub, or to the (casual) office and not look out of place. When we use technical fabrics and construction, we work to hide those details in a casual look.\nFABRIC SELECTION\nWe choose our fabrics because they were the best available for the job, trying to source organic and recycled when we can. Some pieces here don't utilize recycled or organic materials because we aren't able to hit the scale needed, but we promise we will switch to recycled and organic as soon as we're able.\nTHE END RESULT\nWe hope to come out in the end with something unique, but also familiar. A refined collection dedicated to the highest standards of craftsmanship and mindfulness. We hope you share our values and will help us in our journey to keep what matters.\nAndrew Gibbs-Dabney is the founder and CEO of LIVSN Designs, an outdoor brand focused on making versatile apparel designed to last longer.

Thanks to your overwhelming generosity,  Pine is funded and we met a few stretch goals, ensuring we'll be able to give this story the treatment it deserves! \nThe last 30 days have been amazing. So much so we ran out of superlatives a while ago! Tom and I are truly grateful to be backed by all of you.\nThank you again,\nTom & Najati\nPine is a story-driven game about loss and letting go, told from the perspective of a grieving woodworker. A blend of illustration, animation, music, and sound, Pine tells its story wordlessly through interactions that pull you into the woodworker's experience as he struggles to hold on to his past. \nThe woodworker came to illustrator Tom Booth in a moment of deep isolation following a tragic loss. Initially wary of sharing such a personal work, Tom was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from friends and fans after he posted the first image of the woodworker. Their own stories of loss let Tom know that he wasn't alone in grieving.\nWe created this campaign so we could tell the woodworker's story with the hope that it can be a reminder to anyone dealing with their own grief that they are not alone.\nPLAY\n\nWe come to Kickstarter to ask for your help in creating something truly meaningful and heartfelt. Thanks to your support, we get to tell the woodworker's story! Help us spread the word so we can make Pine even better by meeting some of our stretch goals! Thank you to all our backers that got us here, and thank you to everyone stopping by for getting us even further!\n\nNot quite a video game and not quite a graphic novel, Pine blends mediums to pull you into the woodworker's world.\nInteractive moments let you share the woodworker's struggles, turning Pine's animated scenes into personal experiences. \nThe sounds of the world and an original score will combine with Pine's visual and interactive moments to bring you deeper into the woodworker's journey. \nNorthwest Soundscapes (Skywalker Sound, Sucker Punch Productions) is helping with sound design, and the score will be written alongside the game. \nHere's a list of the updates that can't be reflected in the reward descriptions, as they get locked after someone chooses them.\nBecause you all met the early funding challenge, all backers will get the bonus landscape of the woodworker's valley as a high-res wallpaper for desktop and mobile!\nEveryone who was part of the first 80k will get the exclusive soundscape, too.\nThere will be a total of seven prints to choose from: five of Tom's classic illustrations of the woodworker and two new images exclusive to the Kickstarter. Check out Update #4 to see the five that have been revealed!\nThere are add-ons for print bundles, carving mini figures, and the STL of the woodworkers.\nSee the designs for the carving mini figures in Update #7.\nCheck out past updates to see what's been going on with the campaign. Help us make Pine even better by spreading the word and sharing Pine with friends and fans of graphic novels and games!\nTom drew the first illustration of the woodworker over a long night late in the winter of 2019. It was the most personal thing he'd ever drawn, and Tom almost didn't share the image. \nOriginal sketch of woodworker. February 2019\nWhen he did, the response was overwhelming. Despite being born from an extremely personal experience, the woodworker resonated deeply with Tom's audience.\nThere was an outpouring of support from his fans, many of them thanking him for sharing the image. Some were so inspired that they created truly spectacular 3D models, fan drawings, and actual wood carvings\u2014a few even got tattoos!  \nAs Tom posted more images, the woodworker found his way around the internet. From the front page of Reddit to My Modern Met, everywhere the woodworker went, people wanted to know more about him. It was clear that Tom had found a story that needed to be told.\nIn the spring of 2019 we started brainstorming how to tell this story in a special way. Inspired by titles like Florence and, later, If Found..., we thought a story-driven game would be perfect for Pine.  \nSample of thumbnail storyboards.\nSince then we've fleshed out the rest of the story, storyboarded it, built a few prototypes, worked up enough courage to quit our day jobs, founded a company, and made a lovely version of FreeCell to get some practice publishing mobile games. It's been a busy couple of years!\nPrototyping one of Pine's interactive scenes\nEven with all that done, the work is really just beginning. We think there's a little over a year of work left on Pine, full of drawing, animating, programming, composing music, putting it all together, and testing.\nThat's what the funding from this campaign will allow us to do.\n\nAt our lowest funding goal, Pine will be released on iOS and Android. Release on Steam and Switch are stretch goals. All backers that pledge $5 or more will be able to play Pine on the platform of their choice.\nWe don't want to be presumptuous about how this campaign will go, but we do want to make sure that whatever we raise past our goal will go towards making Pine even better. For more info on the project budget, see the section after the rewards.\n* See the note in \"Risks and challenges\" below about publishing to the Switch.\nWe hope the rewards convey how much your support means to us. Every pledge receives our deepest appreciation and we tried to make each reward a meaningful new way to experience Pine. \nLook below the reward tree for details on the limited rewards.\nThe Backer Forest is our way to say a special thank you to those who play a big role in bringing Pine to life. After finishing Pine, you'll be able to explore the forest and maybe find your name there, along with everyone else who made a sizable contribution to the campaign.\nWe've also added a few add-ons since launching the campaign! The second and third are only available with reward tiers that already have a physical component.\n Woodworker carving STL file: This is the 3D model of the woodworker by Ismael Nieto. We had a couple requests for this add-on so that backers with their own 3D printers could print their own woodworker. For personal use only, of course!\n Additional prints and print bundles: If you've been reading the updates you know that there are now going to be a total of 7 images to select from. These add-ons let you get all the prints you want with your pledge! \n Additional carving mini figures: Our backers in the US can also add an additional carving mini figure to their pledge.\nThese handsome prints will be equally at home in your game room or museum room. Choose from the seven print options or let us know if there's a different image you have in mind and we'll see what we can do!\nThese prints will be signed by Tom and include a personal thank you note from him and Najati. You'll also get thanked in the credits after the story.\nYou're right, that woodworker figure isn't painted ... yet! When we were initially brainstorming ideas for this Kickstarter, the one thing we knew right away was that this amazing figure by Ismael Nieto (@ismaflcl) had to be one of the rewards.\nWe decided to take it one step further by having Tom paint them, making it a truly exceptional keepsake. Like the signed print, you'll get a personal thank you note from Tom and Najati and thanked in the credits after the story.\nTom's artistic talents aren't limited to the tablet. On special occasions he takes brush to canvas and putting Pine on Kickstarter is a very special occasion, indeed!\nThose able to support at this level will get one of five original paintings of a scene exclusive to this reward. These will be gouache on cold pressed paper and will ship ready for display or framing as you see fit!\nOf course, these include a thank you note from Tom and Najati and your name in the credits after the story. And yes, Tom has a lot of painting in store if we get funded!\nAnyone able to contribute at this level will be key to making Pine a reality! Your name will appear alongside the team at the beginning of the story, either as an individual or as a group. \nIn addition to getting one of every print and mini figure, you'll also get to choose one of the other limited rewards, and will of course get a thank you note from Tom and Najati. \nWe'd also like to say thank you directly and learn about why supporting Pine meant so much to you. So, if you're interested, we'll arrange a time for a video call with you.\nThe 8.5x11\" prints will ship worldwide through Fulfillrite, with tracking where possible, and delivered with duties paid where possible. If you live outside the list of countries where that service is available, you will be responsible for additional costs such as taxes and duties. Please check the FAQ to see which countries include duties paid.\nThe rest of the rewards are things we'll be making or packing ourselves and are limited in number. Since we're a small team, they'll only be available for shipping to the United States, with the exception of the Associate Producer rewards, which we'll ship worldwide.\nWe already have partners set up for making the physical rewards. Because some of those rewards depend on art that hasn't been created yet (e.g. the exclusive images for the wallpaper pack and Art of Pine PDF), we'll be developing those pieces first so we can get reward production and delivery started as soon as possible. \nSoon after funding, we'll publish an anticipated delivery schedule for the rewards. We're hoping the 8.5x11\" prints will ship over the summer and we're targeting shipping everything else before the holidays season of 2021.\nIn the spirit of transparency and community, we want to give potential backers some insight into our approach to funding and budgeting. There aren't any lovely images in this section but it's important to us that those pledging understand how we're using their money to develop Pine.\nFirst and foremost, our primary goal is to develop a high-quality, engaging, meaningful story-driven game so that you can experience the woodworker's story.\nWhile we'd love to just work on Pine and release it when it's ready without worrying about money, Pine is too big of a project to whittle away at in the evening and on weekends.\nWe think we've got about 15 months of work to do and we need to hire some outside help. The Kickstarter funding goes primarily towards hiring that help and enabling us to spend the time doing the work.\nHere's how the basic budget breaks down. These are estimates, but should be close to how the money gets spent.\n Kickstarter fees: 8% - We wouldn't be here without them!\n Rewards and shipping: 10% - Making and shipping the rewards \n Legal, accounting, etc: 2% - All companies need a little of this stuff\n Taxes: 15% - An estimate, and perhaps a conservative one\n Sound and music: 15% - Producing SFX and the score\n Art and programming: 50% - Most of what Pine needs is time for Tom and Najati to work on it!\nIf we're lucky enough to achieve any of our stretch goals, funding them comes out of the art and programming portion of the budget.\nAt our lowest goal of $80k, this is a shoestring budget even for a small team. However, everyone is committed to the project and we think that's just enough money to make a great game. For anyone curious, the project needs to reach about $300,000 before Tom and Najati aren't spending their savings to develop Pine. Any money beyond that would be invested back into Made Up Games so we can make more games!\nSo that's how your pledges will help us make Pine and, again, we're grateful for every one. If you made it this far, thanks for sticking around through this really boring section about money!\n\nMade Up Games is Tom Booth and Najati Imam. We're both lifelong gamers and longtime friends. After some practice publishing games with Freecell Fable\u2014and with your help\u2014we're ready to take on Pine!\nTom\u2019s been drawing since childhood and has been a professional illustrator for about 10 years, including stints at Nickelodeon and Scholastic. He's illustrated and authored a number of children\u2019s books including Don't Blink! and This is Christmas. His Instagram audience and its love for the woodworker is a large part of what inspired us to start this campaign!\n\nNajati\u2019s been programming since he was a kid and has been doing so professionally for over 20 years. His experience runs the gamut from web front end, to embedded systems programming, to directing engineering departments. He\u2019s also been tinkering with game dev for as long as he\u2019s been able to type. \n\nAndy's an industry vet who records forests for fun. He's the perfect person to weave the sounds of the woodworker's valley into the storytelling. Owner of Northwest Soundscapes, he's done sound design work for Lucasfilm and Sucker Punch Productions, among others.\n\nAdam is one part programmer, one part actor, and one part team coach. He and Najati used to work together so when it was time to blend technology, feelings, and art we pulled him into the team to keep us focused and keep the quality high.\n\nTwo parting notes ...\nWe expect it's clear from the tone of the campaign that Pine attempts to explore a fairly serious topic. While we want it to be a story that most anyone will be able to relate to, and maybe even feel enriched by, it's not intended to be a children's story. Because there won't be anything graphic or violent in it, Pine may end up with an E rating. We added this note to make sure that parents don't mistakenly take that to mean that Pine is intended for children.\nAlso, Made Up Games does not condone carving things into trees\u2014please don't do that! In a lot of places it's illegal, but even more importantly it can be really bad for the tree. The woodworker's story is a fictional one and he would definitely take forest conservation very seriously if he were real.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk we foresee is whether we've estimated for enough time to live up to the high expectations we have for this project. We're confident in our ability to deliver, and we did our best to be reasonable with our estimates, but game development is a wily beast! We have contingency plans, but it would be na\u00efve to assume there won't be a few surprises along the way.\n\nSpeaking of surprises, there shouldn't be many for our backers as we're committed to being very transparent throughout the development of Pine. The dev updates will include progress on all fronts, from making and shipping the rewards to setbacks and successes during the development of Pine.\n\nRegarding publishing to the Switch: The barriers of entry to developing for the Nintendo Switch can be fairly high, with Nintendo controlling access to it tightly. If the project reaches that level of funding, we'll have resources available to tackle those challenges. Still, working with Nintendo is a considerable external dependency that we don't have complete control over.\n\nOur experience in fulfillment of physical goods is somewhat limited, but we've done our homework and think we've covered our bases there. We're confident in the partners we've selected to work with to produce the rewards and working with Fulfillrite removes all the risk around the shipping of the prints.\n\nWe're excited to bring Pine into the world. We're happy with the story we've written, our approach to telling it, and keen on our ability to execute. Risks exist, but we're ready to take on the challenges we face to make Pine a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWhere possible, shipping materials will be recycled and/or recyclable.\nSomething else\nFor all tiers above $25, we\u2019ll plant a tree for every backer that supports the project.

Destroying parts earns you additional dice for future rolls.\n2) The Machine Phase\nThe machine AI takes action, cycling the tracking die on each of its available machine part cards and triggering abilities when the die reaches an icon on its AI track -- potentially dealing damage, repairing, locking die, and impacting gameplay in other nefarious ways.\nWhen all of the machine parts have completed their cycle, the entire line shifts down one slot and a new machine part is added to the doom machine line, increasing the difficulty with each turn.\nCan you keep the machine at bay long enough to destroy the core and win?\nDownload the rules PDF right here or watch the how to play video below:\nTRY THE DEMO ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2230741646\nNote for Tabletop Simulator controls: mousing over a die while pressing a number makes it flip instantly to that numbered die face.

Expect unique songwriting, modern classical orchestration and a hybrid of a concept album and an instrumental song-cycle.\nawesome photo credit: Peter Runkewitz - taken at Berliner Festspiele\nHow it began...\nWhen stargaze first met the singularly talented Arone Dyer (as part of her band Buke and Gase) at the German Haldern Pop festival in 2014, they were instantly blown away by her voice, presence and the brilliance of her/their compositions. \nTwo years later the singer and the European classical-contemporary ensemble found themselves in the same room at the somewhat legendary PEOPLE Festival and residency organised by Berlin's Michelberger Hotel, and curated by The National\u2019s Aaron and Bryce Dessner, as well as Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon. stargaze was presented with the opportunity to arrange and collaborate on some of Arone's recent solo compositions and songs. Since those most inspiring sessions there has always been a small but enduring light flickering in the back of their minds: if one day they could make an album together... So they reached out to each other in the middle of 2020, when it became clear that there wasn't going to be much performing or touring possible any time soon; A hiatus and scary situation, but also a creative chance and THE moment for our project. \n\nAnd now we are at the point where we can say that a dream is about to come true, but we need YOUR HELP to make it happen: to come together when it's possible again, to rehearse, book a studio and record the music which Arone and stargaze are co-writing and arranging at the moment remotely, in a truly 2021 transatlantic bridge of solidarity and creativity.\nMusic vs Covid\nAt this extraordinary time, as the vast majority of musicians have been almost entirely erased from their typical work-cycle, we've lost the income we would typically make from in-person performance or touring. This, and dampened record sales in the time of online streaming negates any potential income that we would typically put towards the creation of new work. As an unregulated, unsupported service-based industry, our hands are tied behind our backs. This plea for help means more to us now than ever before!\n\nWe invite you to become part of our creative musical process and join us on the way to something great! By donating to this campaign, we can realise funding for:\n- the 13 talented performing/recording freelance musicians in stargaze, for their valuable time, effort given during a time when the whole world has been asked to remain static\n- studio rental costs\n- engineer fees\n- any equipment necessary for larger instruments or difficult arrangements that need to be recorded as a group\n- travel costs for musicians when group recording is required\n- travel costs to get Arone to the EU for writing/arrangement when possible\n- arrangement work\n- advance for physical album production costs\n- fee for visual artwork on the album (by the upcoming and talented artist Lily Morris)\nVisual artwork by Lilly Morris\nWho we are\nstargaze has initiated and created many genre bending and boundary breaking collaborations with the likes of Nils Frahm, Villagers, Poli\u00e7a, Owen Pallett, K\u00e4ptn Peng and many more. We get invited regular by major concert venues including Hamburg\u2019s Elbphilharmonie, the Barbican Centre and Paris\u2019 Philharmonie. Arone Dyer is a founding member of duos Buke and Gase and Mistresses, the producer of Dronechoir, a project which examines social dis/comfort through long-durational choral performance, and musical collaborator with an extensive resume of appearances. Her band Buke and Gase has been dubbed anything between an \u2018avantgarde indie rock obsession\u2019 and \u2018steampunk art-folk\u2019, just as uncategorisable as Arone\u2019s vocal style is original and emotionally direct.\nPlanning\nArone and stargaze have already started recording new ideas and demos remotely. Material is being gathered until the time when we can come together in a studio and collaborate in person, recording this special new album that we believe will make people happy and moved. This campaign is designed to make it possible, and with the goal that as many fans will get to experience this unique sound and collaboration between Arone and stargaze.\n\nJan - Kickstarter launched Work begins! \nFeb - Kickstarter campain ends, inform all contributors\nMar - Recording/writing demos continues\nMay-June - fulfill dinners, fulfill lessons/recording sessions for campaign contributors; invites to stargaze Festival at Berlin Volksb\u00fchne (unless postponed to September due to Covid)\nJul - fulfill other rewards for campaign contributors; final demos and arrangements are written/prepared\nAug - stargaze gets together in EU for rehearsing; recording first single remotely; exclusive download of first mix prepared; fullfill guestlist invitations at festivals (where possible)\nSept - recording full album in studio with Arone in Europe; insta sessions/exclusive gig\nOct - overdubs/touch-ups/edits\nNov - Mix/Master; work on video/promo material \nDec - Digital prerelease for contributors\nJan - Music video prerelease to contributors\nFeb - release first single/video; exclusive launch concert\nMar - Full album release \nPLAY\n\nWe believe that making music together remotely has helped us to stay in touch, encourage and support each other as artists, and to overcome and channel our deepest fears about the time we live in and realities we face wherever we are. Music, or rather the act of creating music together, is proving again to be the ultimate connector, the social glue and remedy.\nAnd not least, we believe in launching Arone as a solo artist and composer on record, a voice we believe deserves widespread attention.\nWhat will you receive?\nThe working album title is \"Arachne Versus\" - inspired by the Greek myth of Arachne, where a young talented girl challenges the Gods to a weaving contest and is transformed into a spider. \"Arachne Versus\" implicates the web we must work with to create, or weave, this project/sonic tapestry despite forced distance and solitude.

In 2016 I won The Best Colorist award at Alternate Showcase of Animation and Comics poll awards.You can see my more recent work at www.instagram.com/rnugentcolors.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risks we have are delays in printing and shipping.

I will not reprint this physical edition. If you miss out and want to get the content, Tower of Scoundrels is available in digital format at DrivethruRPG. (Of course, as with everything, even the digital release may not be available forever. The world is constantly changing.) \n\nDigital mockup of the album cover and vinyl record. Please note that this is a mockup and not final. The image was constructed on a 45 RPM record, so this is more accurate to the final appearance than any of the other mockups shown in this campaign.\n\nWithin this 7\u201d album you will find the Tower of Scoundrels, an adventure designed for use with the M\u00f6rk Borg roleplaying game.\nThis adventure includes the outer album cover \u2013 which can be used as a micro-GM screen \u2013 two booklets that detail the tower as well as what is hidden beneath the tower, and a 7\u201d vinyl record of atmospheric tunes.\nTower of Scoundrels is intended for experienced gamemasters. You will need the official M\u00f6rk Borg roleplaying game, dice, pencils, paper, friends, and imagination to use this adventure. A record player is required to listen to the included album.\nOne printing only! This limited edition package will not be printed again. I'm planning for a run of 500 records in print. (Adjusted upward if necessary to cover the Kickstarter rewards.) Copies remaining after fulfillment will be available in a future project.\nDigital mockup of the two booklets. Book One details the tower. Book Two describes what is below the tower.\nYou can hear both sides of the vinyl record right now! NOTE: The final music may vary slightly; the music is being remastered by an audio engineer specifically for vinyl, so there may be slight variations between the digital mastering and vinyl mastering.\nSo that we don't risk causing delays, there are no project stretch goals. The music is complete (as well as professionally mastered), the booklets are written, and the project is ready to go. The only possible change will be upgrading the gatefold to a triple-panel instead of the double-panel, but that change will be based on info from the printer and not rely on stretch goals.\nWhen the campaign ends, I'll deliver PDFs to all backers and run the project through a one-week review stage so we can try to crush any typos that I may have missed. Then I'll officially start the manufacturing process. \n\n\nBook One interior page spread mockup. Each booklet is 6\" x 6\" in size. Book one is twelve pages. Book two is eight pages.\nWith over two decades of experience in the game industry, Philip has created hundreds of PDFs, books, and games . . . but this is his first time experimenting with music. Both tracks (one on each side of the 7\" record) were produced using the Soundtrap tools where Philip layered sound effects and loops, manipulating all of the different elements in the software. Once complete, both tracks are processed through Soundcloud's mastering tools that expand the richness and depth of the music as computers perform their audio mastering magic.\nIn addition to the music, Philip also handled the writing, graphic design, and layout of the album sleeve and two booklets. Please see the copyright notice, below, for more information on the art and maps. \n\u00a9 2021 Philip Reed. Map and tower graphics \u00a9 Dyson Logos, used with permission.

And the genderless communist era of \"no breasts\"? Perhaps only men can appreciate boobs, because every woman I know, struggles with them.\nMe? Even worse! Born as an only-child in China, I was raised up as a boy. When my breasts started to grow, they immediately become the struggle of my life. Almost two monsters that never get out of my sight. I tried to hide them by all means even until today. But right now, as an adult filmmaker, I propose to animate them and confront them in a film!  \nThe Handsome Me and Family Planning Poster\nThat was the simple beginning of the project. However, after looking back at all the memories of binding myself in cellophanes, dreaming of a flat chest, learning to show them proudly, I realised that a lot of things have changed, not only my own opinions, but also, the society's attitude towards women's bodies and sex culture. \nWhat has happened? Is that more of a liberation or just another prison?\nI hate to say it, but the constant struggle with women\u2019s body goes on and on. The difference in turn, shows that a society has changed. The memories of a generation in China can actually be told through the story of boobs and the role of women in society.\n\nThe 90-minute film will adapt a hybrid form with archive, animation, fiction and documentary elements. A humorous approach and a decided style will be used. Two breasts animation will be created as the narrator of the film.\nAnimation Reference\nIt will follow a chapter based and chronological order of my personal life from I was born till today, meanwhile reflecting the influence of one child policy, gender inequality, sex education, globalisation, life in diaspora and the seemly absurd sex culture in China historically and today. Something the society has chosen to be silent about. \nMoodboard\nThrough the role of breasts and sexuality to a coming-of-age story, we follow 30 years of a culture and a society. It is not only to reflects on my own memory and struggles, but also to understand the society on women and the relationship with our bodies and culture.\n\nThe film has participated in several project labs and festival markets, including, IDFAcademy, Berlinale Doc Station and SoundImageCulture. In April 2021, we set to begin the first shooting period, which is where your support will lead to. \nIDFAcademy Workshop For Pitching and Co-production\n\nIn return to your boobie love, I wanted to create rewards that are both fun and unique.

If the pandemic does not allow foreign crew to enter, the director, as a Chinese citizen will form a local crew to continue the shooting.\nThe film is a feature length hybrid form with animation. We have been looking for great animation artist to collaborate with.\nOne of the biggest risk to consider is the political layer of the film. As the sensitivity of some topics may create issues, we will need to take this factor into consideration.\nA big challenge of the film is to tell a personal story to relate to an international audience. The campaign create a great chance for me to hear the voice of others around the globe. I am confident that the Chinese story is also a sneak peak into a Culture that is different and far to trigger a global question question of feminism.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Nipple", "descp": "Nipple is the top of everything and nipplegasm is real.

Thanks everyone!\nThanks to your incredible support, we've reached our goal! Our new stretch goal is $40K.  Let's do this! Thank you everyone!\nIn just 9 days, we've hit our goal. We can't thank you enough! The story of Joe Keithley and the power of music and activism has clearly struck a nerve.  The entire \"Something Better Change\" team is incredibly grateful and thankful to you for how far we've come so far.\nLet's keep the momentum going\u2014indie filmmaking is full of surprises and every additional dollar we receive means we can put it back into the film for additional post-production expenses, music licensing and more to give you\u2014the audience\u2014the best film we can make.\nPLAY\n\nSomething Better Change\nFilm Summary:\nThroughout the 1980s, bands like D.O.A. helped define the decade's deafening hardcore punk sound, paving the way for the eventual explosion of punk groups through radio and MTV in the decades to come. While punk rock's upper echelon may no longer be as culturally seditious as they once were,  the genre's effect on a new generation of activists and aspiring politicians has never been more clear.\n\nIn 2018, after 40 years of fighting against oppression, homelessness and corporate greed in the U.S. and in his native Canada, D.O.A. frontman, activist and cultural politician Joey \u201cShithead\" Keithley decided to turn art into life and run against the outspoken Mayor of Burnaby (population: 250,000), Derek Corrigan. Against all odds\u2014and with only a $7000 campaign budget\u2014Keithley won a city councillor seat in Burnaby, BC that year and helped to unseat the entrenched five-term Corrigan who once famously said, \u201cI would never bend over to give a homeless person a dime because he might steal my watch.\"\n\nWill Keithley's message and DIY approach to campaigning resonate with voters in the upcoming Burnaby election of 2022? Win or lose, we will document him every step of the way as he campaigns for a second term. This is a film that will explore how music and activism continue to interlink, with music often serving as an introduction to social issues that inspire people to get involved and foster dynamic change.\nPete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Brian and Joey \"Shithead\" Keithley, 1986. Photo by Connie Kuhns.\nWhy Crowdfunding?\nCrowdfunding is an essential tool for indie filmmakers like myself. I'm passionate about the communal aspect of the process and how it allows for a type of creative freedom and autonomy that traditional investing doesn't always guarantee. This film is more than just a music documentary\u2014this is a story of a man who not only fronted one of the most vital and important punk bands of the last 40 years, but has consistently maintained his commitment to working on social issues like racism, fascism, homelessness, and the environment.\nAutographed by Joe Keithley official movie poster 18x24\" poster available available in our rewards!\nWhat We Need & What You Get:\nAs you know, a project of this magnitude takes time and money\u2014and as we are approaching the next election cycle, time is of the essence. If we successfully reach our goal, we will use the funds to pay for the following:\nmusic licensing fees\ntravel/location costs\narchival usage fees\npost-production costs (editing, sound, color, etc.)\nadditional A/V needs\ninsurance\nlegal representation\nfulfillment costs\nAll of these are necessary to create a film we can all be proud of\u2014but most importantly, one that tells the story of Joe Keithley and D.O.A. in a way that resonates with both his fans and documentary enthusiasts around the world. This is truly an inspiring underdog, DIY story that has broad appeal. We have begun production on the film with a very, very modest investment, but we need additional funds to really get the ball rolling.  \nCan We Exceed Our Goal?\nWe are hopeful we can exceed our funding goal, and if so, we will use the additional budget for bonus content, promotion and any unexpected costs along the way (a certainty with independent filmmaking).\nHow You Can Help \nAs you know, this film is only going to be possible with your help. This film belongs to you as much as it does to us.  The more people who participate, the more chance we have of getting the story out.

His first film was \"Salad Days: A Decade of Punk in Washington, DC\" and the follow-up was \"CREEM: America's Only Rock'n'Roll Magazine.\" Both films received critical acclaim and multiple film festival awards.

With your help, I want to take my next project much further, with a longer story, many more characters, and a longer production time to get the best out of me. I think I have a really special story with a solid and funny script, so I hope you can help me make it real!\nHi, Eraser!\n STORY\n\u2018Homework\u2019 begins as a normal day for our main character, a regular pencil, who after some unexpected events, will need to get out of his comfort zone and go into an adventure far from his desk that will change the rest of his life. The story is full of little characters that will have their moment to shine and make us laugh while we get to know them.\nEarly in the story scene - Storyboard\nStoryboard - Gum under the table is finally useful\nMost of my stories rely on funny twists and original ideas, so even if I have the full script and storyboard for it, I want you to first experience it when you watch the final animation. I'm aiming for a duration of around 6-8 minutes for this short-film.\n\nWork In Progress\nCHARACTERS\nMeet Sticky!\nAside from the main characters, a pencil and an eraser, many other characters will make their appearance. Each of them has their own personality, role in their 'society' and more importantly, importance in the story. \nHi, this is Clippy!\nSome of the characters of 'Homework'\nCreating characters is what I do best, I've been creating funny characters and situations for over a decade. These characters granted me the privilege to have over half a million followers of my illustrations and to work on some amazing projects with brands like Playstation, Netflix, Pilot, Peak, Nestle, and many more. \nStarting doing animation was a risky move, you don't change something that's working so well. While I miss sharing my work with my followers every week, as animation takes much longer to create, I feel that I've found the perfect recipe for my development as an artist.\nSome of Naolito's illustration work\n\nPHYSICAL REWARDS\nI've been creating products with my artwork for over a decade for my online and retail stores and distributors, so I have extensive experience and a long list of reliable providers who have been creating quality products for me during all this time.\n\nENAMEL PIN SET\nEnamel Pin set preview - 35mm/1.5in\n#2: Crayons Box - MOVING ENAMEL PIN\nPLAY\n\nMoving Enamel Pin - Crayons Box (preview) - 35mm/1.5in (It has an interactive mechanism!)\n\n#3: Notepad - MOVING ENAMEL PIN \n\nMoving Enamel Pin - Notepad (preview) - 35mm/1.5in (It has an interactive mechanism!)\nSTICKERS PACK\n Includes different stickers with 12 different characters.\n12 characters - 10cm/4in depending on the character.\nART PRINT - A4 signed and numbered, printed on fine art 300gr paper.

Storytelling is my passion, so I feel that animation allows me to create a much better representation of my concepts and characters. To my surprise, people seemed to love my animations from the very first day, so I kept creating and sharing them with my +600k followers on Instagram who support my work on a daily basis.\nCreator Nacho D\u00edaz Arjona - Naolito\nI included some extracts of my short animations done in 2020, but if you want to see the complete version of them, you can watch this video to enjoy 4 minutes of cuteness.\n WHY KICKSTARTER?\nThis is an independent project as it gets. Naolito is just one person, with your support, you\u2019re making it possible for me to dedicate full time to the creation of it, and if support is big enough, hiring additional professionals to make it get to the next level.\n\nFor the last year, I\u2019ve been using my free time to give my characters an extra dose of life thanks to animation. It comes with a cost though, while the illustration is pretty straightforward, the animation is more complex and time-consuming.\n              In addition to that, it\u2019s harder to monetize, so it\u2019s not easy to dedicate time to it, so I end up working for brands instead of dedicating more time to my characters. \nI'll be the one doing all locations, assets, characters, animations, editing, music, etc. Even working alone, 3d is really expensive, this is the reason why most kids 3d shows look as plain and bad as they look, they cut corners in all areas, including rendering, to keep costs as low as possible. As I planned this project, all funds will go directly to render farm & software costs, in order to ensure we can get a short film that looks amazing. \nWith your support, I hope to be able to work full time on the creation of \u2018HOMEWORK\u2019 and hopefully many more stories. Working full time on it means longer stories, better-looking characters and scenarios, and hopefully, even bigger projects in the future.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n+125% FUNDED! I could never have imagined such a great reception for this project, thank you so much for your incredible support! It's overwhelming to see a project I've put so many hours and effort into like this one supported by so many people.  Let's make it even bigger with some Stretch goals!\nThank you so much for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 2nd Kickstarter project and I am confident we can manage all the steps to make this project a success. We have already completed the first steps, defining the bases of the storyline and creating the main characters, and I have experience creating complex animation in a much shorter span of time.\nRegarding physical rewards, in addition to being my second Kickstarter project, I've run my online store for over 10 years now, shipping all kinds of products all over the world. \nI also have a decade of experience working with different suppliers of all kinds of products. This experience is extremely important to ensure that all products are created under the highest quality standards.\nWhen it comes to shipping, we're always exposed to an unexpected event or delay, but my goal is always to be responsive when someone has an issue and to get it solved.\nHowever, should a production or shipping delay occur, I will inform everyone with frequent project updates. I understand that updates are important, so I will do our best to keep you constantly informed.\nI will continue to work hard beyond this project creating some new and creative stuff, so we ask you to continue to follow and believe in my work.\nThank you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Thank you", "descp": "Thank from creator @Naolito's Instagram stories", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["18 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Digital download", "descp": "A digital download of my 3d animated short film Homework.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["120 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Premium digital download", "descp": "Includes:\n- Digital Download of Homework short-film\n- All my previous short animations\n- Access to all behind the scenes content", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["242 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Physical edition", "descp": "Includes:\n- Homework short film physical copy\n- All my previous animations\n- Behind the scenes content\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Enamel Pin Set - Pencil + Eraser", "descp": "Includes:\n- Enamel Pin Set of Pencil and Eraser\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Stickers set (12)", "descp": "- Sticker set of 12 stickers featuring all characters from Homework\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Moving Enamel Pin - Crayons Box", "descp": "Includes:\n- Moving Enamel Pin (with an interactive moving mechanism!)\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Moving Enamel Pin - Notepad", "descp": "Includes:\n- Notepad - Moving Enamel Pin (with an interactive moving mechanism!)\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "Limited Edition 1/1 Art Print", "descp": "- Signed and numbered (1/1) art print from a frame from the film.

I just wanted to give you a production update on the short film, there's a lot going on that I'd like to share with you.\n\nIf you follow me on Instagram, you probably have seen that I'm hiring 3d artists. Why is that? When you supported this project, you changed my life, and Naolito as a unipersonal project, forever. Initially, this was a solo project, and while I received a lot of messages of people offering to help me in the creation of the short film, I couldn't afford to pay any extra artists, as all Kickstarter funding would go directly into rendering farms, software and reward products.  \n\n3 months later, we're in a very different, and better, situation. Thanks to this project, and thanks to your support, aside from gaining some weight from working non-stop, my 3d work got a lot of attention, I got 3d gigs, I got some crazy offers, and most importantly, I got additional funding for additional projects and the short film. So even if was already playing with the idea of hiring some additional help to be able to keep pushing all my projects, this new situation allows me to think bigger, so Naolito is becoming a full-fledged animation studio.\n\nObviously, this has a direct impact on my initial planning for the short film. A solo project is more streamlined, and while the final result is probably not as good, production times are much shorter. With a big team working on it, production times get much longer, you need a lot more coordination, you can't overwork your staff the way I do it with myself, etc. But this also means that the quality level you can achieve is on a whole different level."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "\ud83d\udc8c Some project and deadline updates", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "\u270f\ufe0f'Homework' updates and a little scoop for you\ud83c\udf0e", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "We did it! 148% funded & 718 backers!

Will you seek to ruin just one captain and their wretched ship, or will you bring down the rest as well? What intrigues can you leverage within this community of thieves? What secrets can you line your pockets with? What other treasures are hidden, waiting to be found for those clever and determined enough?\nMap of Corpsewake Cove\nThere\u2019s a lot we\u2019ve got squished onto these 32+ pages, including:\nD10 table of possible ways the pirates ruined your life - everything from stealing your curtains to murdering your dog\n3 custom backgrounds for PCs who want something other than revenge: The Dewey-Eyed Pirate Wannabe: fake it till you make it; The Bounty Hunter: get your mark, get your pay; The Treasure-Crazed Lunatic: get rich or die trying.\nThe complete text for how to play the adventure including traps and puzzles\nDescriptions of key NPCs with stat blocks and portraits\nBestiary including stats and images\nThe Fearsome Manticore and the Not-to-be-spoken-of Ex-Parrot\nD20 table of random encounters on the streets of Corpsewake Cove\nAdventure-wide map, as well as key location maps and descriptions\nD100 table of pirate booty\n...and big, splashy illustrations to bring the text to life in a punk-art, graphic style.\n\nWhat's Mork Borg?\nM\u00d6RK BORG hit the Roleplaying Game world a year or so ago, and we have been itching to try our hand at making something in the genre since then. In Mork Borg, the world has really truly gone to to shit. It's dying, and everyone knows we're making-do till it finally all falls apart. But in these bleak times we can still get a little scratch and try to find some sliver of satisfaction. The art blends punk, the cut-and-paste zine approach, and elements of dadaism and thrash metal graphics. We made a one-page dungeon for M\u00d6RK BORG as part of Dissident Whispers (which also happened to be Madeleine's first try at making an isometric map!) and really liked the taste.\nCorpsewake Cove is our first adventurous foray into the graphic and thematic world of M\u00d6RK BORG. Bright, gritty illustrations accompany evocative text - a mad run on the rough streets of a pirate town, to the harbor beyond, and slogging desperately through the cadaver-clogged sewers below. Chock full of swashbuckling, zombie-burning, rabble rousing, and pirate murdering! The tone is grim as the grave - you will take revenge for what the pirates did to you and your family. But there\u2019s also plenty of room for bleak nihilism and a bit of graveyard humor.\nBut, hey, don't take our word for it. In the words of M\u00d6RK BORG's creators:\n\"M\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday rpg about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world. It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it.\"\nThe Dreaded Frankenshark (ooooooooo scary)\nFulfillment\nEvery backer will get the pdf through itch, and/or DriveThruRPG - your choice.\nWe're big believers in the importance of print and being able to hold the book and show it off at the table (and with art like this, you'll want to show it off!) We're offering two options for printing:\n1.Print-On-Demand. Every backer will get codes to print at cost through DriveThruRPG in both saddle-stapled softcover and hardcover with their premium color printing. This means that you will pay them to print and ship Corpsewake Cove to you at a later point. As of right now, it looks like it's about $4 to print the softcover and $8 to print the hardcover. The plus side of this is that you can get a hardcover copy but more importantly, DriveThruRPG has printing and shipping facilities all over the world, making it less terrifyingly expensive to ship internationally.\n2. The \"Official\" Print Run. For our US backers, we will print the \"official\" version through Mixam. In our opinion, the quality of the printing is a step up on their HP Indigo 7600 digital press. We'll be printing full-color on 100# uncoated paper with a boss, gloss laminated, 130# cover. It will feel so good in your hands and look incredible. We've printed a number of products with Mixam and they are always impressive to see.\nThe Timeline\nThe writing and much of the illustration is complete already! During this campaign, we will be going through the layout process. In an ideal world (which we haven't had recently), we would like to get the pdf to you in early February, shortly after the campaign wraps, and deliver the Mixam printed zines in March. To be on the safe side, though, we're saying March for the PDF, April for the printed books. This would be our first printing through DriveThruRPG, so we would expect that may require some additional time getting it just right.\nWho is Ember + Ash?\nThis adventure and every illustration in it is a creation of Ember + Ash Games (@ByEmberAndAsh, www.byemberandash.com).

It has a thick front and back cover. Includes a matte black golf pencil that slides perfectly into the spiral binding, and a black and white d6 that you can carry along as well.\nSample pages (Subject to change)\n\n\n\nHow to play:\nGameplay is simple but entertaining: you roll a 6-sided die to determine how far you'll move each turn. Then pick a direction, draw a line, and interact with anything on that line, be it a monster (ouch!) some treasure (nice!) or a teleporter (cool!).\nCustomize your character, roll your way through each floor, and get items at the shops sprinkled throughout the game. There's even a page in the back to track stats like how many times you died -- so if you die, don't worry! It's all part of the adventure.\n\nYou can get a PDF of sample rules and level here\n\nTesting a prototype\n\nHow I'm making it:\nI am using software called Drawbot that allows me to code a level generator in Python. This generates PDFs which I will send to a local printer to get the notebooks made. This means that each game pad is different - each one has random level layouts and different shops. So if you get more than one game pad, you'll have different levels to play!\n\nLevels are generated with Python code using Drawbot\n\n\nWhy I'm making it:\nI feel compelled to cut games down to their bones and to see what makes them tick. In that spirit, I'm trying to strip this genre down to its simplest form: 1 player, simple mechanics, no story-telling, just you, a die and pencil, and a series of simple decisions in the face of randomness. \n\nAs a product designer, I have been thinking for a long time about the concept of \"paper apps\". In fact I've created one already. Sometimes you want to do something during a dull moment, but don't want to get sucked into your phone screen. Paper apps fill that gap with discrete, screen-free experiences that respect your time and attention. Eventually I plan on creating a whole Paper App Library (PAL) that will include all sorts of little notebook \"apps\", including games and utilities.\n\nAbout me:\nI've been creating games since I first learned to program in QBASIC as a kid. I have published several video games and even published a tabletop game on Kickstarter back in 2013. I am interested in game design, graphic design, and product design. \nPaper Apps is a joint effort of my video game company, Beep Yeah!, and the design company I run with my wife, Gladden.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk involves getting printed and shipped. However, I have made \"paper apps\" like this before and I have a process in place. COVID restrictions may slow things down, but only by a week or two.

Most of it is created by our wonderful community and will be (or already is) made available for free download on morkborg.com, but there is also exclusive official material.\nIn this Kickstarter is also the official M\u00d6RK BORG GM screen, and a box full of almost-forgotten gods. \n\n\u2716 Thank you Terra Tenebrosa for letting us use the track The Arc of Descent from the album The Tunnels in the Kickstarter video. If you're looking for feverous, experimental black/post-metal, check it out here. \nThis is what this godless tome will look like\nPunish your ears\nTo get into the proper mood, we created this Spotify playlist. Put it on while reading this Kickstarter, and/or when playing M\u00d6RK BORG.\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday RPG about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world. It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it.\nSome people said this\n\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG CULT (MBC) is our sub-label for selected, approved and curated M\u00d6RK BORG content by the community. Basically, you send us homebrew stuff and if we like it and it follows our guidelines, we make some edits, art and lay it out before publishing it for free download on morkborg.com. Digital MBC content (including that of zines like this) will always be free, but this is a chance to get some of it in high-quality print form. I mean, you can download the content for free and print it at home too if you want. \n\u2716 Since a few days ago, we are also putting the submissions to MBC on pause. When we started this project we had NO IDEA we would receive as much content as we are, and since we're also working on forthcoming books etc, we simply can't keep up with the demand. So we close it down for a bit, until we've cleared the backlog, at which point we can open it up again.  \n\n\u2716 About six months ago we Kickstarted M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, the first MBC zine. It was a much bigger success than we could have imagined and an unbelievable 1792 backers helped us realize the project. Since then we have received a TON of awesome content submitted to the Cult and we want to collect it into a physical zine once more. So, if you're familiar with MBC: FERETORY, you know the drill. This is pretty much the exact same thing. Oh, and there's also the Official M\u00d6RK BORG Game Master's Screen of Doom and the mysterious shrine IKHON. We'll get to that. \nM\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC is published by Free League Publishing, same as M\u00d6RK BORG and M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY was. They will handle printing, distribution and digital fulfillment.\n  All these either are or will be available for free download on morkborg.com\n Adventure: Graves Left Wanting. The PCs find themselves buried alive in the vast, ever-changing cemetery of Graven-Tosk. This dark and weird tombcrawl is suitable as a campaign starter or a post-TPK adventure. By Karl Druid \n Adventure: Sepulchre of the Swamp Witch. In a hidden repository deep in the Slithering Swamp is a witch's altar of glyph-covered roots. They say it can fulfill any wish. Could stopping the approaching Doom be within its powers? Only one way to find out. By Christian Sahl\u00e9n. \n Adventure: Bloat. Villagers disappear. Tracks lead to an underground temple of bacchanalian frenzy, reeking of rot, offal and bile. Find them and sate your hunger. By Greg Saunders. \n Rules: Unheroic Feats. Enhance and personalize your classless characters with these optional advancement rules. By Johnny Carhat. \n Class: Sacrilegious Songbird. You struck a deal with a devil and since that woeful day your soul screams but your throat sings sweetly. And so does your purse. A small price to pay. By Karl Druid. \n Class: Shedding Vicar. Armor is weak, clothes a sin and your very skin an abhorrent vanity. Best to remove it all and walk peeled, clean and glistening wet into the night. By Cameron James. \n Creature: The Merchant. Cursed with eternal life and destined to roam the world trading shards of souls for ruinous relics. You never know when this mysterious monger might appear. Will you make a deal? By Johnny Carhat. \n Creature: The Bone Bowyer. This horrid fey lurks in the tangled depths of Sarkash where it fashions heart-seeking bone bows and blood-dyed cloaks from the flesh of the lost. By Matthew Bottiglieri. \n Rules: Blackpowder Weapons for the Rich and Foolhardy. The world is ending, so let's end it with a BANG. These optional rules are the spark that adds fire- to your fights. Whether it's a pepperbox or a ribauldequin, you can be assured these things are loud and deadly. By Ian McClung. \n\nThese are exclusive to the zine and will not be made available for free download. These will not only be included in the printed zine, but will also come translated to Swedish as a digital appendix to the PDF version. \n Creature: Borg Bitor. Vile, insectoid, parasitic creatures creeping into houses and nurseries come nighttime. There is a baby. There is an egg. Don't let them become one.\n Creature: Rotting Nurse. Many a Galgenbeckian remembers Mikol's infirmary and its gruesome experiments exposed by the inquisition. The head surgeon was jailed but whatever really happened to his accomplices, the nurses? Their lengthy, cruel punishment and vivisepulture. The empty graves. The shimmer from the starless skies. The many-legged horses carrying the bodies away... for what purpose?  \n 250.000 SEK STRETCH GOAL Adventure: Nurse the Rot. As you put Mother Marathuk\u2014the aunt of one of you dregs\u2014to her final rest, the village Tunstal is set in complete darkness, leaving it to its doom unless something is done. \n Rules: Curses and Cures. So you opened the puzzle box, whistled in the old mine or carelessly removed the protecting wards? These curses will be the consequence. Luckily, there are ways to break them, but it comes at a cost. \n\n\u2716 Our goal is to make this zine similar to M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, meaning something quite different from the M\u00d6RK BORG  core book. This is a rough zine, a haphazardly composited collection of ideas and articles, and we want it to feel like something you'd pick up at a concert or an underground art fair. It'll be a soft-cover zine, about 60-ish A5 pages thick, printed on heavily textured uncoated paper in 7 colors (CMYK+3), with some extra things metallic foiling and golden staples or who knows? You know, a typical zine.\nThe zine will only be printed in English, but the things written by Pelle and Johan will be included in Swedish in a digital Appendix.\n\n Introducing: The M\u00d6RK BORG Screen of Doom* \n*not really the name. OR IS IT?\n\u2716 Since the release of M\u00d6RK BORG we have seen quite a few awesome custom-made GM screens made, and now we want to offer you guys our take on it. This will be a beast of a screen; small but versatile. \nA five-paneled A5 portrait wall of death \nPrinted with gold metallic ink on one side and vivid neon yellow on the other. We want the screen to scream in your face when you run the game. \nShould we reach the 325.000 SEK stretch goal, we'll even equip each screen with two pairs of photo corners (for lack of a better name) that can hold A5 sheets with whatever tables or notes you want. So that you don't have to use that sharpie on the screen (I mean you still can, but you don't have to). Think old-school photo album, but for your adventure notes.\n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\n\nThe back has a ton of more or less useful tables. If we reach the Stretch goal you can even change two of the panels to have whatever reference tables, adventure notes and/or profane poetry you prefer.\n The front is all art, five scenes of various locales and important characters in the Dying world, from SHE in the mountains of Bergen Chrypt to the endless graveyard Graven-Tosk beneath the Shadowking's palace. \n The GM-facing side sports a wide array of tables and rules summaries that might come in handy during play, such as an NPC generator, equipment and Powers, combat summary (with an optional hit location table), generic enemy stat-blocks and a d100 list of random junk you can find when looting the cultists' coffers (previously printed in MBC: FERETORY and available on morkborg.com). \n\n\nOne more thing\nForged by the left hand of Nechrubel, bound in cured skin and soot-black wood, the ancient god-vessels known as IKHONs are detested by the Two-Headed Basilisks. Wielding their Powers, unfettering the Profane Profound shackled within is a serious heretical crime and whoever may carry these blackened shrines will be forever hunted by the inquisition. But perhaps it is worth it. \nEarly mockup. Might change. You never know with these things.\n\u2716 IKHON is a mysterious box. A gaol keeping four almost-forgotten folk gods at bay; the Bilkherd, the Becklure, the Old Dead and the dreaded Silkfiend.  Those who dare commune with them are promised great rewards. But life and death go hand in hand and too small a sacrifice could be perceived as an insult. This gift could very well be a curse. IKHON is an\n a6 box with rules on how to unfetter the Profane Profound. While you can never choose which one to summon and how they'll react, (willing) human sacrifice will tip the odds slightly in your favor. Within are\n four tracts, one for each god-creature, detailing their gifts and punishments. Each a 24 page A6 booklet. \n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\nWritten by Pelle Nilsson but torn apart and rebuilt in a stranger, darker form by Fiona Maeve Geist and Jarrett Crader of the MoonRat Conspiracy.  \n Over 40 full-page illustrations by the masterful Paraguayan artist Samuel Araya, whose oil paintings will bring the Profane Profound to blasphemous life. This is but one of them, giving you an idea of the kind of aesthetic this thing will have:\nOne of these mysterious, bene/malevolent deities.\n\nPledge levels and what they include\nWe got some stretch goals, in case we should get more funds than we need to just make the zine, screen and IKHON happen:\n 100.000 SEK We make this thing, simple as that.\n 175.000 SEK No zine is complete without silver foil details! If we hit this Stretch Goal we'll add a bit of shine to one of the pages.\n 250.000 SEK  We include the official and zine exclusive adventure Nurse the Rot (check the Stuff by Pelle and Johan section above for more details). \n  325.000 SEK We equip the GM screen with two pairs of photo corners allowing you to customize it with your own reference sheets for whatever you're running (just print and cut it to roughly A5 size and you're good!). \n 400.000 SEK We'll make two of these additional GM screen reference sheets and have them printed and included with the screen. Exactly what they'll have on them will be revealed.\n 825.000 SEK We print a minimalistic dungeon crawl in the form of a one-page comic, made by \u0141ukasz Kowalczuk. It will be in A2 format (and also PDF) and comes with the zine. \n 900.000 SEK Pelle will make a generator that will let you generate sects, cults, their leaders and beliefs. This will take up one spread in the zine.\n 1.000.000 SEK, the final stretch goal: We turn the Monster Generator from M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY into a digital app, just like we did with scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\u2716 Of course, if you want to supercharge your pledge with additional things you'll be able to tack on these (more or less) family-friendly products after the Kickstarter campaign ends. These will be shipped together with the MBC: Heretic items. \n\u2716 To buy an addon, click the \"Manage My Pledge\" button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in SEK) for all the addons you want. After the Kickstarter ends, there will be a Pledge Manager where you can mark which addons you want for the extra money you put it.\n\u2716 You can also leave your pledge unchanged and add things after the Kickstarter ends.\nNote that addons can incur additional shipping fees as the weight increases, paid for in the pledge manager.\n\nM\u00d6RK BORG CORE BOOK, 250 SEK\n\u2716 The actual game that all this is for. Maybe you want to start your perilous M\u00d6RK BORG journey here and thus need the actual rule book, or something happened to your old copy. Either way, you can get it here! Includes a PDF. \n\n M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, 150 SEK \n\u2716 The previous M\u00d6RK BORG CULT zine, with lots of adventures, monsters, treasures and untimely demise including the mini/solo game Dark Fort which was the original game that later evolved into M\u00d6RK BORG. Includes a PDF. \n\nDEATH TEMPLE SZTUN, 50 SEK\n\u2716 A hyper-linear murder gauntlet of a dungeon crawl. Short (a folded A4 pamphlet, so 6 pages) but sweet (actually not sweet, more bitter and rank). Does not include a PDF.\nCharacter sheet pads, 60 SEK\n\u2716 A pad of character sheets printed on uncoated paper, perfect for writing on or to angrily crumple into a pathetic ball of disappointment. Does not include a PDF but the character sheets are available for free download on morkborg.com so there's no need.\nExtra copy of M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC, 150 SEK\n\u2716 Add a second copy of this zine to your pledge. Give it to a friend. Cut it to pieces. Or just keep one close at hand in case something happens. These are weird times. Includes a PDF.\nIKHON, 180 SEK\n\u2716 We don't recommend it, but perhaps you want to obtain this mystical box and have a peek inside. In that case, you can add one to your pledge. Includes a PDF.\nM\u00d6RK BORG GM Screen, 180 SEK\n\u2716 Add a GM screen to your pledge. Includes a PDF. No witty text here, sorry.\n\nShipping\nThese are weird times. Not only because of covid-19 and the uncertainty it brings but also with Brexit screwing international shipping up in unclear ways. Luckily we are able to ship from a Germany-based warehouse and a US-based instead of the UK this time around, but the current situation will, unfortunately, lead to increased shipping costs and possible delays beyond our control. We have done what we can but at the end of the day, some of these things are outside of even our unholy grasp. \n\nShipping will be added in a Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends and will be based on the number of products you add to your pledge. But these are the estimates for the pledge levels as they are in this Kickstarter: \nAdditional costs like taxes and/or customs could, but should not, apply.\n\n\u2716 Due to COVID-19 there is a possibility that American backers will receive their stuff a month later than European backers, meaning it might arrive in August. We are doing what we can to avoid this but can't make any promises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are experienced in running successful Kickstarter campaigns and to lower the risks on this one, the majority of the stuff we're offering is already done.

As his lodgings become infested with rodents, and his night-time shifts are disturbed by an unearthly spectre, he must reconcile with the future or have his light extinguished forever.'\nWe're so close to making this project a reality, but we need you to help us raise this \u00a38,000 to make it happen! This Kickstarter campaign is all-or-nothing, so we need to raise the whole \u00a38,000 or we won't get a penny. So please help us hit this funding target by pressing the green button and supporting The Leerie.\nTHE WORLD\nA smog-laden Scottish town with a serious rat problem.\nSituated by a heath lit by gas lamps, it\u2019s a dark, lonely place which seems to be perpetually stuck in midwinter. The heath, where the Leerie works, is an isolated, grey place - relentlessly windy, wet and unforgiving.\nIf we raise this Kickstarter funding, we will be able to to use a combination of smart cinematography, and VFX to transform nearly-period exteriors into viable Victorian locations. \nSTYLE\nThe film will be a stylised, experimental horror, influenced by the photographic style of pictorialism. We are shooting on ALEXA XT B+W, in infrared black and white, and the cinematography will draw inspiration from films such as \u2018Through a Glass Darkly\u2019, \u2018Eraserhead\u2019 and \u2018The Lighthouse\u2019. \nThe dialogue is also written in period accurate Scots dialogue in an effort to sustain a link to the Scots poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson and W. D. Cocker, whose poetry about lamplighters inspired the titular character.\nCOSTUME\nEve Oakley's thorough research has led her to come up with some incredible costume designs. Her ability to steer clear of convention is key to her success as a costume designer, she's able to find innovative ways to breathe life into the repetitive period costumes we're used to seeing.\nFrom the Leerie's shoulder having been repeatedly patched up from the wear of his stick, to the Spirit's costume referencing the style of Edwardian glass dresses (a futuristic fashion concept for 1899), we can't wait to see Eve's designs come to life on screen.  \nPRODUCTION\nWe plan to shoot The Leerie in April of this year, but we won't be able to without your help!\nWe've planned a 4 day shoot. 3 days of which will be in our gorgeously rickety interior location, shooting the scenes set in the Leerie's lodgings. We then have a night shoot planned, when we'll shoot the scenes of the Leerie at work lighting the lamps.\nWe have a funder onboard who intends to grant \u00a315k to the budget, only IF we can secure this final \u00a38,000!\nThis film will not go ahead without this funding. So, only with your support, even as little as \u00a35 or \u00a310, we can make this project happen!\nYour money will go towards costs such as costume making, set dressing to make our locations period (i.e. working gas lamps), location expenses, cast and crew fees, kit hire, our original score by composer Hannah McLoughlin, and making sure our set is COVID secure.\nRELEASE\nOur ambition is for The Leerie to be selected for Raindance Film Festival, London Short Film Festival, and Edinburgh International Film Festival, as well as other BAFTA-qualifying British festivals and horror genre festivals. \nOur goal is also to be shortlisted for the Best British Short award at the British Independent Film Awards.\nOUR TEAM\n\nJoseph is a Director from the Black Country.

What place does your character want to live in, or a secret locations, a haunted building full of monsters or a guild hall for warriors to train. It doesn't even need to be a building!\n\nWould you like to enter your own description, add your own ideas? \nReally? Yes! Tell me more...\nFor the Make 100 Challenge this January,  I thought I could ask you, the backer, to submit your ideas to turn into locations, medieval buildings (or.. see below). These I could turn into a map... a massive collaborative city map (and more).\nLike I did in 2019..\nAfter a phenomenal 1000%+ success of the First Make 100 Fantasy Locations, I was asked repeatedly to go again, this time we've decided on a city map (with sewers!)\nFor More information on the first campaign:\nFor scale, my family shows it off:\nAnd in the Image below, that red box\nAn interesting place, with some very interesting quests.. where will your adventurers go next?\n                   In the end, we did 7 maps!\nSo, for this campaign:\nBased on Medieval maps such as this:\nThis Map is one of many that inspired me.\nI thought it would be fun to draw a range of buildings this time. Like this:\nA stock standard Building to be drawn in this town.. could be your characters house!\nYou'll will give me a description of your building, both inside and out, if its just a house of some medieval folk, adventurers, or a shop of some fantastic kind for players in the campaign..\n\nThat's right, a Campaign to go with the map this time:\n\n The Plot. \nZombies? no, not Zombies.. but Spoilers.. you'll have to find out.\nSo the map will be of a city, under siege, in a fantasy setting. There will be a great wall surrounding the city, key buildings such as apothecary, guild halls, forges and fire pits, but also a myriad of city specific buildings needed in a city under siege. i.e. Your Buildings, that will be the mainstay buildings that not only I draw for you, but make interesting place for players to visit.\nOutside the walls will be a plethora of interesting locations for adventurers to loot, haunted houses to burn down and purge from the monsters. But some still standing, strange and exotic buildings to be explored. Some of which I have pre designed, but you contribute your ideas, your buildings, and even your own boss monsters!\nPlease note, the city image used here, is just the plan/layout, buildings will be drawn in an Isometric form for the map, and possible stretch goals are a 2D facia of the building for the Campaign.  \nIf you just want a copy of this campaigns city Map, to help support the campaign.\nContribute your own idea, some character, small critter, maybe a strange sign, or box, a tentacle from an alley, anything that can be drawn on the street between buildings\nThis City Map and all Prior Maps from the first Campaign, All as PDFs\n Haunted Locations\nAs we've hit the Goal, There's a new Tier, the Haunted Location. \nThe Location includes a Monster of your own design, A building of your own design, but now in ruins as the monster controls it, and of course the map, RPG campaign and stretch goals of this project.\nHaunted Buildings, Outside the city walls, many contain inhabitants.. you decide\nThe Main Pledges\nAs per Make 100, there will only be 100 \"main inner city buildings\" drawn into the map for backers, this time split up into two types:\nThe Main Deal, for Make 100, 80 of these & 20 Deluxe (see below)\nBackers will choose what kind of interesting 'different' building they want to appear inside the city walls, places of note, or interest.. though, I don't mind if you WANT a larger building outside the walls.. its your pledge, do as you want!\n\n\nDeluxe Pledge, Choose from the List or Make up your own\nSo many bits, too much text!!\nThe Original Maps\nIf you're a collector, and want the Original, I can be persuaded to let them go at a sum, I've been told is still too cheap. but, its kickstarter, so I'll leave them here at this price, to help boost the project. \nKickstarter has included the new \"Add-ons' as part of their structure, and I've been fortunate enough to be one of the testers. This way, you don't need to figure out which pledge suits you best, just pledge for what you want first and add on some extras as they suit your desires. \n I've done some head scratching, some spreadsheets, and here's what I have so far:\nIn the first project, each backer increased the sheer size of the map, blowing out the time to collate, organize, arrange and then draw. what was 3 months per map, turned into 9 months per map.\nSo the Stretch goals, will be staggered between digital bonuses, roleplay plot bonuses as much as map bonuses. So every three stretch goals will be a new map of 'part' of the city. This way I can draw, edit and write, depending on life's situation and not miss any targets.\nCongrats, You can now add Ruins & Monsters to pledges, and new backers can back the 'Haunted Location' teir\n YaY! We funded, in 2 hours no less, wow, that was great, thanks everyone! \nMore Art, Extra Art, just making it all look good.\nThe Campaign will now include some of your Easter eggs, as redrawn art, plus some backdrops, such as the one in the banner, included in the rulebook. \nYou push back the metal cover, to reveal an entrance.. shall we go down?\n Wow, Past this stretch goal in the first day, I am so grateful for your support.

Also, all Main locations will be drawn in a larger scale for the campaign book, with extra details, maybe including other backers easter eggs that match the theme.\nA stand alone campaign, or making Blood rain even bigger. PDF Booklet & Cover Art\nYou can get the map of the Sewers and run it as its own campaign for any other game, Real estate pledges will get this as a free add-on. Or choose it either as an add-on, or as your pledge.  \nNow for another Map!\nUsing the art from the Larger Scale Buildings, I'll do the inner city as its own player map handout, so GMs can pass one to the players during the campaign, rather than needing to print out a section of the original. All GM icons/secrets will be gone, and titles will be added to places.\nWe managed to hit $5k.. So, I'll spend the months and months that it takes to draw this map.. in COLOUR, after the last colour map, I know I'll need a physio therapist [joke], but It'll be worth it.. \n\nTaking the Lovely Sewer map, I'll be redrawing in Colour, not that your players should be looking at it.. well, let them, after they die horribly and never want to play in this campaign again..  \nLets go Deeper, everyone gets a Dungeon Room and a Monster as Add-ons\nOne half of the city, as a zoomed in Map.\nSouth Half of the city, as a zoomed in map\n\nSocial Goals:\nAll Main buildings in the book, as a Sepia Toned Image\nThis is unlocked, I just forgot to make a graphic\n\nSocial Stretch Goals, 300 backers, I'll be giving out bonus Easter Eggs\n350 Backers, everyone who has some kind of building gets an extra basement/sewer\n 400 Backers, Lets fill out those dungeons with some Monsters.. everyone gets a bonus Monster\n450 Backers, Traps!

I'll then create a web-store to sell the spares, no discount there, full price. RRP$199+\nMore Stretch Goals? \nBeing a Live a developing Kickstart project, I'll respond in the comments, and we can vote on what stretch goals interest you more. \nIf you're creative, backers can add descriptions of their buildings and the interiors, which will be included in both the map PDF and the roleplay rules PDF. Of course, they do need to match the fantasy genre and avoid profanity, and I reserve the right to (collaboratively) change anything that doesn't match. (in a comical way)\nFurther more, I'll add a note box for everyone to participate in the campaign in their own way, if they so wish, adding an NPC or a monster description, an artefact hidden in a house, or a keepsake, found tucked away in a forgotten house. \nJust like in the first project, with social media:\nfacebook, \ndiscord and \ntwitch, \nI'll be hosting live videos as I draw, discussions online and regular weekly reveals.\nThe time to draw each map, can be upwards of 3 months, so I will usually have a monthly live stream. Other users of the map sometimes pop into discussions in discord or twitch to discuss what they've been using the map for, and I've been building up a small back history of the original, so lets hope we can continue this for the city map, adding in your ideas. \nBased on the first project, The Final cost of that project was actually a lot higher than the $250 goal I set for that (albiet that was for a A2 sized map) the costs of paper ($100 for the roll, $25 delivery), scanning large prints x 5 ($20 each test) & test prints x 10($50 for each test), The collection of markers I went through ($100), plus colour markers and copics ($250) for the colour maps, plus the very minimum time it takes to draw out 100 items, I arrived at this more realistic price point. Its set for the Make 100 goal.  As the project grows and people want more, I understand the time to draw will multiply, but I'm more interested in doing the project than raising funds. \n[edit] Because we have funded, and also have unlocked map stretch goals, I'll have to invest in yet another set of copic refils for the sepia and colour maps, yet I'll look into getting higher quality paper, inks and maybe some wax seals to increase and improve the quality of the final maps. \nShipping\nThere are some small add-ons which may require shipping. These will be discussed after the campaign, between you and me, mostly I don't expect a rolled up tube to cost much more than $25, if it does, we'll find a cost effective solution. Likely it'd be cheaper to have it printed in your city & country, and have them post it to you.

So much so that through the years I've built a number of software-based games for the web, mobile devices, and things like the Amazon Alexa (games that people from all over the world have played and hopefully enjoyed). However this is my first attempt at making some of my 'homegrown, offline, games' available to a wider audience (that is to people beyond my small circle of friends and family).\nBecause this is my first attempt at doing something like this, I wanted my offering to be something that was affordable, fun, and accessible to players of all ages and levels -- so I designed everything to fit into one standard poker size tuck box, included as many variations of game play as I could think of (making sure I also had some single player options), and set the price as low as I possibly could.\nI'm excited about what I've come up with! But more than anything, I hope that YOU enjoy these games and that they bring many smiles, and much fun, to you through the years.\nSo what are the games you'll get? Who are they designed for? How long will they take to play? How do you actually win each and what comes included?\nI'm glad you finally asked!\nThe Games:\nEach deck includes 100 total cards and comes with a detailed instruction booklet that outlines the specifics of setup, game play, winning/losing the games, and answers all your questions about any special situations that may come up.\nIn all, there are currently 6 variations of the games you can play with this deck:\n FUBNUB traditional (4 players)\n BAD, BAD, TURTLE traditional (1 to 4 players)\n FUBNUB lucky ghost (1 to 3 players)\n FUBNUB battle royal (2 to 4 players)\n FUBNUB battle royal with lucky ghosts (1 to 4 players)\n FUBNUB full deck (1 to 4 players)\nLet's take a quick, high-level, look at each of the core games (including some pictures of a few prototype cards).\nFUBNUB   \nFubnub cards\n FUBNUB is designed for 1 to 4 players ages 10+. The average play time is about 20 minutes.\nFUBNUB is a strategy based, trick-taking, card game primarily designed for team play. Loosely inspired by the game of Euchre, FUBNUB introduces some unique dealer advantages and a variety of point cards that help to make the game easy to learn, fun to play, and a fresh new challenge with every hand.\nThe winner is the first team to collect 7 of the 15 point cards. \nPoint Cards\n FUBNUB is meant for the slightly more serious card players who are looking for a good game night game for the family or something that could be played with friends in bar (if we're ever able to safely go back to that sort of thing).\nTo play FUBNUB you simply remove the cards marked with the BBT symbol.\nBAD, BAD, TURTLE   \nBad, Bad, Turtle Action Cards\n BAD, BAD, TURTLE is designed for 2 to 4 players ages 5+. The average play time is about 10 minutes.\nBAD, BAD, TURTLE is a quick-paced, easy game that requires you to have more luck than your opponents do. Equally inspired by the card games 'War', 'Uno', and 'Exploding Kittens', BAD, BAD, TURTLE includes a mix of features from each of those games plus a number of its own little wrinkles to make for just the right amount of silly fun in every game.\nThe winner is the player who avoids all the geckos and is the first to find the turtle.\nBAD, BAD, TURTLE is meant for the younger and more casual card player (though I hope players of all ages find it addictively fun too). It's quick, easy, and requires nothing more than a bit of good luck to win.\nTo play BAD, BAD, TURTLE you simply remove the FUBNUB point deck cards.\nThe Rewards:\nThe core reward I am offering in this campaign is the FUBNUB & BAD, BAD, TURTLE set of cards itself. The number of decks you get will depends on the specific reward you choose to back, but this is what a prototype of each card included in every set currently looks like:\nFull Deck of Cards\nNOTE: Some card designs may change or be added to prior to printing (especially if anyone decides to back the 'subtitle a card' reward).\nThe Super fan reward also includes a t-shirt so you can help show off your super fandom.  This is what the shirt will look like:\nSuperfan t-shirt reward\nThe back of the shirt, where your shell would normally be, says \"I shelled out for FUBNUB & BAD, BAD, TURTLE\" (side note: my son calls this \"the most dad joke ever!\", which of course just makes me love it even more)\nThe \"your name in print\" reward will include your name in the thank you section of the instruction booklet that will come with each set. The thank you section will be in the back section of the booklet and your name will be printed in black and white.\nAnd finally, the \"collectors deck\" reward will include a sticker on one of the decks with Kevin's signature (hand written, hopefully legibly, with a sharpie).\nThe card and box details:\nThe cards are standard poker deck size (2.5\" by 3.5\") and will be printed on Blue Core Standard paper stock (280 GSM).  For added playability and quality, they'll include a linen texture.\nEach deck will come packaged in a standard tuck box and include a full color instruction booklet that explains setup and gameplay for each game (and the alternate game play options).\nThe stretch goals:\nAs much as possible, I tried to design the core deck with everything I could think of to make the games fun, quick, and easy to pick up and play. After much research, I choose the printer,  card stock, box type, and instruction book format to be a good balance of affordability and quality.\nAll of that means that, with or without any of these stretch goals, every deck should be packed with good value. But I've also identified a few things that I think will make every deck just a little better...and hopefully a fun number of tasks you can all help me achieve to be able to afford to include them.\nHere's a graphic that breaks it all down (In case you need it, there are text write-ups with more detail below the graphic)\nStretch Goals\nNote: When helping with any achievements please be sure to tag Fubnub in any posts (so we can make sure it gets counted). Here are the details and links for each:\nOn Twitter: @fubnub (you can follow us via https://twitter.com/fubnub)\nOn Facebook: @DigDownLabs (you can follow us via https://www.facebook.com/DigDownLabs)\nOn Instagram: @fubnubandbadbadturtle (you can follow us via https://www.instagram.com/fubnubandbadbadturtle)\nOur Kickstarter campaign link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/falicon/fubnub-and-bad-bad-turtle (like the map says, you are here!)\nFinally here are some more details on the stretch goal rewards mentioned in the graphic:\nIf we can achieve 2 goals (UNLOCKED!):\nWe'll be able to upgrade from a Blue Core 280 GSM card stock (used for things like Magic: The Gathering and Pok\u00e9mon) to the Black Core 310 GSM (the standard for poker cards because of its high opacity).\nThe material for Black Core 310 GSM is manufactured in Germany and comes pre-textured with a linen texture (the texture adds ridges that reduce surface contact between cards, making them easier to shuffle, deal and handle).\nIf we can achieve 4 goals (UNLOCKED):\nWe'll be able to DOUBLE the number of BAD, BAD, TURTLE action cards that come with every deck. Allowing for slightly longer games and even more chaotic fun with each play!\nIf we can achieve 6 goals (UNLOCKED):\nWe'll be able to introduce at least eight (8) more BAD, BAD, TURTLE action cards into the mix (and you'll get 2x each of them). These action cards will add a number of unique twists and giggles to every game play (if we approach this reward, more details on specific cards that will be included will be released in another update)\nIf we can achieve 8 goals:\nWe'll be able to upgrade from the standard tuck box (what a standard deck of cards comes in) to a two-piece card box (what larger card sets and more traditional games come in).\nIf we can achieve 10 goals:\nWe'll upgrade the card stock to the top of the line card stock - White PVC Luxury with a 0.3mm thickness. The 0.3 mm card thickness makes it possible to shuffle them as you would with regular cards and the material is highly flexible and virtually impossible to rip by hand.\nBecause the PVC card stock isn\u2019t made out of paper, drink spills and food bits will no longer be a problem \u2013 which makes this card a great option for parties and kids. You can even play them in the pool!\nThe deep backstory (a.k.a. the lore):\nNone of what follows is really important to the campaign or the games themselves, but for those of you curious about the complete backstory on the ideas and motivation for this deck...here goes:\nGrowing up in the rural Erie, PA area the small, local bars were often the social hangouts (and during my childhood my father owned one of them, The Sundown in Fairview, PA).\nAnyway, playing various card games was always just one of the things that everyone did at any social gathering. And one of the most popular games to play (especially in the bars) at that time was a game called Euchre.\nFast forward to 2020, and the year of quarantine.\nMy family and I had family game night at least once a week throughout the year. One night, when it was my turn to choose the game, I decided to try and teach them the game of Euchre.\nLong story short - we played it, but none of them loved it (def. teacher error as Euchre is a great game).\nAnyway, around the same time that the 'Marshall Euchre debacle of 2020' occurred, I happened to catch the documentary 'Gamemaster'.\nHaving dabbled with various software based games throughout the years (with some limited success), and really enjoying the family game nights throughout the year, it got me thinking about the idea of creating my own, real world game.\nIt looked like fun, and it felt like something I could do. But what game could I make?\nI had a lot of 'ideas' in the back of my head from various software games I had not gotten around to building (or finishing) yet, but a lot of them felt more complex than I what I was looking for here.\nAs I thought about game ideas, my mind kept wandering back to the troubles I had in explaining Euchre to new players. Maybe there was something I could do to make it easier?\nThat's when the idea for the 'point deck' started to form. And from there, as I started to define the details of it and test play it, an entirely new game started to form. A game that would become the 'traditional' version of FUBNUB.\nOnce I had the core game figure out, I started to think about what else I could do with the deck and the rules. What alternate versions of play could I think of? What if you don't have four players? What if you only have one?\nI started to work through each of those problems, defining the rules, explaining the setup, and of course play testing each option...but I still had one nagging problem.\nEvery version of FUBNUB I came up with was still a bit complex and involved.\nIt probably wasn't going to be a game little kids could play (which is often a good portion of any 'family unit' and I really wanted this to be something for all families).\nIn researching how to get card games printed, I had found a printer that looked promising, and as it turned out b/c of how the cards get printed, the cost to print a deck of 24 cards (all that FUBNUB required) was the same as the cost to print a deck of 54 cards.\nSo I started thinking about what cards I could add to the deck to have an option for younger players...and that's where the general idea of BAD, BAD, TURTLE started to form.\nTo be honest, in my head it was orig. thought up as Bad, bad, kitty. But IMHO cats are overused right now, so I was going to make it Bad, bad, puppy. However, when I dug into my artwork source, I didn't find any puppy artwork I liked.\nInstead, I found a really cute Turtle (and once I saw that, I immediately fell in love with the title BAD, BAD, TURTLE -- a bad turtle is more fun to think about than a bad kitty or puppy any day, and it's more fun to say too).\nFrom there it was just a matter of thinking up some 'action cards' that would be easy, fun, and ideally a little unique. What I came up with is what you see described above.\nSo there you have it - All the lore behind FUBNUB & BAD, BAD, TURTLE.\nIf you actually read through all of that, wow, thank you! I hope it excites you enough to back the project, and I hope the project delights you enough to share with friends & family.\nBut most of all, with or without these games, I hope you have many fun family game nights ahead too!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first attempt at printing up a deck of cards -- so there will be a number of potential challenges.\n\nI've identified a printer that comes highly recommended and has a good history of delivering a high-quality product on time and within budget...but, especially in the current world-climate, there is always a risk that it will take longer to print and ship than I initially expect (I do have a slightly more expensive printer identified that I can fall back to if any significant delays or challenges occur).\n\nBecause this is also my first kickstarter experience, and I wanted to make things as simple as possible, I'm including shipping in the price for all U.S. locations and only adding $2 to help cover any international shipping.

So, let the Peeved Paisleys do it for you.\nThe design of this bandana features oodles of paisleys who are clearly peeved, aggravated, and irked. \nA seemingly serene symmetrical design contains plenty of peeveded paisleys.\nLike my previous BADbandanas, I\u2019m going to reproduce this drawing as a 21-inch square bandana. With white paisleys on a dignified gray background, these bandanas will be 100 percent cotton printed right here in the good-old USA using duplex printing like the quality bandanas I grew up with. (Dyed\u2014not that obnoxious silkscreening we all hate.)\nWhat do you get? Each bandana contains a couple dozen annoyed paisleys combined in a serenely symmetrical composition that is an homage to the classic bandanas of the past.\nPackage of three. (Makes a great gift.)\nPacked in sets of three so you\u2019ll have spares for gift giving. Bandanas make convenient masks to discourage inconvenient viruses and they have many uses in fashion, personal hygiene, and pet decoration. No one is going to want just one. So I\u2019m offering reward levels of BADbandanas in packs of three.\n\nDon says, \u201cI love traditional bandanas but they need more pizzazz. I doubt you have any bandanas in your drawer quite like this\u2014peeved paisleys!\u201d \nBADbandanas make superb gifts. Even if you aren\u2019t a big fan of bandanas, you may want to get a bunch to share. Great gifts for friends, family, neighbors who are angry, annoyed, or vexed.\nDo you need a reminder of how you can use your BADbandanas?\nDon and dog model BADbandana uses. (Don\u2019s the one wearing glasses.)\n\nWhat the critics are saying...\n \u201cA perfect expression of my current mood. This design is ideal for these troubled times.\u201d \n\u201cOne can never have too many clean bandanas.\u201d\n \u201cExcellent gift for friends\u2014especially those who are miffed...and who isn\u2019t?\u201d \n \u201cIs that pizza sauce on your chin? No problem. Mop it up with your BADbandana.\u201d\n \u201cA perfect blend of silly and practical. An enhancement to any wardrobe.\u201d \n\nSCHEDULE\nLightning fast. If there are no calamities, you should have your BADbandanas by April, 2021. Perhaps sooner. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds.\nSHIPPING\nJust the local neighborhood. Because shipping is extra slow and troublesome these days, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, some extras of these BADbandanas will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Peeved Paisleys there.\nTracking. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring your Peeved Paisleys during their next trip.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\n\nLOOSE ENDS\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nThanks for your amazing support.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain.\nDon\u2014Pittsburgh, January 6, 2021", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe basic techniques of making bandanas are centuries old.

Panic seizes top players, equipment companies and the tennis authorities.  \nControversy swells to a crescendo; the future of tennis itself is at stake... \nWith a colourful cast mixing offbeat unknowns and legends like Ilie Nastase and John McEnroe, this is a quixotic tale of dreams, triumph and disaster in the golden era of tennis.\n\nTHE HISTORY  \nIn 1977, tennis was entering the golden age of Borg, Connors and McEnroe. During the summer, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) began receiving reports about a mysterious new force on the circuit. Major tournaments were complaining of upsets, with seeds losing to lowly-ranked players using a strange double-strung system on their rackets.\nAt the US Open, Mike Fishbach, \"an amply-bearded refugee from the satellite circuit\", pulled off the biggest shock of the tournament. Using a racket double-strung with gut, fishing line, tape and twine, Fishbach trounced top player Stan Smith.\nMichael Fishbach\nBack in the halcyon days of \u201877, there were no restrictions on racket design. That same year, the US Tennis Association President, Slew Hester had asserted you could play \u201c...with a tomato can on a broomstick, if you think you can win with it.\u201d  But the authorities soon revealed a more draconian side in response to the Spaghetti racket threat.\nWerner Fischer\nThe origins of the crisis went back to 1971, when Werner Fischer, a gardener from the hamlet of Vilsbiburg in Germany invented a new stringing system. With its intricate, double-strung weave and unique mix of special cements and nylon tubes, the \u201cSpaghetti\u201d racket produced unexpected spin and bounce.\nSoon, the local tennis team, which had until then languished in the lower divisions of the German League, began to win matches. By 1977, the obscure part-timers had achieved an unprecedented four successive promotions. They had risen, against all the odds, to the pinnacle of German tennis - the Bundesliga. \nThe 1977 Vilsbiburg Team\nNews of Fischer's invention and its success quickly spread. Following Mike Fishbach's run at the 1977 US Open, there was an explosion of interest on the professional tour.  \nAt the Paris Open, the following week, George Goven, another Spaghetti racket devotee, dumped tennis great Ilie Nastase out of the tournament. \nIncensed, Nastase called on the ITF to ban the racket, declaring that from now on, he would refuse to play against anyone using one. Yet, at the next tournament in Aix-en-Provence, in typical Nastase-fashion, the mischievous Romanian arrived, armed with his own set of Spaghetti Rackets.\nThe tournament at Aix was a wake-up call for the ITF.  Three of the semi-finalist, including  Nastase, were using the Spaghetti racket, with only World No. 1 Guillermo Vilas keeping faith with the traditional racket. \nIn the final, Vilas, who was unplayable that year, and was on a record unbeaten run of 53 matches on clay and 46 on all surfaces, faced Nastase. \nIlie Nastase and Guillermo Vilas\nBilled as the old racket versus the new racket, the final turned out to be a one-sided affair. \nFinding no answers to the power and accuracy of a Spaghetti racket-wielding Nastase, Vilas abandoned the match, and walked off court in disgust.\nThe Spaghetti racket had finally come of age, but not for long... \nThe ITF made a crushing response. For the first time in seven centuries, the laws of tennis were changed to define \u201c the tennis racket\u201d.\nThe new rule was carefully drafted to outlaw the Spaghetti racket and only the Spaghetti racket. The ITF didn't ban another contemporary innovation, one that was being promoted by someone with considerably more contacts, cash and clout than a Bavarian gardener. \nHoward Head\nAfter making his fortune pioneering laminated skis, Howard Head retired at the end of the 60\u2019s and took up tennis. He spent $5,000 on lessons but was so inept that his local pro soon refused to teach him. Undettered, Head simply decided to build a new racket. In \u201874, after a dozen unsuccessful prototypes, Head woke up from a dream with a 'Eureka' flash of genius telling him to \u201cmake it bigger\u201d.\n Head's new \u201cPrince\u201d racket was lighter than its wooden forerunners, easier to swing, boasted a larger sweet spot and greater power. Unlike Fischer's racket, which was difficult to master, the Prince was a 'cheat', a racket which made the sport easier to play. It promised to popularize tennis and was hugely attractive to big business.\nThere was widespread criticism that the Prince racket would adversely affect the sport, but the ITF allowed it, whilst outlawing the Spaghetti. This was despite the Spaghetti racket being merely a clever re-configuration of the stringing surface, compared to Howard Head's top-down redesign of the racket itself.\nWhile Head\u2019s racket took over tournament play, starting with Pam Shriver reaching the US Open final in 1978, the ITF moved to end Fischer\u2019s hopes.\nDuring a court case in Omaha, technical demonstrations and player testimony were used to prove that Spaghetti stringing spoiled the \u2018character\u2019 of tennis. Meanwhile Head, a businessman of genius and a regular on popular TV talk shows, played the system for all it was worth.\n\nTHE SPAGHETTI RACKET tells this David-and- Goliath tale with humour and nostalgia, through the remarkable personalities involved and memorable actuality from that golden age of tennis. Through the central story, we illuminate wider issues such as the relationship between technology and sport. We also address controversial questions: Why was one invention judged more dangerous to the sport than the other? Was it simple economics, or were other forces at play...? And how has the outcome affected tennis today? \nSince the Prince appeared, racket technology has irrevocably changed the sport. John McEnroe and other  former players have often lamented how tennis is now dominated by power unimaginable in previous eras.\nMeanwhile, it was McEnroe who played the last ever match at Wimbledon with a \u201cnormal-sized\u201d wooden racket in 1982. Oversized composite rackets began to roll off the production line in their millions, and Werner Fischer went back to tending his plants.\nOUR STORY\nContemplating how to get the project over the finish line and promoting it at Wimbledon\nI had a vague memory of the the Spaghetti Racket as a tennis-obsessed child growing up in 1970s Iran. \nOne minute there was news of this invincible, Excalibur-like racket toppling top seeds at tournaments and then nothing. It was as if it had disappeared off the face of the earth. \nAfter visiting the Wimbledon Museum and seeing the racket in the flesh for the first time, my interest was piqued. \nI wrote a treatment and shopped the project around, but at the time no one was interested, few even believed the story to be true. \nBy this time, the story had well and truly gotten under my skin. I persuaded my brother and an old school-friend to help me make the film. \nIt took us two years to track down the inventor, Werner Fischer and another six months to persuade him to trust us to tell his story. \nWhat finally clinched the deal was me  promising to have a finished film within the year.\nWhat I hadn't factored in was the cost of the archive. Sports archive is staggeringly expensive. As a consequence, the film has been a state of semi-finished limbo for the past four years. \nDuring this time we've had interest from the BBC among others, but the cost of the archive has always been a stumbling block.\nDuring lockdown, I persuaded Mr Fischer that we should take our project to the internet. Perhaps with a lot of luck and a little strategy, we could reach out to the global tennis community and rally them around this forgotten yet colorful slice of tennis history. \nWerner Fischer\nEXTERNAL LINKS\nhttps://www.theracketsurgery.com/blog/11-spaghetti-stringing-part-1 \n https://www.theracketsurgery.com/blog/12-spaghetti-stringing-part-2 \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0lJOd6Z6e0 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe money we are asking for will go towards paying for the archive and finishing post-production.

These last years I carried out several interventions in public space in Heraklio, Athens, Paris, New-York. \n https://www.linardaki-parisot.com/the-sleeping-project \nWhether large murals or more discreet interventions, it is always about to melt in the environment but also to surprise the passers-by, make them doubt and modify their eyes on their place of life.\nMy project is to paint a mural on one of the walls of the natural history museum of Crete (Greece) facing the sea.\nAnd also create a series of visual art workshops with children and adolescents around this project.\nwall of the natural history museum of Crete Heraklion (Greece) facing the sea.\nthe wall is 5 meter high.\nwallpainting project\n\nABOUT THE WALLPAINTING\nMy painting project for the museum is called the colossus.\nThe idea comes from several sources.\nThe use of the animal (the monkey) which is connected with the natural history museum.\nIt is a monkey made of gray faux marble that is found in Crete.\nHe is standing with both feet on an amphora so we can see him from far \nlike the colossus.\nThe position of the right hand carried over the eyes of the monkey comes from a bronze Minoan statuette which represents an Adorant of a type frozen \u201cstanding attention\u201d garde a vous, to protect them from the divine glare, it is said.\nOr to protect is eyes from the sun as I thought\n\nthe colossus, Vincent Parisot\nThis painting is also part of a series called \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd.\nIt\u2019s s series of drawings and paintings called Marmaromaimou (marble monkey)\nI draw faux marble forms and effects in the shape of monkeys. The drawings will be installed in the manner of a fresco thus creating different scenes. The idea of this project comes from the observation of the frescoes of the archaeological museum of Heraklion in Crete where I was in residence. The word Maimou (monkey) in Greek is used to say that something is a imitation that I find interesting in co-relation with my faux marble technique.\n\nWHY IS THIS IMPORTANT ?\nI may not be an essential workers, but I am a cultural worker.\nCulture is important it connects people and it's a tool for change.\nAs an artist it is also my responsibility to be part of the community.\nWe must now act local to think global, the ecological crisis pushes us there.\n\nThe natural history museum has been seriously impacted by the pandemic crisis.\nIt's a part of my daily life, it is next to the Agia Triada district where I live. My children went there regularly with their school and during the holidays to do workshops. The museum plays a key role in the city, it is not only a place to discover the history of nature but also it has a strong cultural and social impact.\n\nMy goal is not to create a decor but to realize an on-site project made especially for the museum with different local references. My contribution is a way to highlight this place and create a dialogue with the neighborhood.\n\nABOUT THE MUSEUM\nThe main concern of the Natural History Museum of Crete - University of Crete (UoC-NHMC) is to broaden the visitor experience of the museum. Young scientists (biologists, foresters, farmers, ecologists and geologists among others) are always present in the museum to answer visitors' questions.\nIn recent years, the Museum has redefined its vocation as a meeting place between science and culture. In this context, it dares to experiment its activities in response to the challenges of modern society by achieving the demanding balance between heritage and innovation.\nthe museum\nHOW YOU CAN HELP THE PROJECT\nFor me to carry out the project I would need 600 euros.\nThe museum cannot help me financially but they can give me technical help and scaffolding.\nI ask you to participate in the painting budget\nI need to use good quality paint and resin based products because the wall is near the sea. This requires more coating and therefore more work.\nAnother part of this budget will be devoted to a series of workshops with children and adolescents. There are two huge banners at the entrance of the museum, the idea is to draw with the children all the footprints of the animals in the museum and then paint them on the banners, using stencils, thus referring to the origin of art.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT\nsunburn, le coup du soleil, chalk, Lisses, France, 2016, Vincent Parisot\nWHEN\nThe wall painting in early April 2021 when it doesn't rain anymore\nand workshops after the situation returns to normal.\n\nTHE REWARDS\n \u20ac15 - \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 / Digital print / A4 / Vincent Parisot.\n\n\u20ac15 - \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 / Digital print / A4 / Vincent Parisot.\n\u20ac15 - \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 / Digital print / A4 / Vincent Parisot.\n\n \u20ac25 - Blind sunrise / 2016 / Digital print / A3 / Vincent Parisot.\n\n \u20ac50 - I cried a river over you / 2020 / Digital print / A3 / Linardaki - Parisot. \n\n \u20ac50 - Borderligne / 2016 / Digital print / A3 / Vincent Parisot.\n\u20ac300 - the kiss / 2020 / acrylic paint on paper / 42x60cm / Vincent Parisot .", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am confident that the wallpainting will proceed smoothly and that if my fundraiser is successful,\nI will be able to paint the wall in April 2021, because it is not subject to COVID-19 regulations.\n\nHowever, given the current situation, there might be delays in producing and/or shipping photos and painting, as unexpected lockdowns.\n\nFor the workshops with children and adolescents it will be possible only after the situation returns to normal.\n\nTHANKS A LOT \nvincent\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 /", "descp": "digital print / A4", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Blind sunrise / 2016 /", "descp": "Digital print / A3", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "I cried a river over you / 2020 /", "descp": "Digital print / A3", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Borderligne / 2016 /", "descp": "Digital print / A3", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac300 or more", "title": "the kiss / 2020 /", "descp": "Acrylic paint on paper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (1 left of 2)"]}], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "31 backers pledged \u20ac1,438"}, {"Project launches": "DECEMBER 19, 2020"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vincent75/the-colossus", "project_name": "The colossus"}}, {"backer": "Tieg Zaharia", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "More than three years ago, Hex & Company opened our doors on the Upper West Side as Manhattan's largest board game cafe. We've since held thousands of D&D and Magic: The Gathering games, hosted uncountable date nights and parties, and served tens of thousands of drinks!\nThen the pandemic hit, and our mission became incredibly challenging. But we're hitting back even harder, gladly sending off 2020- and preparing for 2021 to be our biggest year yet. We're moving into a new location a couple of blocks north, doubling in size, and creating a flagship community space that will be able to host over 200 people. \nFor a $10 seating fee, you have access to our library of games- more than a thousand. It's also a place where you can eat, drink, and buy your favorite titles.\nA Piece of History. We're moving into 2911 Broadway- the former home of the West End Bar, dating back to 1911! It served as the base for the Beat Poets, and is \"where Columbia had its first beer\".\nLGBTQ- and Family-Friendly. Our place has always been a safe space for everyone! In addition to keeping a large number of family-oriented games in our library, we also offer family and kids-only programming. We'll be continuing our wildly successful after-school and summer camp programs, and even expanding them in light of all the new space.\nEven More Events. We're bringing our existing Magic: The Gathering and tabletop RPG communities up north too! Plus, we're adding private areas, multiple TVs for the best tournament experience in the area, and expanded A/V capabilities too. The West End was a longtime home for jazz and live music, and we're hoping to expand on that legacy by adding a stage and supporting the arts in a way we haven't been able to before. \nBetter Food. We\u2019re REALLY excited about our new kitchen- and expanding our menu. We\u2019re working with an experienced team who will focus solely on food, bringing together proven menu concepts from around the world (literally).\nGreat Drinks. We're proud to support local favorites Brooklyn Roasting Company coffee/espresso and Harney & Sons tea. Beer and cider enthusiasts have always found a home at our current location and we'll now have twelve draft lines to work with. Plus, we're adding a cocktail menu and milkshakes-  they've been super-successful at our East side location, which opened last year with a little help from a Kickstarter project then.\nWe're a small local business, and every dime donated goes straight into finishing our space! Our new Upper West Side venue is happening no matter what, but we're hoping to add amenities including private rooms- and even a stage to support arts and connect with The West End's history as a jazz venue.

J.R.R. and Edith Tolkien moved into 20 Northmoor Road with their young family in 1930. Over the next 17 crucial years the house was the heart of the Tolkien home. It was here that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, which he had begun as a bedtime story for his children, and followed that with another unexpected journey. That book became The Lord of the Rings.\nWe set up the not-for-profit Project Northmoor to achieve this. A significant part of the capital has already been raised but we need a new push to achieve our target. If the house is secured for Tolkien fans, it will be renovated so that the guest can experience what it would have been like to call on the Professor in 1940.  \nJ R R Tolkien\nUpstairs the bedrooms would reflect the cultures he invented and the garden would be restored to a beauty of which the inventor of Sam Gamgee would be proud.\nYou would then be able to be a guest at the Centre by booking into its programme of writing seminars and other cultural events, or join in virtually with the online programme.The creative courses will focus will be on inspiring a new generation of fantasy writers, film makers and artists. Other courses will introduce visitors to Tolkien and his circle, including visiting the places that inspired him.\n Following in Tolkien\u2019s footsteps: creative writing in Oxford: A 5-day program in Oxford will consist of daily sessions with a tutor, ample hobbit-sized breakfasts (and second breakfasts!), walks in places that inspired Tolkien, evenings in the pub, and a group discussion for everyone who would like to share their work.\nIn future years, we will add similar courses for filmmakers and illustrators.\nOxford\n Walking and writing in the Shire: This course can be booked as a 3-day extension to the creative writing course or as a separate course for those with a general interest in Tolkien. They are aimed at those who want to travel further afield in England to see the places that inspired J.R.R. Tolkien. The participants will spend the day with a tour guide, exploring important places or landscapes that inspired Tolkien.\n3000 year-old White Horse\nOtmoor - home to Father Giles of Ham\nWarwick Castle\n Fantasy Writers Course Online: An online fantasy writers\u2019 creative writing course with published authors as your tutors. You would receive one-to-one tutorials, talks on plotting, character, pacing, dialogue and other elements of writing, and join in our seminars and socials.\nYou can find out more details, including provisional dates for these courses already. Just go here and register your interest today! Due to the pandemic, the online course is likely to happen first but we are hoping in-person courses can begin in the summer.\n\nYou will also be able to book to stay in the house for B&B when the bedrooms are not used for courses. Come and enjoy the beautiful city of Oxford and spend time in Tolkien's study, contemplating the garden in which he spent so much time.\nThe house\nThe house has seven bedrooms already, including one with disabled access. The floor plan is unchanged since Tolkien's time. It is perfect for small groups to stay. Downstairs, Tolkien's study is the largest room, stretching the width of the house, and would provide an inspiring teaching space, just as he used to welcome students at home.\nUpstairs at 20 Northmoor\nThe house will be financially self-sustaining once purchased, thanks to income from visitors. There will also be special events in the house and talks for guests about Tolkien and his circle.\n\nThe team behind the initiative are volunteers from the UK, US, Canada and South Africa. Leading the project is multi-award-winning author and Tolkien fan, Julia Golding. She has written over 60 novels for all ages in many different genres. You can find out more about her here. Her love for Tolkien began with reading The Lord of the Rings when she was ten and she hasn't stop since. \nShe is assisted on Joss Saunders, one of the UK's leading charity lawyers. His grandfather was a friend of Tolkien, as well as his squash partner, when they were young academics at Leeds University in the 1920s. As a result, Tolkien's books were family favourites from the date of first publication.\nLeading the way in North America, is Brian Boyd, who has 30+ years experience in marketing.\nAnd in Canada, we have Kevin Harwood, digital marketing expert and experienced user of Kickstarter on other projects.\nSo please join the Fellowship of Funders today.\n\nJoin the Fellowship of Funders\n Rewards\nHere's a little taste of some of the rewards you can claim, going from a few pounds to a few thousand!  If you are interested in a bigger involvement which could bring rewards such as naming rights to rooms or the centre itself, please go to www.projectnorthmoor.org/rewards\nIf you pick a stay in the house, please note most rooms are doubles so the pledge can cover a couple or two single friends willing to share. Please note, a warden will also be living in the house so will act as your host in all stay-overs.\n You can also add some of these as add-ons to your pledge, but if you wish to pick a physical product (such as the bookmark) after a digital reward (such as the tour), please increase your pledge and let us know in a message that is what it is for because the Kickstarter add-on system does not yet let you add a physical to digital reward.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is that someone else will buy it before we can raise the money.

A Shinto priestess, Hiroko, guides us through this unique philosophy, which is based on gratitude and connection to the kami - the energy of nature.\n      Kami are manifestations of the interconnecting energy of the universe. Usually hidden from this world, they inhabit a complementary existence that mirrors our own. Sometimes we can feel them in the elements of landscape or forces of nature. When you reach a harmony with awe-inspiring aspects of nature, then you are conscious of the way of the kami.\nPROTAGONIST\n      Hiroko Takayama is a priestess at the Dazaifu Tenmangu - a shrine dedicated to the kami of learning, culture and arts. \n      Hiroko was an IBM employee for 10 years. Only when she became a priestess, did she start to truly appreciate the nature surrounding her. Now she frequently goes on trips to the mountains surrounding Fukuoka, the city she lives in.\nDIRECTOR'S STATEMENT\n      From an early age, I was fascinated by Japanese culture and pop-culture. During my last two visits to Japan (in 2010 and 2017), I noticed that their native philosophy, Shinto, has influence over nearly every aspect of the country, from culture to everyday life. I would like to create a film about that philosophy. A philosophy which has such an amazing influence on life in a country that interests me.\n      I have always liked spending time in natural environments. However, only when I started filming this project, did I realise that there may be some deeper connection between us and nature. The connection which is being gradually lost in an evermore industrialized world. This connection became even more apparent to me - and I believe to all of us - during these days of the pandemic. \n      We're almost done! Then along came the coronavirus. Please help us cross the finish line and release this film!\nBENEFITS OF WATCHING THIS FILM\n      You, just like me, may begin to realize that there is more to nature than meets the eye. Thanks to this film, when lockdown ends you may be better equipped to start experiencing the wonders of nature again. As for now, you can experience the beautiful and exotic nature of Japan through our film.\nWHY IS THIS FILM PROJECT UNIQUE?\nShinto has been largely inaccessible to documentary filmmakers - until now. \nOur guide in the film is a Shinto priestess, Hiroko. For a woman to be a Shinto priestess is an extremely rare profession.\nWe document the transition from Heisei to Reiwa period. This transition was marked by a private Shinto ceremony attended by only about 10 priests and our film crew.\nThe film will try to convey the meaning of Shinto through images and sounds. There are very few scenes with dialogue. \nThis is a documentary film, but it is shot with cinematic-quality images, 4K resolution and high-end camera.\nFILMING LOCATIONS\nThis project was filmed in and around the city of Fukuoka in Japan. The three main locations were:\nDazaifu Tenmangu shrine: https://www.dazaifutenmangu.or.jp/en/ \nHakozaki Shrine: https://www.hakozakigu.or.jp/ \nShikaumi Shrine: http://www.shikaumi-jinja.jp/ \nPROJECT COMPLETION STATUS & WHY KICKSTARTER\nWe finished filming in Japan in 2019. (All the stills used on this page are from the material we shot then.)\nCurrently we are at a stage of editing the film.\nWe financed filming in Japan and part of the postproduction process.

It's 50 years later, I've had Oscar nominations and won Cannes Festival awards, and it's time to fulfill a boyhood dream.\nThree years ago, I wrote out a storyboard about a slide guitar-playing cowboy named Slide who appears in a corrupt logging town (circa 1940's) to battle a pair of evil twins and save the village of Sourdough Creek.\nSLIDE has villains, an old-time country music cowboy band, the Lucky Buck Saloon and Bordello, and a glorious Oregon backdrop (And it features a hero who, like me, plays the slide guitar.)\nBy raising our $77,800 minimum goal here on Kickstarter my team and I will be able to devote most of the next six months to SLIDE, with a completion date in 2022.\nBut I want to get SLIDE to you sooner.\nWe have a very ambitious $200,000 \"stretch\" goal that would allow us to complete SLIDE by this time next year - and wouldn't it be great to have a new animated film ready for our safe return to theaters!\nI think you're going to love the rewards: Attend the New York City premiere of SLIDE; Take a private animation class with me, either via Zoom or (after the pandemic) in my NYC studio; And ALL backers at the $100 level or higher will see their name in the closing credits!\nI'm also drawing the caricature of at least one backer who will get to play a Old West villain, have a speaking role, see their name in the closing credits, AND get an IMDb credit.\nBest of all, on Dec. 18, 2020 we're sending out a survey to all of our backers, giving you the option of gifting one of our rewards in time for the holidays. We'll email a gift certificate for the reward you select to the recipient you designate.\nOne of the cool advantages of going to Kickstarter now, halfway through the production, is that we have a lot of clips and sequences to share.  Follow me on Facebook daily during the campaign as I do a drawing a day on camera so you can see how I create my characters and animation.\nPeople call me the \"King of Indie Animation\" and I hope to capitalize on that moniker to give people an inside look at how I create my films - from the concept to the editing and music.  \nThanks for supporting independent animation, and a sincere thanks for supporting me and my new film SLIDE with your generous pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an independent filmmaker, being self-financed is a risk all by itself. I animate a few commercial projects each year, recently a few cool music videos and an nearly-annual \"couch gag\" for the opening of \"The Simpsons\" on FOX-TV. And the income from those projects is very helpful in keeping my studio running - but it only gets me about halfway there if I want to keep creating my own animated shorts and features. Some advance theatrical distribution money from France also helps, but I've used Kickstarter to help fill the gap. My fans have helped with the production of two features, \"Cheatin'\" and \"Revengeance\", and a series of political shorts called \"Trump Bites\". My hardcore fans have bought their DVD or streaming copies in advance, which gets me the money early to finish animating the film faster, I don't have to wait for another big commercial project to come in and fund the feature.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Insider Sneak Peeks", "descp": "Follow Bill through the making of SLIDE with exclusive updates, stills and animated clips available only to Kickstarter backers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Stream SLIDE at Home", "descp": "We'll send you a private link to stream SLIDE once it completes its theatrical premiere and/or Oscar qualification PLUS sneak peeks into the making of SLIDE.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2022"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Autographed DVD of SLIDE", "descp": "You\u2019ll receive a limited edition DVD of \"Slide\", hand-signed by Bill Plympton, and mailed to your home after the film\u2019s theatrical run and Oscar-qualification process.

But a small group of fanatic hologram hackers did believe, and we were able to ship them thousands of our first generation holographic dev kits. To us, holographic displays weren't just a dream from sci-fi movies \u2014 they were something real that we used every day.\nAnd yet, we've always wanted a way for everyone to have their own holographic display. That's why today we're so excited to share something we've been working on in secret for the past 18 months: the Looking Glass Portrait \u2014 your first personal holographic display.\nYou don't need to know how to program to use this holographic display. Looking Glass Portrait is designed for the millions of people that work or play in 3D in any way: Artists, Designers, Developers, Filmmakers, Photographers, and those of you who are just starting to explore three-dimensional capture and creation. Even phones can now capture holograms*.\nSo if your curiosity led to you to this page and you're wondering if you're the type of person that could own their own personal holographic display....the answer is yes. Find out everything you can do with this new magical invention in the scroll below. And welcome to the future!\nMinimum Requirements for Desktop Mode\n HoloPlay Studio works with PC and Mac. \nTo import, edit, process and convert depth photos, videos, and other holographic media, almost all PCs and Macs with HDMI and USB-C will work. Post a question in the Comments section if you have any questions about this. \nTo run and create heavier-duty interactive applications with Unity or Unreal, we recommend a PC with a GTX 1650 or equivalent, CPU with Intel i5 or higher, and at least 8GB of RAM. \nMinimum Requirements for playback in Standalone Mode\nYour imagination (also, USB-C or wall power).\n Phones can now capture holograms*.\nThe easiest way to make a hologram is to take a Portrait mode photo with your phone.\nBelieve it or not, those Portrait mode photos you've been taking have depth information hidden behind them. This is normally used to generate bokeh effect, and now the software that comes with every Looking Glass Portrait can use that same depth info to generate a three-dimensional hologram with a single click.\nThe new iPhone 12 Pro using a combination of advanced machine learning techniques and LiDAR capabilities can capture the best depth photos yet with a single shot.\n* These iPhone models support Portrait mode: iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone 7 Plus. Some brand-name Android phones also support depth capture with portrait mode photos. The newer the phone, generally, the better the depth map.  \n\nOn January 6, 2021, we announced support for a number of flagship Android phones as well as a new conversion service that can take any 2D image and convert than into a 3D hologram for Looking Glass Portrait. Read this update.\n\nHere's a running list of all the compatible Android phones that will work directly with HoloPlay Studio: \nMost of the newer flagship Samsung phones, including A7, A9, S10, S10e, S9+, S20, S20+, S20 Ultra.\nSome of the Huawei phones with \"Aperture\" mode, including Mate 20, Mate 20 Lite, Mate 20 Pro, P20 Pro, P30 Pro.\nNewer Pixel phones, including the Pixel 3, 4, and 5 models.\nFor a more updated list, head on over here. \nUse any camera to capture super-realistic holograms.\nIf you're looking to push the limits of holographic capture even further, Looking Glass Portrait can also display light field photos. This is a fancy term for a series of images taken from different perspectives. You can now capture these advanced three-dimensional photographs with conventional panning shot techniques using the camera you already own and display them in Looking Glass Portrait. \nThis is a simple 4K panning video. It has everything needed for a super-realistic holographic \"light field\" photograph.\nBecause this method captures and displays not only depth but also the directionality of millions of rays of light. even objects like a magnifying lens work in the resulting hologram like a real magnifying lens would.\n*Compatibility: Works with any camera (including phones), that can record 4K video.\nFor this advanced capture technique, you can use your own rail, stabilized camera, or use the rail included in the Holographic Capture Bundle.\nSequence by Giovanni Remigi, a 3D artist and the developer of Lentigram, an interlacing software package for the production of high quality three-dimensional photographs.\nSalmon Tartine by Alban (Sketchfab)\nFlower Point Cloud Photogrammetry by Moshe Caine (Sketchfab)\nTransform photogrammetry and LiDAR scans into holograms.\nPhotogrammetry-based 3D scans and the newest LiDAR scanning with the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro can be played back in the Looking Glass Portrait with ease. The advantage of these techniques is both aesthetic and practical \u2014 this is the easiest way to take and display 360\u00b0 captures of people, places, and objects.\n\n*Compatibility: Works with point cloud and mesh-based 3D output from most known photogrammetry software packages including Metashape, Zephyr, itSeez3D, and Reality Capture. Also compatible with the exports from LiDAR scanning packages Canvas by Occipital, SiteScape, Polycam, and 3D Scanner App. \nWe're planning on adding support for a growing number of real-world 3D capture formats, including direct conversion of stereo photos taken with cameras like the classic Fujifilm FinePix and conversion of turntable captures into holograms. \nIt is confirmed that HoloPlay Studio will support direct SBS format import in Q3 of 2021. \nMake holographic video recordings with a single click.\nFor most of us that have long dreamed of a holographic future, the ultimate goal has been to be able to record a holographic message and send that to someone across the world (or in a galaxy far, far away). Imagine sending a holographic birthday message, or saying hello as a hologram to your great-great-great granddaughter. Now you can!\nPrototype system in July 2020 showing a test video stream of an Azure Kinect depth video played back in the Looking Glass Portrait.\nThe Looking Glass Portrait comes with access to Depth Recorder, a PC and Mac compatible app that lets anyone with a Microsoft Azure Kinect, Intel RealSense depth camera, or iPhone X/11/12 record, send and play back 10-second holographic messages in their Looking Glass Portrait.\nIf you don't have a depth camera already and you're interested in recording holographic messages, the Holographic Capture Bundle comes with an Azure Kinect depth camera and custom Looking Glass Azure Kinect Stand. \nDepth Recorder also comes with a range of effects to overlay your holographic recordings. Recording above made with the Microsoft Azure Kinect\nRecorded using the Intel RealSense D435\nThe newest iPhones (X, 11, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max) have the ability to record depth videos with their front facing TrueDepth camera, and in the case of the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, also with their back-facing LiDAR enhanced cameras.\nRecord holographic videos for playback with apps like Record3D and import them easily into the Looking Glass software ecosystem for rapid conversion into holographic videos suitable for playback in the Looking Glass Portrait. \nCompatibility: the Depth Recorder app works with the Microsoft Azure Kinect and Intel RealSense D415 & D435. You can also playback Record3D recordings made with the newest iPhones (X, 11, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max) and even platforms like the OAK-D by OpenCV AI Kit.  \nFor professionals working with volumetric video production tools like Depthkit and Depthkit Cinema, you can now easily import your work into the Looking Glass Portrait. This media can be played back in Desktop mode or in Standalone mode. This means you can now send someone a holographic display preloaded with your volumetric video content that will run right on power-up.  \nFootage captured with Depthkit Cinema\nFor high quality volumetric video content, look no further than the few dozen volumetric capture studios operating around the world that work by pointing dozens to hundreds of cameras at a group of people on vast stages. \nLooking Glass Portrait can take in volumetric content captured in studios like 4DViews, Microsoft Reality Capture, Mantis Vision and Metastage, displaying these as three-dimensional moving images - setting the \"stage\" for the next phase of the moving image. \nFootage from volumetric capture company 4DViews\nFootage taken by Microsoft Mixed Reality Capture Studios\nCIBER GEISHA by Oscar Creativo (via Sketchfab)\nWhether you're a 3D designer, just starting to learn 3D modeling or someone who is exploring the world of 3D creations on platforms like Sketchfab, you can easily bring people, both real and imagined, into your Looking Glass Portrait.\nGLOW by XenSwapper (via Sketchfab)\nCIBER WOLF by Oscar Creativo (via Sketchfab)\nUse Looking Glass plugins for Maya and Blender for both live and rendered out scenes or import animated models with the 3D Model Importer.\nOver the past few years we've developed and refined powerful Unity and Unreal plugins for the Looking Glass lineup. Now these plugins can be used with the Looking Glass Portrait to create holographic apps of your own. \nExperimental iPhone face tracking Animoji app built in Unity\nGo to our docs page here to read more about our Unity and Unreal plugins, with more details on what's to come in the Roadmap below.\n\nNote: for developers building in DirectX, OpenGL, or Metal that want deeper levels of access and more control over how they integrate with the Looking Glass Portrait, we've developed a powerful cross-platform SDK called HoloPlay Core. More details here. \nLooking Glass Portrait works with a wide variety of peripherals in Desktop mode, allowing for advanced interaction with holograms. This includes VR controllers, various sensors for environmental inputs, tactile feedback systems, as well as hand-sensing devices like the Leap Motion Controller (part of the Holographic Capture Bundle). \nInteractive \"Blobs\" with the Leap Motion Controller. Inspired by the work of Eliza (https://www.elizasj.com/) @iamelizasj (on Twitter & IG).\n Looking Glass Documentation (Looking Glass Portrait documentation coming soon) \n Looking Glass Discord (if you have a quick question you want answered, either post in comments above or join our Discord)\n Looking Glass Blog \nThe Looking Glass Portrait is powered by the next generation of light field technology. The display works by generating between 45 to 100 views of a three-dimensional scene and projecting those perspectives simultaneously. Unlike any display that has come before it or in the market today, multiple users can gather around a Looking Glass Portrait to see different superstereoscopic perspectives without glasses or a headset.\n\nAnother way to think of this is, holograms are kind of like videos played back in space instead of time.\nAs you move around the Looking Glass, your eyes are exposed to millions of rays of light that are reproducing captured content from the real world or playing back 3D synthetic content in the most realistic way ever developed. Because of this approach, unlike other AR/VR or 3D monitor technologies which can sometimes cause nausea and discomfort, the Looking Glass Portrait produces a viewing experience that is as comfortable as you'd experience looking at the real world.\n58\u00ba view cone that hides all errant views and only shows content within the \"Hologram Zone\"\nUnlike the first generation of Looking Glass launched back in 2018, this next generation system has reworked the optical system so that the holograms are no longer \"contained\" in a volume. They can project in front of and behind the physical display, meaning you can literally touch these holograms.\nUntil now, holographic displays needed powerful gaming laptops to run even the simplest holographic media. Looking Glass Portrait can still work in that tethered mode with PCs and Macs -- but it is the first system with an additional Standalone Mode, thanks to a built-in computer (Raspberry Pi 4) and a proprietary holographic software stack that can run high-fidelity recorded holographic media at 60fps. Just plug in the Looking Glass Portrait into power via the included USB-C cable.\nAll Looking Glass Portrait units will come with an internal integrated Wi-Fi module at no additional charge. Potential Wi-Fi enabled features, such as loading and sharing of holographic media with a mobile device, are planned for release via free software update after initial shipments go out. See Roadmap below for more details.\nQuestions about how the Looking Glass Portrait works and how they compare to other displays? Ask us on Discord!\nMicro light field of a wasp sequence by Giovanni Remigi, a 3D artist and the developer of Lentigram, an interlacing software package for the production of high quality three-dimensional photographs.\nOver the years, we've built a steady, strong and vibrant 3D community around holographic displays and creation. Since we founded the company in 2014, we've witnessed creators from all over the world connect and share their work via the third dimension. We welcome all to join our community with open three-dimensional arms. \nIn the past few weeks, as we've been quietly sharing the Looking Glass Portrait with some artists in the community, we've been fortunate enough that some of them have agreed to let us share some of their work in the Looking Glass Portrait. \nTrain Station Scene by Dedouze.

Since launching the first Looking Glass in 2018, the Looking Glass Club has grown significantly and often tweets under the hashtag #\u30eb\u30ad\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9. \nWant to help us spread the word? Click this link to easily share this project on Twitter. \nThe Looking Glass Factory team is made up of dozens of Artists, Engineers and Inventors based (now, mostly remotely) out of Hong Kong & Greenpoint, Brooklyn. \nFolks from our US team\nFolks from our HK team\nThey say distance makes the heart grow fonder and while we couldn't agree more, we've had the benefit of being able to see each other as three-dimensional beings as demonstrated here with the Looking Glass Portrait.\nOne of the very first Looking Glass Portrait Prototypes\nSome additional behind-the-scenes prototype clips here. \nWe are attempting to make the Looking Glass Portrait carbon negative.\nWhile it's difficult to calculate precise environmental impact and to offset that impact for a new type of technology being made for the first time, we've calculated the embodied energy of each component in the Looking Glass Portrait as well as the average operating energy over its lifetime to the best of our knowledge. This is around 510MJ running on Standalone or 332MJ running on a PC/Mac of total energy.\nWe pay for carbon offsets from Native Energy for 2x this amount of total energy, so that each Looking Glass Portrait sold in theory will not only be carbon neutral over its lifetime, but it also should pull out its carbon-weight from the atmosphere.\nBecause this carbon offset payment comes straight from our profits \u2014 you won't be charged extra for this \u2014 we believe this will create a forcing function for our organization over time to reduce the carbon footprint of our products.\nWe surely aren't going to get this right on the first go, and we would love to hear from folks on their ideas for further improvements along the way.\nWhen we invented the first holographic light field display dev kits back in 2018, we estimated that within ten years over ten million people would have one, if they only understood its benefits.\nIllustration from 2018 when we are first starting to see the future to come.\nThe interfaces of the future wouldn't be worn on your head 16 hours a day, but they would be more like campfires glowing with three-dimensional fields of light that you could gather around with others. Sometimes in the same room, other times a world apart.\nIllustration by Jether Amar\n [Tested] Hands on Holographic Display Prototype Hands-On: Looking Glass Portrait (Jan 4, 2021) \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nIn our Press Kit you'll find GIFs, images, spec sheets, and more. If there's anything else you need, write us at press@lookingglassfactory.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe launched the first generation of holographic display \u2014 the Looking Glass dev kits \u2014 back in 2018 right here on Kickstarter. We shipped thousands of those systems on-time and at a high level of quality, kicking off the first wave of holographic creation around the world.\n\nOur 35-person team operates between offices in Brooklyn, NY and in Hong Kong and this affords us advantages that other groups may not have. This includes the benefit of an unusually cross-disciplinary team with deep shared knowledge of both hardware, software, and supply chain. This has made us the only group in the world that has successfully shipped multiviewer holographic light field displays and we will bring that experience to this project.\n\nOf course this is a particularly challenging time, so we've taken some additional measures in advance. This includes setting up a short-run production facility adjacent to our Hong Kong laboratory for tighter control over the initial production runs, running FCC pre-checks at the prototype stage to avoid surprises during the production phase, and securing capital for inventory so that critical parts with long lead times could be ordered before the Kickstarter campaign even started.\n\nWe would only delay shipments in a few exceptional cases. If we found the production units did not meet our high standards, for instance, we would delay shipment until we could meet or exceed our quality standards. And there's always a small chance of delays in the event of a complete global shutdown of supply chain due to the pandemic. We don't expect either of these things to happen, but if they do we will be fully transparent with you along the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hologram Club Sweatshirt", "descp": "Be a part of our community and receive a limited-edition launch special \"Hologram Club\" sweatshirt.

Soon after that he earned a reputation for having the wildest personality of everyone there. He brought this energy to his skating and also to the party scene that came hand-in-hand with the subculture.  \nDesign by Martin Falck. Photos courtesy of Theo Hand, French Fred and Antton Miettinen \u00a9\n In 2007, Ali and Shane Cross, his teammate and friend, were in a tragic motorcycle accident in Australia. Both were heavily intoxicated when Ali drove the motorcycle into a wall while Shane was riding on the back. Ali ended up in a coma, and Shane was killed. After getting lost in a long period of substance abuse, against all odds Ali managed to get back to a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Today, Ali has been sober for seven years. Each day he attends a twelve-step program, carrying the scars on his body and in his psyche, daily reminders of his past and the accident that still haunts him. \n The Scars of Ali Boulala will provide the most in-depth look into Ali's present and past ever presented on film. \nThis documentary feature film is 8 years in the making, and in its final editing phase. The director of the film, Max Eriksson bumped into Ali in a Swedish bar soon after Ali's return from Australia where he had spent some time in jail after the accident. Since then, he's been filming and interviewing Ali - throughout his recovery from drug and alcohol addiction - up until the present day. Alongside newly shot material filmed since the day they met, a large part of the film will be made up of archival material shot in the late 90s and early 2000s. \nPhoto courtesy of French Fred \u00a9\n The film tells the story of Ali\u2019s rise and fall, as well as his path toward possible redemption. Archival material shot in a variety of formats chronicling Ali\u2019s years as a pro skater forms the basis of the film. This material brings in viewers who may not be familiar with Ali and his legacy into the world of his past and introduces them to the central figures in Ali\u2019s life during that time. Through the liveliness of this archival material from a time gone by, we get a vivid picture of what it was like for Ali to live a life without limits, and as such, we come to understand the profoundness of his loss.\nAs well as his family, we have shot interviews of close friends of Ali from his skateboarding days, such as world-famous Arto Saari, Rune Glifberg, Ewan Bowman Dustin Dollin, Erik Ellington and Kevin \"Spanky\" Long.\nPhoto courtesy of French Fred \u00a9\nWe are hoping to raise this final piece of funding so we can get this long-awaited project to the big screen for you all to see.  \nMoving images on Super-8, VHS, Hi-8, and mini DV have been sourced from family, friends, and fellow skateboarders from around the world. Through images starting in the early 1990s up until and directly after the accident in 2007, the archival material takes us to Sweden, France, Spain, Denmark, The Netherlands, the U.S., Australia and beyond. Due to the diverse nature of the physical media, we have chosen to embrace and amplify the messiness of the various aspect ratios, textures and resolutions. The film, like memory, is a patchwork of past times and places \u2013 some sharper than others, some already fading with only the slightest traces still recognisable. \nBecause the archival material has been filmed in a variety of analog formats, it has to be digitized. This allows us to be able to edit the material alongside the newer material shot in the last 8 years.\n A second cost we need to cover is the licensing of all the amazing material that Max, the director has managed to unearth over the years.\n Lastly, as with any film, we'd like to make adjustments in post-production, such as color grading and sound mixing, so that we can bring the best out of the footage we have.    \nPhoto Courtesy of French Fred \u00a9\nWith support we've received from film funds in Sweden and Norway, as well as our own money, we've been able to make a rough cut of the film. However, our current budget won't stretch far enough to cover the costs needed to make a final cut and send it out into the world. This is where you could help! We really appreciate any contribution you can make, no matter how small, and we think our rewards really make it worthwhile.\n Our 35,000 euro goal is what we need to cover the first two key costs detailed above. If we raise funds up to 50,000, we'll be able to carry out the third. If we go beyond this, we'll have even more hours in the post production room with more digitized archival footage, which will make the final quality of our film even better.\nIF WE DON'T reach our goal?\nTo put it simply - we won't receive any money. Only if we reach our target after 30 days will your money be taken and your lovely rewards sent out to you. Our project will also be sent out into the world, so let's get there together!\nAli and director, Max\n Our rewards feature specially created designs for this campaign, with film merchandise signed by Ali himself, and the opportunity to spend some time with him and Max on a video call! \nFilm poster which will be signed by Ali.

Secondary goals are to play live shows when the world is available again! Unfortunately, touring will not be an option for the foreseeable future. For those that don't know, touring is the main ways musicians are able to make money off of the music that they work so hard to create. \nIf we surpass our goal, we'll be able to utilize these funds to pay for costs that would normally come out of pocket for us, such as purchasing merch, marketing the album, and possibly even pressing vinyl. \nWe know that money is getting harder and harder these days, but appreciate anything that you can send our way, following us on social media, moral support, or a few extra dollars.

It is a sign that somewhere nearby, foxes are holding a wedding ceremony. The rain makes people stay indoors, and the foxes can have their wedding unobserved by human eyes.\nThe Fox's Wedding is a fully illustrated compendium of Japanese folklore, with over one hundred entries covering a wide range of ghosts, monsters, and spirits. Every entry in the book is translated and adapted by me from Japanese sources, and many of the stories and creatures in it have never appeared in English before.\nAs the name suggests, the book features a large number of foxes\u2013kitsune in Japanese. One fifth of the book is dedicated solely to kitsune folklore, detailing the different types of kitsune, what kind of magic they do and how they do it, their society structure and power ranks, and a whole bunch of kitsune legends from across Japan.\nBut The Fox's Wedding does not feature only kitsune! The rest of the book is filled with a great variety of Japanese ghosts, monsters, and demons. There are horrific tales of murder ending in supernatural vengeance, adorable animal yokai that you'll want to keep as pets, evil ghosts in search of victims, man-eating beasts, beast-eating men, demon priests, evil trees, haunted chickens, ghostly vegetables, vampires, babies, giants, and more!\nIn addition, The Fox's Wedding contains a timely pandemic-themed chapter featuring a whole mess of evil spirits which spread infectious diseases, as well as the benevolent spirits who scare them away and protect humankind from sickness. That's something we could all use in 2020.\nThe Fox's Wedding follows the same format as my previous books. It will have 100 yokai illustrations, plus a number of double page spread chapter illustrations and a two page map of Japan. Because it is an encyclopedia there is no narrative, and you don't need to have read my other 3 books in order to enjoy it\u2013although you might find them interesting too!\nBecome a backer to get insider access and see the project behind-the-scenes.\nWho are you?\nMy name is Matthew Meyer, but you may know better me as The Yokai Guy on social media, or from my previous books, or as the creator of yokai.com. I am an American artist living in Japan. I've been translating and illustrating Japanese folklore for over a decade. My work has appeared in the New York Times, Smithsonian Magazine, the Japan Times, the Asahi Shimbun, and on NHK and Fuji TV. This will be my fourth Kickstarter as well as the fourth volume of my yokai encyclopedia series.\nFind me online: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Patreon\nMy websites: MatthewMeyer.net | Yokai.com\nWhat happens after the project is funded?\nThe yokai illustrations and the writing are almost all done, and the structure of the book is already complete. After the project is funded, the next step will be to send the revised text to the editor for proofreading. The chapter heading illustrations and map of Japan will be completed next, and all of the artwork should be finalized by the time the text is back from the editor. After a final review, the book will go to the printer for production. I expect that to be in mid to late spring. If all goes well, the books should start shipping out in the summer.\nBackers get insider access and can watch the development of the book.\nHow will the money be used?\nThe book is written, illustrated, produced, and published by me, which means I don't have to spend a lot on outside help. But I still need to hire an editor, as well as pay for ISBNs and other fees related to publishing. The lion's share of the project money goes towards printing costs.\nFor my previous two Kickstarters I used a printer in Korea. It was affordable, but a number of manufacturing errors caused delays, extra costs, and a lot of unnecessary stress. This time I will be using a local printer in Japan. While it is significantly more expensive to print in Japan than in Korea, I believe reducing the freight costs, import duties, and warehouse fees, as well as the stress of dealing with manufacturer errors, is worth it.\nAfter printing, the next greatest cost is shipping and handling. Packing supplies, freight charges, and storage can add up to quite a bit for a large Kickstarter. Inspecting every book for print errors, organizing inventory, packing orders into boxes, loading boxes into trucks, etc. is mentally and physically exhausting, so some of the project money will also be used to hire help for those tasks.\nShipping, Customs, Etc.\nPlease note that shipping charges will be calculated after the Kickstarter is finished, in the BackerKit pledge manager. Because the project is shipping from Japan, it may be more expensive than you are used to paying for local book delivery. Additionally, some countries charge import taxes which you will have to pay upon delivery. Unfortunately there is nothing that I can do about that. I will be working with a crowdfunding fulfilment company to provide the cheapest possible shipping, but please keep that in mind when pledging.\nThe yokai sightings map from The Book of the Hakutaku\nStretch Goals and Add-Ons\nPeople love stretch goals, but they add a great deal of work which can slow down a project, and I am only one person. This time instead of adding stretch goals during the campaign, I am just unlocking every stretch goal as add-ons from the beginning.\nExtra books, paperback and hardcovers of my previous books, collector's editions, bookmarks, postcards, and art prints are all available using Kickstarter's new add-ons feature. This will make it easy for you to see exactly what you've pledged for without having to manually adjust your pledge.\nExtra Books\nYou can order extra copies of The Fox's Wedding or any of my other books in paperback, hardcover, and ebook formats. (Extra books will ship with your Kickstarter order. If you want to read my previous books now, you can order them from Amazon or your local bookstore instead.) \nthe four books in my yokai series\nBookmarks\nEach book has a specially designed matching bookmark available as an add-on. The bookmarks feature a character from the book on the front, and a Japanese protection charm against evil spirits on the reverse.\nmatching bookmarks for the previous 3 books\nPostcards\nThe yokai postcard pack has been a popular add-on in past campaigns. 20 full color postcards featuring popular yokai from The Fox's Wedding and my other books. The actual images chosen for the pack will be voted upon by backers at a later date.\nThe postcard pack contains 20 colorful A6 size postcards.\nArt Prints\nSigned art prints come in small (3.5\" x 5.5\" image in a 5\" x 7\" mat) and medium (7.25\" x 9.25\" in a 11\" x 14\" mat) sizes. They are mounted and matted on acid-free materials and printed with professional quality light-resistant inks on heavy duty acid-free art paper. All prints are signed by the artist.\nHundreds of yokai images are available as signed art prints.\nCollector's Editions\nThese very special versions are only produced in limited numbers. They are not available in stores! They include a hardcover edition, with a matching slipcase and bookmark. You can order extra collector's editions, as well as collector's editions of my previous book as add-on items.\nCollector's Edition backers can also request a personalized doodle or dedication from me in the book!\nThe Night Parade of One Hundred Demons Collector's Edition\nThe Hour of Meeting Evil Spirits Collector's Edition\nThe Book of the Hakutaku Collector's Edition\nThe Fox's Wedding Collector's Edition (concept art)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the 4th book I have produced through Kickstarter. Each time I've learned a little bit more about what worked well and what I could do better.\n\nThe biggest risk this project faces amount to delays in receiving the final project. Delays from something like an unforeseen illness, or disruptions to production or distribution due to COVID-19 are a possibility this time. However, I'm confident I can deliver this project with minimum risk to backers.\n\nHere are some of the things I've learned from past Kickstarters:\n\nInstead of launching this campaign at the beginning of the creation process, the book is already very close to being done. There is still work to be done, but you won't have to wait a year or more for it to be finished. It will be ready within months.\n\nI am using a local printer here in Japan, rather than the Korean printer I used for my previous two books. This brings the printing cost up, but will cut the cost of freight, import duties, warehouse fees, and trucks. It will also reduce the stress of handling manufacturing errors.\n\nI've timed this project to minimize the tax burden that eats up a large chunk of Kickstarter funds. This means more of the money goes to the project, and I can deliver the highest quality product possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Insider Access", "descp": "For people who just want to support the project without a reward.

We will show you how to take advantage of the small size and portability of the smartphone, and explain how it can do some things better than \"normal\" cameras.\n Being able to edit together videos in a non-linear editing system is an essential skill for anyone starting in video production. In this class, we will get you up to speed on the fundamentals of the art and process of editing videos using footage that you shoot yourself with your smartphone\n Our courses will follow an in-depth structure with detailed course content, hands-on activities, and comprehensive assessments that walk you through every aspect of becoming a creative professional.

Your task here is to develop a new prison for lost souls, under the watchful eye of Lilith from HR and Frank - our Hell Manager. You'll not only squeeze as much suffering as you can out of sinners, but also gain the approval of the greatest devils in hell, including Lucifer himself, who will evaluate not only your work but also... your sense of aesthetics and thriftiness. We want to give you a game, that is not only set in the lowest bowels of hell, but also full of good, black humor, which you will love, especially if you were an intern in a big corporation. \n\n\n\n\nHell Architect is a City Builder game. You play as a Hell Manager and together with some sinners you begin the development of 9 circles of hell. There are some torture devices given to your disposal, which will help you squeeze some suffering out of every sinful soul - though you have to keep in mind, that in hell nothing is free and even these lost souls need to eat, drink and... sleep. If you ignore their... hmm... comfort levels, not only will you lose your main source of income, but also enable their quick redemption. Are you sure you want that?\nTime to ask yourself - why Hell Architect? Why we've decided to make a game, that on one hand is filled with corporate jargon (quite funny, when you don't have to experience it in real life) and on the other hand touches upon a hard, controversial subject, that is hell? \nWell, the ideal person to explain the idea is none other than the CEO - Pawe\u0142. Also we want you to know that it has nothing to do with marketing - it was Pawe\u0142 who came up with this whole idea.\nOur discord community - just like us - are fans of history. More specifically: medieval castles filled with torture devices. If you ever wondered what it's like to be a Spanish inquisitor or how an Iron Maiden works, than in Hell Architect we're giving you a painless and harmless opportunity for... testing. \n\nSome people claim, that devils love Metal, but there are times when Lucyfer prefers classical music or good country music, especially when he is visited by souls all the way from Texas. The person responsible for unsetling music and dropping the base is Pawe\u0142 B\u0142aszczak, whose rehearsals caused much suffering right here in our mini studio. \nOur boss - the mortal one, not the one from hell - is a graphical designer. So you can imagine what an infernal experience creating graphics in Hell Arcitect really is - this line is too straight, this red is not red enough... No one pays so much attention to microscopic irregularities quite like him.\nNo wonder that Hell Architect is so perfect when it comes to graphics. Our poor \u0141ukasz is not done till he considers that his work is truly finished. Just look at those pics - can you see how detailed they are? Even the biblical leaf from our censored version was corrected hundreds of times. But it was worth it. \nWe talked about our game, so it is time to tell you something about us... and that's the hardest part. Our team consists of true hotspurs (infernally hot). We like to create games and we're interested in everything that's hellish. Most of us had their fair share of the corporate world, which is considered by us a real road through... hell. We started as interns, tried being Brand Managers and every posistion came with different benefits, such as Fruity Thursdays and Tuesdays, Sweet Fridays and free gym passes (you probably think that we're ripped like Hercules - we're not). No wonder that the process of creating Hell Architect was easy as pie.\nUnfotunately, suffering is not a valid currency... And we need a little bit of money to: polish our game, so that the full version is free of bugs and glitches. Testing Hell architect on numerous configurations, systems and graphic cards is expensive. The other thing is optimization - we want to bring our game to as many people as possible.\nOur corporation can't do it alone, so we need your help!\nGet Your Project Funded Today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo be honest, the most dangerous risk for us is... lockdown.

Well, leave the domestic dangers of virtual reality behind with the latest, greatest must-have gaming footwear Cybershoes!\" by SYFY WIRE \nSitting in a swiveling stool and sliding Cybershoes forward and backward allows users to control their direction and speed with their own movement in VR games while also creating deeper immersion through physical activity.\nIn 2018 we conducted a successful Kickstarter, raising more than 214k Euros from more than 1000 backers. Since then we've shipped more than 3,000 Cybershoes for wired headsets on SteamVR. We're now excited to introduce a new wireless version of Cybershoes for Oculus Quest, and this Kickstarter campaign will help make this product a reality.\nBackers will not only contribute to the product's production and distribution but also fuel the number of games that natively integrate Cybershoes and general awareness to drive adoption.  \nCybershoes for Quest works for all PC VR headsets as well when used with a PC. To show continued support for our community, the new module is compatible with all Cybershoes so if you already own the system you can simply upgrade for the Quest platform. \n\nRhys Da King - Saints and Sinners gameplay: \"Testing is proving - flipping awesome\" \n First impression by Sebastian Ang: \"It looks funny but feels right.\" \n@FREE Arizona Sunshine\nYes, we\u2019re giving Arizona Sunshine to all complete Cybershoes packs! to celebrate the ending of the campaign and it's simply an awesome experience which everyone should try with Cybershoes.\n SoulFoxGaming trying a new approach to Arizona Sunshine \n The VR Realm, Paul Menton: \"I am impressed with how smooth they are working. With all the experience we have now with them - we are finding we can have long sessions without the need for a break. You will soon get over the fact that you\u2019re seated\"\nDr. Oculus: \"The Cybershoes with the Quest - fantastic, everything is wireless and [...] it's fitness, it's fun, and just so freeing.\" \n\nEurogamer, Ian Higton: \"These shoes are made for walking and that's just what I'll do\"  \nThey are compatible with Quest/Quest2 standalone, plus Quest/Quest2+SteamVR with gaming PC, and SteamVR with any PC VR headset (see: game table).\nPLAY\n\nAs legs move, the chair is forgotten in no time. What counts is that you\u2019re active and this - sort of - tricks the brain. With Cybershoes you extend the borders of your living room.  \nWireless Cybershoes connects to a Quest headset via Bluetooth and features an inside-out tracking system. The beauty is that the Cybershoes are seen as a Bluetooth gamepad by the Quest headset, making it very easy for developers to integrate.\nscheme\nThe key functionality of Cybershoes is that the shoes are keeping their orientation. You can walk in one direction and look in the other. By placing an additional IMU (gyroscope) inside the receiver, the raw shoe data can be processed in order to yield X and Y motion to the gamepad. The slider functions as an input multiplicator that lets you adjust the ratio of real-life speed to game speed. The button is used for pairing and to activate the \"Follow Cybershoes\" mode.\nPairing. With their recent firmware update (v23), Oculus has resolved the issue that Bluetooth devices are forgotten after a reboot.\nIf the game supports gamepad Cybershoes will work\nCore principles:\n* comes as a gamepad relative to HMD\n* speed should feel fast enough\n* seated mode: either your solution or try ours\n* get in touch for promo and knowhow: dev@cybershoes.io\nHelp reduce motion sickness and increase the active gaming experience!\nUnity3D: ready. Unreal Engine: WIP, please contact us with your Engine & VR SDK Version.\nThe Unity Fast SDK is a one-pager that contains all you need to know for a quick implementation.\nWe have partnered with leading VR game developer Vertigo Games to integrate Cybershoes in Arizona Sunshine. With natively integrated games, setup is as easy as strapping on Cybershoes, booting up the headset, and selecting the in-game locomotion option.\n\u201cIt is one of our core values to allow players to fully customize their preferred way to play. We have a few people in our office who are sensitive to motion sickness so we take comfort very seriously. Arizona Sunshine already supports a wide range of comfort options and Cybershoes provides an intuitive way to bring the player\u2019s physical motion into the game, allowing our players to experience VR however they like.\"\nsaid Richard Stitselaar, Managing Director at Vertigo Games. \"\nAbout Arizona Sunshine\nBuilt from the ground up for VR, Arizona Sunshine is a full-feature game that puts you in the middle of a zombie apocalypse as if you were really there. Freely move around and explore a post-apocalyptic southwestern America in a desperate search for human contact in campaign mode, join forces with a friend in co-op multiplayer, or jump into the endless multiplayer Horde mode for up to 4 players.\nThe current state of the Cybershoes integration in Arizona Sunshine\nThanks to Vertigo Games, the prototype integration already happened. You can now select Cybershoes as a movement input. This was an important step to validate our SDK, as well as to validate the low latency and accuracy of the new system. The next step is to make it possible to calibrate the player's height while being seated. That way you will have the perception of a standing eye-height for perfect immersion.\nSelect Cybershoes as your movement option: achieved. Calibrate user height: planned.\n@Native Support by Game Devs - WIP\nOur main focus during the realization phase is to get as many games as possible onto the compatibility list - directly integrated by the developer.\nWIP on native integration\n @Compatible Games\nGames you can play now with your Cybershoes\nAdditional titles have also been tested to work well with Cybershoes without native integration,  including the following. \nCurrently compatible games for Cybershoes and Oculus Quest\nPLAY\n\nPaul from The VR Realm plays Journey of Gods.\nPLAY\n\nThe Skarred Ghost in VR Chat\nWith your help, we\u2019re striving to fully integrate the Cybershoes into as many games as possible.\n\n  You can choose from the following initial reward tiers:\n\nThroughout the campaign, we will add more reward tiers as funding milestones are hit. These may include newly integrated games to be bundled with Cybershoes and others.\n\n PERK: eSport Jersey  \nCybershoes and VR Master League joined forces to bring the world\u2019s most famous VR Youtubers to the Tournament during Gamescom Digital 2020.

The \u201cCyQuest\u201d hardware is already developed and pre-production test-runs are happening right now. Those units are also out for review at YouTubers and journalists. In addition to that there are some new molded parts in shoes and the receiver. Improvements come with the chair and the carpet. We\u2019ve rendered our 2018 Kickstarter to every backer in 2019. It took twice as long as projected, and cost three times as much as we thought. We\u2019ve learned from that. We\u2019ve doubled the amount of time we are projecting for realization. We do not price dump in order to get a crazy amount of orders. You get the best price we can afford. Take into consideration, it\u2019s a low volume high-quality product. Game integration deserves a lot of attention.\n\nData\nWe do not share your data without your consent and keep it secure at all times. Cybershoes, Inc. is a subsidiary of the Austrian Cybershoes GmbH and strong GDPR rules are in place. Also, we believe that you should own your hardware. We will invite the users of the Cybershoes App to contribute to the big goal: run together to Mars. We plan to collect anonymized user data in order to understand how to optimize.\n\nThird-party dependencies\nLow probability with high impact: Oculus disables or limits functionality that Cybershoes depend on. E.g. Bluetooth or Bluetooth gamepad support gets removed completely. \n\nRisk: Some of the planned games do not work on the Quest with Cybershoes. During the implementation, certain assumptions may turn out false. Of course, we will try to compensate with other games.\n\nSoftware\nIt may turn out that not all features (e.g. the stretch goals) can be delivered in time. This should not hinder delivering the product to the backers because the software can be updated.\n\nUnforeseen threats\nRegarding Corona mitigation: we\u2019re planning on having all parts at the factory in February leaving us room for potential delays in the supply chain. Other than that, fingers crossed.\n\nCustoms\nIn the US and the EU Cybershoes will be delivered free of duty. For all products delivered in the EU, we render 20%VAT to the authorities. This explains why we try to keep the tiers at a level for the US and the EU by imposing some shipping costs on EU deliveries. Regarding other countries, taxes and customs may incur and are to be paid by the backer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nCybershoes are designed to last a very long time. The material is extremely sturdy that can take a full body's weight easily. Our philosophy is to provide support and backward compatibility to all models. While improving the new generation of Shoes, Cyberchair, and Cybercarpet, we managed to keep compatibility with the Cybershoes from the 2018 Kickstarter. We've spent countless hours finding ways on how to keep backward compatibility. All you need is the new Cybershoes receiver and you can use your existing Cybershoes on the Quest standalone platform.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe re-use the parts that come back to us. After a quality check, those parts may be used as spare parts where needed. We do not accept that online-retailers trash returns, we take damaged items back. We repair what is possible, or use for our own demos and quality tests. The packaging materials are minimized to the essentials. There is no stuffing. Instead of using bubble foil, we wrap the Cybershoes into the Cybercarpet. The upholstery of the Cyberchair protects sensitive parts.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe produce in Europe, we know the factory, we know the workers, we go there and can feel good about the way how they live and how they deal with environmental protection. As in almost any high tech product, the Cybershoes comes with batteries. The shoes can be opened with a standard screwdriver in order to dispose or exchange the battery. Regarding the new receiver, we refrained from placing another battery in it. We're using the USB power of the Oculus headset.\nSustainable Distribution\nFrom our 2018 Kickstarter campaign, we've learned what international shipping means: High cost and a lot of cerosine burned. For this Kickstarter, we deliberately chose appropriate shipping costs for countries that we cannot deliver the Cybershoes by means of ground transportation. We do have warehouses in Europe (Estonia) and in the United States (Oregon). We assume that 90% of the shipments can be delivered without air cargo.\nSomething else\nWith the Cybershoes product, we clearly aim for active gaming. We believe that you should use your full body when it comes to entering the virtual world. Yes, a gaming session of a few hours can be quite exhausting. But when you feel on your body that you've burned calories while having fun - that is a good moment. \nThere is also interest from projects around the world that deal with VR health care, like the VR health project from Argentina, or a project from Switzerland.

A dark vigilante film noir, tribute to Death Wish, Taxi Driver and The Exterminator.\n COMMANDO NINJA 1 FULL MOVIE: https://youtu.be/No6isuzn0FQ\n Follow Commando Ninja on: FACEBOOK,INSTAGRAM.\nCOMMANDO NINJA 2: Invasion America is the direct sequel to COMMANDO NINJA.\nCOMMANDO NINJA is a 2018 indie movie funded on Kickstarter. We had over 5 Million views on Youtube, it was dubbed and translated into 7 languages, and was supported by Kung Fury's creator David Sandberg!\nOur movie was screened all over the world in theaters, festivals, and was acclaimed as a true and sincere tribute to the classic Action Heroes era.\n WATCH COMMANDO NINJA NOW !! \nCOMMANDO NINJA 2 STORY WILL FOLLOW WHAT WAS INTROCUDED IN THE \"HOPKINS\" PREQUEL SHORT FILM:\n1988, Communists have been planning to invade America for the past 10 years, hiding entire divisions underneath major cities, moving through the sewer network, and infiltrating into the population! Nobody can believe it!\nToday is the 4th of July, the day they have chosen to launch their operation.\nHopkins is gonna have to rally the team, John, Kowalsky and Jenny to fight back, and destroy the evil at its source, the house of the rising sun, VIETNAM! When America is under Attack, When Governments can't help, if you find them, maybe you can Hire them :\n THE COMMANDO NINJAS ARE BACK TO MAKE AMERICA FREE AGAIN!!!\nTHE MOVIE will have similarities with our Prequel Comic Book published in 2019, we will use it as a reference.\nYou can READ THE FIRST 10 PAGES HERE, and BUY IT IN DIGITAL FORMAT HERE.\nHere is the Comic Book Trailer:\nAs you may know if you are already a Commando Ninja fan, we love the 80's, and particularly the Action Heroes era! \nCommando Ninja was a tribute to Commando, Predator, American Ninja and others. This time Commando Ninja 2 will take it's inspiration from movies like Invasion USA, They Live, The Red Dawn, Rambo 2, Missing in Action...\nCommando Ninja 2 will still be an over the top Action Comedy: Dark Humour, over the top violence, famous punch lines and other crazy scenes (think dinosaurs, zombies, mutants...) \nIn this sequel, our wish is also to introduce a big \"ADVENTURE\" component. Our Characters will travel in a foreign tropical environment, meeting ancient civilizations and wild animals. Think Indiana Jones meets Apocalypse Now and Jurassic Park.\nThe Action will take place in the United States of America and in the deep jungles of Vietnam. This time we are thinking big, and with zero greenscreen/CGI, we have made plans and deals to shoot both in Utah and Thailand. I personally believe that the audience can feel if something is real on screen ( Think Baby Yoda versus Jar Jar!!), and I have the will to shoot as much as possible at real locations, both for my actors and the credibility of my pictures.\nIn terms of SFX, this time we are going 100% for full live on-set practical effects, thanks to new partnerships with Armorer/pyrotechnics and Make-Up/SFX specialists. Think nice squibs, explosions, real weapon shooting, practical monsters and make-up.\nThe original soundtrack will be composed by our glorious returning composer Thomas Cappeau! Want to remind yourself of the Commando Ninja 1 OST while you read the rest of this Kickstarter? As the action will also happen in Southwest America, we will team up with Swamp Music Players among others for some real american tracks.\nI don't want to spoil too much, so here are a few COMMANDO NINJA 2 characters, some of them you already know!\n\nJOHN\n          John is a former Green Beret and Vietnam Veteran. He learnt Ninjutsu from his Vietcong Jail Keeper when he was a POW. After the events of Commando Ninja and the destruction of the Pentangle terrorist organization, he retired peacefully in a small town of Utah. He is now working hard as a truck driver to pay for his daughter's college fees.\n\"Walking in is the easy part ! it\u2019s walking out without your dick in a sling that\u2019s rough...\"\nHOPKINS\nHopkins joined the army at 16. He is a funny guy from Mississippi. He lost his arm, severed by a Ninja during Vietnam, and has now a cybernetic hand. He is one of the few who survived the communist velociraptors and became an Air Force Colonel. After the events of Commando Ninja, he was fired from the Army for stealing a time travel prototype vehicle to save his friends from the apocalyptic future of 1998. He is now working in a small municipality of Utah as a sheriff.\n\" Do you know why Americans don't have hemorrhoids? That's because all the assholes are in Canada! \"\nKOWALSKY\nMissing in Action during the Vietnam War, he was one of the 4 members of John's Green Berets Search & Destroy Unit. From Polish origins, he joined the corps at 18, known in Vietnam as the most famous \"Lizard Smoker\", specialized at dinosaurs counter-guerilla warfare.\nDuring the events of Commando Ninja, Kowalsky has been abducted by Communists. His brain was replaced by a powerful 4Mhz Micro processor, and his skeleton replaced by a combat chassis, fully armored. He was used as a hitman by Colonel Kinsky, until Jenny reprogrammed him in the future to be American again. Kowalsky now lives hidden in a trailer park, spending his days watching for UFO's.\n\"Come on, you bunch of Filthy Swingers Commie lizards jerks\"\nJENNY\nJenny was a normal child, playing video games, riding her bmx bike, chillin out with friends, going to school... Until she got abducted by a Ninja Organization and was sent to the future of 1998 where time passed 10 times faster than in the 1980's, due to the quantic correlation of the strings, and became a grown up post-apocalyptic guerrilla fighter. She is now 20 and goes to College. She's also got a new badass haircut.\n\"Kill everyone of those motherfuckers Dad\"\nLAN\nLan is a new character to the series introduced in \"Hopkins\". Vietcong fighter from 1965 to 1974, she lost her family during the American bombing over North Vietnam and carries an infinite hate for capitalism.  She is now one of the leaders of the communist invading army hiding in America. She will play a key role in Commando Ninja 2.\nHere is a work in progress example of the rewards you could own! These are only rough layouts for Kickstarter, but Definitive Artwork for the rewards (Bluray Covers, Poster, Tee Shirt) will be updated during the campaign and your opinion will count.\n\nMe posing with the Commando Ninja merchandising!\nI'm a French director based in Montpellier.  I've been working in the video games industry for the last 12 years, where I had the chance to produce trailers for famous brands like Assassin's Creed, Tom Clancy or Mario. More recently I spent 2 years in Vancouver BC, North America, and worked on stuff like Age of Empires 4, Sponge Bob and Dead Cells!\nI'm also the creator of Commando Ninja and a few other short films.\nYoutube Channel\nwww.benjamincombes.com\nAs we did for Commando Ninja, our goal is to show that we can produce a movie with a very small and limited crew, and without the stress of complicated legal stuff, huge crew / gear and big studios.\nWe did Commando Ninja with 30K. This time we are gonna need at least 3 times this budget, because we have bigger ambitions, meaning we need to work with new and talented professionals, hire new locations, and pay for EXPLOSIONS!\nMaking the HOPKINS Short film was also part of the process to improve the quality of our work. We are aiming for a more \"professional\" quality, in terms of picture and production for Commando Ninja 2.\nMoney will go to Talent, Production design, Props, Costumes, SFX, Make-Up, Catering, Travels, Locations, Stunts, Fight Choreography, Sound Design, Music... And of course the money will help to produce the Kickstarter rewards!\nWe're open to all the help we can get, so if you feel like you can contribute to this movie in any way, please contact us at: ben.combes86@gmail.com \nAsk all your questions and join the Commando Ninja 2 chat at :\nhttps://discord.gg/4WgPNaKFsF\n\nTHANKS FOR READING!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCOMMANDO NINJA 2 is a very ambitious project.

The working title is Stories from a Silicon Valley HR Tech Executive: The Good, The Bad & the Ugly.\"  I wrote this book to give a window into what life is really like working in tech companies with young CEOs who are changing the world. This book chronicles my life as an HR leader at 5 different tech start ups.  How I survived the exciting tech scene in San Francisco and the many lessons I learned on how to navigate being a woman and a minority in the often times homogenous world of tech.   I wanted to tell the stories of what really happens behind the scenes of start up life set amidst the backdrop of the tech worlds in both San Francisco and New York City.  \n\nI wrote this book because I wanted to provide a glimpse into the fast paced, always changing world of tech.  It was my privilege to work in 5 different tech start ups as the VP of HR.   I learned a ton about the Silicon Valley tech scene, and myself.  In this book, I share some behind the scenes footage and some stories about the things that make working in tech so hard.  It\u2019s not all free food and games every day.  It is hard work with constant deadlines and lots of moving pieces that make juggling a career in tech one of the most fascinating experiences.   \n  My hope is that, in reading this book, you will understand how the world of tech has changed how much we expect from our employers. My experiences in tech made demands on me that were sometimes at odds with who I was and what I believed.  The many stories in this book are mostly from my own perspective and serve to provide you with a window of the sacrifices I made to thrive in this fast paced, constantly pivoting, highly innovative tech industry.    \n  In this book, you'll learn about:\nHow men\u2019s bladders can expand to the size of a basketball\nHow crying at work gave me an identity\nHow it feels to be the only woman at the executive table \nYou will love this book if you:\n1) have always wondered what if feels like to work in a tech company;  2) have always wanted to know how such young tech CEOs navigate juggling multiple decisions and priorities at various points in the life cycle of their companies; and 3) have wanted to have a career in tech but haven't been able to break into it.  \n  This non fiction book is a book that speaks to anyone who wants to work in tech, start up CEOs who want to understand lessons from their own peers and anyone who wants to look at how tech has changed who we are at work.\n\nStories from a Silicon Valley HR Tech Executive:  The Good, The Bad & the Ugly \nThe book is written in four parts.\n  Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3 which describe the earlier parts of my career and how I ended up at the executive table at 5 different start up companies\n\nPart 2 contains chapters 4-7 which describe the middle parts of my career and the \u2018juicy\u2019 moments that made me question what the hell I was doing in what I thought was a very dysfunctional world.  These chapters describe how much I learned about myself and the leaders that I worked with and found my way through the maze of start up land.  \n\nPart 3 contains chapters 8-10 which describe the latter years of my career where I learn to look back and understand how I was able to thrive in these complex and always changing environments. It was only when I left my in-house roles that I could see clearly that I needed a break.  Burnout is a real struggle, but especially for those tech workers who never finish their life\u2019s work.\n\nPart 4 contains an Epilogue where I discuss what it was like to go out on my own (scary!) and then after some time off, go back in-house to do it all over again!\n \nWhat I Need & What You'll Get \nThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:\n\nThe editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021\nThe cover design of my book\nThe layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, e-book formats)\nThe copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication\nThe launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this in the Spring of 2021\nWhen I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.\n\nI am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:\nYou will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish\nYour name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book\nYou will receive early access to the Introduction and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review them and give me early feedback\nYou will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title\nAbout the Author\nMai Ton has been the VP of HR for five different tech start up companies.  She was the first HR person hired and had to build the team, the function and the company all while working with some of the youngest CEOs.  Mai has won 14 awards for her companies, and has three individual awards including Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Technology, Top 50 Tech Leaders in and Top 20 Tech Trailblazers. She is currently the Chief People Officer at Kickstarter.\n\nMai wrote this book to give a window into the life of what working in a tech start up really feels like.  It wasn\u2019t always free food and great benefits.  There were many times when she had to figure out if she was the only adult in the room.  She provides all these stories without identifying the companies or the people but the behind the scenes accounts are set amidst the backdrop of both San Francisco and New York City.  \n  Mai is a Board member of LEAP a non profit organization that helps Asian Americans break the bamboo ceiling. She is an advisor to some of the newest HR technology software companies and shares her knowledge with others by speaking at various HR conferences, where she always seems to weave in a story about her 12 year old daughter Emma. She tells us that she works hard to show Emma that her generation will ensure that working doesn\u2019t have to suck.\n\nMai received a BA in Sociology from the University of Texas, Austin. You can find her in New York City and at mai@kickstarter.com or find her on LinkedIn, and @maitonpai on Twitter.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nI know this isn't the best time to ask for a financial contribution, but that doesn't mean you can't help me:\nPlease share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network.

Drawing upon numerous contemporary and modern first-hand accounts, most of which have never been made available in English, the book aims to be one of the most detailed works ever published about Japanese game development during the 1990s.\nRead the excerpt here: Hideyuki Suganami and the Birth of Seven Force\nLegends, at its heart, strives to preserve and make accessible the stories behind one of the most exciting times in Japanese video game history. The book will appeal to all who are interested in how video games were developed in the 1990s, whether diehard fans of Treasure or just discovering their games.\nThrough extensive use of translated references, Legends presents a complete picture of the different aspects involved in video game development, including:\nThe business side of running a development company\nThe game design and development process\nThe individual developers and their backgrounds, styles, and inspirations\nThe reception and legacy of the games\nFurthermore, Legends delves deep into each of Treasure\u2019s six games on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis and presents a thorough analysis of their designs, including a detailed guide to how Treasure created the amazing visual effects for which they were famous.\nThis is accompanied by a full chapter devoted to explaining in an easy-to-understand format the workings of the Mega Drive / Genesis hardware and the creative ways that developers made use of it.\nTreasure Co., Ltd. was founded in 1992 by Masato Maegawa, a 26-year-old programmer who had just quit Konami after finishing his third year there. When he left, Maegawa managed to attract a dozen other young developers from Konami to join him at Treasure. Soon after, Maegawa made a bold, unannounced visit to Sega, had lunch with Sega president Hayao Nakayama, and negotiated a deal to develop games for the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in North America). At the time, Sega was experiencing incredible growth due to the worldwide success of its console.\nOver the next three years, Treasure released six games on the Mega Drive:\nGunstar Heroes\nMcDonald\u2019s Treasure Land Adventure\nDynamite Headdy\nYu Yu Hakusho: Makyo Toitsusen\nAlien Soldier\nLight Crusader\nThe first of these, Gunstar Heroes, made large waves in the industry and earned Game of the Year awards from numerous publications. However, almost all of their subsequent releases were commercial failures, despite receiving high praise from critics and fans. Over the years, the reputations of these games have continued to grow, with many now being recognized as cult classics.\nThe creative and technical skill that Treasure put into each of its games makes them stand out as prime examples of the height of action game design in the 16-bit era. The rich stories behind the development of each game, despite being well-documented in Japanese, remain mostly inaccessible in English. These stories show an incredible time in video game history. Sega, at the peak of its success, gave Treasure a nearly free reign. Likewise, Maegawa gave his development staff creative freedom to make the games they wanted. The end result was a wild mixture of ideas and concepts that leapt out of the screen and that continue to impress to this day.\nSome of the many fascinating stories told in Legends of 16-Bit Game Development include:\nHideyuki Suganami\u2019s inspiration for the boss Seven Force (read the excerpt here!)\nMaegawa\u2019s strange meeting with Sega president Hayao Nakayama\nThe bizarre demands from McDonald\u2019s for McDonald\u2019s Treasure Land Adventure \nThe tragedy, and miracle, of Suganami\u2019s magnum opus, Alien Soldier \nThe joys and woes of working with Sega as a publisher\nThese stories, however, only make up a part of Legends. Each of Treasure\u2019s games is packed full of peculiar programming feats and creative design concepts, and the book explores these in detail to analyze how they work. The end result is a complete picture of Treasure as a company and the games it created.\nLegends of 16-Bit Game Development will be offset printed as a 7x10-inch premium softcover book of approximately 250 pages with full-color glossy pages. This is a book intended to be read, but it\u2019s also full of screenshots, example diagrams, concept artwork, and other visual reference materials to accompany the text. Print quality will be held to the highest standards and carefully checked before shipping.\nThis is primarily a work of historical research and documentation, but it is written in an easy-to-read, accessible style. All sources are fully and clearly documented to promote further research, and the book is full of quotes translated from the original Japanese to support and enhance the narrative.\nFor an example of what to expect, read the excerpt here: Hideyuki Suganami and the Birth of Seven Force\nI\u2019ve kept rewards simple to focus on the final product. There are three tiers of rewards:\nGaming Fanatic: The base reward is the book itself, a 7x10-inch premium softcover book with approximately 250 full-color glossy pages. All backers will have their name or a tasteful pseudonym printed at the end of the book.\nGaming Historian: For the diehard fan of video game history, I am including a Kickstarter exclusive reward: a 7x10-inch, 50- to 75-page companion booklet full of translated interviews, writings, and other primary sources related to Treasure and its games. These are the most relevant sources that were used in writing the book. This will never be published again outside this Kickstarter campaign. This reward tier also includes the main book.\nMega Driver: For the ultimate Mega Driver out there, I am offering a further reward, a chance for you to express your passion for this project and for video game history. You will be given the opportunity to write a 100-word statement to be included as a supplement to a section at the end of the book titled \u201cThe Lasting Worldwide Legacy of Treasure.\u201d The purpose of this statement is to show Treasure\u2019s impact on you, your passion for a particular game or games covered in the book, or something of a similar nature to be decided in consultation with me. Final acceptance is conditional on editorial approval. Furthermore, all backers of this tier will have their name or a tasteful pseudonym printed prominently at the beginning of the book in large, bold letters under a special heading of eternal gratitude. This reward tier also includes the main book and the companion booklet.\nMy name is John Harrison. I am a self-described historian of Japanese video games and the publisher of Mega Drive Shock, a website devoted to documenting and translating the history of the Sega Mega Drive in Japan. About ten years ago, I began the daunting task of collecting all of the documentation ever published in Japan about the Mega Drive, from gaming magazines to business-oriented books to Sega\u2019s newsletters, and that research forms the basis of this project.\nI was particularly drawn to the story of Treasure because it is, in my opinion, the most incredible of any of the small developers coming out of that era. Few other developers have managed to retain a fan base to the extent that Treasure has, and if anything, their reputation continues to grow year-by-year. In writing this book, I hope to share and preserve in physical format the stories behind Treasure and its games. These stories are more than worthy of preservation and the thought that they might be forgotten is a sad one.\nI currently live in North America, although I spent the majority of my adult life in Japan, where I resided for over 10 years and where I grew to appreciate Japanese games. In my day job, I am a teacher and research scientist.\nI have completed the research for the book and I am in the process of writing, with about 40% of the book done as of the creation of this campaign. I expect to be finished with writing by April, 2021, at which point the editing process will occur. I will be using the services of a professional copy editor to ensure the highest standard for the written text. Concurrently, I will be working on the layout of the book. I expect editing and layout work to take two months. Following that, it will take approximately two months to print the book and ship it to distribution centers. The initial shipments to backers are expected to go out around August, 2021 at the earliest.\nShipping costs are calculated in addition to the base reward amount. Shipping will primarily be from the United States, but I will also employ a distribution center in Europe to expedite the process and reduce costs. Backers in the EU should not have to pay any import taxes, and the shipping value will be marked to reflect the actual cost of printing.\n\nVideo music by Shane Ivers - https://www.silvermansound.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks associated with any project like this, especially related to maintaining the time schedule to get the books in backers\u2019 hands.

Film director Terry Gilliam is known for creating these strange, marvelous worlds. He does things like having an artificial prop sun appear in the real world and such. When I was making the design proposal for the game, I thought it would be interesting to try to create a world like that. Then, when we did the initial implementation, I thought it looked pretty good so I decided to focus more on it. That was the point where I knew I had to go for it completely.

The final week's issue contained a lengthy round table discussion between five of Sega's greatest developers, including Treasure founder Masato Maegawa.

The first chapter of the book deals with Masato Maegawa's background--how he started programming, why he joined Konami, the games he worked on there, his impetus for creating Treasure, and so on. Part of this research involved delving into the history of Japan's 'micom' (microcomputer) boom at the end of the 1970s. Maegawa, like many other Japanese game developers of the 1980s and 1990s, was introduced to programming during this time, when Japanese manufacturers such as NEC, Sharp, and Fujitsu started to release affordable home PCs. These PCs typically came equipped with a variant of BASIC, and many future game developers in Japan got their start through experimenting with it. The impact of the micom boom on the video game industry in Japan was profound, and reading about it makes me imagine the excitement that an entire generation of Japanese youth must have felt experiencing the joys of computers and programming for the first time."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Only 18 Hours Remaining!", "update_content": "This is a last call to anyone who is still interested in backing but hasn't done so yet: there are just 18 hours remaining!\nThe companion booklet (full of a ton of fascinating, never-before-translated Treasure interviews and writings) will only be available in this campaign, so be sure to get it if you're interested.\nOnce again, I want to give a big thank you to all the backers who made this happen, and also to everyone who has been sharing this campaign around the internet.

Most of the time this chaotic process just makes an unredeemable ugly mess. But occasionally, rarely, something wonderful and impossible happens: a beautiful pattern emerges, or a strange looking animal or an alien landscape.\nThis has sobering philosophical implications for how complexity and even we ourselves might have come into existence. Opponents of evolutionary theory argue that \u201cintelligent\u201d order can never come out of chaos\u2014but I see counter-entropy happening in my fractal models on a daily basis. True, I do act as an environmental pressure on the process, allowing only the patterns that please me to \u201csurvive\u201d. But those happy accidents do occur on a regular, if rare, basis.

It is a term that refers to the different treatment or moral consideration of individuals based on their species. Why do we value the life of a dog more than the life of a cow? The answer is not scientific but purely cultural. With this film, we want to raise the important question, if it is morally justifiable to exploit other non-human animals by consuming and using them as we do in our daily lives.\n\nDEUTSCH: Ich m\u00f6chte meine F\u00e4higkeit, Filme zu drehen und meine Leidenschaft als Tierrechtsaktivistin nutzen, um eine Geschichte \u00fcber ein Thema zu erz\u00e4hlen, \u00fcber das nicht genug gesprochen wird: Speziesismus. Es ist ein Begriff, der sich auf die unterschiedliche Behandlung oder moralische Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Individuen bezieht. Allein abh\u00e4ngig von ihrer Spezies. Warum sch\u00e4tzen wir das Leben eines Hundes mehr als das Leben einer Kuh? Die Antwort ist nicht wissenschaftlich, sondern rein kulturell bedingt. Mit diesem Film wollen wir die wichtige Frage aufwerfen, ob es moralisch vertretbar ist, andere nicht menschliche Tiere auszubeuten, indem wir sie in unserem t\u00e4glichen Leben nutzen und konsumieren.\n\n\n Who are we? - Wer sind wir?\nThe Team - Maurice Cannon, Franziska M\u00fcller, Ufuk Kubat, Hyung-Guhn \"Hugo\" Yi\nENGLISH: We are three film students from Germany who are currently graduating from university with this project.

Furthermore, Hyung-Guhn \"Hugo\" Yi, who has already graduated, also joined the team as a producer.  \nWe want to create an exciting and thrilling film, that is not only fun to watch, but that will make people think. \n\nDEUTSCH: Wir sind drei Filmstudenten aus Deutschland, die mit diesem Projekt ihren Bachelor of Arts abschlie\u00dfen werden.

We can build a forest-hut-set in our university's studio facility. It's a key scene in the movie and to make it look unique, we have to invest in proper materials. \n\nTransportation and accommodation: Both of our main actresses' transportation and accommodation costs need to be paid. Also, we need a budget for the fuel used, transporting a 15-people-crew to all our shooting locations and back home. :)\n\nCatering: We do have a great vegan restaurant from Frankfurt am Main sponsoring parts of our catering.

Since we are already starting the shoot on the 15th of October, we are assuming that no major changed in those guidelines will occur until then, which would prevent us from making our film.

With the help of this book, you can learn these skills too.\nProsciutto ham and cheese. These foods are often taken for granted, or seen as too complicated to make at home, but are actually quite simple processes that this book can teach you.\n\nIt\u2019s often intimidating to face learning all the skills we need for a future off the grid. With A Year in an Off-Grid Kitchen, you can treat it as a self-paced homestead cooking course, or just pick the book up and learn something new whenever you like.\n\nKimchi. I share the easy fermenting recipes and techniques that are staples in my home, and the same ones that I sell to my market customers. I provide clear instructions that suit anyone from beginners to advanced cooks, one recipe tester said \u201cThis is the first ferment I've made that I felt like I could trust!\u201d\n\nThe book\u2026\nAround 220 pages in length, 10.75\u201d by 8.25\u201d in size, the book is packed full with over 100 recipes to make, skills to learn, and tips and tricks to make real food cooking work in busy lifestyles, wherever you are.\n\nThe recipes are not just any recipes, but adaptable everyday ones that you\u2019ll want to make over and over, using easily-found ingredients.\n\nThese recipes have been tested  in many different kitchens, and will work on wood stoves as well as conventional electric and gas cookers. These are the recipes that fuel my homestead. I\u2019ve included many variations and ingredient substitutions to help you make the recipes with whatever ingredients are on hand at the time.\n\nThe book is presented in full colour, with lots of full-page photos, plus smaller photos on some pages.\n\nI\u2019m putting a lot of effort into creating good indexes to make the book even more useful - including an index by ingredient, so you can quickly make use of seasonal produce or food that needs to be used up, an index by meal is also provided, so you can easily find the right meal to suit your day, whether it be ideas for breakfast, quick meals to get on the table fast, or slow cooking and make-ahead meals.\n\nFollowing the seasons...\nLate winter\nA Year in an Off-Grid Kitchen begins in late winter, where we learn how to make bone broth, soups, and stews from storage vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, carrots, turnips, and other roots. This chapter offers a great starting point where you can dive in at any time of the year to create nourishing budget-friendly meals from local ingredients.\n\nRecipes include\u2026\n\u2022Beef and Winter Vegetable Minestrone\n\u2022Farmhouse Vegetable and Barley Stew\n\u2022Beef, Beetroot, and Caraway Stew\n\u2022Indian Lentil and Vegetable Stew\n\u2022Japanese Beef Curry\n\u2022Mexican Lentil Soup\n\u2022Classic Pumpkin Soup\n\u2022Chickpea and Chorizo Stew\n\u2022Welsh Leek and Lamb Stew\n\u2022Indian Lamb Stew\n\u2022Turmeric Braised Vegetables\n\u2022Braised Red Cabbage with Apple and Onion\n\u2022Anyvegetable Gratin\n\u2022Parsnip and Rutabaga Mash\nBeef, Beetroot, and Caraway Stew\nEarly Spring\nIn early spring the focus is on eggs and greens. Not just the cultivated greens in the garden, but wild ones from the land and the sea. You\u2019ll learn how to forage, prepare, and cook wild, perennial, and garden greens, how to preserve nettles, how to forage and preserve edible seaweeds, along with an abundance of tasty egg recipes.\nRecipes include\u2026\n\u2022Simple ways to serve greens: Greens cooked after sausages, greens in cream sauce, kale chips, greens and kelp, herb and cheese omelette, any vegetable frittata.\n\u2022Green and Egg Slabs\n\u2022Thai-Style Greens, Carrot Noodles, and Eggs\n\u2022Hueveros Rancheros\n\u2022Bacon and Egg Fried Rice\n\u2022Korean Egg, Green, and Rice Bowls\n\u2022Cream of Wild Green Soup\n\u2022Green Egg Drop Soup\n\u2022Lamb Dolmade Casserole\n\nKorean Egg, Green, and Rice Bowls\nLate Spring\nIn late spring we focus on home dairying. This chapter includes all the skills you\u2019d normally learn and use from an entire book about home dairying, but focusing on just the important stuff - butter, sour cream, hard cheese, yoghurt, DIY cheese starter cultures, soft cheeses, and melty mozzarella. Feedback from recipe testers is that \"this is a fantastic introduction for people to the cheese making world\".\nRecipes include\u2026\n\u2022Cr\u00e9me Fra\u00eeche (Sour Cream)\n\u2022Butter\n\u2022Ghee (Clarified Butter)\n\u2022Yoghurt\n\u2022Yoghurt Cheese\n\u2022Kefir\n\u2022Ricotta\n\u2022Paneer\n\u2022Soft Cultured Cheese (Ch\u00e9vre)\n\u2022Mozzarella\n\u2022Tomme Hard Cheese\n\u2022Feta\n\u2022Paneer Makhani or Butter Chicken\n\u2022Butternut Squash and Spinach Salad with Cheese\n\nHomemade cultured butter and other dairy staples are easily made from scratch once you learn my simple techniques\nEarly Summer\nIn early summer the focus is on new potatoes, and foods that go well with them, along with foods to share at picnics, and simple summer recipes.

Many cookbooks are written by people that are either professional chefs, or have smaller households to feed, that have time to do fiddly techniques to prepare smaller amounts of food. My recipes are flexible, to provide for varying household sizes, but the techniques I use are ones that produce lots of food and taste, using minimal effort and time, from local, natural foods. A book with this approach is desperately needed to help us reclaim food security skills and cook from scratch even in busy times.\n\nStretch goals!\nAll backers at the ultimate supporter level and up will receive the following extra goodies if the stretch goals are met:\n\nUNLOCKED - $15,000aud ($10,950usd) Stretch goal - Rocket Ovens digital dvd by Paul Wheaton\nThis 2 hour documentary will show you how to build the most efficient off-grid oven.

The writing, testing, photography, and design work are all done.

With this in mind, this time I have allowed a longer deadline for getting backer copies sent out than what I\u2019m likely to need, so while you can expect them before the end of March, you might be pleasantly surprised to have them arriving earlier than expected.\n\nI will send out updates keeping you informed of the progress, so that you\u2019ll know what stage things are at, and when your book is in the mail.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "Thanks!", "descp": "Thank you!

And in time, his initial 20 to 30 cars exploded into one of the world\u2019s largest Matchbox collections \u2013 more than 42,000 cars, monstrous enough for him to turn practically his entire home into a museum.\nOfficial poster for The Matchbox Man\nCharlie leads us on a dazzling mini-museum tour, a private peek into his vast treasure. Your eyes will have a hard time focusing and your mind will be boggled by each room you see \u2013 Where do I look first? All these colors! These cars are really old! Wow \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen that one before! Stop! I\u2019m not done looking yet! \nCharlie has one of nearly every model Matchbox car ever made. He goes deep into the details, showing off some of the variations that hardcore collectors desire: sizes, car colors, windshields, decals and wheel types.\nVisit Charlie's Facebook page for the Matchbox & Lesney Toy Museum here.\nVisit his Matchbox eBay store here.\nCover of the first Matchbox catalog from 1957.\nAbout the documentary...\nFor those of you who have seen Pizza, A Love Story, or any of Gorman Bechard's other 7 feature documentaries, you know the work speaks for itself.  This film is a short documentary, Bechard's first short film in years.  But it will be fast, funny, informative, and just generally rock your world, making you hit replay the moment it is over. \nWhy We Are Making This Film...\nWe are obsessed with obsession, as if the title of our first documentary, Color Me Obsessed, A Film About The Replacements, didn't give that away.  We love the passion involved, the personal details, the drive to turn what would be for anyone else a hobby, into something full-blown and uncontrollable. \nWho Are We?\nDirector Gorman Bechard, co-owner of What Were We Thinking Films, has numerous feature-length documentaries and narrative features to his credit.\nGorman most recently directed the documentary, Pizza, A Love Story, which looks at the history behind the three greatest pizza places in the world, New Haven's own Pepe's, Sally's, and Modern.  As well as Seniors A Documentary, which finds Bechard training his lens on some of the most spirited senior dogs on the planet and the people who love them. \nThe limited edition Matchbox Man car (offered as a reward). Only 25 of these beauties will be made.\nGorman is also the director of Color Me Obsessed, a film about The Replacements, which Rolling Stone called one of \u201cThe Seven Best New Music Documentaries of the Year,\u201d as well as four other rock-docs: What Did You Expect? The Archers of Loaf live at Cat's Cradle; Every Everything: the music, life & times of Grant Hart; Who is Lydia Loveless?; and What it Takes: film en douze tableaux, his look at the recording of the last album from Sarah Shook and the Disarmers, and the animal welfare documentary, A Dog Named Gucci, for which he was awarded the ASPCA Media Excellence Award 2015 for his work on that film.  His narrative features include the award-winning Friends (With Benefits), You Are Alone, and Broken Side of Time, and the horror cult classics Psychos in Love and Disconnected, both of which were recently released in deluxe bluray editions from Vinegar Syndrome.\nYou can read an interview with Gorman Bechard in FilmMaker Magazine here. He is also co-founder of the NHdocs: the New Haven Documentary Film Festival, held every June at Yale.  This year the 11-day event screened over 110 films and featured the first ever tribute to filmmaker Michael Moore.\nGorman's full bio can be found here.\nOur company, the micro-studio What Were We Thinking Films, founded in 2004, has a proven track record, with over 30 years of experience making feature films.\nAnd as usual, Gorman will have on board the crew that have made his films work of the past decade, including musician Dean Falcone, who will be scoring the film.  Dean a fleet-fingered guitarist and eclectic pop/rock composer who\u2019s been playing in bands since his pre-teens. He\u2019s worked with filmmaker Gorman Bechard on several different projects, scoring FRIENDS (WITH BENEFITS), BROKEN SIDE OF TIME, A DOG NAMED GUCCI and WHO IS LYDIA LOVELESS. He is also the co-producer of the documentary COLOR ME OBSESSED, A FILM ABOUT THE REPLACEMENTS and of course PIZZA, A LOVE STORY. He\u2019s helmed acts such as The Excerpts (w/Jon Brion), 100 Faces, Dean & the Dragsters, The Shellye Valauskas Experience, Tipsy in Chelsea and The Zambonis, among others. He has shared the stage and/or produced/recorded with: Aimee Mann, Eddie Vedder, Norah Jones, Brian May, Susanna Hoffs and many others. Dean is also the anything-goes impresario of the legendary \u201cVomitorium\u201d extravaganza every Thanksgiving at Caf\u00e9 Nine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nWhere Your Money Goes...\nThe film is already shot and completely edited.  Funds raised during this campaign will go toward music, a sound mix, film festival submission fees, and insurance.  We're asking for $4,000, but that's the minimum.  It's why there are so many great rewards.  Let's   raise double that so we can submit to more festivals, spend more on extras for the DVD, make the film even shinier, like a mint condition Matchbox car.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou can feel confident supporting this project because it's basically finished. Plus our films always get distribution, as well as acceptance into leading film festivals such as Big Sky, IFF Boston, Sidewalk, Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival, Woods Hole, Sonoma Film Festival, NHdocs, and so many more. That is never an issue for us. \n\nOur goal is to premier the film at film festivals around the country in early 2021, and release the film on DVD and pay-per-view in Fall of that same year. But this isn't always a perfect world. So worst case, it may take a little longer than we expected to deliver the DVDs and other rewards.

winning comic book artist and writer, best known as the co-creator of Powers with Brian Michael Bendis, as well as Marvel's THOR: Ragnarok, Red Sonja and Cave Carson with Gerard Way.\nThis is a Kickstarter for my project, the AFTER REALM - an ongoing quarterly series -- each issue is double sized, written and drawn by me. Colors by Taki Soma and letters by Shawn Lee - The team that brought you Dick Tracy: Forever.\nThis fourth issue will be exclusively available on Kickstarter; this is our first foray of publishing without Image comics.

This will be a dangerous but fun series filled with my childhood inspirations.\nThe After Realm is about Oona Lightfoot, an Elf torn away from her best friend at the beginning of Ragnarok and the destruction of the Nine Realms.\nShe struggles to find her friend to fulfill a promise they made about exploring the Nine Realms.\nAfter saving her people from Loki, Oona sets out to explore those new worlds and record what has become of them,  and to record what happened to the Old Gods and the new peoples that inhabit it.\n***************************************************************\nISSUE 4 COVER BY OEMING \n\n ISSUE 4 ALT COVER BY ELSA CHARRETIER \n\nTHE CAST:\n\nPREVIEW ART FROM ISSUE 4:\nFREE STORY SAMPLE:\nClick for link\nREWARD IMAGES:\n The After Realm Coaster\nLIMITED AVAILABILITY\n\n\n\n6\"x9\" SKETCH OF POWERS WALKER & DEENA (SAMPLE)\nCLICK FOR VIDEO\n6\"x9\" SKETCH OF OONA LIGHTFOOT (SAMPLE)\nclick for video\nBOOKMARK PIN UP ORIGINAL 11x17 ART $300\nBOOKMARK PIN UP ORIGINAL 11x17 ART\nBOOK MARK ART\n\n PAGE 32 ISSUE 3 ORIGINAL 11x17 ART $300\n\nPrinted Version\nPAGE 4 ISSUE 3 ORIGINAL 11x17 ART\nPAGE 4 ISSUE 3 ORIGINAL 11x17 ART\nPrinted Version\nOONA ORIGINAL ISSUE 1 PIN UP ART\n POOKA AND OONA ORIGNAL POSTER ART 11X17\nPOOKA POSTER ORIGINAL ART 11x17\n PAGE 22 ISSUE 3 ORIGINAL 11x17 ART $250\nPAGE 29 ISSUE 3 ORIGINAL 11x17 ART\nPAGE 29 ISSUE 3 ORIGINAL 11x17 ART\n ORIGINAL ART FOR KS VIDEO $250\n ADD-ONS!\nADD-ONS\n\n FRIENDS OF THE AFTER REALM!\nTHUMB BOOK: THUMBNAIL SKETCH BOOK FOR CARTOONISTS\nClick for Link\nHELM GREYCASTLE\nIF YOU LIKE AFTER REALM...\nClick for Link\n\nLIKE FATHER, LIKE DAUGHTER: ACTION AND FUN!\nClick for link\nCORPORATE COFFIN EXPANSION PACK!\n FUN GAME!\nClick for Link\nTHE WAILING BLADE\nI did a pin up for this fun book!\nClick for Link\n2020: Hard Times in the Anarchist Jurisdiction!\n SO FUNNY- A GREAT HOLIDAY GIFT\nCLICK FOR LINK", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th campaign for The After Realm, and we've learned a lot!

(itch.io)\nWishlist DoubleShake on Steam!\nChat with the team and other fans in our Public Discord channel!\nCheck out our PayPal Donation Form for an alternate donation method!\nFor streamers, youtubers, or journalists interested in covering DoubleShake: Check out our press kit!\n\nDoubleShake is our love letter to our favorite PlayStation 1 and Nintendo 64 games that we grew up with, such as \"Mischief Makers\", \"Tomba!\"*, and \"Klonoa\". Our goal is to utilize modern technology, techniques. and game design to \"shake up\" this nostalgic aesthetic.\n(*some of y'all outside of North America might know it as \"Tombi\")\n\nOur current target platforms are PC/Linux (Steam and Itch.io), as well as Nintendo Switch. We'll be researching and shooting for as many other storefronts and platforms as possible, but they do have their challenges:\n Mac is supported by Unity with no additional costs (just as Linux is), but we'll need to squeeze a bit of budget to acquire a Mac machine.\n PlayStation and XBOX are low-priority, but possibilities. We'll explore these options if we have positive experiences porting to other platforms, and if we do, they'll be post-release ports.\nThe Story:\nOur heroine, Loam, is just chillin' on the beach when --\nLoam goes to investigate the catastrophe, but along the way she grapples with an unsettling crew of bandits known as The Agents of Chaos, who are up to no good. It's up to her to bring peace and serenity back to Caliko Archipelago. \nBut will she succeed, or will her actions throw her home into MORE chaos...?\n GRAB just about anything not nailed down to the floor, including enemies! Carry small objects around or attach to Grapple Orbs to navigate tricky terrain!\n THROW things to clear the way! Throw carry-able things forward, up, down, and all around to solve puzzles, defeat foes, and destroy obstacles!\n SHAKE up the scene! Give your enemies a jostle, activate held objects, shake off their loose valuables, swing massive weapons, shoot guns, various other things that are too spoiler-y to mention here, and when you're not holding anything, shake your money maker to taunt enemies!\n KICK the heck out of everything to disarm enemies and ricochet off of various objects and walls. Your kick doesn't deal enough damage to anything not in shambles, but it still has great knock-back and can stun foes.\n NAVIGATE winding, twisting, branching, bobbing, flowing, changing, turning, rotating 2.5D-style paths throughout scenic vistas ranging from quaint fishing villages, volcanic mountainsides, haunted vineyards, and... an entire fusillade of in-flight missiles!? Paths can converge and split at crossroads, or Super Jump Pads can let you quickly transfer to faraway points! Also, as the game progresses, the levels become more and more puzzle and exploration-focused. \n DISCOVER a ton of secrets, items, alternate paths, and ability upgrades scattered and tucked away in the deepest darkest corners of the levels! Eat Golden Peppers to increase your max health and find ability upgrades!\n\n ENCOUNTER a band of nasty ne'er-do-wells (and the occasional dangerous wildlife), including several bosses! Utilize your grab and kick mechanics to turn their attacks and projectiles into counter-attacks, take them down and overthrow their evil plans!\nThe band of misfits known as the Agents of Chaos come in many grotesquely goofy forms.\n ROCK OUT to an amazing soundtrack filled with sick beats and chill tunes, performed by Freen in Green and their fantastic guest musician friends, AmpRen, Pill Battle, Tony Caline, and Wolfblur! While taking some inspiration from our source games, our soundtrack is also very inspired by the energy of \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" games.\nOther Features Planned & What To Expect:\nWith inspiration from Mischief Makers running in the blood of this game, expect some zany scenarios, wacky dialogue, and over-the-top set pieces.\nAccessibility Options (as much as we can manage so that more people can enjoy DoubleShake!)\nControl remapping and support for mainstream controllers.\nResolution and Old School Filter options - Play the game in crisp, modern visage, or turn on some PS1/N64-style crust for authentic effect.\nWe've broke through our initial goal! But we still have ideas to expand the game a little more! Most of the content will be small, but anything that'll push the release date too far will be saved for post-release DLC (free or paid).\nLook below to read more information on revealed goals!\n(PS: PayPal Donations also count towards our goals!)\nQuest Quencher ($11,000) [REACHED!]\nIn the spirit of \"Tomba/Tombi 1 & 2\", we'll integrate a Quest System that turns NPC's and discoveries into trackable quests with their own rewards and ability upgrades! This will also come with a Quest Log that will let you keep track of quests and objectives, including mainstream objectives.\nAlso, we promise that the quests won't be a bunch of annoying \"Fetch 20 Logs\" filler quests! We want the quests to focus on lore, story, and character development, so there'll definitely be a \"quality over quantity\" approach to quests.\nAS A BONUS, everyone who has grabbed a tier with \"Digital Game\" as a reward will ALSO receive a Digital Illustrated Instruction Manual with hand-drawn illustrations and information on various mechanics and characters in the game! The manual will also be available to anyone who buys the game on release as well!\n\nBeastly Bounty ($13,000) [REACHED!!]\nBOSSES, BOSSES, and MORE BOSSES! This will add a few additional bosses to the game, as well as optional Boss Rush modes available after completion of the game. Nightmare Boss Rush might be familiar if you've played recent \"Kirby\" titles, as it will involve fighting every boss again, but with increased difficulty and more devastating movesets!\nThe In-Game Bestiary will be a dedicated pause menu feature that'll show details and lore about every enemy and boss you've defeated. Every entry will also be added to every Digital Art Book backers receive! (the Art Book will also be available for purchase after the Kickstarter)\n\nDressed For Disaster ($15,000) [REACHED!!!]\nThis feature will add 3 purely aesthetic outfits! You'll likely unlock these from various side-quests and be able to swap between them at any time!\n Cozy Classic -- Some people may not know this, but Loam is a character of ours that existed long before DoubleShake started planning (long story short, she was designed for a different game that was cancelled). This option puts her back in her original design, sporting a comfy & stylish hoodie and ripped slacks.\n Mecha Mischief -- This option will give Loam a specially designed mechanized body. The design will be based on a specific character from one of our inspirations.\n Furry Fatale -- This option will give Loam even more animal-like features, tapping into her primal energy.\n(note: Mecha Mischief and Furry Fatale designs haven't been finalized)\n\nHeavy Hitters ($17,000) [REACHED!!!!]\nSince our soundtrack is highly inspired by \"Sonic The Hedgehog\" music and 90's rock, we got Johnny Gioeli of Crush 40 and Hardline fame on board to sing vocals in collaboration with our own musicians for a track of epic proportions!\n\nAnimated Adventures ($20,000) [REACHED!!!!!]\nWhether we hire an additional animator, an entire team, or even if we have to do it ourselves, we'll be applying additional time and/or budget into adding a little extra animated flare to DoubleShake via an animated intro and a number of animated, fully voiced, short cutscenes for major story events (exact amount is to be determined, especially based on how much time/money it'll cost). With these cutscenes, we want to take an approach that further encapsulates DoubleShake's inspiration from media in the 1990's.\nApologies if this goal is awfully vague, but the details could take a long time to iron out, likely even far after than the Kickstarter itself. If we reach this goal, we'll work out the specifics and announce the plans as soon as their concrete!\n\nCatkus Caretaker ($30,000) [NYEH!!!!!!]\n  Breed your own Catcus!\nNyeh! That's right! This massive and final goal will introduce an optional companion game mode called \"Catkus Corral\". Loam will be able to head to a special new island where Catkus-kind flourish. Here, she'll be able to breed Catki to make a whole litter of friends! She can feed them or give them items she's found on her journey, which will affect their stats, behavior, and what forms Kitten Catki will become when they grow up! Additional content planned for Catkus Corral include:\nMinigames that push your Catkus' stats to the limit!\nMany new breeds of Catkus to discover!\nTake one Catkus with you back to the adventure. This companion will act as a passive ability for Loam, helping her on her quest! The better your Catkus' stats are, the better the buff!\n  In this sub-tropical climate, the bright sun and sea breeze keeps the archipelago at perfect temperatures for chilling and relaxing. The islands are also home to several tribes of the Caliko people, whose defining features are their animal-like ears and beastly abilities, like super strength, keen senses, and cat-like reflexes.\n Loam, our heroine, is a rough-n-tumble girl and one of the native residents of the islands. Her favorite activities are running, snoozing, eating, causing mischief, competing with others, and wrestling with dangerous local wildlife. Her favorite things are big bugs, sunny days, pretty girls, and sand between her toes.  Like the rest of her clan, she has incredible strength, animal-like prowess, and powerful kicks.\n Terra, the sporty girl living on Bramble Island. Her passion is raising the Catkus that live there and harvesting the prickly pears that grow on their shells.\n Argil, the head fisherman on Tuta-Oria island who's obsessed with showing off his might to his lover by catching big fish.\n Meadow, the upbeat lighthouse keeper, carrying on a tradition of her tribe to maintain the mystical lighthouses that protect the islands.\n Nigel, a shy and reclusive scientist who's rarely seen by the natives, appears to be studying the ancient ruins and artifacts around the archipelago.\n The Pyriri, a band of immigrants who can't get enough heat, so they moved into the local volcano. They specialize in making exotic fabrics which are traded by the indigenous people and worship a dragon deity who apparently moved into the volcano with them.\n \"Father\", the enigmatic commander of The Agents of Chaos. This name is muttered with fear by even the higher ranking agents.\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we can't promise the execution of any physical rewards, however, we've got a decent selection of digital goods!

Started in 2011 and officially founded in 2015, we've been working hard to produce the kind of games we feel like the world could use a little more of.\nIn 2018, we released our first commercial product, Wonder Wickets, thanks to a small IndieGoGo campaign.

BuffaloGrid have confirmed a collaboration with UK for UNHCR, the national charity partner for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and I can now confirm the first batch of Buffalitos you have helped fund will be delivered directly to the Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in Uganda. UNHCR will ensure that they are provided for free to the people that need them most.\n\nThere are 1.2 million refugees in Uganda's Bidi Bidi Settlement which is the largest refugee camp in Uganda and the second largest in the world, covering 250 square kilometres.\nIt is estimated that 73 % of men and 44 % of women in Bidi Bidi own a phone. We are honoured to put power and light into their hands by providing Buffalitos to refugees across the camp.\n\n\nEach Buffalito sold will help support our work providing power to the 1 Billion people worldwide who lack reliable access to grid power. This helps to transform lives as people are now able to charge their cell phones so they can stay connected, and light their homes, enabling them to work and read late into the night.\n\n\n\nCharge the Buffalito and in just 50 minutes and it provides enough power to completely refill a smartphone battery, while still working as a light for hours.\n\n\n\nBuffaloGrid\u2019s mission is to remove internet adoption barriers by providing free power to charge mobile devices and digital services to connect the Next Billion.\n\n\n\nThe Buffalito is designed to act as a portable and cost-effective way for millions of people to transport and store electricity. It was created to compliment our solar-powered BuffaloGrid Hub. The Hub is a solar-powered charging station designed to sit in the centre of a village in a shop or public building where people can charge multiple phones and power banks at once.\n\n\n\n\nTechCrunch: \"...while smartphones put the internet in everybody\u2019s pocket, without a way to keep our phones powered, connectivity and its utility is limited.\" \n\nThe Guardian: \"Since 2010, BuffaloGrid has been working to bring cheap electricity to rural communities in Uganda, where 80% of the population owns mobile phones but only 5% has access to power.\"\n\n\nThe Buffalito packs a LOT of features into its small size. Whether living in a busy, modern city, or in a rural village, the Buffalito has a use for you!\n\nPower bank with a rugged design and 5v of output so you can charge even the most power-intensive phones.\n\n\nAt 160 lumens, your Buffalito will work great as a bike light. And lasts for 4 hours  even after charging your phone!\n\n\nIntegrated light with 3 different brightness settings.\n\n\nA range of accessories allow the Buffalito to be used for multiple purposes, including:\n- Bike light\n- Reading lamp \n- Portable power bank\n\n\nAt 20 lumens, the Buffalito lasts even longer and makes the ideal reading light with 36 hours of power.\n\n\nEven the packaging serves a dual purpose. We\u2019ve joined forces with Japan\u2019s N&R Foldings to make sure the Buffalito box won\u2019t end up in a landfill because it folds into a simple but beautiful lamp.\n\nFeatures Overview:\n\u2022Front LED array \n\u2022Universal mounting system for attaching a range of custom accessories. \n\u20221x USB-C port for charging \n\u20221x front button for on/off function and switching between modes. \n\u20222900mah battery \n\n\nFor over a billion people, finding somewhere to charge phones, lights and other electronic devices is still a difficult and sometimes impossible, task. \n\nThis lack of power has consequences. It creates disconnected communities, unable to keep in touch with friends and family, or access information online.\n\nGlobally, there's a growing digital, social & economic divide, which is aggravated by limited connectivity and infrastructure. Almost half the population of the planet have never experienced the internet and one of the main barriers for internet adoption is reliable access to power. There are billions of overlooked consumers, who with access to mobile digital services could improve their quality of life and business activities.\n\n\nFor each Buffalito sold, you're helping provide education, empowerment, economic development and growth that changes lives. \n\n\nWherever you are in the world, anyone can benefit from the Buffalito. For those living in rural India you can refill the power from any of our BuffaloGrid hubs. Never worry about running out of power. Charge your phone on the go and use your light to read, work or commute.\n\nBuffaloGrid is a company on a mission to bring power and connect the next billion. We\u2019ve spent the last 8 years working across India and Sub Saharan Africa to remove the barriers that millions of people face in getting online. \n\n\nLast year BuffaloGrid partnered with Airtel one of India\u2019s biggest mobile network operators to bring solar energy and internet to thousands of people in off-grid communities across Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\nWe are backed by Microsoft and by some of the most reputable Venture Capital funds in Europe. We were incubated at the Royal College of Art Incubator (Innovation RCA).\n\n\nOur products enable frontier-market smartphone owners to use their devices more often and to use them for more. We\u2019re committed to promoting sustainable development through connectivity.\n\n\nBuffaloGrid was founded by Daniel Becerra, a design entrepreneur, and Phil Schluter, a coffee trader. Phil's company had been buying coffee from rural communities in nations across Africa for more than 155 years. He witnessed how coffee farmers had to travel for up to 2.5 hours to charge their phones for vital information to trade, sometimes already having travelled for days to get to market.\n\nHaving identified a real need, and utilizing Daniel's experience in award-winning energy design, Phil and Daniel set out to create a highly scalable product and service that will impact the lives of millions.\n\nThis is how the Mighty-H was born. A solar-powered charging Hub, capable of charging ten phones per hour. Also, the Mighty-H comes pre-loaded with 1TB of content which allows consistent streaming and digital content access in areas with limited mobile network reception and no fiber optics or wired internet. \n\n\n\nThe Buffalito is the natural extension of this mission, and provides a portable way to add additional hours of power and light to the over one billion people living without access to grid power. \n \nOur services offer to our frontier users the following:\n Free Power - 5V outputs where users can charge phones and other devices.\n   Mobile network-enabled hardware that provides consistent streaming of digital content in areas with limited mobile network reception or no wired internet.\n   Hubs are pre-loaded with pre-selected content that updates regularly over mobile networks.\n   Hubs provide a feedback loop that allows for anonymized data analytics and market insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Becerra, Founder and CEO\nDaniel is the Founder and CEO of BuffaloGrid, a company bringing mobile power and internet connectivity to the next billion users across frontier markets.

The separation process is called depaneling. This month, quite late in the design for manufacturing process, the PCB factory requested that we change the shape of the board to make the depaneling easier. As soon as we received this request, we paused the start of the mechanical tooling so that we could assess whether the case design would be affected by the change. While the modification to the PCB shape was relatively minor, it reduced the mechanical support around the button that turns the device on and off. As such, a matching change to the mechanics was required so that the board remained well supported. These changes have now been made and communicated to the factories, but have unfortunately delayed both the mechanical and electronic parts by a couple of weeks."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Buffalito Production Update", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nWe reported in our last update that we were purchasing certain performance-critical components to protect the project against delays due to component shortages. Since then, we took the decision to go ahead and buy all of the components required for our first production run. This caused us a number of headaches, as components that appeared to have good stock levels one day became unavailable the next. However, we are pleased to announce that we now have sufficient material in stock to produce all of the Buffalitos required for orders and donations. There is of course a risk that during our engineering validation testing we discover the need to modify the bill of materials slightly, but at least now we will only have to worry about those changes and not sourcing components that are already in the design.With the stock in hand, PCBA production has begun and tooling will hopefully start within a week, once a final improvement to the USB port cover has been incorporated. Our expectation is that the first small batch of evaluation units will be available for testing at the start of July. These units will be tested by both our production partner and our design team to ensure that they function correctly, look great and are suitable for manufacture. Once any final tweaks are made off the back of these tests, we will produce a larger batch for use in safety certification. Thank you for your continued patience with the project, it has taken longer to get to this point than any of us hoped, but it feels like we've made an important milestone by getting production work underway with our partners.

A First-Class BA (Hons) Illustration for Graphic Novels graduate of Glynd\u0175r University, Lyndon occasionally teaches Sequential Arts at Salford University.\nWith postage costs in flux at the moment, we've been careful to keep the combined weight of each reward as low as possible.\nWe really appreciate everything our backers do for us and want to make sure that they feel supported.\nTo help achieve this, Blue Fox Comics offer a money back guarantee - if you are unhappy with your rewards, and return them, undamaged, within one month of receiving them we will return your pledge amount to you.\nPrinting books costs money, but that's not the only thing! The funds raised from this campaign will roughly be broken down as follows:\n50% printing costs\n25% reward production\n15% postage costs\n10% Kickstarter fees\nShould the campaign significantly overfund, then we will create extra stretch goals.\nWe are aiming to deliver the rewards in February 2021.

With this experience, and with the current pandemic, they've decided that now is as good a time as ever to step out, develop, and execute their own vision of what they see is valuable in the communities they're involved in. \nTil Death is a physical space located in Bushwick, New York where coffee and moto enthusiasts can come and sit, drink coffee, have a meeting, and meet with friends, as well as rent some time on a lift to work on your own motorcycle/scooter/bicycle/etc. All the seating in outdoor and COVID friendly. \nEmily and Megan have worked tirelessly over the last two months to flip an RV into a space they can make and serve coffee out of. Megan will be taking the lead on all things coffee, while Emily will be focusing on the workshop side of things. They have purchased a 20' shipping container and are building it out to be a space where anyone from any knowledge level can come and work on their own 2-wheeled vehicle with the goal to create a space to foster the moto community that already so-strongly exists in NYC.\n\nAs one of Til Death's first retail products, we'll be launching an Instant Coffee pack. The pack will contain 8 servings of instant coffee that will make a 10-12oz cup. Our goal is to start with a caffeinated and decaffeinated option. In the future we hope to be able to expand our offerings, as we have a ton of ideas for add-ons up our sleeves. \nThe goal for our first ever Kickstarter is to be able to fully fund our first run of Instant Coffee. After many calls and research, we've realized co-packers have very high minimums for the packaging we're shooting for, which is stick packs. (If you're not familiar, it's what the infamous single-serving Crystal Light pouches are.) We found one family-run co-packing business based out of Texas with a minimum of 5,000 individual servings. This would put us at 625 fully completed, 8-serving packs.  \nAlong with this expense, as well as the green coffee and roasting costs, we also have the expense of sending off our fresh-roasted coffee to a company that will brew it and then nitrogen freeze dry it, bulk package it, and send it to the co-packer. \nThis Kickstarter will put us in a position to complete the first run of our Instant Coffee and build up the clientele that will be return customers (because we know that it's just that good)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately, we've already gotten the ball rolling with all of the things needed to be put into motion for this project.

We believe good music is needed now more than ever. \nSo amidst it all: We decided to record an album.\nWe believe the songs we have to share are healing, and needed, but to get them out into the world, we need your help.\nWe\u2019re raising $15,465 to cover the recording and production costs of this album.\nWe have 30 days to fund this album, and it\u2019s all or nothing.\nWe\u2019re in this together \u2013 you can be a direct part of the next phase of our career.\n\nThis campaign is all-or-nothing, so if we don\u2019t reach our $15,465 goal by Sunday, November 8th, we won't be able to bring this album into the world.\n\nHere's the $15,465 goal broken down:\nDigital worldwide distribution through CDBaby = $69\n300 physical CDS = $1000\n120 bandanas = $500\n150 t-shirts = $1000\n100 Vinyls = $2000\nRecording/mixing/mastering costs = $8,900\nKickstarter fee of 5% = $998\nProcessing fee of 5% = $998\nTOTAL = $15,465\n\nThis goal does not include any budget for promotion, publicity, marketing, nor does it account for the nearly $4000 we will owe in taxes.

This has been one of the favorites of our listeners for a long time. Though we're not exactly sure why -- we think it has to do with the universal experience of grief that so many of us have gone through, but haven't quite verbalized or been able to talk about without taboo.\n\nI wrote this song in autumn a few years ago. I had just gone through a breakup and the fresh wound of what it\u2019s like to want someone, something, you can\u2019t ever have again was palpable. I could feel the presence of absence so acutely, it felt like I was a ghost walking around who wasn\u2019t seen but could still feel everything.\n\nI remember writing this song in a little chapel built on my family\u2019s old property. The chapel was built by hand by my father and my brothers. I felt my dad again when I spent time in there. Many, many songs were written in that little building.\n\nSo being there with this feeling of loss in the chapel my dad built \u2014 I also felt an understanding, of some sort, with my mother. After my father died, she became like a ghost, too.\n\nI knew she\u2019d do anything just to feel his warmth again.

With an uncertain COVID-19 season ahead I like to offer a safe and fun way to participate in a global art project. Even though traveling is restricted, postcards allow our handwriting to travel physically. This campaign coincides with World Postcard Day on October 1st \ud83d\udcee\ud83c\udf0d\nIn four Kickstarter campaigns (1, 2, 3, 4) with the help of 837 Backers from 45 countries, I created a series of 29 typographic postcards. Now I like to add postcard #30 & 31, and hopefully we can set a new record and bring together backers from 50 countries. 50 countries = 10 extra copies of HOW ARE YOU cards for each backer(of 5\u20ac and more).\nParticipating is easy:\n1. Choose a reward & pledge.\n2. Leave a comment with the country, state your reward will ship to. \n3. If you like, share how you are!\nCurrently backers from 24 countries are supporting the campaign: \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9 \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0 \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfb \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf4 \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (see \u2192 S T R E T C H G O A L S below for more details)\nHere you see the complete set:  \n\ud83c\udf0d Global and Local  S T R E T C H G O A L S \nAfter you backed, leave a comment and let us know to which country your reward will ship, and if you like to: share how you are. \nThe more people from different countries back the project = the more cards all backers will receive! 50 countries = 10 extra copies of HOW ARE YOU Postcard/Sticker for all backers (of 5\u20ac or more).\nCurrently (31. Oct. 2020) backers from 24 countries are backing the campaign. Here in alphabetical order: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Latvia, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Puerto Rico, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA.\n\nFollowing up to Victoria's comment from the Typographic Postcard #27 Kickstarter (almost 4 years ago):\n\u2026I thought it would be only fair and encouraging to add a stretchgoal for US-Backers. \nKickstarter is a unique platform that enabled me to share my work with people all over the world. Although I say all over the world, but in past campaigns I noticed that about 40% of the pledges are coming from the US. On the other hand other areas are underrepresented. Past campaigns were backed from 2 African countries: Namibia and South Africa. Regarding the two most populous countries China and India, only few backers came from China and none from India. That is why I came up with L O C A L \u2014 S T R E T C H G O A L S: \n Join the project and pick a reward: \n\ud83d\udcee\ud83d\udcafComplete Set\nYou will receive the complete set of 31 Typographic Postcards, all Stretchgoal-extras, and one WISH YOU WERE HERE Poster (backside tells the story how the series came to life and pictures of all postcards.)\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO GET MORE THAN ONE SET OF CARDS? After the campaign ends you can add individual cards, additional sets etc.\n\ud83d\uddbc Typographic Object, HOW ARE YOU.\nYou will receive one HOW ARE YOU object, framed (17,5cm x 17,5cm) ready to hang. And all perks of the \"Complete Set\" reward. Each object is unique, set in actual used keyboard keys. Select one of the below:\nTypographic Object #0\nTypographic Object #1\nTypographic Object #2 (OREO Edition)\nTypographic Object #3 (A1243)\nThe keys of \u2191 Typographic Object #3 are entirely taken from used Apple A1243keyboards, which were introduced in 2007. On its back, one reads: Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China Model No. A1243.\nSome trivia: On the first day of January in 2002 the Euro currency was introduced. Around 1999 keyboard manufacturers started to print a \u20ac sign next to the E key. This makes it easy to spot the age of a European keyboard.\nTypographic Object #4 (black keys II)\nTypographic Object #5 (IBM Model M 1985)\nThe keys for Object #5 were taken from the legendary IBM Model M Series manufactured in the United Kingdom from 1984 and is still being manufacturing in Kentucky, USA. In PCWorld (Jul 8, 2008) Benj Edwards writes about the Model M: \u201cStung by the criticism, IBM assembled a ten-person task force to craft a new keyboard, according to David Bradley, a member of that task force and of the 5150\u2019s design team. Their resulting 101-key design, 1984\u2019s Model M, became the undisputed bellwether for the computer industry, with a layout that dominates desktops to this day. As we peek under the hood of this legend, you\u2019ll soon see why many consider the Model M to be the greatest keyboard of all time.\u201d\nTypographic Object #6\nTypographic Object #7\nTypographic Object #8 (Tetris)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nQuick Facts about Typographic Postcards:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n Size: 12cm x 17.5cm\n Material: 265gr cardboard or heavier.\nPrinted in Germany\n Printing: four color offset with different finishes (glossy UV sealing, matt laminate, glossy sticker)\nSome postcards have rounded corners.\n\"AUTOBAHN\" \"OFFLINE\" and \"I WAS HERE\" are stickers / postcards! The other cards are regular postcards.\nThe back of the cards are easy to write on with pen, biro, pencil, inkjet etc. The front works well with marker and typewriter:\nThe backside of a postcard is very important. Regular postcards have \"address - lines\", but I am not a fan of \"address - lines\". For me they are always too short, or missing a line. When it comes to world wide addresses one size does not fit all. I think everybody should be free to use the card horizontally, vertically or diagonally or upside down - right to left etc. So I leave as much space as possible for you to be creative.\nBut I put some tiny information on the back about the postcard. \nIMAGE\nHow will the funding be used?\nMost of the funding goes to the artist (\u224830%), then printing, packaging and shipping the cards, a bit to taxes (16% VAT + income taxes), a little bit to processing credit card payments (3%) and a tiny bit to Kickstarter for creating this awesome platform (5%).\nTimeframe\nAll the artwork work is done. I have already printed a test batch of Postcards:\nNow I just need to know how many postcards I should order for the final printrun, and how much shipping material. After the Kickstarter Campaign is over it takes about 14 days for the funding to arrive in my account. Then I will place the final order with the printer. Until it will arrives (about 7 days) I will prepare the shipping (printing shipping labels and order enough packaging material). It will take another 5 days to package everything and have it picked up by the postman. So 26 days after the campaign ends the rewards should be in transit to you!\n14 days processing payment / collecting addresses from backers\n7 days printing cards / preparing shipping (printing address labels)\n+/- 5 days packaging rewards\n\ud83d\udce6 Shipping \nAll Rewards ship with priority mail from Frankfurt am Main, Germany to any location in the world (including islands and outposts). Your reward will be carefully packaged in a protective and reusable envelop. From the last Typographic Postcard Campaigns I found these average shipping times:\nGermany: 1-2 days\nEurope: 2-7 days\nU.S.A. / Canada: 7-21 days\nAsia / Pacific / South America /Russia /Africa /Rest world: 7-28 days\nPlease keep in mind depending on lockdowns in different countries these times can be significantly longer (couple of weeks). \n\ud83d\udccdTracking: Framed object rewards include online tracking and insurance. Postcard rewards are send out with priority mail without tracking. Costs of tracking depend on the country you are're in and because of COVID-19 change from week to week. After the campaign ends, depending on the situation, you will have the opportunity to add online tracking to your reward.\nYou can read more about this the project's history on my website: haraldgeisler.com/postcards\n\u2192Kickstarter References \nIf you like to see my other typography Kickstarter projects check out this list:\nFonts:\n Sigmund Freud Typeface \u2022 a letter to your shrink 2013   \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/201030759/sigmund-freud-typeface-a-letter-to-your-shrink \n Albert Einstein Font 2015   \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1822548650/albert-einstein-font \n Martin Luther Font 2017   \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/martin-luther-handwriting-font-here-i-write \n\ud83d\ude2d Martin Luther King Font 2019 (\u2026did not reach funding goal)  \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/martin-luther-king-font \n 2020 Font Collection 2020   \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/2020-font-collection \nWriting Reenactment:\n Kickstarter Gold: Pen Pals\u2014Einstein & Freud 2017 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/kickstarter-gold-pen-palseinstein-and-freud-handwr \nTypographic Postcards:\n Typographic Postcards #14-26 2015 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/typographic-postcards \n Typographic Postcard #27 \"I WAS HERE\" 2016 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/typographic-postcards-and-sticker-27-i-was-here \n Typographic Postcard #28 \"WISH YOU WERE HERE\" 2018 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/typographic-postcard-28-wish-you-were-here  \n Typographic Postcard #29 \"OFFLINE\" 2019 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/offline \nTypographic Wall Calendar Series:\n Typographic Wall Calendar 2011 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2011-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2012 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2012-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2013 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2013-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2014 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/107717342/2014-typographic-wall-calendar \n Typographic Wall Calendar 2016 \u2014https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/2016-typographic-wall-calendar \nCancel / Save / OK:\n Cancel / Save Notepad 2017 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/cancel-save-notepad  \n Cancel / OK Sticky Notes 2018 \u2014 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2108133360/cancel-ok-sticky-notes \n\nThanks for reading, ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery artistic project bears risks.

In addition to working on its game design, story, and audio, I was the composer and performer of its original soundtrack, which we released digitally as well as on vinyl record featuring beautiful cover art by the talented Olly Moss.\nThat vinyl soundtrack release has long since sold out, and in the intervening years, many people have contacted me asking how they can get one. They occasionally pop up on eBay, but are prohibitively expensive.\nBecause I can't take advantage of big economies of scale, it's costly for me to speculatively fund a small-run reprint up front. So I'm launching a small Kickstarter campaign both to see if there's sufficient interest to justify a new print run, and to allow me to fund the manufacturing if it turns out there is. The campaign funding goal is based on the cost of a minimum-quantity run from the original manufacturer, plus the cost of materials and other logistics. I think (I hope) this is the amount of money necessary to break even. Of course it would be great if demand were higher!\nYou'll be able to choose between a straight reprint of the original, or a signed collector's edition pressed onto yellow vinyl. The sleeve will be the same for both editions. If you order two or three at a time, your unit cost will be lower, and you'll save a lot on shipping. If you'd like to order more than three copies, you can add any number of standard editions to your pledge as \"Add-Ons.\" If you'd like more than three collector's editions, send me a message. (Edit: I can't edit the reward text anymore, but I should clarify that I mistakenly used the phrase \"gatefold\" in some reward items when I should have said \"sleeve.\" This is the same style as the original release, with a pocket-style sleeve rather than a gatefold.)\nEach record will also come with a code to get a digital copy of the soundtrack through my Bandcamp store. You'll be able to download the music in a number of popular formats, including MP3 as well as lossless FLAC and WAV.\nI also intend to delve through the Firewatch archives and put together an additional digital collection of early musical tests and experiments that I created early in the development in the game. Some of that material is very much of a piece with what ended up on the soundtrack, and some of it is very different, while still containing seeds of the final material. I'll write up liner notes with some memories of that process. Every Kickstarter pledge will get a digital delivery of that collection, which I'm calling \"Fireworks.\"\nThe record will be manufactured by Pirates Press in Oakland, California. I've worked with them on multiple vinyl releases, including the well-received original Firewatch run, so I'm confident they will do a great job. They are currently up and running despite the COVID pandemic, so there shouldn't be any undue delays.\nA final note: I may be able to continue selling these record past this Kickstarter, but I most likely won't be able to. I don't have a permanent physical goods store and fulfillment solution through which to take and ship orders, so if you think you'd like one of these records, I would recommend getting it now.\nI loved putting this soundtrack together, and it's meant a lot to me that so many people have enjoyed listening to it. Thank you to everyone who bought one of the first run\u2014and if you weren't able to, here's your chance!\n\nNote: Shipping costs are higher than I would like. I'm sorry, I know it's frustrating. I helped run two small online storefronts for many years (including the Campo Santo store that sold the Firewatch soundtrack) and when you aren't Amazon or can't operate at a global scale with warehouses distributed worldwide, there just isn't much that can be done to lower shipping costs. The current shipping prices are likely already underestimates for most countries. If it helps, you can buddy up with friends to buy two or three copies and save on the cost of the record itself, with even more significant savings on shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk I can imagine is simply that there isn't enough demand to justify a print run\u2014which is exactly why I'm doing this through Kickstarter. I want to ensure the interest is there.\n\nThe opposite potential risk is that there is far more interest than I might anticipate, which could make fulfillment more difficult. This would be a problem I would be happy to have. If demand ends up being small but sufficient to justify a run, I will fulfill orders out of my apartment. If demand is too high for this to be feasible, I have a fulfillment partner based in San Francisco who would be able to accept delivery from the manufacturer and ease that burden.

Since then, we've launched another iMicro C in 2019, with a longer working distance and a broader field of view. We delivered over 12000 Fingertip Microscopes units with these two successful, accomplished campaigns to microscope fans in over 70 countries. It is a breakthrough in portable microscopy - we're quite proud, and thank you all for your support. \nWe never stop - now we've taken our effort one step further and are pleased to bring you the new, improved version of fingertip microscope - iMicro Q2.\nWhat is Fingertip Microscope (iMicro Q2)?\nSince Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in the 17th century, there has been tremendous progress in microscope technology. Microscopes with excellent performance are usually bulky, heavy, and expensive, even for portable ones. With our years of effort, what we introduced in 2018 - the fingertip microscope iMicro Q - is a real breakthrough in mobile microscopy. It has comparable optical performance to a professional desktop microscope and enables you to carry it with you as easily as you bring your phone. In addition to the iMicro Q's excellent optical performance and portability, iMicro Q2 has a new design to enable it to work with any smartphone.\nHighlights\nVery high magnification power: up to 800x\nVery low distortion: comparable to a desktop microscope\nVery high resolution power: down to 1 micron\nExtremely easy to use: \"Stick and Play\" with your phone\nExtremely low profile and weight: \u00bd inch and ~1/60 oz\nExtremely easy to carry: fit in wallet like a card\nExtremely low cost: ~1% of the price of a desktop microscope\nCompatible with any smartphone  \nHere are some micrographs took with iMicro Q2 (using an iPhone 11):\nKey features of iMicro Q2\nExtremely high magnification: up to 800x\nIt has the same high magnification as iMicro Q. When used with a smartphone, it can observe, for example, at full view the mouth part of the housefly at a magnification of ~100x, and then zoom in detail up to 800x magnification. It is able clearly to see the spiral structure of the tip of the mouthpart at high magnification. If you don't have a microscope, you never know a housefly has such a fine structure at its mouth part. It is amazing!\nVery high resolution\nThe clear observation of the spiral structure of the mouth part of the housefly is already proof of its high resolution. We did some further tests: the USAF 1951 resolution test chart was used to test the resolution of iMicro Q2 on an iPhone 11. The intervals between the finest test bars are 2.19 micrometers. The finest test bars on the 7th group are clearly seen, indicating its resolution is far beyond that.\nVery low distortion\nA grid calibration target was used to test the distortion. Even in full view at the edge of the visual field, no noticeable distortion was observed.\nBased on this optical performance test, iMicro Q2 has excellent optical performance, definitely comparable to a desktop compound microscope.\nA stem of xylophytadicotylendon T.S. was observed under iMicro Q2 as well as a desktop microscope Motic DMB-1223 (price ~2200USD for microscope + 500USD for camera attachment). No noticeable difference was observed, as shown in a side-by-side comparison.\nExtremely low profile\nIt is about the size of a fingertip and weighs only 0.5g (~1/60 oz). It is very thin, only 3.2mm (1/8 inch). No parts extrude beyond the edge of your phone when it is installed. Also, We considered the portability of the package from the beginning of the design. It is packed in a card size thin PP case which is easy to fit into your wallet!\nExtremely easy to use\nThe Fingertip microscope is different from a comprehensive desktop microscope - it does not introduce a bulky and expensive focus tuning system. In contrast, the iMicro Q2 has no knobs and buttons at all. Compared with the original iMicro Q, the new iMicro Q2 is more comfortable to align and attach to your phone's camera. Just connect and point closely towards what you want to see, and it works!\nAffordable to every budget\nWe are very proud of the Fingertip Microscope and would like everyone to be able to afford it. Even though it has such an excellent performance, we tagged with an attractive price: ~1 percent of a traditional desktop microscope cost. With the money you would need to buy a traditional desktop microscope, you will be able to purchase many Fingertip Microscopes, making this great for children and students.\nWorks with any smartphone\nWhen we launched iMicro Q, we were often asked: does this work with my phone? There is no more confusion with iMicro Q2: We design it to work with any phone with a camera. iMicro Q2 will be coupled to your smartphone by an innovative, re-useable, nano-suction pad. Whether your phone has a single back camera or multiple back cameras, a flat camera(s), or extruded camera(s), the iMicro Q2 will work with them all. Please see the picture for your reference to see how it looks with different camera configurations.\nPrinciple and development process\nHow it works\nThe magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system for traditional compound microscopes, including objective and eyepiece. Its total magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.\nFor our fingertip microscope, three stages of magnification are combined to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three.\n\nTherefore, iMicro Q2 uses a different process and technology compared to a traditional microscope. Thanks to the advance of micro-optics and smartphone technology, and with the effort and expertise accumulated in the past years, we have enabled iMicro Q2 to achieve excellent performance at a low cost.\nDevelopment path and process\nWe walked a long way to develop these smartphone-based microscopic tools since registering the first patent in 2012. We have already successfully built a series of smartphone microscope products, including iMICROSCOPE, iMICROSCOPE R, and the \u03bcRuler, iMicro Q, iMicro C as well as this new version iMicro Q2.\nWe have shaped and polished our Fingertip Microscope idea according to previous backers' and customers' suggestions and comments based on our previous successful projects. We have optimized the optics and the overall design, and each step was tested and refined using prototypes to achieve the best performance possible.\nThe essential techniques to achieve its high performance\nDedicated optics: multi-element aspherical micro-lens\nThe lens is a crucial component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a straightforward approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects, spherical and other aberrations. The iMicro Q2 uses a more complex multi-aspherical lens with a dedicated design to achieve both the high performance of magnification and low aberration.\n Innovative illumination: Reflection/transmission light design \nLight and illumination are essential to microscopy. Nowadays, every smartphone comes with a camera as well as a flashlight. The original iMicro Q used a light guide technique to introduce the light to the point of the lens field of view. iMicro Q is a great design but incurs a compatibility problem with some of the phones with a long distance between the camera lens and flash.\nIn iMicro Q2, we incorporated a new innovative design: Reflective/Transmission illumination. In this design, the thin PP case is not only used to pack and protect the product but also used as a light-reflective illumination box. The light from the flashlight and ambient light go into the transparent light guide to illuminate the sample. Simultaneously, the light is also reflected from the thin PP case's bottom wall to illuminate the sample. Because of this design, the Reflection/Transmission illumination achieves its high performance with flexibility to work with all the different phone camera lens - flash configurations and therefore being compatible with any smartphone. Even for the phones/pads which do not have a flashlight, it works well with just good ambient light illumination or using close to an ambient light source.\n\n\n Seamless coupling with the smartphone: Nano-suction pad attachment \nCompared to conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's foot-pads: it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro-suction cups to hold the device to the phone. \nEvery on and off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed \"nano suction pad\" is residue-free, non-tacky, and repeatable. The use of a nano-suction pad has been proved in our previous product, and it is repeatable and easily cleaned by a PSA tape (such as Scotch tape).\nPLAY\n\nPrecise focus control: automatic + manual focus\nEvery smartphone now has an auto-focus function. When iMicro Q2 is coupled with your smartphone, this automatic focus function also works. We have precisely designed and machined iMicro Q2 to control the focus point accurately. As long as you point it closely towards a sample plane, the sample falls into the autofocus range, and it will automatically focus for a clear image.\n\u03bcRuler and Dedicated App: for professional needs\nA high-quality \u03bcRuler (stage micrometer) will be provided (as an option) with iMicro Q2 to calibrate the scale-bar in our App, i-Seeing, and enable you to measure size accurately. Please see our previous campaign, \u03bcRuler- A micro-ruler to measure micro-objects, for more information.\niMicro Q2 actually works with any camera App which can control the flashlight when shooting. In some cases, it is crucial to have a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on the micrograph. The dedicated App, i-Seeing, was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. The scale-bar on the micrograph can be toggled on/off to enable you to embed a scale-bar on the image if required.\nHow to use it?\nThe iMicro Q2 is very easy to align and attach to the phone's camera. Just connect and point closely towards what you want to see, and it works!\nPLAY\n\n Critical improvements compared with iMicro Q\n Better optical performance - Although the lens optical technology is the same as with iMicro Q, we optimized the design of Q2 regarding structure and production stability. These improvements ensure the best performance and excellence in lens optics.\n Smaller and lighter - it is smaller and lighter and, more importantly, it has a round shape with optimized size, which enables it to stay firmly and stably attached to the camera lens.\n Easier to use - Thanks to its thin and round shape, it is easier to align with and attach to the camera lens.\n Works with any camera phone - The essential improvement is that it should work with any camera phone with dramatic evolution in compatibility with this new design.\nComparison between iMicro Q2 and iMicro C\nThe picture shows the comparison of the same scale target being observed with iMicro C and iMicro Q2 (when no digital zoom is applied), so you can compare their visual field. You will see they are complementary: iMicro C has a lower magnification and a larger visual field, while iMicro Q2 has a higher magnification and a high resolution. The detailed comparison between iMicro Q2 and iMicro C is shown in the table. They are both suitable for different yet complementary purposes. \nAlso, both are easily packed in the same thin PP case, so you can quickly have both available to use at any time. We have set an option in the rewards for both of them.\nWhat people say about Fingertip Microscope\nApplication examples\nIt is super portable, and you don't need complicated settings, so you can immediately take images, use it for reporting, and transfer images to your colleagues. Plus, you can use it with any smartphone. It can be used in many professions where you need accurate changes and immediate research in the field. For example, it can monitor a knife's sharpening process, check the masks' quality, and measure small machinery parts' quality. It can also check the mounting of samples on a TEM grid, check the quality and texture of cloth, identify the counterfeit, evaluate the printing quality, and check the flaws in jewelry and many other applications. It is not just a tool and can also be used for a lot of fun: parents might use it during play to explore the wonderful micro-world with their child.\nMany of our previous backers shared their beautiful and amazing pictures when they used the fingertip microscopes. Here are a few examples of previous backers' photos with the iMicro Q and iMicro C on their phones. \nHighlights\nRewards\nTimeline\n\nWe really want to express our thanks to you all for your support.

With Roger's recent prognosis of MND, this will be the last Annual with Roger looking after it, and indeed it is likely that this may be the last time the Annual is in A4 format going forwards.\nSo with that in mind, Roger has agreed once more to take the helm as the editor and Oli will take charge of the graphical style of the issue as well as creating a brand new cover in the style of the early issues of ZZap.\nThe annual will be hardback only and come in at 120 pages - it will be in full colour throughout.\nWe have once again decided to keep the new cover by Oliver Frey a surprise so that when the book arrives on your doorstep it will be the first time a reader of the annual will have rest their eyes on it. Oli will be dusting off his airbrush once more to create the cover, in the same way, he created them back in the day and adding graphical touches throughout the annual just like he did for last year's annual and the ZZap issues of yesteryear.\nThe new annual will be full of reviews written by the same team of individuals from last year's annual - a mix of well-known names from ZZap back in the day (Robin Hogg, Julian Rignall etc) and many known C64 journalists from the busy Commodore 64 retro scene (Mat Allen, Paul Morrison, Andrew Fisher etc).\nWe also have a guest appearance from Perifractic (Christian Simpson) who has written a feature on how THEC64\u00ae 'Maxi' runs games against the original hardware - he appeared in Star Wars movies don't you know! Chris is a huge C64 and ZZap fan - check out his Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Perifractic\nSimon Butler returns with the art gallery - showcasing some stunning art on the Commodore 64.\nFamiliar sections of ZZap! 64 will return including Hi-Scores, ZZAP! RRAP and the Art Gallery! Those again pledging will be encouraged to send in a letter for the ZZap Rrap section of the annual and those hi-scores!\n\nJaz Rignall is back in the new annual reviewing some games and we have also got memoirs from Steve Shields, the very last Editor of ZZap, and Ian Osbourne.\n\nAndrew Braybrook 'adds' another entry to his diary in the Annual and we also have an in-depth interview with Tony Crowther - conducted by Mark Helewell, founder of the Commodore Amiga demo group Anarchy.\nStuart Williams, our resident Adventure expert in the last two annuals, passed away last year and his input into this Annual is sorely missed. Colin Bell will now be taking up the Adventure Trail section for the 2021 Annual.\nHope you are still enjoying playing retro games Stuart - our thoughts are with you matey.\nMARK KNIGHT\nMark Knight was known as TDK on the Amiga scene (The Dark Knight) composing lots and lots of great tunes for the computer, and he continues to create great chiptune music, releasing a number of albums over the last number of years with his new one out this week - this Perk is for that album, and his last 2.\nSo the perk will be 3 x CDs - each in a cardboard sleeve, pledge on the MARK KNIGHT perk, or add \u00a320 to your pledge.\nPLAY\n\n\nEarly Bird - 40 backers - Hessian CD album from Amicom.

Just like the names of our books, we will save you that presentation :)\n\nLet us say, at least, that the wonderful inventive mind of Tesla could be captured in his patents. Tesla was prolific in patents and even today, the exact total number of Nikola Tesla patents around the world is in doubt. But it\u2019s a fact that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has registered 112 patents of Nikola Tesla.\n\nLike many, we have always been fascinated by old technical illustration and, specifically, \"cut-away\" illustrations.\n\nWe introduce you to our 500-page book of Tesla\u2019s patents registered in the USA, arranged chronologically with their illustrations and patent description.\nTake a look!\n\n\nOur plan is to print a small print run. We encourage you to guarantee your copy if you like it.\n\nWe will send it to print in mid-December and it should be printed in March, as scheduled with our printer. We are going to mark the estimated delivery date in April. But if we can send it before, we will do, for sure.\n\nTechnically speaking, we will make a book of 20 x 27 cm in format. We have chosen a premium paper designed for offset printing, Munken Polar, where the crisp white tone and its smooth uncoated surface provides an exclusive and natural feel. \n\nKronecker Wallis is a small publishing company. So we do not know how to, nor do we want to, create a monotonous and characterless product.\n \nWhy not add patents published in other countries?\nWe thought about it initially, but due to the quality of the original materials from some countries and the repetition of patents already published in the USA, we had to make a choice. Sometimes you have to make painful decisions to avoid making a book that is too long, that does not have good quality in its illustrations and is repetitive.\n\n- Campaign rewards -\nKeeping it simple, we reduced complexity by offering only 3 pledge options.\nThe book\nThe book + 1 poster (choosing from 4 options)\nThe book + 4 posters\n\nThe posters (A2 size)\nTesla Coil\nAC Generator\nElectric light\nElectromagnetic motor\n- Campaign add-ons (NEW!) - \nAdd-ons are optional rewards that backers can include in their pledge.\nIt's not a new reward but a product to add to your pledge optionally.\nWe have created a small book for \"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency\".

It\u2019s the definitive documentary series that reveals the 100-year history of arcades and arcade games.\nIt's an exhilarating tale, told by a colorful array of historians, curators, collectors, industry legends, celebrity fans, and arcade fanatics. It\u2019s the first documentary to tell the complete story: from the penny arcades of the early 1900s, through pinball\u2019s glory days and the video generation, to the virtual reality worlds of today and beyond.\nHow did arcades begin? How did new technologies influence gameplay? And why have these games sparked our imaginations, fueled our obsessions, and haunted our dreams? \nArcade Dreams will launch with three episodes detailing the 100-year journey of arcades and arcade games. Backers also receive two exclusive mini-documentaries that take deep dives into specific arcade companies, games, and genres.\nIn addition to all that killer content, we\u2019re creating unique collectible goodies for our fans. Exclusive rewards for our Kickstarter backers include:\nARCADE TOKEN CHALLENGE COINS\nYou'll get a collectible Arcade Dreams challenge coin, based on classic arcade token designs, with sturdy display stand. Only available to our Kickstarter backers.\nCOLLECTOR\u2019S EDITION BLU-RAY BOX SET\nExclusive to our Kickstarter backers. We won\u2019t be releasing this multi-disc box set anywhere else.\nThis top quality, factory pressed multi-disc Blu-Ray box set includes the entire series, plus our Kickstarter backer-exclusive mini-documentaries, and hours of rare footage and unreleased interview content from gaming's biggest legends.\nThe set itself is a work of art, laid out with gorgeous illustrations created especially for Arcade Dreams and a full color, informative companion book with rare images from arcade history. We're going to be digging deep in the archives for this one.\nSHIPPING & FULFILLMENT\nWe\u2019re working with BackerKit after the campaign to make sure that each of our backers gets the best experience possible. One of the coolest things about BackerKit is that it allows backers to add rewards after the campaign ends, so you can outfit the whole family in Arcade Dreams t-shirts!\nIn order to keep shipping rates low for our backers, shipping is based on our actual bulk shipping rates and will be collected once we're ready to start shipping out rewards. \nWe\u2019ll also save our international backers customs headaches and extra fees by using distribution centers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia.\nThis is the one you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nThe footage we\u2019ve shot is like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen. We put you inside the games and the arcades of every era. Some of these games are so rare that only a handful exist in the world. You\u2019ll be transported through time as we show you the games, the arcade environment, and the stories of people who were there. Stories that have never been told before.\nWe need your support to take our incredible footage and turn it into a polished documentary series. You, the community, are the only people who can make this happen. As a backer, you\u2019ll be directly responsible for bringing this series to life. \nOur plan is to release three episodes that tell the story of 100 years of arcades. However, as we approach our funding goal, we\u2019ll also be unlocking two exclusive backer-only mini-documentaries where we dive deep into a particular manufacturer, game, or genre.\nWe're really excited to bring these mini-docs to life for our fans. Backers will vote on which mini-docs they\u2019d like to see, making Arcade Dreams an interactive adventure! How deep can we go? That\u2019s up to you!\nWe believe in this series with all our hearts. We\u2019ve been working hard in the background and now we\u2019re ready to show it to the world. We\u2019ve already filmed dozens of hours of interviews and gorgeous \u201cb-roll\u201d footage. It\u2019s been one heck of a ride so far.\nThe passion we feel for this project is off the charts. It\u2019s more than a documentary for us. It\u2019s that feeling of excitement when we first stepped into an arcade. It\u2019s that moment that the lights and sounds carried us into another reality. It\u2019s our childhood joy coming back to us and begging us to tell this amazing story. \nFrom Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Seattle to New York City, and Atlanta to Philadelphia, we\u2019ve criss-crossed the continent to dig up the untold tales of Arcade Dreams.\nAside from filming some of the rarest machines in the world, we\u2019ve interviewed collectors, historians, industry legends, major players and small arcade operators. \nAnd we're just getting started!\nArcade Dreams is Zach Weddington\u2019s dream project. He was an 80\u2019s kid, and he grew up in the arcades. They were his obsession. Every chance he got, he would sneak out of his bedroom window to ride his bike to the arcade at Sparkles roller-rink in Marietta, Georgia.\nArcades were intoxicating. Dark, mysterious rooms were filled with captivating graphics and enticing sounds, and there was always the promise of a new challenge or a new challenger.\nZach has never let go of his obsession, and still seeks out new arcades to visit. He searched in vain for a comprehensive history of arcades, but found only tantalizing bits of information. He realized that if he wanted to know the complete story, he would have to tell it himself.\nFortunately for us, Zach was already an experienced filmmaker. While shooting Viva Amiga: The Story of a Beautiful Machine, he met Bill Winters, an Emmy Award-winning Director of Photography. Bill\u2019s wizardry helped lift Viva Amiga to new heights, and the film was a hit all over the world.\nBut Bill was also a video game expert, and when Zach told him about his next project, he was intrigued. The two film pros were also video game bros, and when they teamed up to form an epic duo, they knew they could make Arcade Dreams a reality.\nWhat Zach and Bill found was a treasure-trove of history that stretched back 100 years. Arcades first appeared in the early 1900s, as collections of mechanical amusements that simulated real-world activities. Over the years, electrical augmentations helped bring these machines to life. In the late 1970s, microchip technology made a whole new type of game possible. The first video games were directly inspired by their electro-mechanical ancestors.\nThe story of arcades didn\u2019t end in the 1990s. While gamers mostly migrated to 16 and 32-bit consoles, the arcade continued to offer experiences you couldn\u2019t get at home. From Time Crisis to Dance Dance Revolution, arcade games evolved and changed. Arcades themselves found new niches in which they could thrive.\nBringing this entire 100 year history together in a cohesive documentary series was challenging. Zach and Bill were joined by a group of award-winning writers, editors, production designers, researchers, and 3D animators.\nTogether they\u2019ve collected hours of video footage, including interviews with both legendary figures in the industry and passionate fans and collectors.\nWhenever Zach and Bill show bits of this footage to people, the reactions are always the same. The first reaction is: \u201cThis is amazing!\u201d The second is: \u201cCan I see more of this?\u201d\nWell, you can.\nBy backing this Kickstarter, you can join the epic quest to make Arcade Dreams a reality.\nThis campaign unlocks three episodes detailing the 100-year journey of arcades and arcade games. Backers will also receive two exclusive mini-documentaries that take deep dives into specific arcade companies, games, and genres. \nWe\u2019ve assembled an incredibly talented group of folks to help bring Arcade Dreams to life. We\u2019ve got professional filmmakers who have won multiple Emmy awards. We have 3D animation experts, famous sound designers, brilliant graphic designers, award-winning writers, and encyclopedic arcade historians. But more important than all the trophies and accolades, we have a group of people who are absolute fanatics about arcades and video games.\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve done a lot of filming, research and writing. Now, our team is ready to begin editing our episodes, creating animations, and doing additional research. It's time to go \u201ddigging in the crates\u201d to digitize rarely-seen original artwork and design documents to share with the world.\nWe\u2019ll also be doing more shooting. When we get back on the road, we plan to go worldwide and shoot the most interesting locations and characters in the UK, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Arcade history is as rich internationally as it is in the United States and we want to tell those stories. \nThis is the perfect time to get involved with Arcade Dreams:\n Get it First - As a backer, you\u2019ll receive stories and short content segments throughout the production of the series, as well as several mini-documentaries made exclusively for backers.\n Shape the Story - We\u2019ll give backers the opportunity to submit interview questions to some of the biggest names in the business. You\u2019ll also get to vote on topics for our backer-exclusive content.\n Join the Community - Become part of a fun community of like-minded arcade fans, and come on the road with us with live-streaming sessions.\n Make the Documentary a Success - By backing us, you\u2019ll help create an epic achievement that does justice to the games you love. You\u2019ll also pave the way for its growth into an ongoing franchise.\nYour generosity and support mean everything to us.

Incorporating the world\u2019s first hot-swappable low profile Optical switches to customize your typing experience with ease. With breakthroughs on several technical challenges, we redesigned the low profile Gateron Mechanical and Keychron Optical switches to upgrade your typing experience and potentially pave the way for future low profile mechanical keyboard market.\nEngineered with the 75% layout, Bluetooth, and wired dual mode with great compatibility for both Mac and Windows, pairs with up to 3 devices, the K3 is your ultimate companion to enhance productivity.\n\nThanks to our innovative design team, the redesigned low profile switch is 40% slimmer than conventional switches. The slim switches with the streamlined aluminum body together makes the K3 one of the thinnest and lightweight wireless Mechanical keyboards in the world.\n\n\nFeaturing the latest Broadcom Bluetooth 5.1 chipset, the K3 offers flawless connectivity and an organized workspace whether you\u2019re working at home or the office. Also, enjoy a reliable wired connection with the provided USB Type-C cable. \n\nDesigned for multitasking, the K3 is compatible with both macOS and Windows. With its unique Mac layout, the Keychron K3 is one of the few in the market that allows Mac users to enjoy the same multimedia and function keys as the Apple keyboard.\nIncludes keycaps for both macOS and Windows (3 keycaps for each) that allow you to switch between operating systems with ease. For Linux users, we also have a dedicated user group to help with your experience. \n\n\n\nYou can connect up to 3 devices wirelessly on the K3 even with different operating systems. Press Fn + 1 / 2 / 3 to switch among your laptop, PC, and tablet swiftly.\n\nWe all have our unique typing preferences, that\u2019s why we went the extra mile to make the K3 the world's first hot-swappable low profile Optical switch keyboard. In order to ensure stable performances in such a thin hot-swappable keyboard, we\u2019ve implemented A MX-styled stem and stabilizers, and conducted numerous design iterations of the keyboard structure.\n\nFollowing our simple instructions, you can easily hot-swap every Optical switch in a few seconds to customize the typing experience of your K3 without soldering.\n\n*Hot-swappable feature is available for Keychron low profile Optical switch version only.\n\nCrafted for productivity, the K3\u2019s 75% layout is a compact version of tenkeyless layout. It allows users access to all the essential multimedia and function keys, but with a smaller footprint compared to the normal tenkeyless layout on the market. \n\n\nWe\u2019ve overcome different technical challenges to redesign both the Gateron low profile Mechanical switch and Keychron low profile Optical switch on the K3 in order to elevate the typing experience while enhancing its reliability on the ultra-slim mechanical keyboard. We've got you covered whether you prefer linear (red, black, white), clicky (blue, orange) or something in between (brown).\n\n\nWith over a year of dedication, we\u2019ve worked with Gateron to redesign their Gateron low profile Mechanical switch with a MX-styled stem and new stabilizers to enhance its reliability.  Gateron's reputable switches are your best choice for precise, smooth, and reliable fingertip feel.\n\n\nWith the similar MX-styled stem housing, stabilizers, and signatured 0.2ms ultra-low latency, the light actuated Keychron low profile Optical switches are crafted for typists or gamers who want to type at lightning speed. They can also withstand a 70 million keystroke lifespan, which is much greater than industry standards.\n*The Keychron low profile Optical switch version keyboard is hot-swappable and compatible with Keychron Low Profile Optical switches only.\n\n\nIt's been hard to find alternative keycaps for low profile mechanical keyboards due to the stem style and its comparatively new design to the market. We\u2019ve spent over a year developing and implementing a MX-styled stem on both the low profile switches for the K3 as well as stabilizers on the big keys like the space bar, left Shift, backspace and Enter key.  \n\nSuch a groundbreaking design will improve keyboard reliability, deliver better typing experiences, and may potentially pave the way for other keycap manufacturers to launch alternative keycaps. (See the photo above to compare the keycap stems between K3 with Roccat Vulcan 120 Aimo keyboard.) This design breakthrough on the K3 will also lead to an upgrade to future Keychron low profile keyboards.\nPLAY\n\nComes with floating keycap designs with over 15 types of RGB backlight settings as well as a static white backlight option. You can also adjust the keyboard brightness to sync with your mood. Various backlight patterns are available on the K3 White Backlight version. Here is a video to show some of the RGB backlight settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the customs policy of different countries, we CANNOT guarantee the tax price.

As Marty puts it, a full-life reset. It\u2019s about humankind\u2019s battle against loneliness and emptiness, and the endless search for meaning and the elusiveness of a better life.\nOur goal is to fund all four digital issues (100-ish pages!), with a special printing of issue #1 so you can read the whole saga on your tablet while wearing your leather jacket and sitting sideways in a booth at McDonald\u2019s on a Friday night.\nMarty is stuck at his dead-end job at Burger Lord and the last 15 years have passed him by.

Will cashier Sonja just make out with her boyfriend Rat Blood in the parking lot and miss all the excitement?\n\u201cTRVE KVLT is fantastic.

This is a Coen Brothers movie with an Oliver Stone twist!\u201d \u2014Vita Ayala (The Wilds, Submerged, Morbius: The Living Vampire)\n\"TRVE KVLT has everything you want in a comic: razor-sharp dialogue, masterfully choreographed art, and a story that kicks you in the face from page one.

Shortly after the initial launch, McFarlane invited 4 of the most respected writers in comics\u2014Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller, and Dave Sim\u2014to collaborate with him on a string of single issues. At the time, Dave Sim was riding his own wave of success and popularity with his groundbreaking, award-winning series CEREBUS. Sim accepted McFarlane\u2019s offer (as did Moore, Gaiman and Miller) and the two of them embarked on their collaboration which appeared in issue No.10 of SPAWN in 1993. McFarlane illustrated Sim\u2019s story, bringing their popular characters together in a tale about Creator\u2019s Rights called \"Crossing Over.\" The issue made such an impact that their collaboration went on to win the 1993 WIZARD WORLD AWARD for \u201cBest Single Story\u201d and remains one of the most memorable collaborations in the history of comics.\nLeft: ORIGINAL 1993 EDITION OF SPAWN 10.

It\u2019s still as fresh and relevant today as when it first appeared. While the original edition of SPAWN No. 10 was published in full color, this special edition - at Dave Sim\u2019s insistence - presents the story in black and white. In the original edition, McFarlane drew what Dave Sim has called \u201cthe definitive Cerebus\u201d (\u201c...more people saw Todd\u2019s Cerebus that one month than had seen my Cerebus in the decade prior to SPAWN No. 10\u201d). Working gingerly and painstakingly around his career-ending (2015) wrist ailment, Sim fulfilled what he calls a \u201clast ambition\u201d to render the Kitchener Sequence as he originally pictured it, and to produce three new covers. He also redrew the Cerebus figures throughout the issue.\n\"Remastered\" pages with Dave Sim's new art!\nTODD MCFARLANE'S ORIGINAL PAGE WITH DAVE SIM'S NEW CEREBUS FIGURES.\nDAVE SIM'S NEWLY UPDATED \"KITCHENER SEQUENCE.\"\nTodd Mcfarlane\u2019s masterful inking style radically changed the aesthetics of comic-books forever.

WHY!?\nSince you all are aware we were/are force to stay at home and seems like as soon as 2021 begins, everything will be in the past/future/present? (hopefully) ... But it is not enough for us, we need closure.  \nI'm gonna teach you the meaning of \"Happy accident\"\nWe used our time  to think of a good way to take out all our frustrationsend of this \"peculiar\" year... and we did it wisely. We decided to make a pi\u00f1ata to smash it at new year's eve, and it's almost done. Sadly, we cannot continue with the decoration as we have not decided on the theme of the following options:\nColorfull: Because there's a rainbow after the storm. \nElegant: Classic New Year's colors. \n????: This option is a surprise (don't know what to think of it e_e).\n\nWe need your help in order to take this tough desition.\nUPDATE: Mystery option has been unlocked: Toilet Paper Decoration. \nBecause shit happens...\nBut we don't want to keep all the fun just for ourselves, you have the oportunity to learn how to make this amazing 2020 pi\u00f1ata from scratch and bring some fun to your \"celebration\" (remember social distancing).\nFuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, and fuck you, I'm out!\nWe will teach you everything you need in order to do it: Basics, decoration, structure/body of the pi\u00f1ata, time, materials, etc. \nPaper.

But today's technical developments seem more like a dystopian inevitability. What went wrong?\nIs this the future envisioned?\nWe are creating a documentary that explores these questions. By interviewing the people who helped invent what today we call personal computing, this film will provide a perspective that is commonly absent from popular discussions about the role of computing in society. Many of these pioneers have long taken issue with the direction their inventions have taken. During these tumultuous times, it is crucial to get their take while we still can -- to grasp the futures they originally envisioned and to hear their view on the present.\nDespite the omnipresence of personal computing technology and its overarching influences on our daily lives, these questions have never been fully explored. No documentary has comprehensively examined this history from the perspective of the key contributors. \nOur aim is to let them do so in their own words.\nThis campaign will be used to fund our second round of interviews for the final product.\nWe anticipate donating our raw interview footage to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA sometime after the release of the final film.\nA taste of our reading list\nWe began work on this project in 2019, conducting dozens of informal conversations with scholars, journalists, and senior figures in computing. After months of careful planning we filmed our first three interviews in November of 2019. Using that footage we cut the above teaser, both as a \"proof of concept\" and as material to raise funds for further filming.\nOur first three interviewees comprised a good cross-section of perspectives, allowing our initial teaser to convey the kind of narrative we imagine will come from talking to the men and women who were on the ground at that time. They are also each unique and vibrant characters. \nM. Mitchell Waldrop, PhD. Author of \"The Dream Machine\"\nMitch Waldrop is a professional journalist and historian of science best known for his books \"Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos\" and, more importantly for us, \"The Dream Machine\" -- a comprehensive history of computing that he spent nearly a decade researching and writing. He provides an important historical framing for the development of these technologies.\nMichael Grisham, PhD. Psychologist and former head of Human Factors research at Bell Labs\nMichael Grisham is a psychologist and former head of the Human Factors research group at Bell Labs during its heyday. He began working with computing machines out of a necessity (his psychological research), and came to appreciate the effect these machines could have on the world. Of the many projects he worked on at Bell Labs, he worked on a re-programmable \"SmartPhone\" two decades before that term would enter the mainstream. Grisham provides important insight into the role of basic research cultures and institutions in the development of qualitative leaps in computing.\nDiana Merry-Shapiro, programmer and member of the legendary LRG group at Xerox PARC\nDiana Merry-Shapiro was a member of the Learning Research Group (LRG) at Xerox PARC during its heyday. PARC, and the LRG specifically, produced many of the qualitative leaps in computing that the later commercialization would build upon, including the graphical user interface, among others. She was key to the development of the Smalltalk programming environment, which revolutionized software development. Her elucidation of the vision of the LRG group -- what they had in mind for the kind of computing they were inventing -- is an important historical perspective.\nAfter finishing these first three interviews the outlines of a clear narrative began to emerge. More importantly what has become crystal clear from our dozens of conversations with these individuals is their desire to share a perspective on what is arguably the main technological development of a generation. This work changed the world, but no one has asked them what they think. \nWith your support, we can capture even more voices and capture what we are sure will be even more interesting and through-provoking perspectives.\nThe funds from this campaign will directly finance travel, production, and post-production of our next 5 interviews. \nUpon completion of the campaign, we will reach out to our list of potential interviewees -- all of whom we've already been in contact with -- and determine the 5 subjects to participate in this round.  We will base this decision on availability, local technical support options, and travel. Our aim is to shoot the interviews this coming Fall/Winter (2020/2021). In addition to enlarging the historical record, the new footage, along with previously shot and archival material, will be used to further promote the project. We will be creating digital content - teasers, a short feature film, etc - as needed to raise funds for subsequent rounds and post-production.\nObviously the current COVID pandemic presents challenges when it comes to this production plan. We are currently looking into the possibility of interviewing remotely using local teams. With that in mind, funds from this campaign might also be used to facilitate a more involved remote setup for each interview.\nWe've curated a nice collection of physical and digital rewards to thank you for supporting our project.  These include mousepads, coffee mugs, and T-shirts, as well as credits on the film's website or final film credits, depending on contribution level. \nAdditionally, we will be offering early digital access to any featurettes or materials that we derive from the compiled interviews at certain backer levels.  Though we anticipate the final product of our documentary taking the form of a feature, it may also end up as a documentary series or even a series of shorts. With that in mind, any digital copies or discounts on this final product will be applied in accordance with the distribution of the ultimate product.\nHacker Supporter\nAside from our eternal gratitude, Hacker Supporters will be given a special thank you shout out on our film's website. Like all backer levels, we will keep Hacker Supporter's appraised of the documentary's production as we continue the filmmaking process.\nHobbyist Supporter\nHobbyist Supporters will receive all of the rewards at the Hacker Supporter level, plus sneak preview and digital access to any teasers, shorts, or featurettes we make in the course of production.\nExpert Supporter\nExpert Supporters will receive all of the rewards at the Hobbyist Supporter level, including sneak preview digital access. Additionally, Expert Supporters will have their choice between an MNU-themed mousepad or coffee mug. \nMousepad - Super Supporter ($250) and above\nCoffee Mug - Super Supporter ($250) and above\nCredited Supporter\nBackers at the Credited Supporter level will receive the immediate shoutout on the film's website; sneak preview and digital access to any teasers, shorts, or featurettes; an MNU-themed t-shirt; and, most importantly, a named credit in the final product.\nT-Shirt - Credited Supporter ($500) and above\nCredited Producer\nBackers at the Credited Producer level and above will receive all of the rewards at the Credited Supporter level. Additionally, backers at this level will be credited in the final product as Associate Producers of the work. \nWe have budgeted $25,000 for completion of the second round of interviews. This budget includes equipment, transportation, and crew as well editing/post-production costs.  It also includes a 10% incidental rate that gives us a cushion against cost overages, which is standard for independent film production.\nOur current timeline for the production and completion of the film is as follows:\nDaniel Krasner is a technologist and photographer. In a prior life, before heading off into the word of computing, he was a mathematician focused on topology and homological algebra. He has a PhD in mathematics from Columbia University. Daniel's technology work is driven by the 'computing as a medium for thought' framework that was born in the 1960s and 70s emanating from research labs like Xerox PARC. His work in photography is geared around 'alternative processes' such as wet-plate collodion. \nMatt Rocker is a documentary film maker, focused on stories of music, technology, and subculture.  He earned a Master's degree from NYU in music technology, and next worked in the music and and sound department for hundreds of film and tv projects, before focusing on film making.  His first project, \"Revolver Live\" captured live concerts for some of the worlds most successful hard rock and heavy metal acts in the world. Subsequent work on traditional documentary projects led him to Dan and Eric, where he could return to exploring his other passion, technology.  \nEric Gade\nEric Gade is a historian and programmer. He earned his MA/MSc in International and World History in 2011, writing about the history of the Domain Name System. He was previously the project manager of Columbia's History Lab.

Climate change is a thousand different crises emerging across the world in ways that are difficult to understand and terrifying to contemplate. This project aims to provide people with insight into how large wildfires will increase in their community due to climate change and give them the tools to push their communities to action.\nWe built the first county-level map to show how climate change is increasing large wildfires in the U.S.\nWorking with John Abatzoglou, a climate scientist at the University of California-Merced, we developed the first U.S. county map of how wildfire risk is projected to change over the next 20 years. Leveraging data from his study Climate change presents increased potential for very large fires in the contiguous United States, we were able to create an interactive map for people to explore the frequency of very large wildfires in the near future. This map shows the frequency of Very Large Fires by county between 1971-2000 and what's projected under our current emissions trajectory to occur by 2040. Explore it below or at ThisPlaceWillBurn.org. Very Large Fires are 12,000 acres or more and account for a majority of burned area in many regions of the US. They include the 2018 Camp Fire that burned 153,336 acres, resulting in $16.5 Billion in damages, the loss of 18,804 homes and other structures, and completely destroyed the town of Paradise, CA.  \nUse the Layers to toggle between history and future projection or at ThisPlaceWillBurn.org:  \n The change is dramatic, with many counties set to experience multiple very large fires every year. But building a map isn't enough, we have to use this data to mobilize our communities to put pressure on the institutions that can drive change. Collective action starts with collective awareness, and we want to help people force collective awareness in these communities about the local impact of climate change.\nSigns for collective awareness and action    \nTo force people to think about the very real and local stakes of climate change, this project will provide posters and stickers for backers to post in public places that will face extreme risk of destruction due to large wildfires within 20 years if we fail to act on the crisis. This project follows the model of This Place Will Be Water, which has thousands of people across the world posting stickers in their communities about the risk of sea level rise.   \nThe posters and stickers are designed to convey the stakes of the climate crisis in clear and stark terms that can be easily understood by anybody. They drive awareness of the issue and demand for action in response. By mapping this data to political boundaries (counties) we hope to arm people to more effectively pressure their local governments and politicians on the issue.\nTHE POSTER\nThe posters are screen printed on 18\" x 24\" FSC-certified recycled paper by Bushwick Print Lab in Brooklyn, NY.\nTHE STICKERS \nThe stickers are 10\" by 3\" bumper stickers printed on 100% biodegradable and compostable sheets, made primarily from cornstalks grown and manufactured in the USA. The stickers are expected to degrade over a period of 12 months, so they will last a while but not cause any permanent impact on the environment. They are more expensive to produce, but we don't want to be contributing even more plastic waste to the environment. \nWe are also purchasing carbon offsets to mitigate the rest of the production and shipping footprint of this project.\nWhat if I don't live in a place threatened by wildfires?\nWe still need your help! Supporting this project will enable us to produce materials that we can distribute to schools and advocacy groups in these regions free of charge. The more funding we receive, the more we can canvass these regions with stickers and posters.\nWho We Are \nJon Leland is the VP of Insights at Kickstarter and leads the Kickstarter Environmental Impact Group.\nAmanda Rios is a designer at Kickstarter and member of the Kickstarter Environmental Impact Group, designed the stickers and posters for this project.\nThank you to our collaborators\nJohn Abatzoglou, a climate scientist and associate professor at the University of California-Merced, provided the data for the wildfire risk map. \nDanielle Shtab, generously formatted the climate data and developed the initial wildfire map.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have printers lined up and we have run a similar project in the past.

The first book in this series is almost ready. It is titled \u2018Cryptics\u2019.\nWhat is Cryptics ?\nCryptics is an adventure novel aimed at teaching some of the most amazing concepts of cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, blockchain and several fundamental mathematical concepts in a very fun, exciting and a memorable way.\nIt\u2019s a story of five middle school students, who coincidentally meet at a talk (in Bay Area) given by Dr. Shiva Kintali, a billionaire mathematician, technologist and an entrepreneur. Dr. Shiva Kintali (a.k.a Doc) brings their attention to a puzzle, whose solution is worth $10 Billion. Yes. Billion with a B.\nYes. The billionaire in this story is me. Some of the incidents, lifestyle and mannerisms of this character are based on my real life. If you don\u2019t know me, visit my homepage. I am NOT a billionaire in real life. Not yet ;)\nMy character appears on very minimal occasions in the story. Most of the story is about the five middle school students. The students race their way towards solving this $10 Billion puzzle, against the rest of the world\u2026 including some of the topmost genius mathematicians, anonymous hackers, large corporations with unlimited resources and a global network of mafia with evil tactics. During the course of this \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 global race, that attracts \u2018never before seen\u2019 international attention, the five middle-school students co-operate with each other, overcome some of the toughest real-life obstacles together, learn some of the most important values of life and become BFFs.\nMost of the events in this story take place in the Bay Area between January 2018 and January 2020.\nThe origins of Cryptics\nI got the idea of writing this series of books in 2009, during my PhD days at GeorgiaTech, after teaching some classes in complexity theory. I taught some of the most elegant, amazing and exciting concepts in this course: asymmetric key encryption, universal Turing machines, zero-knowledge proofs, undecidability\u2026 to name a few.\nI constantly noticed that students often find these concepts boring, because we teach in a \u201ctheorem\u2026. proof\u2026 theorem\u2026. proof\u201d style. Most of the students forget these concepts right after the semester end. There must be a better way to teach these concepts in a fun and a memorable way. I started making a list of mathematical concepts and started writing several short stories about them. Eventually, I merged all these short stories into three long coherent stories\u2026 one of them is Cryptics.\nWhat to expect from the book\nCryptics story is aimed at curious learners of ages from middle-school level and above. It reveals several mathematical concepts in an interesting, fun, suspenseful and an exciting way. Concepts from cryptography, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and theoretical computer science are revealed first in a subtle way in the story, developing a sense of curiosity in the reader's mind. These concepts are expanded as the story develops. All the essential concepts are eventually explained at the right time with the right context. Sometimes the readers must solve simple puzzles, connect hidden clues in the story to understand some concepts and appreciate the \"Aha moments\" in the story. The entire story invigorates a sense of creative puzzle-solving with applications to real-world technologies.\nQuick fun puzzle\nWhat is the precise mathematical function plotted on the cover of the Cryptics book (shown in the above image) ?

I have been photographing space exploration-related programs, facilities, and people for over 30 years. I recently completed a collaboration with Italian astronaut, Paolo Nespoli, to document and interpret the interior of the International Space Station. Paolo and I have produced a book of images from this collaboration, Interior Space: A Visual Exploration of the International Space Station. The book is being published by Damiani Editore in Bologna, Italy, in time for the 20th anniversary of continuous human habitation of the ISS on November 2, 2020.  \nView of Port Hatch into Node 3, Node 1 \u2013 Unity, International Space Station, Low Earth Orbit, Space, Photograph by Paolo Nespoli and Roland Miller\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to offset costs related to producing this book and to offer backers a copy of the book and prints of selected images from the project. The Interior Space book is a 200 page, color, hardbound, 12 x 10 inch publication. My timeline plans for shipping rewards out in October. Reward levels which include prints allow for the choice of one or all of five selected images in a variety of sizes.    \nInterior Space: A Visual Exploration of the International Space Station\nSelected Reward Image Choices\nA.

Scaffolding and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 \nE. View of Port Hatch into Node 3, Node 1\nBeginnings\nThe Interior Space Project was conceived when NASA astronaut Cady Coleman encouraged me to find a way to share my photographic vision and technical approach with astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). Cady was familiar with my photography of deactivated and repurposed space launch and test facilities which are encompassed in a project entitled Abandoned in Place. As remote a possibility as this idea seemed at the time, I honored Cady's request and drafted a proposal to collaboratively document the interior of the ISS with an astronaut who I could direct in making photographs. My goal for the project was to explore the ISS's interior in the combined documentary and abstract manner I approached the abandoned launch and test facilities, and to accomplish this mainly through available light photography. Cady liked the idea, and she connected me with Italian astronaut, Paolo Nespoli.   \nCupola with Clouds and Ocean, International Space Station, Low Earth Orbit, Space, Photograph by Paolo Nespoli and Roland Miller\nAs it turned out, Paolo was the perfect partner with whom to collaborate on Interior Space. Paolo has extensive photography experience himself. Paolo is recognized for the amazing images he made of the Space Shuttle Endeavour docked at the ISS during STS-134, the penultimate space shuttle mission. Paolo made these photographs while departing from the ISS on a Soyuz spacecraft, and they are the only images of a Space Shuttle docked at the ISS made from off-station. We have included three of these images in the Interior Space book.  The image below is one of the selected reward prints available at a number of the backer levels.\nView of ISS Nadir from Departing Soyuz TMA-20 Spacecraft, Complete ISS stack including Space Shuttle Endeavour and Automated Transfer Vehicle Kepler, Low Earth Orbit, Space, Photograph by Paolo Nespoli\nAlong with the collaborative images of the interior of the ISS, the Interior Space book contains photographs I made of ISS processing, training, and research facilities around the United States. Coupling these Earth-based images with the collaborative photographs Paolo and I made allows Interior Space to tell a broad visual story of the overall ISS program. \nScaffolding and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 \u2013 PMA 3, High Bay, Space Station Processing Facility \u2013 SSPF, NASA Kennedy Space Center, Florida, Photograph by Roland Miller\nThe Interior Space book includes essays by four experts. Dr. Walter Cugno, Vice President for Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space Italia, discusses Italy's role in designing and building a significant portion of the ISS modules. Dr. Alice Gorman, associate professor of archaeology at Flinders University, Australia and co-lead investigator with Dr. Justin St. P. Walsh of the International Space Station Archaeological Project, covers the concept of space archeology and the space station as a home. Dr. Jeffrey S. Nesbit, architect and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, analyzes the Goodyear Company's early role in space station development. Dr. Justin St. P. Walsh, associate professor of art history and archaeology at Chapman University in California, considers photography's role in the International Space Station Archaeological Project's research of the contemporary ISS.  \nView from Starboard into Node 2 and Japanese Experiment Module, European Laboratory \u2013 Columbus, International Space Station, Low Earth Orbit, Space, Photograph by Paolo Nespoli and Roland Miller\nAlong with in addition to these essays, Paolo and I each write about the project and the process of completing what we believe to be the first true collaboration at this level between an artist on the Earth and an astronaut in space. The book is introduced by Dr. Dava Newman, the Apollo Professor of Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Harvard\u2013MIT Health, Sciences, and Technology faculty member. From 2015\u20132017, Dr. Newman was the NASA Deputy Administrator.\nReward Specifics\nThe Book: Interior Space: A Visual Exploration of the International Space Station is printed on high quality paper by Damiani Editore of Bologna, Italy. Damiani is known for the quality of the photography and art books they produce. The book dimensions are 12 \"X 10\". The book is hardbound and 200 pages with more than 90 color images. The books will only be signed by Roland Miller due to travel and shipping constraints surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe Prints:  The images will be printed on high quality, archival paper with pigment inks. The size listed for the prints is the paper size. The actual images will be slightly smaller with a white border (approximately one inch on each side) to allow for signatures, matting, and conservation. The prints will be signed by one or both authors depending on who created the image. For those who back the project at a reward level where you receive one of the five selected images, you will be able to select the image of your choice when you receive your Backer Survey. The reward pricing is well below gallery pricing for my photographs.\nThe books and prints will be shipped separately.\nBecause of current international mail restrictions, the rewards will not be available worldwide at this point. International shipping currently costs more than the rewards. I hope to run a future Kickstarter that offers the book worldwide when international mail has returned to normal.  \n More Images from Interior Space \nStarboard View, European Laboratory \u2013 Columbus, International Space Station, Low Earth Orbit, Space, Photograph by Paolo Nespoli and Roland Miller\nZ1 Truss, High Bay, Space Station Processing Facility \u2013 SSPF, NASA Kennedy Space Center, Florida, Photograph by Roland Miller\nPort Hatch with Mission Stickers and Memorabilia European Laboratory \u2013 Columbus, International Space Station, Low Earth Orbit, Space, Photograph by Paolo Nespoli and Roland Miller\nExternal View of Wall with Ribs, Heaters, and Ground Support Equipment Multi-Purpose Logistics Module \u2013 MPLM Donatello, Space Station Processing Facility \u2013 SSPF, NASA Kennedy Space Center, Florida, Photograph by Roland Miller\nAll photographs of the ISS in orbit are courtesy of NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are really no risks or challenges presented by this project\u2014other than meeting the funding goal.

Heavy, porcelain bowls decorated with scenes of paradise discombobulated by calamities large and small. Three sizes to accommodate beasts of various dimensions.\nYou asked for this. My previous Calamityware porcelain projects on Kickstarter featured traditional blue-willow landscapes enlivened with various calamities. Many people requested pet dishes. Here they are. \nI call this the Things-Could-Be-Worse design because no matter how bad your day is going, this design reminds you things could probably be much worse. You could also be chased by UFOs, pestered by pirates, or plagued by giant frogs. Now, all your pets can be reminded of potential calamities, as well.\nSmall bowl for small beasts.\nFood safe. Microwave safe. Dishwasher safe. Bonus. They also function as serving dishes for dips, sauces, salsas, chips, popcorn, etc.\n*********\nBeautiful, useful, funny.\nProduction of the Beast Bowls is a global project. It starts in Pittsburgh, where I do the designs. The image transfers are made in the Czech Republic using special vitreous pigments that turn to glass at high temperatures. The bowls are made and decorated in China...the land where porcelain was first perfected three thousand years ago. Finally, the finished goods are shipped to New Jersey for mailing. (New Jersey is famous as a gay, sprightly land of grace and social ease...and tomatoes.)\nIn-glaze porcelain is fired at extra-high temperatures to allow the image to melt slightly into the surface. Connoisseurs will appreciate the beauty of the in-glaze technique. This is the look of porcelain you see in museums. Sweet.\nSmall Beast Bowl design (14\"W, 2\"H, 4.5\" diameter. Holds 1 cup kibble. Weighs 13 ounces)\nMedium Beast Bowl design (18.5\"W, 2.5\"H, 5.75\" diameter. Holds 2.5 cup kibble. Weighs 21 ounces)\nLarge Beast Bowl design (22.5\"W, 3\"H, 7.125\" diameter. Holds 5 cups kibble. Weighs 37 ounces)\nSubtle variations. Designs are nearly the same, so these bowls will look good together. You\u2019ll find dinosaurs, sea monsters, giant frogs, robots, pirates, UFOs, Sasquatch, and so much more. There are small design variations to accommodate the different proportions of the bowls. Sharp observers may detect an extra frog, mouse, or mystery quadruped here and there.\nThree practical sizes that nest for compact storage. (Shown here un-nested.)\nMultitude of beasts? If you entertain a lot of beasts and need more bowls than the standard pledge levels allow, please email us and we'll figure out how to boost your pledge level to get as many bowls as you need.\nBig bowl for big beasts.\nWhen can I expect these rewards? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you and your beasts should be dining with oddities by February 2021. Probably sooner.\nObviously, these aren't just for pets. They might prove to be your favorite snack bowls.\nWhat the critics are saying\nI don\u2019t have any pets. I\u2019m going to use my Beast Bowls as serving bowls for my human friends.\n*******\nBeast Bowls have all my favorite calamities from the Things-Could-Be-Worse Mugs, plus some new inconveniences, like the saber-toothed bunny.\n*******\nAlthough silly, these are serious bowls\u2014heavy, beautifully decorated and meant to last.\n********\nExcellent gift-giving potential.\n*******\nDestined to become a treasured family heirloom.\n********\nWoof!\nConsider getting multiple sizes. You\u2019ll find ways to use them.\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because these bowls are heavy, shipping costs are astonishingly high. But acquiring distinctive porcelain that could be treasured for generations might be something that you can justify.\nJust the local neighborhood. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of these bowls will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Beast Bowls there.\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you Beast Bowls during their next trip.\nIf you receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nTraditional from a distance and silly up close.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. A good place to find some unusual gifts.\nDon Moyer, Pittsburgh, August 5, 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors for a production run, I can green-light production right away. I\u2019m using a proven workshop that has been doing ceramics for decades. So technical problems are unlikely. The biggest risk is that delivery will take longer than anticipated because fewer ships are puttering around during the pandemic. \n\nI promise that I won\u2019t stop working until all my sponsors receive their Beast Bowls. My gloomiest prediction is that we will ship by February 2021. I will try to make it sooner.

It's a privilege to be entrusted by so many people to bring this project to life. We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed many Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because of our experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partners in China for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible, however, making the new candle holder is something we have never done before. There is always the potential for delay when working with a new manufacturer. We have a strong relationship with our fulfillment partner. These relationships are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. Molds may breakdown and have to be recreated. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nThere can also be delays with shipping. Products can be delayed at sea, there may be extended customs inspections, and even adverse weather conditions may slow down local delivery. Deadly pandemics may strike, causing governments to shut down commerce either regionally or globally.\n\nBut, when you support Elder Dice, we promise to keep you up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the dice are shipped.

LAUDERDALE\" \nThere were seven of us...\nEach one of us had a reason to be there in that tiny dirty backroom in the heat of the Florida summer. We were loosely sewn together in the beginning, maybe by some warped joke or divine inspiration.\nSome of us friends, or friends of friends, some of us whispers in the dirtiest corners of the city and some of us prayers for help to be answered.  Later though, we were bonded in a few ideas but the one that resonated in all of us \u201cYou can\u2019t escape your future\u201d. It was our rallying cry, the thing scratched into walls and spray painted in alleyways. We were and would become the future personified. \nLiving one step away in a collision course set to a backdrop of thick humidity and the real face of what people will do to try to cheat the things that can never be cheated.\nThere\u2019s only so much neon that you can take in a place that spits in the face of what we thought was good here.\nRight about now you\u2019re probably asking yourself what could be good in a low rent, mosquito swarmed city, that is surrounded by a massive snake and alligator infested swamp? That\u2019s a solid question really. Well, to be honest with myself, it\u2019s those moments of solidarity and kindness, friendship and generosity, putting a complete strangers well being in front of your own and then adding some bodily harms to yourself for good measure too.\nThe basic rules came first..\nPlucked right from the most logical place for a group of misfits, from a Nirvana song called \u201cRadio Friendly Unit Shifter\u201d.  Four rules to hold us all together, our 7 separate stories, the 7 separate reasons to do what we were doing, and a million reasons to put everything on the line.\nHate your enemies\nSave your friends\nFind your place\nSpeak the truth\nIf we could keep these things pure and simple, then how can we fail, right?  Well that and drinking the Cuban coffee that\u2019s served out of a graffiti covered bodega\u2019s side window. Now, that\u2019s exactly what any self respecting, sleep deprived group needs to keep on mission. \nWHO ARE THE INEVITABLES?\nThe Inevitables story takes place in the not-so-distant future when Big Pharma has been able to produce a \u201ccure for death.\u201d Of course there\u2019s a big number on the price tag that reflects such a coveted item. Just like the bridge itself, it further divides the mega wealthy from the working class. It\u2019s about time they get a reality check that playing God has consequences and death is inevitable.\nOne side of the bridge is the home of The Inevitables: an unlikely team of a punker, drug dealer, graffiti artist, mystic bodega owner, and middle-aged Christian couple who come together to take on the challenge that is Knight Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Tillerson Knight, owner of the massive corporation, is part of the mega wealthy living across the bridge. \nAs tensions rise, so do the stakes. There are only 40 DAYS to save the world and this is only the beginning...\n The Inevitables is both an art & music project based on a group of nobodies trying to save the world.  \nHowever, the creators are far from nobodies. Spearheaded by multi-faceted creator, Vinnie Fiorello (Less Than Jake, Paper & Plastick) & the full team list below, the world building of The Inevitables extends FAR beyond music and into a multi-medium adventure that includes a FULL LENGTH ALBUM & 22 PAGE SINGLE ISSUE COMIC BOOK that crosses the bridge through the gray area between the haves and have nots.\n We are The Inevitables. \nTHE INEVITABLES COMIC TEAM\n Vinnie Fiorello (Less Than Jake, Paper & Plastick) - Creator\n Obi Fernandez (Westbound Train, Meen Machine) - Creator\n Jono Diener (The Swellers, Baggage, No Trigger) - Comic Scriptwriter\n Liana Kangas (TKO, Vault, 2000 AD, Black Mask, Image) - Comic Artist\n Devin Watson - Character Designs, Logo, Comic Cover\n Fabian Lelay (We Are The Danger, Jade Street Protection Services) - Layout Artist\n Cardinal Rae (Marvel, Image, ComiXology) - Letterer\nMORE ABOUT THE ARTISTS BTS\nJono Diener (@jonodiener) is a comic writer and world-traveling musician out of Flint, Michigan.

Diener put together A Comic For Flint: HOPE released by Source Point Press, and is featured in the anthologies Maybe Someday (A Wave Blue World), and Everything Is Going Wrong: Comics on Punk and Mental Illness in addition to his self-published titles Monster Bounty, and Jetpack Zack.\nLiana Kangas (@lianakangas) is a comic artist and dog mom most known for her work on Vault Comics\u2019 She Said Destroy, as well as co-writing a title for TKO, and doing art for the likes of Image, 2000AD, A Wave Blue World, and Black Mask.

With your support, we can bring this project to life and draw the comics, print the books, record the music, press the vinyl, make the t-shirts, and release it all independently and make it available EVERYWHERE folks who like comics and music can access it.\nWe can bring this project to life for $20,000. Please help us reach that initial goal and create The Inevitables.\nThanks to the nature of Kickstarter, you can get in on the ground floor and be rewarded with some EXCLUSIVE incentives that will ONLY be available as part of this project.\nIf you're unfamiliar with how Kickstarter works, click here and read all about it. \nKickstarter is ALL OR NOTHING, so if we don't reach or surpass the initial goal of $20,000 by the deadline...NO ONE GETS CHARGED AND THE PROJECT DOES NOT FUND! \nThat means no comics, no new music, no t-shirts, definitely no vinyl, not a thing. \n We can't let that happen. \nREWARD PACKAGES INCLUDE:\nPrinted Copies of The Inevitables Comic Book\nThe Inevitables T-Shirts (Your Choice of Design AND Size)\nVinyl Copies of the Full-Length Album\n LIMITED EDITION - Inevitables Black Vinyl w/Silkscreen Cover\n YOUR NAME Listed in the Comic Book as a Supporter\n AUTOGRAPHED - Silkscreen Art Prints Signed By Comic Artist\nCreative Consulting Sessions (w/Vinnie, Jono, & Obi) \n AUTOGRAPHED \"6/19\" books by Vinnie Fiorello \n YOUR NAME & YOUR LIKENESS Drawn into the Comics\n RETAIL COMIC PACKS - For Comic Book Stores \nZoom Songwriting Sessions with Vinnie, Obi, & Alex \nFoldable paper doll/cut-outs of Florida Man \n Vinnie Designs Artwork for Your Album Project\n \"The Ultimate Collector\" package stuffed with AUTOGRAPHS & RARITIES \n ...AND MUCH MORE \nYou Choose Your Design and Size or GET BOTH!\n*NEW LIMITED EDITION REWARD*\nBowman Audio Endeavors x The Inevitables Guitar Pedal\nBowman Audio Endeavors is the 2020 creation of James Bowman (Against Me!). Bowman, who is always on the hunt for classic and unique guitar tones, took it upon himself to create the sounds and tones he uses today. With a nod to the classics, think fuzz, distortion, and mood.  Bowman Audio Endeavors are handcrafted pedals, always limited, and with high-quality classic circuits. All guitar effect pedals are made by hand in Gainesville, FL.\n\nTwo modes: Pure Clean & High Gain\n1) With the switch in the down position, it's like a volume control that goes to 20.\n2) With the switch up, it\u2019s a cutting boost with a bit of gain. Not quite an overdrive, just overdriven tube grit and edge to your tone.\n\n Dual FETs for the most tube like tone in a transistor design. \n Power Doubling on the inside so you put 9VDC in, using an internal charge pump to nearly double operating voltage! \n Caution \u2013 9 Volt DC Maximum Input Voltage (DO NOT try to put 18 volts to the unit hoping that the doubler will make it 36VDC!) \nWhat do higher power supply voltage rails mean?!  SUPER CLEAN HIGH-HEADROOM BOOST!  \nFlip the switch -> Tube-like gain!\nCheck out the pedal in action in the video below.\nPLAY\n\nCheck out the full list of rewards along the right hand side of the project!\n PLEASE NOTE - \nReward bundles include ONLY items expressly listed in the reward outline\nExperiential rewards will be scheduled after project ends and according to participating member schedules (Reward delivery may extend into 2021)\n Using Your Name and/or Likeness in comic DOES NOT entitle backer to any royalties, claims, or residuals on The Inevitables project \nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nWe can't wait to bring the world of The Inevitables to life. \nLet's cross the bridge TOGETHER!\n-Vinnie, Obi, & The Inevitables\nWebsite: https://www.theinevitables.world/\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/wearetheinevitables/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all products, there could be production delays.

Sonically it combined my love for Elvis Costello, The Pietasters and  classic Rock n\u2019 Roll. It\u2019s what i like to imagine if Fats Domino played  in our band. What\u2019s so special to me about this song is not how it  resonates with me musically but rather how my partners in crime Vinnie  Fiorello and Alex Stern shine. Lyrically, this is classic Fiorello with  fire or \u201ccaliente\u201d storytelling and his play on words and alliteration.  It\u2019s a flawless set up for Stern\u2019s brand of pop with the perfect dash of  his own cleverness. What makes this tune great is that anyone can jump  into the narrative and find themselves right in the thick of it,  verbally going lick for lick with your buddies. We all know the Mr Can  and Mr. Cant\u2019s, we all have our sober buddies and those certain friends  who seem to only know how to take. We all can totally relate. And if the  lyrics don\u2019t do that for you, we have a new animated video for this  song that lets you jump into The Inevitable\u2019s universe and get a glimpse  into the story that is unfolding. Feel free to jump on in.

We also read books and searched on the internet for inspiration. \nThree years ago we got the idea, to try and create a book with Swedish ice cream recipes. One reason was to challenge ourselves into creating something new, as well as learn more about typical Swedish ingredients. We have also had the ambition to make somewhat healthier ice cream, with more flavour and less sugar than the typical ice cream.\nEvery recipe has started with an vision. We have tested and iterated every recipe until we are both satisfied with taste, texture and look. By purpose, we have also included somewhat different styles and ways of creating the different recipes to inspire creativity and offer options also for people without a ice cream machine.\nJ\u00e4mtland - Black currant parfait\nOne ice cream for every county\nTraditionally Sweden is divided into 25 different counties. We listed all of them and started researching to find out what local ingredients or traditions that could best be represented in an ice cream.\nBelow we show the actual index of the book with all the flavours we intended for the counties.\nIndex page from the book to be\nLayout of the book\nFor every recipe we want also to add a bit of background about the county and the thoughts we put into the specific flavour, or the particular ingredients. We are making two versions of the book, one in English, and one in Swedish.\nThe page spread for the county of Dalarna, and the recipe of Billberry soap\nNext step\nWe have completed all but two of the recipes, but we have still length to go in order to complete the graphic and text to complete the book.

Imagining the possibilities and absurd humor of what it would mean to turn our band into a game, and what an oddity it would be to see a new NES cartridge for sale at our merch table. Heavily influenced by licensed era marketing tie-in video games, Space Raft NES pays homage to those misguided attempts at merchandising intellectual properties. Most agree that those games were poorly made cash-ins, yet they remained incredibly popular, helping to shape the pop culture landscape of its day. Space Raft: The Game attempts to recapture the idea of art as marketing and turn it back into art once again.  \nCollecting sandwiches in the van\nTHE  GAMEPLAY: \nCactus Club Milwaukee, Wi\nSpace Raft:The Game is a mix of obstacle based scrolling stages and early arcade top down action stages making use of many recognizable people and places from the Milwaukee music scene. Featuring the band's jealous old bass player Srini* as the villain of the game who has returned to Milwaukee from California to steal the master tapes of the new record. You'll need to chase down Srini and eat all the sandwiches in order to retrieve the tapes and finally release \"Positively Space Raft\" to the public. Each of the 4 members of Space Raft are represented by unique sprites with unique actions and their own color palette to help build characterization.\nTjay, Jon, Tyler and Jordan\n*Srini was chosen as the villain of the game per his request, so rest assured no feelings were hurt by this decision. \nHey Space Raft, I QUIT!!! , WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!\n#srinimania\n THE BAND:\nSpace Raft is an indie rock band from Milwaukee, WI rooted in the sound of the post-Beatles period pop music milieu that occurred in the early 1970s. Encompassing influences from artists like Badfinger, Big Star, Harry Nilsson, The Raspberries, ELO, Black Sabbath and Klaatu. Often veering from heavy psychedelic dirges to shiny pop melodies, the band is able to inhabit a territory that is uniquely their own as demonstrated on the band's recently released 3rd LP \"positively Space Raft.\" \nSpace Raft en route\n Listen to  Positively Space Raft  Here:\nPositively Space Raft on Dusty Medical Records\n\nTHE ARTIST/DEVELOPER:\nMy name is Jordan and I am the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter in Space Raft. I am a first time game developer currently following my passion project from hobby to hopeful physical release. As a musician and composer,  I've worked on projects ranging from television, film, stage, progressive political ads, and most recently,  chiptune, which developed out of a sincere desire to recreate \"Positively Space Raft\" in this format. I was reminded of the chiptune version of Cyndi Lauper's \"Goonies r' good enough\" included in the Goonies II NES game that I received as a child and how the experience of hearing that simple piece of music helped shaped my interest in music at such a formative age. Further I was reminded of the quote by Albert Camus featured on the back cover of Scott Walker's 1969 masterpiece SCOTT 4: \"a man's work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened.\" The similarities between the cause and effect of influence over art struck me as profound, so I set out to create something that honored the machine that made some of the first sounds that I was able to identify as music... the Nintendo Entertainment System. \nsetting the high score at my local arcade\nTHE SOUNDTRACK:\nI started the development of this project by breaking down the music of \"Positively Space Raft\" into basic four channel chiptune in order to create my soundtrack. My goal was to include a recognizable version of each of the 10 songs on the album plus the band's de facto theme song \"Humboldt Reservoir Blues\" as well as the necessary sound effects needed to create a game. This presented a major challenge in reducing an entire four piece rock band with three singers into an arrangement for only four monophonic channels while maintaining the approximate spirit of the original music. Creating a soundscape that both honored the band and allowed the sonic space necessary for sound effects was a difficult task. I researched all of the major NES soundtracks that mimicked music from film and television to take notes on how to best translate recognizable songs within such narrow limitations. Then I set about trying to learn how to use Famitracker,  a free music tracker program that allows you to easily export code the NES can read and deliver to its audio processing unit. There a thousands of techniques to creating sounds for the NES, so many ways of manipulating the stock sounds to trick the ear into hearing more or less than it is. I believe I have settled on a sound that is both rich in texture and practical for gameplay while also representing the melodies and arrangements of the band. As well, I have managed to fit it all within the tight 10k memory constraints allotted for sound. A juggling act of which I feel that I have succeeded, even going so far as to including a drum kit that you can play along with the band using the d-pad during cutscenes. \nIt's a game and watch dance party!\nAt the onset of the project I used a free and easy web program called Beepbox in order to learn how to work with chiptune and transcribe the music of the band. This platform emulates a variety of sound chips, and while not faithful to the NES soundchip, it allowed a lush and worthwhile recreation of the album as computer music which I have entitled  \"Approximately Space Raft\" . I have included this as a bonus in the digital version and on the Soundtrack cassette. \nTHE DEVELOPMENT:\nSpace Raft was developed using a software program called Nesmaker available from The New 8 Bit Heroes. As I started researching NES development I soon realized that programming in 6502 assembly language would be a hurdle for me to climb that might prevent my project from coming to fruition. It was clear to me early on that my talents in nesdev were mostly in asset creation using programs like Shiru's NES Screen Tool and Famitracker. I managed to learn enough to bend the existing framework within Nesmaker to produce a roughshod demo to be included in the new 8bit heroes 2019 Byte Off competition where Space Raft was able to serve as the musical guest. Luckily, through participating in the competition, I made many new friends within the Nesmaker community that were able to help me piece together the code necessary to complete my game. One such friend is a talented NES programmer from France who goes by the name Dale Coop. Dale and I started discussing developing NES games and quickly became collaborators and have been exchanging assets for programming in service of each other's projects ever since. Without his invaluable assistance I would not have been able to finish this game nor raise it to its current level of polish. Cartridge and motherboards have been sourced for the game through  Infinite Nes Lives and printed materials have been sourced locally (somewhat) from Frank Westphal .\nthe Van\nTHE DEMO:\nAvailable to play now is a free DEMO version of the game ROM to play on an emulator or flashcart of your choice.

Tomorrow I will start creating backer surveys to send to you all that will be used to collect necessary info like mailing address and T shirt sizes. I know a few of you had messaged me about shirt sizes early on before I had my tiers worked out, don't worry, those will be counted. Once I have all the surveys returned I can begin my print run of T shirts. Today and tomorrow I will be working on Ironing out the final details of the game manual before I can submit them to the printers, the print materials will likely take the longest so I want to ensure those are put in early. Once the ball is rolling in that direction I will redouble my focus on finishing up the last few details of the ROM file and sending it over to Infinite NES lives to start producing the cartridges.

I am Stranga, the creator of the games: Just Ignore Them, My Big Sister and Red Bow. I also co-created Mini Thief along with Tommah. \nWelcome to the Kickstarter for my latest game Ashina: The Red Witch. A top-down horror-themed story adventure game.\n\nThe story is about Ash. An ordinary girl who takes a journey through a mysterious spirit world filled with strange creatures. Ash must find her way back home...before something else finds her. This game is a canon prequel to one of my previous games 'My Big Sister' which will tell the story of the events that led to the red witch. \nI also have plans to include some alternate endings to the game as wells as a few secret ones. \n\n\nAll of my games (except Mini Thief) are made in Adventure Game Studio. AGS gives me the flexibility to create something more unique and adventurous than RPG Maker. Most of the engine's functions and systems are already pre-built into the engine, which gives me more time to create my own unique systems and features.  I have more designing freedom with less programming to create it  and I love to design!   \nThe game will feature:\nA unique and thrilling story!\nNew and exciting characters! As well as some returning characters from my previous games.\nAdventure like puzzles throughout the game to help keep your mind at its wits.\nExtra character dialogue options to delve into some of the lore surrounding the game's universe.\nMini-Games!\nAn Original Soundtrack + Remixed Soundtrack.\nAchievements + Trophies! As well as an in-game trophy system.  \n\n\nThe reason I started this kick starter is to help financially support me and my family whilst I develop the project. I'm a full-time game developer and I do absolutely everything myself, from programming and artwork to story and music. I occasionally receive help when it comes to testing or grammar checking (As I tend to miss quite a few things while I program). \nBut my stories are made for the fans and players. I love to share them with everyone! \nWith the extra funding, I will be able to make a longer game with much more content than my previous titles. I also hope to add a few new mechanics as well as some  extensive puzzles \n\nThe game will initially release on PC through Steam and itch.io as early access when available. Once the PC full release has been established, the game will be ported to consoles such as:\nPS4\nXboxOne\nNintendo Switch\n\n\nThe stretch goals will be used to extend the game and add more nifty features.\n + $5,000 - An extra chapter will be added to the game!\n + $10,000 - An extra chapter + Bonus alternate ending!\n +$20,000 - Digital art book!\n  +$50,000 - In game character lore book or collectors cards + Character face portraits to dialog! \n +$100,000 - A defibrillator to revive me  after I pass out seeing so much support!(Just kidding!). Animated intro + a few animated cutscenes throughout the game + Possible IOS and Android ports of the game + I'll think of some more things, don't worry!\nWith your funding, I estimate a full release around early to mid-2021 or even late 2020 (It all depends on the stretch goals). I want to try and make this game as enjoyable as I can with as much content that I can pack into the game add as much content as I can to the game, hence why the stretch goals are important.

Follow along with the updates and guarantee lifetime access to special Kickstarter pricing.\nCustom Cork Body Design \nTo offset the carbon costs inherent in the manufacturing of steel and glass, The Present has been redesigned to be simpler, lighter, and more ecological. Its new body is made of compression moulded zero-waste cork from Portugal. \nPrototype \u2014 Single piece cork body\nCork is naturally impermeable to liquids and gases, mold and dust, is hypoallergenic, a fire retardant, anti-microbial, can withstand intense impact without losing shape and sports an extremely low thermal conductivity.  \nAll of these benefits make cork the ideal material to protect the internal mechanism of the clock from moisture and fluctuations in temperature for decades.  \nCNC prototype\nCork benefits\nMaking Time \nClockmaker Scott Thrift saving time from falling.\nIn 2012, we made The Present Year \u2014 365.24 day revolution.\nIn 2016, we made The Present Day \u2014 24 hour revolution.\nIn 2020, we complete the set with The Present Moon  \u2014 29.5 day revolution.\nWith your pledge we can bring the full set to life for you, me and everyone we know.  \nScott Thrift - Clockmaker - Pictured with early prototypes of The Present Year & Day\nThe Present Partners \nThe team that I've had the pleasure of working with so far has been instrumental in making every part of this campaign a reality.\n CW&T (industrial design & manufacturing)\nTaylor Levy and Che-Wei Wang of CW&T\nI first found out about Kickstarter through the work of CW&T back in the summer of 2011.  Partnering with CW&T for product development in early 2019 opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. Their casual artistry and degree of patience is admirable. The quality of a product hinges on a lot of things, but most critically, on your relationships with the vendors who produce the objects themselves. CW&T have been successfully producing elegant designs with their vendors for over a decade and it is such a relief to have their experience and bright minds on this project.\n Alex Daly (public relations)\nThe Daly Team\nBefore realizing that the trio was collectively called The Present  I must have run through sixty-four potential names. Many times I asked for the impossible, to change the story that was already pitched in a constant pursuit for clarity. Creativity is often strange and unpredictable and somehow Alex and her team always managed to adapt. Thank you for your patience and understanding. \nJulio Monterrey (original music)\nJulio Monterrey\nHere is the track list for anyone who loved the music from the video.\nHow many videos have we made together Julio? The latest collaboration is always the best and this one is no different, thank you for your friendship and sharing your talent.\nEric Epstein (artist & animator) \nEric Epstein\nAnother timepiece, another chance to work you again, Eric. Thank you for bringing all of this movement to life with your rich animations.  \n Jonathan Harris (design & communications) \nJonathan Harris\nThis project would not be half as a clear and whole as it is without the insights and far reaching vision of Jonathan Harris. I always wanted to partner with Jonathan since we became friends in 2007. Realizing Mr. Harris was going to help me make this happen changed the scope of the project. \nWe\u2019ve gone through a lot in the past few months leading up to this launch, but the clarity of purpose has become crystal. The Present is a way of measuring life time and working with Jonathan means you get access to a whole lifetime of knowledge.\nMade with Sunlight \nThe Next Clear Thing\nThe Present is a collaboration with Sunlight. Sunlight works to energize, clarify, and illuminate humanity\u2019s wisdom \u2014 supporting the emergence of positive futures.\nBackground\nThe Present \u2014 Day Moon Year evolved out of two beloved \u201ctime art\u201d projects by Scott Thrift, ThePresent (2012, an annual clock) and Today (2016, a daily clock), both of which began on Kickstarter and eventually made their way to the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s Design Store. Over 7,000 people in 42 countries have been living with these special time pieces for the past several years (testimonials below).\nNow, Scott has redesigned ThePresent and Today, while adding a third time piece that shows the cycle of the moon. These three new timepieces are called The Present Day, The Present Moon, and The Present Year (collectively, The Present). In their pared down and distilled formats, Scott hopes that they can become truly universal tools for being in time. \nA tale of two times\nIn closing\nTime as we know it is narrow and short term.\nThe Present helps us relate to the wide and long term nature of time.\nEach piece offers a way into the delicate wonder and infinite depth of the present. \n- Scott Thrift \nTestimonials\nAfter living with The Present Year for seven years I sent a survey out asking what it's like to live with it and these are some of the many responses.\nRead more testimonials at daymoonyear.com\nThe Present\nThank you for your time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my fourth Kickstarter and if it succeeds the next production run will be my seventh. Those two facts will not prevent this project from facing unexpected obstacles, paradoxes and surprises. I still have much to learn but I am confident that I will hit the deadlines in time, this time.\n\nAfter the campaign ends you will be updated on every Full Moon until you receive your time. As complications inevitably arise you will be guided through where we are and how we move forward together. If there is a reason for an extended delay, it will be absolutely clear to you through the updates. \n\nMy philosophy of production delivery is inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto, the legendary video-game designer who has said \"A delayed game is eventually good, a rushed game is bad forever.\"\n\nThese timepieces speak to the nature of longevity itself so it is imperative that they also last a long term.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nEach of these designs was refined over the years for longevity. Many owners who received their clocks in 2013 just passed their seven year anniversary. As long as you commit to changing the batteries every four years, your timepieces are designed to last a long, long time.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe protective body of cork is the ideal material to keep each \"Heart of The Present\" safe. The packaging this time around will be minimal and you should expect the box it ships in to be the only box needed. These timepieces are no longer meant for retail display so no more boxing and then boxing it again for shipment. A great deal of focus will be paid to eliminating unnecessary waste.\nSustainable materials\nThe body of The Present is a new form of cork production called compression moulding. The beauty of the cork is in its texture, durability, longevity but also in the fact that it is a zero waste product made in a zero waste facility in Portugal.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe facility I am utilizing in Portugal is proud to be a zero waste facility. Cork is the bark of a tree which renews itself every seven years for harvest. No trees will be cut down to produce these timepieces. As a bonus, cork is such an effective carbon sink that using it for The Present offsets the footprint of the classic steel and glass editions.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Virtual elbow bump!", "descp": "Follow the Full and New Moon updates.\nBe a part of making more time for everyone.\nLifetime access to special Kickstarter pricing.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "The Present Pins", "descp": "Let me send you something.\n+\nOne Present Day pin\nOne Present Moon pin\nOne Present Year pin\n+\nVideo from Scott thanking you for supporting independent creative projects like The Present", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["107 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 149 or more", "title": "One Present", "descp": "Choose Day, Moon, or Year (1)\nin post-campaign survey.\nCustom cork body made in Portugal\nNo steel and glass", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["244 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 299 or more", "title": "Two Presents", "descp": "Choose any two of Day, Moon, Year (2)\nin post-campaign survey.\nCustom cork body made in Portugal\nNo steel and glass", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 299 or more", "title": "One Present (Steel & Glass)", "descp": "Choose Day, Moon, or Year (1)\nin post-campaign survey.\nEncased in steel and glass", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["203 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 449 or more", "title": "Three Presents", "descp": "Choose any three of Day, Moon, Year (3)\nin post-campaign survey.\nCustom cork body made in Portugal\nNo steel and glass", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["139 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 599 or more", "title": "Two Presents (Steel & Glass)", "descp": "Choose any two of Day, Moon, Year (2)\nin post-campaign survey.\nEncased in steel and glass", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["32 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 899 or more", "title": "Three Presents (Steel & Glass)", "descp": "Choose any three of Day, Moon, Year (3)\nin post-campaign survey.\nEncased in steel and glass", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "The Heart of The Present", "descp": "Bring your own vision of The Present to life with our custom 365.24 day movement.\n\nEngineered and made in Germany.\nAutomatically sets itself to the present day.\nOne revolution per year.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "72 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Making time count.", "update_content": "Hello,\nWelcome to another brief full moon update about making The Present.\nThere is something curious about the way that The Present, which offers little means of traditional counting, wind up being a time you can truly count on \u2014 it's the consistency of each natural cycle that you can \"count\" on.

An unbelievably vast, uncharted territory filled with extravancies that no poet ever envisioned. Vast plains, towering, geometrical mountains, dizzying cliffs and other things for which there are no common words in our language. \nHow far does one have to travel to find it? Well, far enough, although not in length\u2026but in size! On the tip of a needle, on a grain of sand, on a speck of dust, on your fingertip! There the microverse is!\nLet us introduce to you Maxwell\u2019s Daemons, an immersive FPS adventure set in the world of atoms and molecules, where everything surrounding you will be  firmly grounded in physics and chemistry... except something really odd: that's what you have to fight!\n'Graphene pawns are sometimes held in a standby state, circling in space like damned souls...' from an anonymous diary found at Camp-02\nMaxwell's D\u00e6mons is a game made by three Physical Chemists, intended first of all as an entertaining and thrilling adventure, with a very peculiar settings and an original story. It's intended for a wide audience, and in particular for those who have a curiosity for science and the working of the world around us. While the game can be played as an FPS adventure, though requiring a certain deal of reasoning and attention, it has been designed as a multi-layer product with various levels of gameplay and understanding; therefore, we prefer to envision it as a pop-science medium, at its deepest level.   \nPLAY\n\nYour task is to unravel the mystery of Freezlins (see the game story below) by exploring a tiny grain of material, and this will require you to ponder about the inner mechanisms underlying many everyday phenomena. What we want you to realise is just how strange and fascinating things are when viewed from a billionth of a meter perspective. \nYou are going to see the nanoworld through your viewer capable of analysing its surroundings and creating a visual representation of it. It can switch between various styles so that you can always focus on the most relevant aspects of the level you are playing (and this is why you see different graphical styles in these in-game pictures). \nThe viewer allows you to gain informations about the Maxwell's D\u00e6mons world, such as thermodynamic data, radioactivity levels, the elemental composition of the surroundings, and other chemical data.\nFor example, you can decide to highlight the elements around you with different colours, or to see everything in greyscale with the exception of specific chemical species. By pointing at a specific molecule in the viewfinder you can also obtain more information about it. \nA carbon based creature, with a double heart of iron\nAt the beginning you will be supplied with a number of chemicals, but as you proceed in the game you may discover that some useful compounds are missing or dwindling. Don\u2019t worry! You can miniaturise and absorb various substances with your equipment.\nHowever, as part of your quest you'll also have to fight against an army of really weird creatures which are lurking in the nanoworld, defying our current understanding of the Universe and posing a constant threat to your mission. You can beat them, but you must always choose the right weapon!\nA head of porphyrin rings encasing a nanoparticle of Uranium... this nanomachines fire alfa rays, better staying clear of them!\nCertain creatures can be beaten by means of chemical beams. As an example, if your opponent is made mainly of carbon you can try to 'burn' it with an oxygen shower, but if it is made of silicon this is certainly not the right approach! Try at your own expenses...\nOther in-game situations may instead require the use of electromagnetic radiation of the correct frequency, and your equipment can emit beams from across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from radiowaves to X- and even gamma-rays! But beware, using these at the wrong moment can be very dangerous!\nWe won't tell you much about the monsters, for the moment it will suffice to say that they come in many different molecular forms (a few of which you can see on this page). Some of them rely just on their number and will try to block you by trapping you with their tentacles or even by burying you under their bodies, while others are fighters ready to punch you with their heavy metal fists. Among the most dangerous monsters are those equipped with radioactive atoms, capable of firing lethal alfa rays!\nWhatever their appearance and their weapons, the real problem is: what are these creatures? And what are they doing here?\nIt's your task to find out!\nInexplicable phenomena are taking place across the globe. They are called Freezlins. Suddendly a pot, a car, a house or a factory, start getting colder and colder in the middle of summer, or even on the Equator\u2026until they freeze! Many, even quirkier, events take place beside a Freezlin: black outs, strange smells, electromagnetic interferences and malfunctionings (one unverified claim is that before one of these episodes a fried egg got uncooked!).\nNo one has an explanation, and while at first the governments tried to keep the facts under wraps, soon these events multiplied, and became too widespread to be kept under control. Now there is panic all around the world, with a number of casualties and huge financial damages. Moreover it looks as if the Earth is slowly and steadily getting colder since these episodes started a pair of years ago. Some scientists say that only an army of Maxwell\u2019s Demons could be responsible for such subversions of the ordinary laws of nature, and in particular of the deepest of them all: The Second Law. But these creatures were thought to be just imaginary entities, and nobody ever expected witnessing the fall of the Second Law\u2026how could this happen?\nElectronic dusk... something is skulking in the wood\nWell, we have a favour to ask you! We need a qualified person for a very special mission. If you accept, you\u2019ll be shrunk to a billionth of your size and sent into the microworld, to walk among atoms and molecules in search of a solution to this mystery.\nA floating zeolite crystal could be the headquarter of the Demons!\nA previous expedition was lost some time ago, and you should first of all find out what happened to them, before getting rid of what\u2019s going on in the depth of matter. In the vastness of the microrealm you\u2019ll be alone, apart from JC, a very smart AI which \u2013 or should we say who \u2013 will guide you, and help with all of our scientific knowledge. However you\u2019ll possibly reach a point beyond which no known theory could be of any help!\nA droplet of water with a very unusual behaviour...there must be demons at work!\nA top-secret miniaturizing technology will allow you to use a number of chemicals for different purposes throughout your quest, to open your way, build things or, if necessary, to defend yourself\u2026against what we cannot tell!\nAs part of the equipment you will be provided an electromagnetic radiation source covering a wide range of wavelengths, and an absorbing ray for collecting environmental samples and useful chemicals, be it for examination, survival or self-defence.\nA clearing in the carbon nanotube forest\nIf you are considering our proposal JC will teach you everything you\u2019ll need to know in due time. However, let us reassure you that you will be in a better starting position compared to previous lost squad members. As you know, atoms can\u2019t be seen by means of light and eyesight, but over the last few weeks a prototype of a powerful viewer has been developed, so you are going to \u2018see\u2019 the molecular landscape, with whatever it hides, in an unprecedented way. The new viewer allows you to switch through various sight modes, allowing to focus on what you think is most useful to see at any given time amid the molecular chaos.\nA graphene sentinel watch for strangers in the peptidic fortress\nYou look smart and brave, you can be the one we are looking for. There is no monetary reward for this mission, but rather many things to learn and wonder about. As your eyes roam around the hidden structure of matter, you will get at a glance what everything surrounding you is made of, and how the smallest cogs of the world operate.\nThe Earth is doomed to freeze at Absolute Zero if you don\u2019t solve the mystery, so please give it a chance, it\u2019s worth it\u2026even if you were to be lost on a grain of dust in the end!\nBombarding enemies with high pressure oxygen sometimes is not enough... try with a catalyst!!\n\nBeside being science fanatics we also share a passion for music. All the three of us play various instruments and are very curious about synthetic and generative music. So we have already started to write the game soundtrack. In our plans, part of the music will be traditionally written by humans (that's to say, by us), while for the sound landscape we want to rely on the sonification of scientific data coming from molecular simulations and quantum calculations of the electronic structure of atoms. In this way, the experience of the microworld will be as immersive as possible.\nHere you can listen to Maxwell's Daemons original song!\n-Hey, we know you feel it / we're all around you but you're never gonna see it / we feed on light / we feed on feelings / we have no shape, we need no gravity to deal with / we / we got the morning / we got the moon, we got the stars, we got them burning / we disappear in femtoseconds / we hide behind your eyes and soon you'll realize we're Maxwell's Daemons in disguise\nThe money coming from this crowdfunding will be used mainly as economic support for the team, and in particular to cover part of the living expenses during the development of the project. We are also going to hire an Unreal Engine expert to support us and speed-up the delivery of the game, which we expect to be around Christmas 2021.\nWe choose Kickstarter, as what we care most about is our creative freedom! Thanks to your support we can develop the game without any industry or business constraint, just knowing that you like our project the way we are envisioning it.\nApart from what is central to all videogames - story, level maps, player character, and weapons design - we have a number of peculiar challenges to tackle! \nAs the player will be supported throughout the game by a smart AI guide, to help him getting oriented in the microscopic world, and to give hints on how to face enemies, we are going to write an engaging and at times funny - in the sense of nerdy, dark humour - script for this character, elaborating on the many fascinating scientific concepts underlying the story.\n\n      We have already developed some advanced tools for efficiently turning molecular structures into actors of the game, with which we have created five non-player characters to date. We are planning to add at least five more molecular creatures and various nanotechnological devices. We would like to create a zoo of this creatures, however this strongly depends on the final outcome of the campaign.\n\n      We want the \u201cwalk around and behold\u201d part to be important, while keeping the player engaged and focused on the mission. In this sense, level design is crucial for the game experience, and we plan to be supported by an experienced developer.\nFear the water golem!\nThe design of the visual apparatus of the player character is still in a very early stage. The viewer will display an interface showing some relevant data and statistics on screen, both concerning the gameplay and scientific details of the outside world, such as chemical identity of what is seen, temperature, aggregation states etc. We plan to develop at least three rendering options, with different colors and different aspects being highlighted, depending on what is most relevant to the mission from time to time (monsters detection, the individuation of chemical elements via the color scheme, temperature, etc...). This is the reason why you see various graphical styles in the videos we linked.\nFinally, we are already working on the musical score and on sound effects, with a number of tracks already completed. However our idea of the soundscape of Maxwell\u2019s Daemons' world is ambitious, and we want to give a great deal of time and attention to this part.\nThe Boltzbrains team consists of three computational Physical Chemistry researchers embarking on a new and exciting adventure!\nIn our academic life we deal with the secret life of atoms and molecules, in a strange world where there is no gravity, and things jiggle, rock and roll at incredible speed. A world where light comes as a storm of energy grains and many phenomena are under the weird spells of quantum mechanics. After exploring for years the microscopic labyrinths of porous crystals, the mesmerizing patterns of cellular automata, the uncharted cliffs and valleys of molecular energy landscapes, we realised how unfair it is that almost nobody outside of research laboratories knows of the beauty of the microscopic world. This is why we decided to bring it to you, as a virtual place to live and explore\u2026and videogames turn out to be the perfect medium!\nWe all studied Physical Chemistry in Sassari, a quiet town not far from the sea in Northwestern Sardinia, an island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. We were all in love with the idea of becoming scientists since our childhood, and our curricula are in line with this. We are three friends, and shared the same small office at Sassari University for some ten years. Andrea and Alberto worked on similar research projects for their master\u2019s degree, with the help of Federico, who was already undertaking his PhD studies at the time.\nMany find it hard to acquaint themselves with so-called hard-sciences (math, physics and chemistry), and, even worse, they feel these are only technical and dry fields of study. Naturally we believe in the opposite, and the only reason for this is a communication problem at some level, so we\u2019d like to build a bridge. While there are many excellent pop-science books on these topics, and even games, we feel that none of these fully convey the feeling of wonder that a first person experience of the vast realms unfolded by modern science could give. This is why we are working on our first videogame, where you can go for a walk after shrinking your size to one billionth of a metre.\n>Download press kit<", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter many years as computational physical chemistry researchers, Boltzbrains is a brand-new experience for us, and Maxwell's Daemons is our first videogame. However, we are strongly motivated, and we are used to addressing novel and challenging tasks, given our previous working experience in a field requiring strong programming as well as logico-mathematical skills. We are aware that doing research and making videogames are quite different beasts, and success cannot be taken for granted.

And, when we need something to squeeze, we give one of them a squish.  \nEach RPG Squeeze is a blind-box, so you don't know what you are getting! However, as a Kickstarter backer, you will get the chance to pick which monster you want, but the color will still be a surprise! \n\nAll of the pins available as add-ons are new pins, not currently available in our store. As a Kickstarter backer, you save $4 off the normal $12 retail price.  If you want to include add-ons in your pledge, simply add additional funds to your pledge level. As an example, if you pledged for the 5 Pack ($55) and you decided you wanted 2 pins, you would increase your pledge $16 for a total pledge of $71.\n\nBlind-box is a fun way to get a surprise each time you open a toy. Inside each of our boxes is one amazing RPG Squeeze, and if you're lucky, you may even get one of the rare chase variants limited to only 1 in every 25!  \nPart of the magic is opening up the box and being surprised with what's inside. But we know not everyone likes leaving things to chance. So, you will have a couple of options. You can pick Series 1 or Series 2 for each of the squishies you buy. For Series 2, you can choose to pick if you want an Eyegor, Gelatinous Cube, or Mimic. Sheer luck will determine the colors you get.  \nPLAY\n\nWhat? You missed out on Series 1: Eyegor Edition. Do not fret. Now is your chance to get them at these Kickstarter prices... that's right you can just add them to your order.  \nHere's an example of how this works: Ruby wants to get 9 squishies, so she picks the $99 tier of Nine all the Time. Once this is all wrapped up and she is filling out her survey, she will get to mix & match how many she wants from each of the RPG Squeezes series.  \nCome talk squishy goodness over on our Discord here! \nPLAY\n\nHey everyone, I'm Brian Colin, founder of Creature Curation and illustrator of the cartoony dungeon crawl critters that are taking form in adorable RPG Squeezes. I first illustrated these classic monsters with a softer cartoony feel, hoping my kids would latch on to the beasts I adore. They have been a hit at conventions as pins, patches, and now as a way to squish away your stress. My entire family loves them, and I'm sure you will too.  \nBased on previous experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter wraps up, based on the actual costs incurred to ship.

Hi, my name is Harald Geisler, I am a Typographer and Artist. With the 2020 Font Collection, I like to share with you my experimental designs about reading and writing for this season.\nI like to think about fonts like fashion. The way one dresses written language can be a personal statement. Think about how you dress up going to a party or when you're going to a first date. In the same way, you choose a font when you write a love letter and a different one when you invite your friends to a rad house party.\nThe struggle with new. Today I find that most \"new\" fonts are historical revivals honoring the past, for example, the x-th resurrection and hommage to a classic. \nMost of the time classics like Helvetica itself were revolutionary at their time. To stay in the image of clothing: if you pull it off right it can be fun to show off at the party in a 1950s suit. But what is the fitting font for your words this coming season?\nFashion x Fonts. This collection is about exploring possible futures of type design. And I would like this exploration to be fun. The designs of the 2020 Font collection are experimental, fun, pushing writing and readability to its limits.\n\"Of what use is readability if there is nothing to excite us to take notice of a text?\" (W. Weingart 1973)\nAs an artist, my work often starts with a daydream, in the 2020 font collection I like to work on 5 of these dreams:\n1. A font is a portrait of a person\n2. Sigmund Freud's handwriting has a nightmare\n3. Questioning the way we write with our hands\n4. A Miles Davis melody and Andy Warhol philosophy become a font\n5. Imagine your personal neutral font\n Can a font be a portrait of a person? Dimanche is Sunday in French. The idea for this font came from getting to know a Japanese dancer who worked in France. We met a couple of times and what remained was a lot of fun memories about movement and the wish to capture this unique character in the design of a typeface. It started with the idea of writing an M that would whimsically bend towards the end, seeing that made me smile and remember. Just like a portrait makes you think of a person, the font makes me think of this encounter. And I like to imagine that each letter carries some of that character and unique movement. The variations of each letter come from the same inspiration. Can you spot all the letter variations in the image? \nDo fonts dream? In 2013 I created a font that renders Sigmund Freud's handwriting here on \u2192Kickstarter. I spend two weeks at the Sigmund Freud Archive in Vienna to analyze the handwriting of the inventor of psychoanalysis. When it comes to creating a handwriting font it is all about understanding the character and patterns of a writer's movement. Now I like to create a dreamlike variation based on the character, movement, and patterns of Prof. Freud's hand. \n In cursive, all lowercase letters connect. What if\u2026 we'd live in a world where all words start with a lower case letter, followed by uppercase letters that are connected. The design explores how to transform the writing-movement for uppercase letters to write a seamless uppercase cursive. Here an early scene from the sketchbook:\nImagine Warhol and Davis had a font. \"So What\" is inspired by a trick from Andy Warhol and a song from Miles Davis. To create the font I locked myself in the studio listening to Davis' \"So What\" on repeat for 8 hours. What emerged was a concept for a font drawn in four angles, 8 variations, and an algo-rhythm programmed into the font that exchanges the letters as you type, creating a unique pattern for every word you type. Here are some scenes from the sketchbook: \nWarhol's trick goes like this:\nSometimes people let the same problem make them miserable for years when they could just say: So what.\n\u201cMy mother didn't love me.\" So what. \u201cMy husband won't ball me.\u201d So what. \u201cI\u2019m a success but I'm still alone.\" So what.\nI don't know how I made it through all the years before I learned how to do that trick. It took a long time for me to learn it, but once you do, you never forget.\nAndy Warhol,  \u2192The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, 1975\nStretchgoal:\nif the campaign reaches 5050, I will add one more font to the 2020 collection. \nI already used this uppercase typeface for my own T-Shirts, Posters, and Editorial design. And it has beautiful numbers:\n\u2192Status of the fonts\nSome of the fonts are already in use, some are close to finished, others are still on the drawing board. The delivery of the font collection is planned for September 2020. You will receive instructions and a link to download the fonts.\n\u2192Font Guide\nYou're new to the world of fonts and this is the first time you're buying a Font? This is going to be exciting! With the font-collection comes a helpful font guide covering the first steps to get you started. And if you have font questions along the way, I am happy to help you in person through Kickstarter or email. This is going to be fun!\nIf you like to try out installing a handwriting font, you can download the \u2192Martin Luther King handwriting font from my website for free. It includes detailed instructions on how to install and use fonts on your computer (PC, Windows, Mac, Linux) or mobile device (iPhone/iPad, Android).\n\u2192Technical Details\nAll fonts of the 2020 collection will be delivered in OpenType format with PostScript outlines. This format is a standard and widely supported by all common operating systems like PC, Mac, Linux, iOS (iPhone or iPad), Android etc. \nLanguage support \u2022 Every language has specific needs, for example in German two dots are placed over vowels (\u00e4,\u00f6,\u00fc) to indicate a modification. The Fonts of the 2020 collection are experimental fonts, which for example can mean that a font may only have uppercase letters. However, it is very important for me to support as many languages as possible \u2014 for example when you are from Denmark and like to write K\u00f8benhavn (Copenhagen). Now if the font does not support the letter \u00f8 it can not be used for that, which would be sad. So I try to support as many languages as possible.\nAll fonts are licensed for private (non-commercial) use.\nCommercial use: If you are planning to use the font commercially, for example in your design work or in any context that you could describe with \"at work\" or involves you doing something that you receive money for\u2026 please pledge for the commercial license.

I couldn't take pictures of them or catch any of them so I thought a good way to remember them would be to make sculptures of them.\nNow I want to share with you some of these monsters and do it in a different and fun format, the FANTASY KEYCAPS.\nIf you like my work you can help me so that the beings I knew do not fall into oblivion, I promise to use all my effort to create sculptures that are at the height of the monsters they represent.\nThe keycaps are the first but with your support I intend to continue creating new product lines and later on to be able to acquire the necessary material to be able to physically produce them as well.\nThe Fantasy Keycaps is a collection of 12 pieces organized in 3 themes; aliens, devils and zombies.\nIt is a downloadable digital files project for 3d home printers. They will be supplied through dropbox, (it will only be necessary an email address to access the download) they are not physical sculptures. As it is a digital file, no returns will be accepted.\nAcquiring the download of the files gives you the right to print them as many times as you want but you cannot make copies to sell them or take out molds to make copies and sell them, they are for personal, non-commercial use.\nAll keycaps have been printed on an anycubic SLA printer and tested on a keyboard to verify their operation.\nThe original size is one key size for a standard \u201ccherry\u201d type mechanical keyboard but the pieces are designed to work in larger scale sizes and can be used as decorative or artistic pieces.\n\n\nThe reward for the financing of 10 euros includes the following group of 4 keycpas.\nThe reward for the financing of 25 euros includes the 12 pieces from the three collections.\nHere you can see the result of the keycaps once printed and placed on the keyboard.\nThe pieces can be painted but they work perfectly without doing it, simply using the base color of any resin.\nUse your imagination, print them in different sizes and colors, surely you can find them a place or a custom use.\nSTRETCH GOALD\nIf the kicstarter manages to reach 3000 funding, all who have supported with the funding of 25 will receive an extra keycap, a monster designed for a new collection.\nHere you can see which one it is.\nPLAY\n\n\n UPDATES \nI have received many positive comments about the artistic design of the keycaps but some of these comments came from people who did not have a mechanical keyboard and despite being enchanted by the monsters they could not find a use that convinced them. I had contributed some ideas of different uses but perhaps it was not enough, so now I have decided to go further.\nI have created a box in the style of the keycaps where you can save what you want, the keycpas that you do not use, the pieces of your games, jewelry ... it depends on you and the size at which you decided to print the MonsterBOX. You can use the keycpas to complete your decoration or simply stick a poster with the message you want or with the cover of your favorite board game.\nIn addition, the download of the MonsterBOX file will be free for all those who choose the option of 25 euros with the only condition that the kickstarter get the financing.\nI hope you like it. \n UPDATES 2 \nHi everyone, thanks for the support and for staying there.\nIt seems that the keycaps are having a lot of success among people who are fond of miniature painting and in some cases they won't even use my monsters to put them on the keyboard, this seems sensational to me.\nSo I've been looking for a way that keycaps can be exposed, I've tried various options with very baroque frames but the monsters already had a lot of detail and it didn't look good so I decided to make it functional and simple.\nIt is a simple base that can be hung directly on the wall or placed inside a frame. This base has connections to fit the keycaps.\nIn addition, if you do not want to hang, I have added a support on the back so that it can be supported on its own, so you can put it where you want. With the rear support in place the base remains with a certain degree of inclination, this will improve its stability.\nObviously if someone wants to expand the scale they must do it in all the pieces equally because otherwise the connections would stop working.\nThis piece will be free for all those who chose the option of supporting with 25.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough there are many people who have a printer at home, I do not know how many of them may be interested in a product as specific as keycpas.\nIn order that more people could be attracted I have studied the design of the figures a lot so that it can be printed at larger sizes and I have contributed some ideas in this kickstarter of some uses that could be given to them.

One thing that makes us geeks is obsession and passion for details -- for systems, for stories and for genius. We are compelled to solve these puzzles and to explore these worlds. If you know what I mean, I think you have a sense of what this movie is about.\u201d \nPhilip Shane, Director\nRand and Robyn Miller Photo credit: Adventure Gamers\nIn 1993, brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, living in a double-wide trailer on the edge of a forest outside Spokane, Washington -- a.k.a., the middle of nowhere -- changed the home computer industry forever with the launch of MYST, a single-perspective exploration game that had no score, no violence and no set goal other than satisfying pure curiosity. In a world of flashy, shoot-\u2018em-up, beat-the-clock video game challenges, MYST quietly became the best-selling game of the 1990s.\nMore than a quarter century later, director Philip Shane is making a documentary film about the lives of the famous brothers as they continue to expand the world of MYST and other video gaming projects. He will also demonstrate how the story of MYST is part of a growing continuum of unsung electronics visionaries who constantly push the envelope of what gaming means. For every new level of innovation created, the next generation carries the torch to build newer, higher levels over the decades.\nPhilip Shane\nThrough extensive interviews with Rand and Robyn, along with several other gaming and computing luminaries, THE MYST DOCUMENTARY will tell the unlikely story of two brothers with disparate talents and interests, who were able to form a partnership that would revolutionize the way video games are consumed by the public. With few other gaming pioneers to use for inspiration, the Miller brothers were able to break new ground by writing an original script from scratch, creating an entirely new virtual digital environment long before the internet arose, composing an atmospheric musical score, and even recording and acting in short videos via their company, Cyan Worlds. In the following years, Cyan released several sequels, including RIVEN and URU, bringing new sophistication to the MYST universe, while Robyn has branched out with his own separate gaming pursuits.\nMYST Creator Robyn Miller with Philip Shane, Documentary Filmmaker\nTo date, Philip has completed some interviews and preliminary filming of the Miller brothers and others who helped bring the MYST saga to life. But the MYST DOCUMENTARY project still needs YOUR help to bring this story to life on screen.\nPhilip has determined that additional and substantial funding is needed to complete the primary filming required before it can be turned into a concise, entertaining cinematic story. For the next few years, Philip wants to capture the creative processes of these gaming masters and their collaborators. In addition, the filmmakers need to delve into archival materials \u2013 videos, articles, photos, early computer programs and hardware, radio interviews, etc. \u2013 to help flesh out the details of the exciting MYST story. These efforts will be funded by your pledges!\nCurrently in the \u201cpre-production\u201d phase, Philip plans to continue interviewing Robyn, Rand, and the rest of the team at Cyan, as well as many other luminaries in the gaming and computing world. He wants to use every available item -- props, early videos, computer hardware, original sketches -- from every Cyan project to describe their journey.\nWorking with cinematographer Kyle Kelly, Philip also wants to develop a cinematic style that is different from the traditional \u201ctalking heads\u201d doc. The finished product will be more in the spirit of the MYST game itself, shown in very-high-resolution to thrill not only those familiar with the game but newcomers as well. The goal is to recreate what it feels like to wander the different island worlds in an epic journey, using a visual language to convey complicated, abstract concepts.\nPhilip will also expand his focus to include  computer history museums, where he will locate old hardware and marketing materials, but most importantly the people who were there during the MYST journey -- the collectors, devoted archivists and historians who can recount each stage of the Miller Brothers\u2019 story. Much like the original Route 66 of the American Southwest, the traces of MYST\u2019s path are all there -- they just need to be connected in a visually exciting way.\nThe actual filming process for the documentary will follow two distinct timelines:\n The Origin Story: A reliving and retelling of the history of making MYST and RIVEN through interviews and archival videos, presented through stylized visualization in an abstract and atmospheric way. The film will visit locations of the Miller family\u2019s origins, such as Philadelphia, Hawaii and Haiti, as well as Los Alamos and Albuquerque, N.M., where Rand met his mentor, who first gave him access to a computer lab.\n   The Present Eras: Filming at Cyan in Spokane and other locations where new games are being created, as well as Silicon Valley, to meet those involved in the development of Apple\u2019s Mac home computer, and other places where new technology is being tested.\n  After filming, the editing process will begin to weave this incredibly diverse, complex and massive amount of material into a riveting narrative. On top of that, an original score and sound design will tie the elements together into an adventurous journey bringing the brothers from that double-wide trailer on the outskirts of Spokane to the dizzying, high-tech world of Silicon Valley, another island full of wonder and mysteries.\nFrom the launch of this Kickstarter, Philip expects the final print to be ready by the end of  2022.\nHere\u2019s where YOUR participation is especially important. We\u2019re excited to offer many cool rewards for fans of MYST, grouped into several \u201ctiers\u201d and named after our favorite iconic spots in MYST.

MYST, he said, is to video games what Star Wars was for movies. \u201cI had never seen anything like it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just completely swept me away into a whole new universe.\u201d He wanted to explore those MYST worlds, or \u201cAges,\u201d but also wanted to find out how they were made.\nPhilip has had the great fortune to work on many documentaries over the past 30 years, and had always been \u201cfascinated by creators.\u201d Twenty years later, he got a chance to talk to Rand and Robyn Miller, the creators of MYST, in 2016. \u201cThese are sweet, genuine, down-to-earth guys,\u201d he said.\nWhen he asked them whether anyone made a documentary about their story, they said no, and were \u201calmost confused by the whole idea.\u201d Immediately, they told Philip yes, they\u2019d be happy to take part, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re interested in this, but we\u2019ve just finished a game, we\u2019re about to release it and we are beginning our next project that\u2019s totally top secret. Are you interested in following that?\u201d Awestruck by their generous query, Philip responded, \u201cAre you kidding??\u201d \nIn making documentaries, Philip\u2019s goals are always to help people appreciate a group of people who did something extraordinary that most people don\u2019t know much about. The Millers\u2019 lives were completely transformed by this work of art called MYST that they poured their heart into. Most people don\u2019t even know who they are, and now Philip wants to bring you in to meet them. But there were other people -- those who made the MacIntosh and the HyperCards that were all essential to the creation of MYST. He wants to introduce you to these people to see how they all fit together to build the MYST universe.\nAs a result, Philip wants to tell the story of these two brothers, living at the time in a double-wide trailer in the woods of Spokane, who, with the help of their friends and colleagues, made the most popular video game in the world.\n\u201cThese were two guys as far from the world of technology as you could get, with very limited means and experience,\u201d Philip said. \u201cAnd one day ended up on the stage with Steve Jobs.\u201d\nPlease join us to help make sure Philip has the resources to complete this ambitious project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDocumentary filmmaking is a challenging and time-consuming process. Additional interviews might be required, along with the purchasing of archival footage and music rights, which may take longer and cost more than foreseen.

One of the world's leading galleries in the realm where Symbolist Art, Expressionist Art, and Art Nouveau overlap, Century Guild exhibits important artifacts from 1880-1920 and rare works on paper by early 20th century artists including Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Felicien Rops, Egon Schiele, and Alphonse Mucha.   \nThis month, Kickstarter has launched an exciting initiative titled \"Signs of Change\" in which creators use printed materials to promote ideas as community activism.\nAs archivists, publishers, and exhibitors of art from politically-charged eras, it is impossible to ignore the fact that we are living in a time period that will be studied by historians for generations to come. The historical parallels to our current era are a frequently discussed topic, and the common thread that we can all agree upon is the importance of preserving our Democracy - and the necessity of casting your vote at the ballot box this November.\nThe Poster\nAn uplifting, psychedelic design by Thomas Negovan that features a symbol of positive change: an Art Nouveau-inspired butterfly bearing the message Make the Change - Vote. The reverse features a list of voter resources from two national, non-partisan, non-profit organizations dedicated to helping all Americans exercise their right to vote.\nThe front of the poster features a psychedelic, Art Nouveau-inspired butterfly as a symbol of positive transformation with the message \"Make the Change - Vote.\"\nThe back of the poster presents a voting checklist with non-partisan/non-profit voter resources.\nMAKE THE CHANGE Window Poster\nlarge 12\" x 13\" size\ndouble-sided with butterfly design and list of voter resources\nglossy finish on sturdy card stock\nhigh quality offset printing\nDISTRIBUTE POSTERS RESPONSIBLY\nIt is vitally important to wear a mask and maintain social distancing protocols when posting and distributing signs in your area! \nVoter resource information\nThe information shared on the back of this poster was sourced from non-partisan national non-profit organizations; the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a member of the Election Protection coalition which runs the Election Protection Hotline 866-OUR-VOTE, and Vote.org. Century Guild is not professionally affiliated with these organizations, however we strongly believe in their cause and support their mission. \n About us \nSince 1999, The Century Guild Museum of Art has been devoted to exhibiting and documenting important artworks that define the origins of popular culture.  by Thomas Negovan, Century Guild has presented Art Nouveau and Symbolist Art in both their Chicago (1999-2013) and Los Angeles (2012-2018) galleries, as well as in numerous international art and antiques fairs across the last two decades- including fourteen years as a major presence at San Diego Comic Con International. Works previously in the Century Guild collection are on permanent display in a number of important institutions, including The Art Institute of Chicago, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Detroit Institute of Art and have been exhibited at The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Minneapolis Museum of Art, and The Art Gallery of Ontario.

That's my goal with the Retro Tea Break series, and within this book I hope to capture and share these fantastic memories and experiences with you all.\nThe first volume is completely written and ready for publication. The goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to raise the minimum amount needed to publish the book and put it in your hands \u2013 and there are some exciting extras too!   \nDigital impression (final product may vary slightly)\nComplementing the popular series of the same name on my YouTube channel,  I've carefully selected my favourite interviews to-date to be printed in a beautiful hardback book with a textured, foil-embossed cover, quality paper stock and premium finishing touches, including coloured head and tail bands in the spine of the book.  \nThe final book will have a head and tail band woven into the spine\nIn the book I introduce each guest and transcribe a conversation with them, exploring their life in the video game industry.\nThis volume includes 12 very special conversations with: \n The Oliver Twins (British 8-bit pioneers)\n Al Lowe (Sierra, Video Game Developer)\n George 'The Fat Man' Sanger (Composer, Freelance/Lucas Arts)\n Bill Volk (Developer, Activision/Avalon Hill)\n Francois Lionet (Developer, STOS/AMOS)\n Rob Hubbard (Composer, C64 Maestro/Electronic Arts)\n Stoo Cambridge (Artist, Sensible Software)\n Jon St. John (Voice Over Artist, Duke Nukem 3D)\n Mike Dailly (DMA, Grand Theft Auto/Lemmings)\n David Fox  (Developer, Lucas Arts)\nAnd \u2013 exclusive to the book \u2013 two new interviews with Chris Sawyer (Transport Tycoon, RollerCoaster Tycoon) and Ken Silverman (Build engine). \nI've worked with each guest to elaborate on their RMC channel interviews with footnotes and box-outs that further discuss points in more detail. I've also worked with a professional editor to present the interviews in a format that is enjoyable to read without removing the personality of each guest in the text, and the book features a glossy, full-colour centre section with photos provided by guests giving further insight into their time in the industry.\nThe result is a high-quality book that is designed to look great on the shelf but, more importantly, put in your bag and enjoyed on the go. This is not an unwieldy coffee-table book, but a handy reference packed full of first-hand experiences as told by the coders, artists, musicians and engineers who created the worlds we love.  \nDigital impression (final product may vary slightly).\nThe pixelated cherry on top is artwork by guest Stoo Cambridge of Sensible Software fame (Cannon Fodder, Sensible Soccer). I've commissioned him to draw portraits of each guest in his unique pixel-art style. They appear in each chapter of the book in greyscale, but will also be available in full colour as Tea Break collector's cards if you choose to buy the special set  available as a Kickstarter tier.  \nA pack of 12 Trading Cards illustrated by Stoo Cambridge\nAnd if you'd like to enjoy your own tea break while reading it, then why not pick up a limited edition 11oz mug with our guest portraits wrapped around it, hand pressed by Neil.    \nA closer look at the book and the mug! (design wraps around entire mug)\nAnd finally, for a limited number of backers,you can commission your very own Tea Break collector's card, drawn by Stoo Cambridge. You will receive five prints of your custom card and a digital file containing the portrait. It can be of you or a loved one you'd like to gift this unique reward to \u2013 just like this example featuring a picture of me!    \nA custom collector's card example.\nWe did it! We funded the production of the book! Thank you so much.  I've had a chat with the printers to come up with some goals to make it even better for you, so here are the stretch goals.\nIf we hit goal #1 I will add an as yet unseen interview with Mark Ferrari, formerly of Lucasfilm Games.  \nMark has a fascinating story to tell about his time creating art for such games as The Secret of Monkey Island and Loom. Tales from Skywalker Ranch, a near death incident and a life filled with adventure and good fortune can  be expected.  And yes, I did ask him about Loom(tm).\nIf we hit goal #2 a high quality ribbon bookmark will be stitched into the book at the printing press. Never lose your page again! I think this will really add to the overall quality of the production.\nI'd love to see us stretch to this goal. If we hit it I will design a timeline of key releases our guests have been responsible for. \nThis will be a full colour, double page fold out section (so twice the width of the book once unfolded). This will really help to see where the threads of the many stories come together, especially on those releases where multiple guests worked on the same titles.\nIf we stretch to this goal then I will take on the mammoth task of editing our interview with Richard Garriott into an additional, final chapter. \nRichard is a pioneering game developer who created the Ultima series, rode a rocket into space, visited the Titanic and so much more as a result of his success in the industry. This will be a huge and fitting finale for the first Retro Tea Breaks book if we can make it happen.\nAnd who knows, if Retro Tea Breaks Vol.1 is a success, maybe we can go on to create a whole series of future volumes that can take pride of place on your bookshelf and continue to document the lives of these historic figures while they are still available to share their stories with us.\nThank you for your help in making the publication of this book a reality.\nNeil - RMC   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk is minimal as the book has been written in full before starting this campaign.

Read them in a tufted armchair, by candlelight, in a British accent, while angels are singing.\nSince then, we\u2019ve published more anniversary editions, including Mistborn, The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages, and Warbreaker.\nWe\u2019ve been able to release these books thanks to readers like you who believe in the stories I tell. So let me take a moment to say thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for loving these characters and worlds as much as I do. I love telling stories, and you are the reason I can continue to do that.\nUPDATE: Wow! My team and I are floored and humbled by the response to the campaign. Thank you for your trust. Thank you for your patience as we will be putting everything together over the next several months to send out to you. And just overall, thank you for making this possible.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve offered the anniversary editions by themselves for reasonable prices. The Way of Kings is so large, however, that we needed to split it into two volumes to maintain the quality and integrity of the physical books. This results in a set that costs more to produce, therefore it also retails for more. We recognize this is your hard-earned money, so we've turned to Kickstarter as a way to:\n1) Give you more bang for your buck.\n2) Bring the excitement of a book release party home to you.\nBook release parties sometimes offer attendees goodie bags full of extra swag. In this case, the more people who back the Kickstarter release, the more swag we\u2019re going to put into your goodie bags, so to speak, mostly in the form of stretch goal rewards, which we'll discuss further down.\nNow, without further ado, I\u2019d like to introduce the Dragonsteel Tenth Anniversary Leather Edition of The Way of Kings.\nPlease note that this is a mockup. The actual product will look slightly different. For example, now that we have the leather from the bindery, it is a slightly darker blue than is portrayed here.\nEach volume is bound in dark blue bonded leather with a hubbed spine and foil stamping in two colors (gold and blue) on front, back, and spine. The interior pages are acid-neutral, Smyth-sewn into the binding instead of only glued, and are printed in two colors: black and blue. It comes in two volumes\u2014the first of which is signed.\nUnbound sample of the signature page in The Way of Kings, Volume I.\n\nThe page ends are gilded, each volume has a satin-ribbon bookmark, and the full-color endpapers present art by Michael Whelan, Howard Lyon, and Isaac Stewart. \nFront endpaper by Michael Whelan.\nBack endpaper by Howard Lyon.\nEach volume begins with an 8-page gallery of full-color artwork, including cover illustrations from around the world, commissioned pieces, and top-notch fan art.\nGallery illustrations. French covers by Alain Brion. Dalinar by Randy Vargas. Taravangian by Tara Spruit.\nIn addition to 2-color versions of all of the original interior maps and art, there are a few new 2-color pieces by Ben McSweeney and K\u00e4ri Christensen, and I want to make particular note of five new end-of-part illustrations by the talented Steve Argyle.\nEnd of Part illustration by Steve Argyle.\nTwo-color map of Roshar by Isaac Stewart.\nSpread across the two volumes are seven new full-color interior pieces by Miranda Meeks, Dan dos Santos, Micah Epstein, Audrey Hotte, Bryan Mark Taylor, and Steve Argyle. \nTwo of the new full-color illustrations. Left by Dan dos Santos. Right by Steve Argyle.\nAdditionally, Jian Guo has created stunning reimagined versions of the chapter arches. \nNew chapter arches by Jian Guo.\nWe are committed to beautiful books, and we've elevated the quality even more with this edition. When you see the final version of the book, we hope you'll agree that it's the finest book Dragonsteel has produced so far.\nI recognize that many of you are perfectly happy with your existing copies of The Way of Kings, in whichever format you prefer. With this in mind, we've created six pledge tiers so you can get involved with the campaign at whatever tier you're most comfortable with. We'll use BackerKit to facilitate add-ons, which will further the customizability of your pledge, allowing you to buy some of the rewards \u00e0 la carte once the campaign is over. Even pledging $1 to the \"make a pledge without a reward\" tier will allow access to the add-on store. More on this later. Here's an overview of the pledge tiers with explanations for the different rewards further down.\nUpdate: We are sold out of all leatherbound books that will arrive (hopefully) by the holidays 2020. We have opened up new tiers that will continue to offer the leatherbound books, but the books won't arrive until sometime in 2021. These books slated for 2021 will still be signed and will also be part of the first printing.\nImages are mockups, not actual photographs. Designs are not final.\nSince the books, the posters, and the other goodies are various sizes and will arrive from the manufacturers at different times, you will be charged shipping for each package we send out, depending on which tier you pledge to. For more information, there's a handy shipping chart in the shipping section further down.\nTo save on shipping (particularly overseas) some of you asked for a tier that has no physical rewards besides the leatherbound. We gave this some thought and don't feel that discounting the leatherbound is fair to those buying it in the other tiers\u2014plus, the amount of work and effort we've put into this has pushed the margins pretty tight\u2014but we think we've found a balance. You can either opt for physical rewards in Tier 4, or you can can opt for none of them in Tier 3, and in exchange we've added this reward to Tier 3: a $10 digital gift card to our store. If shipping is an issue, you can buy digital copies of some of my novellas there\u2014or you can save up for a physical item you want, when you want it.\nYou'll notice that Tiers 3, 4, 5, and 6 have a limited number of backers available. If we sell out of these, we might open up new tiers, but be aware that the leatherbound books in these new tiers won't ship until sometime in 2021, though these books will still be considered part of the first printing of this edition. If we do open new tiers, we will only be able to do it once for Tier 6, capping the signed and numbered copies to just less than 2000 copies total.\nMockup of the 23.75\" x 35.75\" Bridge Four, movie-style poster.\nEven without the stretch goal rewards, each pledge tier comes with the bonus of a Bridge Four movie-style poster\u2014by the amazing Zack Stella\u2014in either digital or physical format. Pledge Tiers 1 and 3 come with 1920 x 1080 and 1080 x 1920 digital wallpapers based on the Bridge Four poster, and Pledge Tiers 2, 4, 5, & 6 each come with a physical 23.75\" x 35.75\" Bridge Four poster\u2014rolled, not folded.\nThis is a mockup, not an actual photograph. Design is not final.\nI'm working on a new Stormlight novella in the vein of Edgedancer, a story about Lift that bridges the gap between Words of Radiance and Oathbringer. The new Stormlight novella will focus on Rysn and will be available as an e-book in all tiers, or in both physical and digital formats in Tiers 2, 5, and 6.\nMockup of The Way of Kings Prime hardcover and e-book. Design not final.\nI understand these are hard times and not everyone has the funds for The Way of Kings leatherbound, so I decided to take something originally planned as a stretch goal reward and give it away for free on my website in e-book and PDF forms.\nThe Way of Kings Prime was written in 2002 and is basically an alternate version of The Way of Kings, which was published by Tor Books in 2010. The Way of Kings Prime is very different from the published book. Think of it as set in a different universe with a completely different plot. If you haven't read the 2010 canonical version, please read that one first.\nThe Way of Kings Prime is what we're calling a Sanderson Curiosity. A hardcover version of it is included in Pledge Tiers 5 and 6, or as an add-on for backers of the campaign. We can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ll ever reprint it once the campaign is over.\nAfter you back the campaign, and before we fulfill your pledge when the campaign is over, we will give you the opportunity to pick an Order from among the ten Orders of Knights Radiant. If Order-specific stretch goal rewards are unlocked\u2014and you choose Pledge Tiers 2, 4, or 5\u2014those rewards will be themed to your chosen Order. (Read further down for more about the stretch goal rewards.)\nFor example, if you pledge $200 for The Way of Kings leatherbound and choose Windrunner as your Order, all five Order-specific stretch goals (sticker sheet, patch, art print, pin, and challenge coin) will be themed toward that Order, using its unique glyph and color scheme.\nNot sure which Order of Knights Radiant to choose? Take the Official Knights Radiant Order Quiz. Or if you\u2019d prefer, you can read about each Order and make a decision based on that. We\u2019ve worked hard to give each Order its own visual identity, so when in doubt, pick your favorite symbol or color scheme.\nWe have prepared ten stretch goal rewards as a way of telling our backers \u201cthank you.\" Each time we unlock one by meeting a certain amount of pledged money or backers, all pledge tiers will get more rewards in the digital art package, and Tiers 2, 4, 5, and 6 will receive more physical rewards. (The exceptions to this are the \"genuine leather\" and \"slipcase\" stretch goal rewards, which only apply to Pledge Tiers 3 through 6.) Thus, the bigger we make this release party, the more rewards the \u201cattendees\u201d get in their goodie bags!\nWe hope all of these will unlock during the course of the campaign, but if there's something you want here and are worried it might not unlock, you can check out the add-ons further down.\nImages are mockups, not actual photographs. Designs are not final.\nPlease note that while we'll carry The Way of Kings leatherbound in our online store after the Kickstarter, we can't guarantee that future printings will have the slipcase and the top-grain genuine leather (if unlocked). Future printings of the leatherbound sold through the online store will be sold separately from any of the stretch goal rewards available here.\nUPDATE: Two hours in and we have already unlocked all the planned stretch goals and reached 10,000 backers. Wow! THANK YOU! You all are the best! So, what's next? On the livestreams leading up to the campaign, we accidentally dreamed up the existence of Roshar's Chromatic Chicken Scouts. We reached 10,000 leatherbound books sold, so we will create another sticker pack, this time themed toward the Chromatic Chicken Scouts. It will match the style of the other sticker sheets, with Ben McSweeney drawing these up with a symbol and wordmark to represent these persistent patch-earners and brave badge-hounds. We can't guarantee that any of the stretch goals will be available in our store after the campaign.\nAnyone who pledges to any tier of the campaign\u2014even if it's only $1 to the \"make a pledge without a reward\" tier\u2014will have access to the add-on store through BackerKit once the campaign ends. These are items that you can purchase in addition to what you already receive with your pledge. For example, if you pledge to Tier 4 and the campaign ends without unlocking the playing cards, you will still be able to buy the playing cards for the add-on cost through BackerKit. If the campaign ends with the playing cards unlocked, you will get a copy of the playing cards with Tier 4, but you will also be able to buy additional copies of the playing cards (and anything else in the add-on store), if you would like.\nAnother example: Maybe you've pledged to Tier 4 for The Way of Kings leatherbound but also want goodies from a second Order without needing to buy a second copy of the leatherbound. We have the Order Pack add-on that allows you to buy the five Order-themed goodies in any Order of your choice at a discounted price from what we'll eventually sell it for in the online store. This, and any of the add-ons, can be purchased multiple times with a different Order of Knights Radiant chosen each time, but please note that some add-ons might have a limit on the quantity you can purchase.\nImages are mockups, not actual photographs. Designs are not final.\nWhile we hope many of these goodies will be sold later in our online store, we can't guarantee availability and pricing outside the campaign. The backer pin is exclusive to the Kickstarter and will only be available in conjunction with the campaign.\nWe love independent bookstores, so as part of the campaign, there will be a few limited vendors who will have copies of The Way of Kings leatherbound as well as some of the swag items. These bookstores include:\nSubterranean Press\nThe BYU Store\nMurder By the Book\nMysterious Galaxy\nPowell's Books\nBorderlands Books\nWe'll have more information about this after the campaign, but the books likely won't be available at these vendors until the holiday season.\nIf you're not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a platform that allows creators to crowdfund their creative projects. The campaign lasts several weeks, and when it\u2019s over, my team will go into full production and fulfillment mode. We will send out Kickstarter surveys, which will allow you to choose your Order of Knights Radiant\u2014if your pledge needs that information\u2014and also to give you the chance to give us your most up-to-date information so that your books and goodies arrive to the correct address in as timely a manner as possible.\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about how to make a pledge on Kickstarter, here's a short overview.\nAfter the campaign, your shipping will be calculated based on your pledge tier and shipping address. Some rewards will have to be shipped separately from others. For example, The Way of Kings leatherbound will be shipped directly from the bindery so that it doesn\u2019t have to come across the country to us before we then ship it back out to you. The rolled posters will be shipped separately in 24\u201d wide triangle boxes. Because of these realities and others, we unfortunately can\u2019t use a one-size-fits-all approach to shipping, therefore, rewards will be sent out in waves (more on that below), and shipping will be charged to you depending on how many packages you are receiving.\nReference the chart below to see how many packages and the total cost of shipping you can expect for each tier. Please note that the Total Shipping side of the chart is not the price per package, but represents the total you will pay for shipping and handling. For international orders, please note that your country might have additional customs fees. We do not collect those. Please check your local regulations for that information.\nWe welcome international orders! However, we unfortunately cannot ship everywhere. Currently these are the countries we can ship to:\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Estonia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greenland, Germany, Croatia, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Malta, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Slovenia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States, Hong Kong, Cyprus, and the European Union in general.\nShipping Update: Special Destinations\nSome of you have asked about specific countries that have been a bit harder for us to ship to in the past, and we've done some research into how to make those happen. We wish the shipping was cheaper, but to make sure we can get the items to you safely, we have to use a specific carrier that costs a bit more. This is also only available on the leatherbound books that will ship in 2021. We feel this is the best option right now, so we've added some destinations that require this special handling. These are:\nArgentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates.\nFor these destinations that require special handling, you will receive the same amount of packages listed under the International destinations in the shipping chart. Like we've mentioned for all destinations, if you do not want the poster, please pledge to our streamlined tier, Tier 3.\nIf your country is not listed, we apologize. It means we haven't been able to establish reliable delivery in that region yet.\nShipping Continued...\nThank you for your patience. We\u2019re learning a lot right now that will help us keep the number of packages and the shipping costs down if we decide to do future Kickstarters.\nWe hope to have most rewards fulfilled by the holidays 2020, but many things like the physical editions of the Stormlight Novella and The Way of Kings Prime will not be ordered from the printer until after the campaign is over and might not ship until early 2021. If we wind up opening extra leatherbound tiers, they will ship sometime in 2021 as well.\nWave 1\nWhen The Way of Kings leatherbound is finished, we will verify all backers\u2019 addresses\u2014including addresses outside of the United States\u2014and then provide this information to the bindery who will ship your books, shrinkwrapped and packaged in custom-fit boxes, directly to you.\nPosters will likely also be sent in this first wave of shipping, both to addresses inside and outside of the United States.\nWave 2\nMany of the stretch goal rewards and add-on items will be produced after the end of the Kickstarter. As soon as we have all of these rewards in-hand (except for the books), we will once again verify addresses before packaging up the rewards and sending them out to you, hopefully in one box of awesome happiness.\nIf your shipping address is outside of the United States, your goodies will be shipped in Wave 3, as described below, to save you on shipping costs.\nWave 3\nThe Way of Kings Prime and the Stormlight Novella are the items most likely to be shipped in this final wave. These will be fulfilled as soon as we get the books back from the printer, but not without once again verifying addresses. Please keep in mind that printing usually takes a few months, but in some cases can take much longer.\nIf you live outside of the United States and have chosen pledge tiers 2, 5, or 6, postage is more cost effective for you if we wait until the Stormlight Novella and The Way of Kings Prime are delivered to us so we can ship your books and goodies together. \nWe hope you will join us for the release of Rhythm of War\u2014the Stormlight Archive Book 4\u2014to be published by Tor Books on November 17, 2020. Find pre-order links here.\nI have the best fans in the world. You've proven that to me time and again as I get to meet and interact with you, so I can't say thank you enough. You are awesome, you are amazing, and you have incredible taste in books!\nYou've read this far, and because of that, I want to give you one last goodie just to say thank you. Life before death, Radiants!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve been producing our anniversary editions for several years now, and before that, we produced some of our own hardcovers, so we\u2019re experienced in the production of nice books and other goodies. Currently, most of the files are ready to send to the manufacturers, and some of the products are already in various levels of production. One of the biggest challenges will be getting everything produced or printed and delivered to you in a timely manner. Our printer, bindery, and other suppliers are all top notch, but producing quality books and products takes time, with quality assurance steps all along the way. We don\u2019t want to rush any of these steps because we want to send you the best products we can produce. In addition, as we\u2019ve seen from world events this year, there are sometimes things out of our control that affect more than just supply lines.

Story\nIn the spring and summer of 1989, the army entered Beijing and used live ammunition to suppress peaceful demonstrations by students and citizens. But through the actions of the government, the facts about the bloody massacre on June 4, 1989, and about the entire democratic movement in 1989, rapidly vanished, were distorted or inverted in contemporary Chinese history.\nIn Hong Kong this history has been preserved through candlelight, textbooks, memorials, and uninterrupted social movements. Over the past 31 years, however, freedom in Hong Kong has steadily crumbled, and the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement has come to exist only in name. Will we witness in our lifetime a second disappearance of Tiananmen Massacre history?\nCan we imagine a Victoria Park absent the candlelight of annual June 4 memorial vigils? Can we imagine history textbooks that make no mention at all of the Tiananmen Massacre? Can we imagine the June 4th Museum finally vanishing after being forced to move again and again?\nWitnesses to the 1989 democracy movement are now passing away, and others who experienced it have gone into exile. The blood stains of Tiananmen Square were cleaned, but there has still not been a reckoning with the truth. We cannot allow history yet again to disappear.\nThe vanishing of history is the beginning of its repetition.\n( Media Coverage: Nikkei Asia Review, New York Times, Stand News, Initium Media, NowNews, Apple Daily, HK01 )\nWhat Are We Going to Do?\nOur plan is to build a Tiananmen Massacre Memorial Museum on the Internet.\nSince its establishment in Hong Kong in 2012, the June 4th Museum has again and again suffered pressure and harassment. In Hong Kong, where freedom is deteriorating, the preservation of precious historical archives and relics faces many difficulties. The goal of this crowdfunding campaign is to build a permanent museum of human rights memory for the 1989 democratic movement.\nWith your help, we will accomplish these three things:\n1. Collect historical files and store them in digital form. We will collect archives and materials about the 1989 democratic movement that have over the past three decades been scattered in university libraries, government archives and personal collections around the world. These include historical documents and private materials, diaries, audio recordings, video footage and so on. We will preserve these files by producing digital copies, translating these into English, establishing an archive query system and finally building encrypted storage that will prevent anyone from tampering with history and eliminating memory.\n2. Rebuild the narrative with digital curation. We will organize an academic committee and curation advisory group to invite scholars, artists, and others to design online interactive exhibitions, restoring the \"June 4th Massacre\" to its context within the 1989 democracy movement, and returning \"1989\" to the fuller context of events in the 1980s -- in this way rebuilding the narrative and allowing June 4th to be defined and understood as being about resistance rather than just suppression. This process will allow the history of the 1989 democratic movement to better communicate with the broader history of the world and with social movements currently taking place.\n3.  Open source and shareable. The front-end design, basic functions, information structure, and technical framework of the Tiananmen Massacre Memorial Museum will all be offered as open source once the basic functions have been stabilized, with the hope that our interactive approach can be more easily applied to other online museum projects and other digital human rights museums.\nCrowdfunding Goals\nOur goal is to raise 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars. Over the next year, we will complete the collection of files and digitization of data, resolve the technical issues involved in permanent preservation, and finally build the Tiananmen Massacre Memorial Museum. At the same time, we will initiate research and exhibitions on a number of key topics.\nWe hope that everyone who has, like us, been impacted and changed by the Chinese democratic movement in 1989 and by the Tiananmen Massacre, can contribute in some way to this meaningful project. \nLet us preserve history in our hands.\nTruth never dies, nor will the candlelight be extinguished. We shall never surrender.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk for backers is low.

I am Chan Tze Woon, director of the film Yellowing. Teamed up with Peter Yam, the producer of Lost in the Fumes and Yellowing and Andrew Choi, the producer of Ten Years, we are working on a new film titled Blue Island, and we are crowdfunding the remaining capital to complete its production. We plan to premiere in early 2021 locally and abroad. We hope you would support this film that speaks to our times!\nIntroduction\nSince the 2014 Umbrella Movement, we decided to take records of Hong Kong through the lens of documentary filmmaking.\nThe Blue Island project started in 2017. Three years after the Umbrella Movement and one year after the Mongkok Civil Unrest, 2017 marked the year when pro-democratic uprising was crushed the second time around, and Hong Kong just had its under-represented chief election. A sense of defeat prevailed, with an uneasy stillness hung over the city. Will we stand our ground and fight on for what we believe, or will we run away and live our remaining days in blissful ignorance?\nI followed a few people who lived through important episodes in Hong Kong history, trying to catch a glimpse into their changing perspectives through the times. How they judged the rights and wrongs of what they did, and how past experiences continue to affect them to this date. A year into the project, the Anti-extradition Bill Protest came about. Entire generations of protesters in their prime times took to the street. Stepping upon familiar streets turned into warzones, witnessing young freedom fighters defying rains of bullets and tear gases and water cannons, bit back tears and bravely charged forward for a cause so noble, I found certain unchanging qualities amongst the past, present, and future imageries captured through my lens.\nThis project is also a personal adventure for me. Adopting a hybrid documentary approach, we plan to combine live shots surrounding our three activist protagonists, with narrative reenactments of their pasts to bring out their pains and personal struggles against the backdrop of present-day activism. I want to explore the question: how does the yearning for freedom and justice continue to shape generations after generations of people.\nDespite being an uncommon approach among Hong Kong films, we hope that by adopting the hybrid documentary approach we can better tell the admittedly complex Hong Kong stories. First phase of shooting lasted around two years from 2017 through to June 2019 when the Anti-extradition Bill Protest started. On a meager capital around HK$200K, only 10% of the budget, we managed to produce a cut with which we\u2019re invited to 10 pitch events across Asia, Australia, North America, and Europe, receiving critical acclaims from filmmaking organizations and TV stations around the world, as well as from international film festival delegates. Being awarded several small project fundings certainly helped also. At this point we\u2019re delighted to announce our production partnership with Japanese co-producer Uzumasa, Inc., and that filming has resumed in late April when the Coronavirus situation has come under control.\nWe are currently raising funds for the remaining 50% capital, in order to support further production and marketing costs, towards international and local releases.\nFilm lengths: Theatrical version - 90 to 120 minutes; TV version - 52 minutes\nLanguages: Cantonese, English, Mandarin\nSubtitles: Traditional Chinese, English\nSynopsis\nHaving lived half their lives here, three men get to relive each a pivotal moment in Hong Kong history.\nEach a player in a revolution of their times, the values they shared with the larger movements paved the way to the present-day Hong Kong.\nHow then, will today's youths play out their destinies?\nOur Crew\nDirector | Chan Tze Woon\n\u201cI was born towards the end of Britain\u02bcs colonial rule over Hong Kong, with an impending handover back to China. I grew up during times of political and social upheavals, prompting me to embark on a journey of search for my own identity. The complex relationship between Hong Kong and China is therefore a topic close to my heart.\u201d\nDirector Chan Tze Woon is a Hong Kong filmmaker. Graduated from Academy of Film at Hong Kong Baptist University in 2013. The Hong Kong 2014 Umbrella Movement inspired him to make his first feature-length documentary Yellowing (2016). The film won the Shinsuke Ogawa Award at Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, was nominated for Best Documentary at Taipei Golden Horse Film Awards, was qualified to compete in the 2019 Oscars for Best Documentary Feature, and was screened in International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2020.\nProducer | Peter Yam\n\u201cThrough his lens, Chan Tze Woon captured the nuance of a chaotic social movement, and allowed the audience to be intimately immersed in the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Working on Blue Island is like being on a deserted island, we are putting our story into a glass bottle, throwing it into the ocean in hopes that you will pick up the bottle, see and be moved by our story.\u201d\nPeter Yam is the producer of Yellowing (2016) and Lost In The Fumes (2017). He has started working with director Chan Tze Woon on Yellowing after the Umbrella Movement. The film won the Shinsuke Ogawa Award at Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival. They have commenced a long-term collaboration, dedicated to create more works for this era.\nCo-Producer | Andrew Choi\n\u201cHong Kong turned upside down last year. Uncertain outlook leads to fear and anxiety in the community. Looking back when we were preparing for Ten Years, we interviewed people from all walks of life. We asked them, what decisions have they made ten years before that have an impact on them today? How do they see themselves today and ten years from now? It was said, history is a mirror of the past, and to the future. Blue Island likewise attempts to explore the future of Hong Kong through reflections on its past. I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to work on Blue Island, a documentary that speaks to our times.\u201d\nFilm Producer Andrew has many years of experience in media-related work, including digital media, video and film production. He is the producer of many award winning films, including Ten Years (2015), the Best Film winner at the 35th Hong Kong Film Awards, Ten Years Thailand (2018), Official Selection at the 71st Festival De Cannes, Ten Years Taiwan (2018), Official Selection at the 20th Taipei Film Award, Ten Years Japan (2018), Official Selection at the 23rd Busan International Film Festival.  His latest film is Beyond the Dream (2020), received six nominations at the 39th Hong Kong Film Awards and won three awards at the 26th Hong Kong Film Critics Award.\nKey Creative Staff | Hongkongers\nOur creative team consists of Hongkongers all having prior experience working on award-winning films. Your contribution will directly go toward paying the hardworking people working around the clock making this meaningful work possible.\nInternational Achievements and Next Step\nBlue Island has just been invited to pitch in the Sunny Side of the Doc pitching event to be held towards the end of June in France. Previously, Blue Island pitched in BIFF (Busan International Film Festival) AND (Asian Network of Documentary) and DMZ Industry of DMZ International Documentary Film Festival both in Korea, Tokyo Docs in Japan, Golden Horse FFP (Film Project Promotion) in Taiwan, AIDC (Australian International Documentary Conference), as well as FIFDH (International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights) Impact Day in Geneva. Blue Island has been actively taking advantage of the privilege to go around places and tell the world Hong Kong\u2019s decades-long fight for freedom and democracy.\nWe\u2019re honoured to have received the following awards so far:\nBusan International Film Festival AND (Asian Network of Documentary) Fund\nDMZ Industry (DMZ International Documentary Film Festival) Excellent Project\nCNEX Chinese Doc Forum\u2019s Hot Docs Award\nTokyo Docs Excellent Pitch Award\n \nBlue Island\u2019s director Chan Tze Woon has made his international debuts with his previous work Yellowing in various places including Japan and Taiwan. Independent screenings of Yellowing have also been held in many cities across North America and Europe. The film won the Shinsuke Ogawa Award at Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival in Japan, and  was qualified to compete in the 2019 Oscars for Best Documentary Feature.\nAs of now, Blue Island has secured Uzumasa, Inc. in Japan as a production partner. Talks are underway to seek further production partners in North America, Germany, and other places across Europe and Asia.\nHong Kong has come under the spotlights of many a film festivals around the world. Just this year the IFFR (International Film Festival Rotterdam) specifically reserved a track called \u201cOrdinary Heroes: Made in Hong Kong\u201d to showcase Hong Kong films among which were Yellowing and Lost in the Fumes, respectively the works of Blue Island\u2019s director Chan Tze Woon and producer Peter Yam.\nWe aim to premiere Blue Island in early 2021 at top-tier international film festivals, as well as film festivals all around the world with a focus on the Hong Kong situation or human rights in general, in order that we may tell the world what happened here in Hong Kong. Making the world a better place through art and media, we\u2019re sure, is a cause worth fighting for.\nCrowdfunding Milestones\nOur film budget is HK$2,500,000 (US$320,000), half of which has already been raised through funding awards and from international production partners. Significant portion of production works have already been completed, including over a hundred days of live shots and seven days of dramatic reenactment of historical scenes.\nKickstarter requires that funding target be met before the funds are released. We therefore set a modest target of HK$800,000 (US$103,200). Deducting overheads resulting from using Kickstarter, the funds raised will be enough to support the second phase of shooting planned for August, where historical scenes from the 60s and 70s are to be recreated, as well as to pay for the hardwork done by the creative team.\nIf we were to reach the second funding target of HK$1,200,000 (US$154,800),we would have sufficient resources to complete the film, release it for local screenings, and take it to international film festivals.\nIf we were able to raise above HK$1,500,000 (US$193,500), we would be able to realize ambitious post-screening projects including disc-based releases, a book retelling the stories we heard through interviews, development of educational materials on Hong Kong history, as well as permanent screening arrangements.\nWhy are we crowdfunding?\nAs of now, Blue Island is already 60% complete, with footages shot over a period of over a hundred days. However, we need your help to proceed with the second phase of shooting, to complete post-production, and to front the costs for local releases and screenings at international film festivals. Due to the sensitive nature of the project, we anticipate no public release via mainstream cinemas. As such, we plan to take local screening into our own hands, and eventually build our own film screening platform to provide for indie films that expose inconvenient truths.\nShooting Reenacted Scenes\nBlue Island is a hybrid documentary combining live shots with narrative filmmaking, which leads to its higher cost of production compared to pure documentaries. A total of seventeen days of reenacted scenes are to be shot, of which the first portion has already been completed May this year. The remaining portion requires more funding to support, as scene reenactments generally involve costly elements such as costumes, props, lightings, and advanced shooting techniques.\nPay for the Team\u2019s Hard Works\nOur creative team consists of Hongkongers all having prior experience working on award-winning films. Your contribution will directly go towards paying the hardworking people working around the clock making this meaningful work possible.\nPost-Production Works\nPost-production works required for Blue Island, like all high-quality films, include numerous professional practices as film editing, colour grading, music scoring, sound effects design, sound mixing, visual effects design, animation, subtitling, translation, key visual and graphics design, computer media encoding and output, and so on. Behind each professionally made film is an entire fleet of professionals each with specialized skills. Your contribution will directly go towards paying the hardworking people working around the clock making this meaningful work possible.\nScreenings at International Film Festivals\nThere is no better way for a film to spread its message to the world than through screenings at international film festivals. We plan to submit screening proposals to 30 to 50 film festivals and showcase Blue Island to international audiences.\nLocal Screenings\nMainstream cinemas in Hong Kong are not keen to screen films dealing with political themes so close to home, and we expect Blue Island to be no exception. We therefore plan to screen Blue Island at niche cinemas and pro-democratic shops starting 2021 Q1.\nCrowdfunding supporters contributing more than HK$500 will be invited to view a time-limited online screening of the film in 2021.\nIn addition, given sufficient resources we have plans for:\nDisc-Based and Online Releases\nWe plan to make disc-based releases to be sold through physical product channels, as well as releasing Blue Island on online platforms like iTunes, Google Play, Youtube Premium and Netflix, in order to reach a wide international audience.\nBook Publication\nAcross the four years of research and interviews we have come across many stories of Hong Kong and those whose destinies are intertwined with it. We plan to document these stories passed down via verbal accounts in book format.\nIndependent Film Screening Platform\nAn independent film screening platform will give Hongkongers access to a broader selection of films, including politically sensitive films like Blue Island. We, as filmmakers, have always wanted to change the world through filmmaking. Running our own screening platform will be a cornerstone towards that goal, by introducing ideas and encouraging discussions among the people.\nThe most common challenges in independent film screening are lack of suitable venues and not having access to robust equipment. We wish to eventually set up a permanent screening venue and make available a set of quality equipment for rental, to support community screening.\nEducational Materials on Hong Kong History\nThe stories behind Blue Island\u2019s three protagonists concern each an important episode in Hong Kong history. We wish to develop education materials around them leveraging the film as a storytelling vehicle, in the hope that our younger generations may gain a better understanding of their heritage.\nCrowdfunding Rewards\nHK$100 Thank You For Your Support\nInclude a name of your choice in film and website credits, and receive preview clips of the film towards the end of 2020.

existing Discord community\n Ex-Zodiac is a fast-paced rail shooter with a stylised look reminiscent of early 90's 3D games. Join protagonist Kyuu as she fights to free the the worlds of the Sanzaru Star System, overrun by the intergalactic terrorist organisation known as Zodiac.\n - A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style\n- 12 main levels (plus secret areas and side-paths)\n- Multiple routes to complete the game\n- Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac\n- A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis\n Ex-Zodiac has been in production for over 2 years (although I've only been able to work on it during my free time), and the current demo represents a vertical slice of what to expect in the full game.  But what's planned for the full game?\n\nThe Heroine\n\nThe Ship \n\nLevels\nThere are 12 levels planned at minimum, spanning various locations across the Sanzaru Star System. Each level presents unique enemies and obstacles to overcome. Here are the first 2 in the demo:\n A peaceful location, populated with both forests and towering skyscrapers alike. Despite the industrialisation of some areas, the inhabitants have a high regard for the environment, choosing to use alternative sources of power where possible.\n An uninhabited, beautiful but volatile combination of fire and ice. Ignice may look chilly but don't be fooled, as just below it's surface lies a scorching hot mantle, reaching temperatures of over 1000\u00ad\u00b0C. Many attempts to tap into the planets resources have been made, but with little success so far...\nLuxor\nThe ancient ruins of a long-lost civilisation still stand, a stark reminder of a time when the planet was able to sustain more advanced lifeforms. Although it\u2019s not fully understood how Luxor came to be in this state, there are certain theories that allude to this fate being brought upon the inhabitants by themselves, possibly due to the mysterious technology they dabbled in.\nOceana\nA vast sea sprawls the entire surface. it\u2019s unknown if this planet even has a core, or if it\u2019s entirely composed of heavy water. The Zodiac likely have their eye on this location as a bountiful source of deuterium oxide, commonly used as a neutron moderator. It may be necessary to explore both the surface and the dark fathoms of this water world.\nEuclidean Belt\nAn interplanetary graveyard, created from the shattered remains of the planet Euclides. Hazardous conditions mean few choose to venture here. Of those who do, fewer return.\nParabolic Cloud / Hyperbolic Cloud\nTwo separate locations, vast distances apart, yet somehow connected. There are reports that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 may be the cause of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 but it is unconfirmed if this is the case. Entering \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been known to create \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which can allow \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to occur almost instantaneously.\nBosses\nEach level ends with a massive boss, piloted by one of the 12 members of the Zodiac.\n The OST is created by +TEK, a video game composer with a unique 16-bit style perfect for this game.  Check out some of his existing work:\n My name is Ben Hickling, and I've been developing games on-and-off for the past 20 years, with Ex-Zodiac being my first serious project. I've also been a 2D artist for a large part of that time, too. Having a huge amount of interest in games released during the mid-90's, I to try infuse my own games with a similar look and feel. Constantly challenging myself, I aim to capture the same feelings those games evoked in me at a young age. Hopefully this shows in Ex-Zodiac and my future projects!\n I started this project back in May 2017, although I had no idea what it would become, and at that point it wasn't much more than a simple flight movement prototype. Since then, it's evolved and become the on-rails arcade shooter known as Ex-Zodiac. The problem is, it's taken quite some time to get to this point. Right now the only time I can work on the game is during evenings and weekends, but with the funds raised from this Kickstarter, I will be able allocate more of my time per week for working on the project. This will allow me to develop an Early Access version of the game (about 6 levels) and then eventually the full release (12 levels + all other features)\nDiscord Private Channel Access: The Discord Server (which you can join right now) is the best place to connect with the existing Ex-Zodiac community.  This tier will get you access to the private development channel where we will show and discuss our updates on the game all the way to launch and beyond.\nThe Game: This tier gets you a digital copy of the game, as soon as it's available,  for Windows, Mac, or Linux.  Right now we plan to sell the game on Steam, Humble, and Itch.io, and you will receive a key for your platform of choice.\nFirst Access: This tier will give you access to builds of the game before the initial launch, delivered via Steam key or direct download. These builds will be available soon after the campaign ends, and will continue to be updated all the way to full release.\nSoundtrack: This tier grants the full soundtrack to the game, created by +TEK, delivered via a Steam Key or Bandcamp code.  In addition to the soundtrack: \nA look into the process of creating the soundtrack on a private discord channel \nHigh-quality downloads of the song as soon as they're done (not having to wait for full OST release)\nMidis/stems if desired\nDigital Art Book: This is a compendium of artwork by Ben Hickling, the developer of Ex-Zodiac.  It contains sketches, designs, renders and wallpapers from the game, as well as illustrations of the game's characters.\nMega-Backer: This gets you special recognition in the game, as well as the Discord server.\nIntergalactic Sponsorship: You get to provide some text for one of the marquees in the city level, or design a constellation to be featured in the space-themed level. You will also be featured in-game in a special section just for sponsors.\n Like any big project, I can't do this alone. Thankfully, Pixeljam will be here to help! They will be supporting me along the way, helping out with marketing, community management and ensuring the campaign delivers on its promises. They'll probably give me a bit of game design advice too, that's always useful!\nPixeljam has created, consulted on and published almost 30 games since 2005. Dino Run and Nova Drift are probably their best known titles.\nQ: Will there be stretch goals?\nA: At this moment, they are not planned. We are just focusing on the core experience for now. Any funds raised over the goal will just make more game.\nQ: Why no rewards beyond 100?\nA: We're aiming to keep the campaign as simple as possible and only promise what we know we can deliver. You are free to contribute over 100 though! :)\nQ: Will there be colourful animal characters piloting the ships?\nA: Of course!  We will reveal some details of those characters later in the campaign :)\nQ: How much content will be in the Early Access launch?\nA: We are targeting 6 playable levels for Early Access launch, and then after that,  updates will improve those 6 levels while we add the other 6 and all the other features of the game.\nQ: I need to play this on Switch.  Will the game be released there?\nA: That's the plan, but at this early stage in development it's best not to promise it. After initial Early Access launch, we'll have a better idea of what is needed for a Switch release. Pixeljam has resources and connections to get the game on console, so the odds are in our favour!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving spent the last 15+ years developing various games and prototypes, I believe I have the knowledge and experience to tackle a project like Ex-Zodiac. While the full game will have at least 12 stages, the focus of this kickstarter project is to help bring the game to Early Access, and for that we\u2019re aiming for at least 6 stages. As the first two stages are already playable from start to finish, I feel this is an achievable goal for the timeframe. \n\nThe lack of overly ambitious backer rewards also means I will be able to spend more time focusing on the game, rather than worrying about how to ship life-size cardboard cutouts of the game's cast (that\u2019s not a real thing, please don\u2019t ask!)\n\nSince I\u2019m the sole developer of the game, I certainly have to make sure I stay disciplined and focused, but it also removes the potential issues of working in a team, such as disagreements or ownership disputes. The only other person that\u2019s contributing content to the game is +TEK, who is producing the soundtrack. His track record of delivering completed soundtracks is solid and I trust him to deliver on this one too.\n\nFinally, I have Pixeljam games, who are helping all this to go smoothly. They have many years experience with developing and publishing games. They have provided invaluable information and knowledge so far, and I\u2019m confident they will continue to help guide the game to completion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nAll products and rewards are digital, no matter is created or destroyed in the making of this game :)", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Discord Private Channel Access", "descp": "Access to the members-only channels of the Ex-Zodiac Discord server.

In 1945, at eight years of age, Takashi witnessed the nuclear explosion over Hiroshima and became an extremely rare survivor within a one mile radius of the blast.  It devastated his home town and killed the entirety of his family.\nMy name is Francesca and two years ago, at a social gathering, I was introduced to now 82-year old Takashi. I have since had the opportunity to document his story, from his memories of the bombing to his journey to the US, first as prisoner in internment camps, and then as a peace activist.  For 11 years, I lectured grad and postgrad students on the History of Modern Japan, and Hiroshima was always one of the hardest lectures -- how can you describe a collective trauma beyond any imagination?  And what video content can you show students when the cinematic treatment of Hiroshima has always been framed through the lens of American decency?\nAs someone who has experienced an intensely traumatic event, Takashi needed time and space to trust me and open up.  But when he started sharing his story, inviting me to see and feel what he experienced during that unimaginable day, I felt the responsibility to ensure that this piece of history was not forgotten, and would receive the most authentic possible portrayal.\nABCC program\nIn 1956, orphaned and partially blind, Takashi was invited by the American Government to the United States to \u201cregain his health\u201d.  A second grader when the atomic bomb dropped, with six members of his family dead of radiation poisoning, Takashi embarked for the U.S. at 18.\nAs soon as he landed in California, Takashi realized that he had been identified as an eligible subject for experimentation undertaken by the ABCC (Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission) to understand the effects of intense radioactive energy on the human body.\nTakashi's story is different from many other Hiroshima survivors. It is the journey of an angry young man whose misfortunes begin right after the Hiroshima bombing. It's a story of revenge, and acceptance of the past.\nYour Contribution\nYour contribution will directly support:\ncompleting the animation\nfinalizing color and mix\nfestival distribution\nAll of the shooting and editing for the film is complete.  The Kickstarter funding received here will be used exclusively to cover the costs involved in animation, final audio mix, and festival distribution.  Animation is a time consuming process, but it will enhance Takashi\u2019s story in a way that is impossible with footage alone.  Another cost is festival entrance fees.  It is surprisingly expensive to apply to film festivals, and we want to have the best possible chance of getting into as many festivals as possible.  \nConcept art for animation\nConcept art for animation\nStretch Goal\nShould we reach the initial goal, we will add a stretch goal to produce an original score for the film. Powerful original music adds special value to a film by emphasizing key moments and enhancing the personal connection to the story. An original score will be particularly effective in this documentary as it will complement the animation and set the tone intended by the filmmakers.\nWhat You Get\nThe most important thing if you choose to be a funder, is to preserve and promote this historic story and help bring it to life in a way that will make an indelible impression for everyone who sees it.\nEven a small amount will help bring this film to as wide an audience as possible. And every funder receives a credit at the end of the film.\nThe year 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombings in Japan. Depending on your contribution, you may also choose to associate yourself or your organization with the film and its screenings both at festivals, online, or at events you might choose to organize.\nMore Ways You Can Help\nOurs is the last generation who has the privilege of listening to Hiroshima survivors' stories in person. It's a tremendous responsibility to give voice to their stories and present them to those who will come after us in a compelling way. Funding this project is an excellent way to take part in a conversation that will become a part of history.\nIf you know family, friends or organizations who might want to help bring this project to life, please send them the project via this page. Feel free to share this page on your social media page too and help us to make this happen.\nMore About Us\nDirector:  Francesca Di Marco debuted as a documentary filmmaker in 2018 with The Woman All Women Were, an award winning film that appeared in numerous international festivals. She is committed to narrating stories that reconfigure the margins of the dominant discourse. Who Won the War, her current project, is the attempt to deconstruct the official narrative of the aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing written by the \"winners\" by giving voice to a survivor, and to open up a space to heal his trauma. Francesca is the author of the book Suicide in Twentieth-Century Japan. She holds a Ph.D in Modern History of Japan from SOAS University of London, and a Postdoc from Yale University. Her research interest is on collective and national narcissism and how it manifested in Japan through interwar totalitarianism and modern suicide. She lectured on the Asia-Pacific Wars and on History of Interwar Japan at Stanford University, the UK, and Italy.\nPost Production Supervisor: Jeremy Solterbeck has a passion for filmmaking rooted in a background of drawing and sculpture. His first projects were based in animation, and went on to win awards and screen at festivals such as SXSW, Seattle, and Atlanta.  He has been a part of Bay Area filmmaking for 25 years, working in sound mixing, editing, writing & directing, sound design, and visual effects on major productions, documentaries, and animated shorts. He has traveled the festival circuit with numerous projects and is a producing partner with award-winning documentarian Scott Kirchenbaum on the films These Are My Hours and You're Looking at Me Like I Live Here and I Don't.  With a creative interest in science fiction, Jeremy's focus is to place the future, the imagination, and the unknown into the context of humanity.\nCollaborator: Chelsey Dubiel is an award winning writer, director and producer. She grew up in the rural farm town of San Miguel, California. Combining a strong visual sense, a background in dance and a whimsical, yet analytical perspective on the world, Dubiel makes films that are graceful, engrossing and strive to push cinematic boundaries. She is an outspoken advocate for gender equality and currently works with Oakland based, Camp Reel Stories, where she creates and teaches film workshops to women and teen girls. In 2015, she received her MFA in film production and directing at the UCLA School of Film and Television.\nCollaborator: An unlikely filmmaker, Chesley Chen grew up in the impoverished Tenderloin area of San Francisco, amongst adult theaters and the perpetually homeless. But it was in this dense environment that the young Chesley saw the drama and courage of people trying to survive. Captivated by those experiences and drawing from them for creative inspiration, Chesley won a fellowship to attend USC School of Cinematic Arts for his MFA in Film. Since completing his degree, he has continued to make films that explore the human instincts to survive despite difficult odds. These films have aired on television around the world and screened at numerous film festivals, including being selected for competition at the Cannes Film Festival.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe completion of this film is time sensitive due to the fact that the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing will be commemorated on August 6th, 2020.

For 20 years I lived in the big city and worked at tech companies. My heat and water came from city utilities.  My food came from the supermarket.\nOne of our sheep, Elsif, and her daughter.\nSeven years ago I moved to a farm in the countryside.  I still work for tech companies (remotely), but now I heat my house with firewood from my forest. I grow my own fruits and vegetables. I make my own bacon, from pigs I raise and butcher.\nA sane, possible choice\nThis project is for people like you - people who live in the city or the suburbs.  Whether you're already convinced that there's a better, more in-touch-with-the-world lifestyle for you in the country, or just want to learn what your options are, this project has the information you need.  \nA tomato, fresh from our garden.\nThe good news is that moving from the city to the country is easier than you think... and it can be a lot more affordable than you think too.  If you have even a modest home in the city or suburbs, you can trade it for a much nicer farm or homestead in the country, with all the conveniences you're used to, at the same price.  I know, because I've done it.  I traded a 1,000 square foot, two bedroom 1950s cookie-cutter house on a postage stamp lot, for a 5,000 square foot, five bedroom recent-construction house...and it came with 40 acres of forest, 16 acres of pasture, and two ponds.\nI used to commute in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic and shop at an overpriced supermarket.  Now I work from home, where I eat lamb, pork, beef, eggs, fruit, and vegetables fresh from my farm - all of it higher quality than what I could buy at Whole Foods.\nYou can do the same. \nA beaver pond on our property. Good land is a lot cheaper than you might expect.\nAll you need is information\nYou can move to the countryside, work a good-paying job, see your cost of living drop, and see your quality of life improve. \nMost days half or more of the food we eat comes from the farm. Some days, it hits 100%.\nThe only tricky part is learning the skills.  When I moved to the country, I didn\u2019t even know what questions to ask. I had to learn thousands of things about tractors, gardens, compost, livestock, and more.  A lot of it the hard way.\nNow I've put it all in a book - two books, actually, because there's too much information to fit in one volume.  Absolutely everything you need to know about country living and homesteading, to help you move from the suburbs or city out to the country, and thrive once you're there.\nWhether you want to plant orchards and raise livestock, or just want to have a few chickens for eggs, my books will give you everything you need to know.  They'll tell you what equipment and tools you need, and show you the skills to use them. \nWe planted an orchard a few years ago. The peach trees are already delivering tons of fruit.\nWhy this book ?\nThere are endless books on gardening, farming, and homesteading - I know, I own hundreds of them.  All of them have three failures.\nThey don\u2019t have sufficient breadth.  One will talk about compost but not gardening. Another will talk about gardening, but not tractors.\nThey all have blind spots. Especially about the basic stuff. They forget that thousands of things aren't obvious to everyone. The difference between straw and hay, between sweet corn and field corn, discing versus plowing versus rototilling, pastures versus fields, the different kinds of fencing, how utilities differ from the suburbs to the countryside. A book on gardening doesn\u2019t tell you what you really need to know about hoses. A book on firewood might tell you to haul logs with your tractor, but not everything you need to do it safely.\nThe third failure is the lack of itemized lists and step-by-step instructions.  For every topic that I cover, there's a conversational discussion, but I follow that up with simple checklists, overviews, alternative choices for different price points or enthusiasm levels, and step by step instructions.  I also included dozens of recipes for every vegetable and fruit I grow, and for every part of every animal I raise, from apple cobbler to red wine, from beef fajitas to T bone steak, from Asian fried pork chop cutlets to head cheese and English black pudding. \nIf you've never had pesto made from basil picked from your garden minutes earlier, you haven't lived.\nThis project delivers\nThis is not \"here's what I\u2019m going to do\" kickstarter.  I've already written the book.  ...and I\u2019ve done this before.  Three years ago I kickstarted two novels I wrote, released them on time, and went on to win awards for them.  All I need is your help to turn the manuscript into a finished, printed book...and put it in your hands.\nYou\u2019ll get all the benefit of my experience \u2014 including dozens of misadventures, so you can learn from my mistakes.  Broken shear pins, logs jammed in snow blowers, bent tractor buckets, the wrong way to make vineyard trellises, invasive weeds and what not to do with them, trees falling where they shouldn't, broken tractor implements, trespassing neighbors, dogs barking at coyotes, dogs barking at bears, escaped sheep, and pig carcasses falling from great heights. \nThings break. But if you have step-by-step troubleshooting instructions and a list of the right tools, you can fix them and get back to work.\nAnd, of course, I talk about the pros and cons of farmhands, and why I really don't believe the one who told me that the Hopi Indians planted corn seeds 4 feet underground.\nOver the last decades millions of people have become more interested in gardening, ethically raised meat, becoming more self-sufficient, and having a lifestyle that doesn't feel consumerist, fake, and constrained. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re one of them. Whatever your dream of living in the country is like - a small vegetable garden, eating home made bacon in an off-grid compound, or just having a bigger house than you have now and heating it with a wood burning stove - I'll tell you everything you need to know to plan realistically, and how to make your move to your country dream home a success. \nHeating with wood warms you three times: once when you log the trees, once when you stack firewood, and once when your burn it.\nCollaborative writing and early access\nIn these crazy times, a lot of people are looking for information RIGHT NOW.  It's my intention to share early drafts of the book, and invite conversation with the first 300 backers.  You'll get access to the content immediately, to help you make decisions about your own life in summer 2020 and beyond.\nThe books\nI expect the finished project to be around 1,000 pages of information - 800 pages of text, and 200 pages of photos, though that ratio could change based on a lot of factors.  I've already written almost 700 pages of text.\nThe book is split across two volumes because no printer can bind 1,000 pages, but this is, in essence, one large book.\nThe books will be professionally printed.  The trade paperbacks will be 6\" x 9\".  The hardcover books will be the same size and have dust jackets.  Pictures will be black and white (though all hard copies come with complimentary ebook versions which will have color photos).\nStretch Goals\nThe problem with writing 800 pages is not coming up with enough material to fill it all - it's deciding what to prune (because longer books cost more to print).\nAs stretch goals, I'll add extra content. \nThere's no party like a farm party. Especially when you roast a pig and serve it with a variety of sides and four different BBQ sauces.\n$ 10k - plans for a general purpose 12' x 12' utility shed \n$ 15k - feast recipes #1: how to throw a pig roast for 50 friends\n$ 20k - everything is negotiable: a primer on haggling\n$ 25k - feast recipes #2: how to throw a viking farm party for 50 friends\n$ 30k - decorating your country home by refinishing / rebuilding garage sale furniture\n$ 35k - feast recipes #3: how to host an old-fashioned Thanksgiving\n$ 40k - plans for simple bookshelves\n$ 45k - feast recipes #4: how to throw a farm Christmas dinner\n$ 50k - overview of small homestead engine operation, maintenance, and repair: 2 stroke, 4 stroke, and diesel\n$ 55k - interviews with 3 families that made the leap from city to homesteading\n$ 60k - overview of pressure washers and pumps\n$ 65k - interviews with 3 more families that made the leap from city to homesteading\n$ 80k  - free \"shop inventory\" e-book\n$ 90k  LOCKED \ud83d\udd12 - immediate early access of book content to every single backer\nTable of contents\nThe full table of contents is much larger than this; to make it manageable I've trimmed this to just top tier and second tier topics.\n Intro\n Intro: How to Read this book\n Intro: Welcome\n Intro: Organization of this book\n Intro: Types of Farming\n Farming Scenarios: Which Is Right For You?\n Farming Scenarios: Suburbanite In The Country\n Farming Scenarios: A Garden With Chickens\n Farming Scenarios: Market Gardener\n Farming Scenarios: Homesteading\n Farming Scenarios: Commercial Farmer\nLife in the country is great - but there's a lot to learn.\n Life In The Country\n Life In The Country: Things To Consider\n Life In The Country: Distance From Civilization\n Life In The Country: Taxes Vs Services\n Life In The Country: Zoning, Landscaping Laws, Noise Ordinances\n Life In The Country: Internet Access\n Life In The Country: Neighbors\n Life In The Country: Cultural Fit\n Life In The Country: Jobs\n Life In The Country: Buyer's Remorse\n Planning Your Move\n Planning Your Move: Figuring Out What You Want\n Planning Your Move: Ten Year Plan For Young Adults\n Planning Your Move: Buying Your Homestead \nThat's not a \"nuisance tree\" - that's free firewood!\n Utilities\n Utilities: Heat\n Utilities: Water\n Utilities: Electricity\n Utilities: Internet / Phone\n Utilities: Garbage\n Utilities: Septic\n Utilities: Freight\n Buildings\n Buildings: House\n Buildings: Workshop\n Buildings: Bunkhouse\n Buildings: Barn\n Buildings: Coops\n Buildings: Run-in Sheds\n Buildings: Sugar Shack\n Buildings: Garden Shed\n Buildings: Tractor Shed\n Buildings: Fabric Buildings\n Buildings: Greenhouses, Cold Frames, High Tunnels And Low Tunnels\n Buildings: Firewood Sheds\n Vehicles\n Vehicles: Intro\n Vehicles: Tractors\n Vehicles: Tractor alternatives\n Vehicles: Riding Mowers\n Vehicles: ATVs / Quads / RUVs / ROVs / UTVs \n Vehicles: Skidsteer loaders (\"Bobcat\")\n Vehicles: Backhoes\n Vehicles: Excavators\n Vehicles: Bulldozers\n Vehicles: Trailers\n Vehicles: Maintenance\n Raising Animals\n Raising Animals: Fences\n Raising Animals: Chickens\n Raising Animals: Turkeys\n Raising Animals: Geese\n Raising Animals: Goat And Sheep\n Raising Animals: Pigs\n Raising Animals: Cattle\nPumpkins are easy to grow, make delicious soups and pies, and can also be fed to pigs and chickens.\n Raising Plants\n Raising Plants: Orchard\n Raising Plants: Berry Patch\n Raising Plants: Vineyard\n Raising Plants: Lawn\n Raising Plants: Garden\n Raising Plants: Pasture\n Raising Plants: Field Crops\n Forestry\n Forestry: Maple Syrup\n Forestry: Firewood\n Forestry: Mushrooms\n Forestry: Management\n Invasive Species\n Invasive Species: Japanese Knotweed\n Invasive Species: Oriental Bittersweet\n Invasive Species: Poison Ivy\nGarlic is also easy to grow, and keeps well all winter long, if stored properly.

While this music has aged extremely well over the years and remains dear to my heart, I believe this music hasn't been done the epic orchestral justice it deserves ... \nThat's where I come in! I'd like to introduce to you all to my passion project: Thomas Reorchestrated: Sodor Symphony.

Now, it's time for me to tackle the soundtrack that started it all: The Soundtrack from Season 1 of Thomas and Friends. For the next few months, it will be my mission to arrange every memorable theme and ditty from Season 1 of Thomas through the magic of MIDI manipulation, using high-quality orchestral samples and a special pinch of human musicality to bring these tunes to life in a neat little orchestral album I like to call Sodor Symphony. \nBut, I need your help! I can't do it alone! That's where you and Kickstarter come in. I propose an alliance, you help me, and I'll help you! (Shoutout to my friend Gordon for this idea.)

If you decide to graciously donate, there are some seriously awesome awards that await you: Bonus tracks, physical copies, rare vintage merch, hats, mugs, and more!

Check some of the music I've produced on my Youtube channel and I hope to prove you otherwise! Thomas and the brilliant world created by The Rev. W.

Read the full update here.\n The \"Smell of Space\" \n\"\u2026a rather pleasant metallic sensation... [like] ... sweet-smelling welding fumes, burning metal, a distinct odour of ozone, an acrid smell, walnuts and brake pads, gunpowder, fruit, rum, and even burnt almond cookie.\"\nDecades ago, NASA asked specialists to develop the \"smell of space\" to help train astronauts before launch into orbit. NASA's goal of simulating Space during training is to eliminate any surprises Astronauts might experience in Outer Space. Astronauts experience a high G Force Centrifuge simulator for blastoff training, carryout extreme underwater to trainings in Zero G weightlessness for when they reach outer space, and learn what to expect for everything in between. After all, it isRocket Science. The history of the \"Smell of Space\" has been clouded behind various accounts of existence. Ever since the first space walk, astronauts were shocked by the lingering odor when returning back into the spacecraft. Some describe it as gun powder, rum, fruit, seared steak, or a BBQ. The first space tourists also noted a pungent aroma once the hatch opened, 'like burnt cookies'. We had to find out for ourselves...What does space smell like? We dug deep. With a bit of luck (and a beautiful thing called a FOIA request), we found our lead. A perfumer based in the UK. \"The smell of space is so distinct that..NASA reached out to [a fragrance maker] to re-create the odor for its training simulations\". Bingo. Two exclusive commercial contracts later, a secret shelved formula based on verified astronaut accounts, a very large minimum order of fragrance...and we're all off smelling space! We've had Space Ice Cream...this just takes it a small step further. (Or maybe it's a leap for all man kind?)\n \"Will you pledge your support today to help mass manufacturer Eau de Space, so that everyone can experience the 'Smell of Space' for themselves?\"  \n We've partnered with award winning perfumers, some of the best in the world, and secured the rights to launch this product exclusively.

Then we can bottle and ship the smell of space directly to you.\nBuy One, Give One\nTom's founder, Blake Mycoskie founded his shoe company on the \"One for One\" model. The One for One model is designed so that for every shoe purchased, one is donated to someone in need. This model, and shoe, was so popular that other large companies like Sketchers were inspired to release shoes in a similar fashion, one of which they named \"Bobs\". \n \"For every bottle of Eau de Space you buy, we're going to donate one to a K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) program in need.\" \nIt's a big promise, and isn't the best decision for a company trying to make a profit. But, we really believe in the cause and hope you do too. Imagine if a child that smells Eau de Space today is inspired to become an astronaut, scientist, or engineer. One day, that same child may even become the first human to walk on Mars. That's the kind of impact experiential education has on early teaching programs in the formative years of child development.

W. Leadbeater. It was originally published in 1905 in London. According to the teachings of Theosophy, thoughts and emotions create distinctive patterns of color and form in the human aura\u2014visible only to those who are gifted with a sufficient degree of clairvoyance and can see beyond our normal perceptions. Besant and Leadbeater dictated their clairvoyant \"thought-forms\" to a group of friends who then created the 58 magnificent illustrations contained in the book. This book was a major influence on the artists Hilma Af Klint and Wassily Kandinsky among many others but has long been overlooked as a foundational pillar in art history. \nBesant was also an early suffragist and political activist and was far ahead of her time as an artist and thinker. Theosophy was the first occult group to open its doors to women and Thought Forms offers a reminder that the history of modernist abstraction and women\u2019s contribution to it is still being written.\nA proper, color corrected version of the book is not currently in print. Our re-print aims to bring this over looked masterpiece back into circulation in the form of a high quality clothbound and embossed hardcover at an affordable price. We have also worked with the editor of the project Lucy Lord Campana to commission three introductory pieces by contemporary scholars to further contextualize the book. \nAt a Funeral\nTHE LONG STORY: \nThought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation by Annie Besant and Charles W. Leadbeater originally published in 1905, is a 143 page, illustrated book that offers a look into a chapter of the past that has largely been forgotten.\nBesant and Leadbeater were the third wave leaders of the Theosophical Society. Theosophy is an occult movement founded in New York City in the late 1800s. It was a time when ideas about individuality, religion, art and science were up in the air as the structures of society were shifting. The aim of Theosophy was to unify all religions, create world peace and further the \u201cunlimited capacities of man\u201d, proclaiming that \u201cthere is no religion higher than truth\u201d.\nAnnie Besant was a British socialist, women's rights activist, anti-colonialist, and pro-union fighter whose spiritual journey eventually led her to Theosophy. She fought for birth control, and was arrested when she put out a book on family planning. Besant's close collaborator in the Theosophical movement was C. W. Leadbeater, to whom she credited as helping her gain clairvoyance. Together they wrote about topics such as the human aura, the history of mankind, and the chemical structure of the universe.\nAccording to the teachings of Theosophy, thoughts and emotions create distinctive patterns of color and form in the human aura\u2014visible only to those who are gifted with a sufficient degree of clairvoyance and can see beyond our normal perceptions. The quality of thought determines the aura\u2019s color and shape; a person who is selfless and generous, possesses an aura that is radiant and clear; for those who are selfish and insensitive\u2014their aura is cloudy and muddy. These artist impressions were made available only in Thought Forms and are radically different than anything else made at that time.\nWe learned of Thought Forms a few years ago and it completely took us by surprise. This one book totally challenged the classic art history narrative that had been taught to in school. Not like we fundamentally believed that story, abstraction is found in all cultures\u2014not just in western 20th century painting, but the genesis story of a few male painters \u201cinventing\u201d abstraction does have its truths.\nIn this narrative of Modernism, Vassily Kandinsky is widely viewed as one of the most important founders of abstraction, and his manifesto On the Spiritual in Art is mandatory reading in art school.\nWhat was never mentioned to us in school however, was that Kandinsky was a member of the Theosophical Society, and had acquired a copy of their book Thought Forms a few years before he abandoned conventional ways of painting. Learning that Kandinsky didn\u2019t just come upon these ideas on his own as previously thought, totally changed our understanding of his work. It\u2019s worth mentioning that Piet Mondrian was also deeply influenced by Theosophy and later on, Jackson Pollock was as well.\nLast year the Guggenheim held the first US retrospective of Hilma af Klint\u2019s paintings. She was a member of the Theosophical Society and was undoubtably influenced by the spiritualistic currents of the time. Theosophy was the first occult group to open its doors to women, and it deeply questioned gender roles, many of these ideas are also in Af Klint\u2019s paintings. This show was one of the first times the all-male origin story of abstraction was challenged within the ivory tower. Af Klint, made these paintings before Kandinsky, and she was a woman. Thought Forms came out before Af Klint began her abstract paintings and it is certain that she must have come across this book.\nWe\u2019re republishing this beautiful, overlooked book, so that it may be widely accessible and no longer omitted from the past. Thought Forms offers a reminder that the history of modernist abstraction and women\u2019s contribution to it is still being written.\nTheosophy\u2019s motto seems as appropriate today as it did in 1880, \u201cthere is no religion higher than truth.\u201d\nBOOK CONTRIBUTOR BIOGRAPHIES:\n\nAuthors\n Annie Besant (1847\u20131933) was a British socialist, women's rights activist, president of the Theosophical Society, writer, orator, and philanthropist. Regarded as a champion of human freedom, she was an ardent supporter of both Irish and Indian self-rule. She was a prolific author of over three hundred books and pamphlets. Besant greatly expanded the international reach of Theosophy, and represented it at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair in 1893. Besant\u2019s close co-worker in the Theosophical movement was C. W. Leadbeater, to whom she credited as helping her gain clairvoyance. Together they wrote about topics such as the human aura, the history of mankind, and the chemical structure of the universe. Besant continued to be a leader of Theosophy and a human rights activist until her death.\n\nCharles Webster Leadbeater (1854-1934) was a member of the Theosophical Society and author of over sixty books and pamphlets. He was a high-ranking member of the society but resigned in 1906 amid a sex scandal involving adolescent boys. Besant championed and defended Leadbeater, eventually readmitting him back to the Theosophical Society where he was a leading member for the rest of his life even amid additional sex scandals. Leadbeater claimed clairvoyance and much of his work was about the \u201cpower to see what is hidden from ordinary physical sight\u201d. Many of his books remain popular today and include such topics as the afterlife, dreams, vegetarianism, and Esoteric Christianity.\n\nEditor\n Lucy Lord Campana is an artist whose observational based painting practice explores the limits of our collective vision. Recent projects include images from the Hubble Space Telescope, a series around X-ray use in diamond mining, and methane detection with infrared technology.

If Avatar the Last Airbender met traditional fantasy with influences derived from folk music, RPG's, and anime; Saving Dreamland is born. It's a traveling adventure full of the power of friendship and magic.\nTHE STORY\nSaving Dreamland follows our brave new heroes as they embark on a quest to save Dreamland from being consumed by the evil plague known as \"The Nightmare\". Diva, the princess of Dreamland who is willing to do whatever it takes to save her home from evil takeover; Eddie, Diva\u2019s companion and childhood friend who wants nothing more than to protect his family and friends from the clutches of darkness; Astro, a friendly yet short-tempered little boy who wants to avenge his father who has been taken by the Nightmare; and Ballerie, the timid and highly intelligent older sister to Astro who is set on searching for a way to save their father.\nOur story begins with Diva and Eddie sneaking out of the palace in search of adventure. They soon learn of the harsh realities that have been occurring outside of the palace walls while they have been sheltered within. The Sandman, protector of dreams, is rumored to still be alive and hidden away in a cave far from the capital. Knowing that her grandfather may still be alive and that there is a chance to save her home, Diva jumps at the opportunity to take on this mighty quest to find the Sandman.\nTHE WORLD\nDreamland exists in another dimension from our own, it is the place where dreams come from. This world is colorful, bubbly, and diverse with every dream that has ever been dreamt residing here. One spooky area in this land is the Starless Valley. This valley houses all of the bad dreams that have come into existence since the beginning of time. The negative energy permeating through these nightmares form a nasty plague known to the locals as \" The Nightmare\u201d. After the disappearance of the Sandman, the plague started to slowly take over the land; corrupting everything in site and turning good dreams bad.\nThere is a legend that the locals believe that tells of a new hero who will arise and take the place of the Sandman. Dreamland\u2019s residents eagerly await the arrival of their new protector.\n\nTHE PROJECT\nSaving Dreamland is an animation adaptation derived from the original indie webcomic created by Rachel Owens. The goal is to produce a 10 minute pilot episode through Kickstarter. We're looking to raise the minimum goal of $15,000 which will help us finish the remaining work needed for the pilot including animation, post production, music, and sound effects. If we surpass our minimum goal, extra funds will go toward more episodes and a larger team.\n\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nProducing and animation of this length and detail is expensive and unfortunately personal funds can only go so far. We need the power of the people of the internet to help bring this project to life. We want to bring this goal to fruition while at the same time paying artists who work on the project.\n\nPLEDGE REWARDS\nTea House Print Prize\nCat Print Prize\nTHE CREATOR\nRACHEL OWENS \nProducer / Director / Writer / Artist\nRachel is a freelance illustrator and independent webcomic artist living out of California.

We're excited to announce our brand new line of Bandit Barista blends. Roasted locally in New York and shipped directly to you. Perfect for an at-home drip coffee, espresso drink, or pour-over.\nBandit's Roasting Operation in New York\nAt Bandit, we love our customers and our community. It pained us to have to close our doors due to COVID-19 in early March. Not only do we miss serving happy customers every day, but, we are also deeply saddened to see our wonderful baristas out of work. We know that our situation is not unique, and it is, unfortunately, something that many small businesses and their employees are facing. \nBryan, one of the original members of our barista family\nA better cup of coffee\nAfter receiving customer outreach about missing Bandit Coffee as a part of their normal daily ritual, we realized that we could recreate a similar coffee experience at home. We are proud to announce our Barista Blends line of coffee. A whole new way to drink delicious Bandit coffee wherever you are. Best of all, the coffee sold by this Kickstarter will give out-of-work baristas their livelihoods again. \nOur beans are shipped immediately after roasting for maximum flavor\nOur Barista Blend\nBandit\u2019s original blend -- a blend of Ethiopian and Guatemalan 100% Arabica beans that were carefully chosen for their harmonious relationship in your cup. Roasted with the perfect everyday taste in mind, Bandit\u2019s Barista Blend combines the mountainous regions of Ethiopia with the ideal growing climates of Guatemala. The end result is a coffee that is delicate yet flavorful, without giving up any complexity. This coffee is wonderful for both homebrew and pour-overs.\nNotes: Caramel, dried fruit, citrus, chocolate\nProducer: Finca Los Angeles (Guatemala)\nAltitude: 1450m - 2200m\nOrigin: Guatemala, Ethiopia\nProcess: Washed\nOur Ripe Cherries at Finca Los Angeles in Guatemala\nThis could soon be yours...from the comfort of your home\nBandit Espresso Blend\nOur flagship espresso blend. We set out with a single goal in mind: to craft a perfectly balanced espresso that can be enjoyed both as a straight shot or as a drink with milk. After countless cuppings in our roastery, we finally settled on this marvelous blend of Burundi, Guatemalan, and Ethiopian beans. Our Signature Espresso blend gives you the perfect balance of a rich cocoa body, dried fruit and crisp citrus notes.\nNotes: Dried fruit, cocoa, balanced citrus\nAltitude: 1450m - 2200m\nOrigin: Guatemala, Burundi, Ethiopia\nProcess: Washed\n  Cupping of coffees at our Roaster (saving only the best for you)\nBandit Gold\nOur latest addition is truly something special. These single-origin beans come from micro-lots of Ethiopian land traces in the mountainous Oromia region. After a careful roasting session in our NY-based roaster, these beans fill your cup with notes of ripe fruit and honey.\nNotes: Ripe fruit, meyer lemon, honey\nAltitude: 1800 \u2013 2200m\nOrigin: Ethiopia\nProcess: Washed. Dried on raised beds.\nOur Ethiopian beans are sourced directly from family owned micro-lots\nThe Bandit Story & More About Us:\nBandit was founded in 2019 with the goal of revolutionizing how people access high-quality coffee. We pride ourselves in the work we have done to build a coffee community across our Manhattan locations. In such a short amount of time, our baristas have been able to connect with our customers on a personal and professional level.\nServing joy daily @ Bandit\nFrom the beginning, our baristas have been paid an above-market wage and given access to health benefits not normally available to hourly workers. We recognize that our baristas responsibilities go far beyond our four walls. Our baristas are mothers, sons, daughters, students, artists and more; their livelihood and their families livelihood depend on their ability to continue to work and serve coffee. \nJust some of our customers' favorites\nEven though our cafe doors are closed, we want to continue to roast and distribute our beans to support our barista family and serve our loyal Bandit community. We know that we can\u2019t possibly fix all of the problems out there, but we know that we can make people's day better with a good cup of coffee and we plan on doing just that with your help.\nYour pledge will go towards:\nStaffing costs (formerly out-of-work baristas) 30%\nProduct costs 50%\nKickstarter rewards 10%\nKickstarter fees 10%\nAll of the funds raised, including any addition to our goal, will be invested wholly in roasting more coffee and growing our business to better support our community.\nProject milestones:\nApril: Kickstarter launch\nLate April/Early May: Final order tallying + end of Kickstarter campaign\nEarly May: Roasting and delivery of your beans + rewards!\nThe funds from Kickstarter will come to us two to three weeks after the campaign ends. We will then immediately go into roasting of the beans and distribution of rewards.\nRewards:\nHere are the rewards that are on offer in exchange of your pledge:\n$5+: Thank you email\n$17: Your choice of one 12oz bags of delicious Bandit Coffee  \n$35: Your choice of two 12oz bags of delicious Bandit Coffee \n$50: Coffee Variety Pack [Both of our blends and our single origin]\n$100: Bandit Swag Package [Coffee Variety Pack + Bandit Shirt + Bandit Hat]\n$250: Create and name a special drink on our menu \n$1,500: The Full Bandit Experience [Flight to New York City + hotel + meet with Bandit Founding Team + Barista Training on Your Favorite Drinks]\n  Thank you so much for your help.

She struggles to find her friend to fulfill a promise they made about exploring the Nine Realms.\n However, the Elves have sequestered themselves to protect them from the Apocalypse and have no idea what has become of the outside world and the new dangers that have molded it.\nOne day, Oona and a few other rangers explore those new worlds and record what has become of them, the Old Gods and the new peoples that inhabit it.\nYou'll follow Oona from her childhood into adulthood over the first 3-4 issues. She is a character that will evolve and change, growing before your eyes through her experiences.\nBesides my love of Mythology, the After Realm is also inspired by my love of Saturday morning cartoons from the 80's, like Thundarr the Barbarian and obviously Dungeons and Dragons. This will be a dangerous but fun series.\nIf you missed the first issue, you can purchase it at your Local Comic Shop or through Comixology here:  https://www.comixology.com/The-After-Realm/comics-series/139271?ref=Y3JlYXRvci92aWV3L2Rlc2t0b3AvbGlzdC9jcmVhdG9yTGlzdA \nThis second issue  will be released from Image Comics in May of 2020, while you will get a chance to grab the same issue here with an exclusive cover just for you, the KICKSTARTER family at the same time as it comes out! -- My hope is this will be an ongoing series that lasts years, and I plan to deliver them each quarter, as a double sized 56 page issue here and through Image Comics.\nI am writing and drawing this myself, with colors by Taki Soma, best known for her work on Bitch Planet and several creator owned projects we've done together from United States of Murder inc, to Sinergy and Rapture.\nI've been working on this series secretly for several years as I've focused on Powers and Murder inc. -- I already have three issues of art FINISHED.

It is a paper cut out Triorama! There will be a PDF to print out yourself, with instructions of course.

You can count on me delivering as I've been a comics pro for nearly 30 years. Besides the success of Powers I'm well known for my work in fantasy and mythology comics from the Mice Templar, Hammer of the Gods, Red Sonja and several volumes of THOR for Marvel comics.\nI'm passionate and serious about this project.

That's why we make the Rolling Cat House, Koro Koro Neko!\nJust in case the cat loves sitting on it instead of staying inside\nStrong Icosahedral Shell\nA strong and rigid structure depends on triangles to achieve that goal even it's made of cardboard.

No cutting nor glue is required. Anyone can fold the Rolling Cat House from flat pack to the icosahedral shape.\nEnvironment\nWe care about the environment in the creative process.

Written by acclaimed industrial designer Christopher Armstrong, this book is the by-product of over a decade of practical, hands-on experience honed directly in the field of advanced research & development. Relying on the latest scientific methods in STEM and cutting edge R&D (Research and Development) practices from around the world, it delivers a comprehensive understanding on the use of manual  \"old-school\" tools of the trade, as well as \"new-school\" state-of-the-art technologies; featuring real-world case studies by top industry professionals in all areas of design, engineering, and filmmaking today. \nAfter launching in late 2018, the book was met with critical acclaim within the industrial design industry, ranking as the #1 Industrial Design book and Top Design Books of All Time by BookAuthority, and was featured in Iron & Air, Urban Workshop, and The Entrepreneur Motivation Podcast.\nNow for 2020, we need your help get this momentous book printed as a hardcover! Not only will this hardcover book have a beautifully updated black & gold foil cover design, it will also include 80 new pages of content as an updated & expanded GOLD edition. This is an absolutely essential resource for anyone wanting to achieve professional quality prototype results, with content that's accessible for everyone from beginner all the way to advanced / professional industry-level. \n What is the Maker Movement?\nThe Maker Movement represents a dramatic shift towards the democratization of design, engineering,  education, jobs and manufacturing. Advancements in new technologies such as desktop 3d printing and CNC machining are now putting powerful tools that were once only available to large institutions like NASA in the hands of millions of creators worldwide. This rapid pace of disruption is creating a paradigm shift and playing-field leveler like no other in history, opening up many new opportunities for independent makers and entrepreneurs that were once thought to be unimaginable. As a result, this is leading to what's known as the small-batch or \"lean manufacturing\" revolution giving rise to the \"maker\" and maker culture \u2014 the repercussions of which are so monumental, in fact, that it's often been compared to the countercultural revolution that pervaded the West in the 1960's.\nPut simply \u2014 the Maker Movement is a collective group of empowered individuals who are becoming much less dependent on large manufacturers for the production of their goods and services. Add to that an increasing level of interest and investment into corporate R&D (Research and Development) programs that are leveraging the use of new technologies as a way of gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace. All of these combined factors have placed an emphasis on STEM and engineering educations or skill-sets as the path forward to success in this new era of uncertainty and globalization \u2014 with tens of thousands grade-schools worldwide now rushing to build their own Makerspace facilities (now becoming hot commodities) out of both a fear of missing out, and in an attempt to stay out in front of this lighting-fast pace of change in today's volatile jobs marketplace. \nThis movement is also responsible for placing less emphasis on formal degrees, and more focus on practical problem-solving capabilities \u2014 that can be demonstrated through real life, project-based portfolios instead (or simply put, provability of results as evidenced by real-life examples and / or case studies; no complicated math formulae or academic theory needed). If you've seen Kickstarter (or similar crowdfunding platform) campaigns raise millions, or tens of millions of dollars on a relatively simple, scratch-built functional prototype alone \u2014 you've witnessed the full power of the Maker Movement firsthand.\n\n Updated & Expanded GOLD Edition Sneak Peek\n NEW 80+ pages of expanded content (290 pages in total), including content suited for those serious about pursuing a successful career in R&D (research and development) or who are looking to profit from a prototype to launch on Kickstarter. No stone has been left unturned, giving each individual maker or Startup entrepreneur the best chances of success and is easily comparable to tens of thousands of dollars worth of higher education costs in such industrial design, engineering, product development and model making fields:\nNEW 2020 GOLD expanded Table of Contents\nChapter 02 - Machines (1st ed. paperback content)\nChapter 03 - Hand Tools (1st ed. paperback content)\n\nChapter 04 - Materials (1st ed. paperback content)\nChapter 05 - Application (1st ed. paperback content)\n\n Expanded Advanced Projects section, showing step-by-step behind the scenes process of professional project case studies.\n Expanded R&D industry & jobs section, giving a holistic overview on how multidisciplinary teams function to bring successful products to market.\n NEW Index section added, along with a NEW expanded glossary of critical R&D industry terminology.\n NEW added section on mass manufacturing, which peels back the hood on how to bring a conceptual prototype design or invention to market. \n NEW color coded chapter section tabs and pro tips highlight boxes, to facilitate much easier reference & indexing:\n Expanded and massively updated 3d printing/additive manufacturing section, now featuring 30 new pages covering metal 3d printing, rubber polymers, HP Multijet Fusion, Polyjet and many others. This now makes The Maker's Field Guide the most comprehensive, exhaustively researched resource covering almost all of the different types of on 3d printing / additive manufacturing anywhere on the planet:\nNEW 2020 GOLD expanded content\nNEW 2020 GOLD expanded content\nNEW 2020 GOLD expanded content\n\nNEW 2020 GOLD expanded content\n\nNEW 2020 GOLD expanded content\n NEW beautiful black/gold foil hardcover format (11\" x 8.5\"), for lasting durability & shelf life (just like a quality watch you'd want to pass on down to your grandkids!): \n Current Project Status \nWhere we are currently at: we've already negotiated pricing and delivery terms with our book printing factory. Because we are also the publisher on this title, we can assure that both quality and delivery will be accelerated, as we have eliminated the need to go through an intermediary to produce, market, and secure distribution of the book on our behalf. \nThe book is complete and ready to go to production once funds are released from Kickstarter. In order to publish the book, we need to get at least 300 collective book pledges or the equivalent funds from other backer levels.\nOnce the campaign ends and our factory has the order, the books will take approximately 9 weeks from initial production until delivery. Shipping accounts for 5 weeks of that time.\n Use of Funds\nBy backing this campaign, you will help to give us the resources needed to finance an initial production large enough to meet our manufacturer's minimum requirement. The goal of funding is to finance an initial production run of printed hardcover books, which will be distributed directly through www.themakersfieldguide.com and also through Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other major book retailers. An order must be placed that's a large enough satisfy the offset printer\u2019s requirements in order to set up the large metal plates (dyes) used in the offset printing process \u2014 which is industry-standard for full color photography books like this one. Once the books have been printed, they will be shipped to our regional location in Southern California, where they will be made available for sale throughout the USA and Canada, with possible plans of international distribution in the future depending on the level of demand from other territories outside of North America. \nThe higher the amount of total funding received also equates to a much larger printing quantity available for distribution, where the educational impact of the book will have the ability to spread across a much larger surface area both domestically and abroad.  \nStretch Goals: \n **Please see Updates #11/#12 & updates at top of project page. Made in the USA production will be possible above $32,000 in funding. USA production will also shorten the overall production and shipping timelines, allowing backer deliveries to be processed much faster (by at least 2-4 weeks). \n\nTiming \nMake no mistake \u2014 while the timing of this Kickstarter campaign is a little \"unique\" given the COVID-19 situation worldwide, the hardcover edition of this book has been a a plan of mine even before the outbreak. Because over 10 million workers have been displaced in the USA alone, this is a time for people who may be struggling to find a source of income. Therefore, the Maker Movement represents is one possible solution of empowering a new wave of entrepreneurs and independent creators to rise up, weather the storm, and to produce new products, innovations or solutions to important problems \u2014 in ways that have never been seen before (which, society will be the ultimate beneficiary of). \nOptimistically, more than a few groups of open-sourced, decentralized maker communities have made headlines recently, by showcasing to the world their ability to quickly and adaptively contribute innovative solutions to the recent PPE shortages experienced by hospitals. The implications of this type of cross-collaboration on a design & manufacturing front reach far beyond the current situation we are facing. See this fantastic editorial by the NY Times:  Coronavirus is Straining Hospitals. Here's How Innovators Are Helping. | NYT News. \nBillionaire Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban is one of the voices of optimism, and has even publicly stated recently that the next 10, 15, or 25 companies that go on to change the world will be starting during these challenging times. In his mind, and in the minds of many other prominent business & investing thought leaders, it is the spirit of entrepreneurial problem solving, innovation, and a dogged persistence that remain the fundamental economic drivers of a nation like America \u2014 and will all be key factors in our ability to come out of this pandemic stronger than ever. And, because of the quarantine measures being implemented in many locations, what better opportunity than ever to spend this time reading and learning something new!\n About Christopher\nChristopher Armstrong is an acclaimed industrial designer and product developer, having held senior leadership positions on multiple Advanced R&D / Special Projects teams.

All pricing and timeline needs have been thoroughly negotiated with and approved by our printing manufacturer, for both USA and international production.\n\nThat said, final timeline and backer deliveries may be slightly effected due to the current COVID-19 situation worldwide. Our manufacturer continues to remain fully operational (both domestically and internationally), and we have made our best estimates regarding the timing of fulfillment and shipping. USPS is running slower than usual, and it is possible that circumstances beyond our control could potentially effect and/or delay our production and shipping dates. Currently, the 9 week production + shipping timeline accounts for up to a few thousand units. However, if this blows way past these expectations (a welcomed problem), we will make all efforts to produce the orders in batched quantities, then mail them out as they are completed. We will make every effort to keep backers informed along at all steps along the way if any problems/delays were to arise.\n\nIn order to publish the book, we need to get at least 300 collective book pledges or the equivalent funds from other backer levels. Please note that there are a handful of countries that we are not able to ship to: Ascension; Bolivia; Falkland Islands; Republic of North Korea; and Somalia.

Importation procedures/speeds vary from country to country. For instance, there were about five different backers who had not received their shipments in the Netherlands. In some cases, packages have taken over after Asendia (the 3rd party tracking aggregator assigned to most packages by my fulfillment partner) shows they arrived in-country or were marked as 'delivered.' Unfortunately, Asendia does not provide real-time updates like a first party shipper would. If you still have not received your package, my suggestion is to follow up with your local shipping authorities directly. You can do this by contacting the largest regional shipper in your select country and see if they can track it down.

This is why USA orders have  been given priority over international backer orders.

The towns are overcrowded. Food is expensive. Guilds control trade; nobles control the taxes while priests pray for our damned souls.\nOut there, beyond those walls, are beasts, bogies, monsters. They inhabit the forests, live under the fields, dwell in the ruins of our burned-out fortresses. They kidnap the lone wanderer, harry our caravans, and when they are bold, they attack our towns.\nThis land is wild, untamable, and in it we struggle to survive. We who thought we could conquer it, subjugate it\u2014we are guests here, our days numbered.  \nNew to Torchbearer? Read Thor's primer here. Download our introductory chapter here. And our work-in-progress character sheet here. \nA Second Edition: One Book Becomes Three\nWe have been hard at work on a new edition of Torchbearer for over three years now. Based on the feedback we received from you and from our own campaigns and demos since we launched in 2013, we wanted to make a couple of tweaks to the game. Well, those \"couple of tweaks\" rapidly spiraled into a massive revision. Check it out:\nNew format and layout! The game is now a two-book set: The Dungeoneer\u2019s Handbook and The Scholar\u2019s Guide \nClarified, revised, refined and expanded rules from seven years of playtesting and feedback\nThe Dungeoneer's Handbook\n275 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper!\nRevised character creation which includes tighter Nature question results\nRevised leveling costs\n10 levels for all classes (up from 5), including revised benefits for levels 1-5\nNew class: Theurge, a mad seer possessed by the immortals\nNew arcane spell memorization system, The Memory Palace\nNew divine magic system, The Immortal Burden\nNew invocations and spells with revised, clarified format\nA Scholar's Guide to Dangers Various and Sundry\n332 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper! \nNew easy-to-process difficulty factors format throughout\nRevised skill format\u2014much easier to parse\nRevised and clarified reward system\nIconic monsters all in a revised, cleaner format \nNew loot tables\u2014with more treasure!\nNew camp and town events (they're so good!)\nNew demo adventure: Revised and updated Dread Crypt of Skogenby! \nThe Lore Master\u2019s Manual\nWe came up with so many new rules and ideas around the game that they wouldn't fit in two books. So we're offering a third book full of optional material for the game. It includes:\n200 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper! \nNew class: the thief, go from a knife-wielding cutthroat to the shadowy power that rules this town\nNew class:  the shaman, fueled by the Immortals of Beasts, channeling their wild power\nNew stock: the Troll Changeling; they're part troll, part human and all trouble\nNew conflicts: Banish, Abjure, Bind and Battle\nNew settlements like Borderland Fortress, Shire and Walled Town\nLots and lots of gear in a comprehensive list\nRules for making base camps\u2014good for tackling those megadungeons. \nEconomic rules so you can crash the economy of your town\nTravel rules\nSimple guidance on town adventures\nMore spells and invocations\nMore monsters!\nWild new rules for spiritual quests \nAnd more!     \nBooks are not enough to express the full majesty of Torchbearer.  We have revised and refined our action card deck as well as the equipment and light cards. The game master screen has been updated to include the revised edition information. And we're adding metal coins, custom wooden dice and a wooden card holder on top of all of that. \nBut these items are not merely gorgeous swag to adorn your gaming shelf, we have designed each of these items to be a useful, efficient part of the Torchbearer experience at the table:\nAction cards facilitate conflicts, making them move more smoothly.\nEquipment, condition and light cards offer easy reading of your current load out for you and for the rest of the table.\nUse the coins as a prop for loot or use them to track light during an expedition or hit points during a conflict.\nThe dice are marked to clearly represent the 4+ target number of Torchbearer, but we've also included pips so you can use them to roll for armor and on tables! Dragons for scoundrels, axes for successes and the sun for a 6. \nAnd the card holder ties it all together. You can drop your action and equipment cards into the slots on the left. While on the right you can use your copper, silver or gold coins to track your light and hit points.  \nFeasting Table pledge tier items (yes we know we need more dice)\nMetal coins shown here by Campaign Coins. This is what you'll get in your set!\nYou can pledge for one of our bundles or\u2014ominous horns sound\u2014you can add these items onto your individual pledges. We even made a chart for you, because it wouldn't be Torchbearer without one\u2026       \nupdated 5 PM EDT 4/21\nThese are prototypes of our dice!\nYou\u2019re a scoundrel, a villain, a wastrel, a vagabond, a criminal, a sword-for-hire, a cutthroat.\nRespectable people belong to guilds, the church or are born into nobility. Or barring all that, they\u2019re salt of the earth and till the land for the rest of us.\nYour problem is that you\u2019re none of that. You\u2019re a third child or worse. You can\u2019t get into a guild\u2014too many apprentices already. You\u2019re sure as hell not nobility\u2014even if you were, your older brothers and sisters have soaked up the inheritance. If you\u2019re cursed with visions from the Immortals, the temples won\u2019t take you in. You question their authority and subvert their power, so you are outcast like the rest of us.\nAnd if you ever entertained romantic notions of home-steading, think again. You\u2019d end up little more than a slave to a wealthy noble.\nSo there\u2019s naught for you but to make your own way. There\u2019s a certain freedom to it, but it\u2019s a hard life. Cash flows out of your hands as easily as the blood from your wounds.\nBut at least it\u2019s your life.\nAnd if you\u2019re lucky, smart and stubborn, you might come out on top. There\u2019s a lot of lost loot out there for the finding. And salvage law is mercifully generous. You find it, it\u2019s yours to spend, sell or keep.\nA Roleplaying Game of Desperate Adventure\nTorchbearer is a roleplaying game of desperate adventure. The expeditions you undertake are taxing on your body, your mind and your very nature. To survive, you must carefully manage your food, water and light resources. To excel, you must fight for what you believe in. To prosper, you must fill your bags with loot and treasure.\nThis triumvirate of competing needs creates a delicious tension unique to Torchbearer. Players are asked to weigh these forces in every decision they make. Some may seem easy or frivolous to start, but the deeper you become enmeshed in an adventure, the heavier and more costly each decision becomes. \nVarg, Karolina and Beren by Jordan Worley\nThe system is based on our award-winning Mouse Guard roleplaying game system. Using the same core rules, character builds and conflict system, we have created a grimmer, harsher world. One that can stand the test of time, providing you with years of adventures.  \nSystem Preview\nEager to dive right in and create an adventurer?

Check out Luke's new currency cycle diagrams.\nTorchbearer has been in print since 2013. Over the years, we've had a goodly number of folks play the game. Some of them even liked it. Perhaps the words of these wise sages will convince you to join our cause:\n\u201cTorchbearer has actually become my favourite system ever for fostering role-playing on a long-term basis\u2026 If you like your roleplaying dark and brooding, and it\u2019s been a while since you shanked a kobold, this book is absolutely worth your time.\u201d \u2014 Shut Up and Sit Down\n\u201cA roleplaying game where adventurers are filthy, choices are meaningful, and light is as precious as loot.\u201d \u2014 Team Covenant\n\u201cPlaying Torchbearer feels a bit like a good roll in mud: In the moment everything is sticky, wet, and slimy, but that\u2019s kind of the point, right? If you\u2019re even for a second serious about your nostalgia for \u20183d6 line roll\u2019 D&D...you owe it to yourself to play or run Torchbearer.\u201d \u2014 Cannibal Halfling Gaming\n\u201cA combat-laden adventure, far from civilization. This is a survival game... even a rat bite can ruin your day.\u201d \u2014 Gamasutra \nAs we grow in wisdom and experience, we gain levels! And when we benefit, so do you all. We shall share with you all whatever bounty we reap:     \nWE F-ING DID IT! GOLD! I GET MY GOLD TIPPED PAGES!\nOur cover artist for the Dungeoneer's Handbook is Arik Roper. Arik is a massively talented artist living in Brooklyn. He's done some of our favorite covers for some of our favorite bands: Earth, High on Fire and SLEEP. When we heard he was available we hunted him down in the wilds of Brooklyn and made the most dignified pitch we could muster.   \nFortunately for us, Arik has a soft spot for nerds with dark, weird dreams. He signed on not only to do the cover but a number of interiors as well. We're honored to have him as a part of our adventuring band. Maybe if this goes well we can talk him into doing more work for us\u2026  \nOur music track\u2014In Tenebris Lux\u2014was composed specifically for this project. It is a collaboration between Bismuth and Vile Creature. \nVic + KW: Vocals\nTanya: drum programming, bass, synth, vocals, mixing, mastering\nOur video was orchestrated by the Master Burner, Chris Allingham using art by Kurt Komoda and Jordan Worley.  \nWe are are small group of friends living in New York and New Jersey (and Helsinki). We have been making roleplaying games since 2002. \nWe have created/designed/published: The Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, Mouse Guard, FreeMarket, Torchbearer, Inheritance and Miseries & Misfortunes. \nWe strive to make baroque games contained in beautiful books.   \nThe Burning Wheel Gold Revised Edition\nAnd we have won numerous awards for our games: Origins awards, Golden Geeks, Indie RPG awards, even a thing called an Outie that Ken Hite gave us back in 2003.\nOur Beliefs\n We love roleplaying games. If you ask us, you\u2019ll hear us go on and on about how and why we love them.\n We make games we want to play and we play them as much as we can before releasing them. Corollary to that, we play by the rules we design, and design our rules to be used. A game cannot be experienced through reading it, and though our games often come in the form of books, they are meant to be played, not read. \n Each of our games is an attempt to say something new about the art of roleplaying games and game design in general. Each of our games is an iteration of the last, built on the experience of players at the table in an attempt to advance the state of the art in a small way.\n We speak through our work. Our thoughts, concerns and questions about the world around us are expressed in our work. Rather than editorializing or explaining, we prefer to let the work speak for itself. If you disagree with ideas presented in our games, it is our hope that you design a game to express your own concerns.\n We love our fans. We thrive on hearing about how you play, and talking with you about our games and games in general. That said, and this is a hard thing to say, we make games for us, not you. We hope our games will challenge and fascinate you, not cater to or coddle you.\n We are unconcerned with popularity or convention and will sacrifice a great deal in service of a compelling idea. Though it\u2019s painful to admit, we accept that our games will likely never be popular with a broad audience.\nYou can read more about our Beliefs and Instincts here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWelcome friend\n\nWe begin today another adventure with Burning Wheel Headquarters. We have been creating and publishing games since 2002 and we love to surprise and delight our fans. Let us run through some risks and challenges both for us and you on this project.\n\nWe have never failed to deliver on a project, but we are launching into an extremely uncertain world now. We wouldn't launch unless we had every item buttoned up\u2014and we do\u2014but still, anything can happen.\n\nWe always under-promise and over-deliver. That is a challenge for us. Whatever you see on this page, we want to deliver it to you in an even more magnificent form. We don't know exactly what that will be, but as I said, we aim to surprise and delight.\n\nSomething always goes wrong. Always. For past projects it has been shipping cock-ups, misprints and Luke & Thor feuding over design for four years. For this project who knows what will go wrong? Something will, but we will handle it. We always do.\n\nThis is our biggest project to date with the most gaming material combined with the most moving parts. We feel like we're ready to begin the long process of getting this game to you. That said, we have no idea what we're doing, but we have excellent partners and 20 years of experience in delivering really good games.\n\nShipping is complicated, slow and expensive. It just is. We've done our best to find the fastest, safest and cheapest solutions for you (pick two). If shipping is too expensive for you, we respect your economical opinion, but there is no way we can satisfy your needs in this matter. \n\nAnd lastly, we present to you the biggest challenge of this project: We seek allied adventurers and other brave souls to join our band and assist us on this great quest. If you can carry a pack, heft a spear or bear a torch as part of our adventuring band, then we welcome you on our quest. We are in dire need of such friends. \n\nBe courageous: Join us and help hold aloft a burning beacon to drive back the weird darkness of this world. \n\nAgents of chaos need not apply, any who do shall be cast into the abyss.\n\nOnward,\n\u2014Luke, Thor & BWHQ\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur books are built to last years of wear and tear at the table and in your backpacks.

Thank you for your support. All extra funds will go towards purchasing materials so that we can donate more shields to our community, and to our volunteers who are experiencing a loss of income due to COVID-19.\nOur goal was to make hundreds of face shields, but we've had requests for thousands. These detailed tutorials will help us share our process and procedures so that we can enlist more makers in fulfilling the demand we've received. We also hope that this is helpful to other communities who are banding together to make PPE.\nOur design is durable, reusable, can be made quickly, and only requires basic tools to make. This means that more makers will have the capabilities to produce it at a faster rate, and medical staff can clean the all-plastic design and reuse them instead of throwing them away, reducing waste and the need for larger quantities.\nThe Tutorials\nI\u2019m asking for your support to make 3 tutorials:\nHow to make our design including templates, materials, and tips and tricks so that anyone can be successful in making one - or many!\n  How to organize a team, and the process for the sanitary production of the shields in hopes that other teams can do the same.\n  Alternate materials that can work to make a shield for home use.\n\nProject Journey\nI make tech-craft kits, and so I keep many craft supplies in stock. When I saw that our medical workers were facing a shortage of face shields, I looked at my box of headbands and thought \"I can easily make a face shield with these!\" \nMy first prototype was made of headbands and duct tape. This design has been getting a lot of attention on YouTube from people who want to make their own:   \nFor Version 2, I looked for materials that could be sanitized for re-use because our local hospital told us that they were re-using shields that were supposed to be one-time-use, and they were deteriorating quickly. I decided to try screws and bolts: \nOur final design replaces the screws with zip ties because zip ties are cheaper and faster to assemble. The design also includes an optional cover for over the top of the head, or, we suggest the use of foam between the headbands. We are also suggesting that clinicians use tourniquet bands as an elastic, but hair ties work as well.  \nThe Zip Tie Connection\nThe head cover design process\nGet Involved\nLocal Jersey City makers!

I figured, this is what will hopefully be a first volume, so why not have \"One\" in the title. And what number \"One\" has the most significance in an RPG? That dreaded dice roll! How many times have you been trying to perform an easy task and suffered the \"Critical Miss\". \nFor instance, trying to make an incredibly easy jump over a small chasm.\n Or trying to draw your sword more quickly than your opponent.\n Game Masters can really make that simple task humorous.\nAnd if you don't think stuff like this can happen (and has happened) in a session of D&D or Pathfinder before... just go and ask a player. \n The real question is... why not?\nIf we can't poke fun at ourselves, who can we poke fun at? And this is definitely poking fun at the stuff that we as gamers all enjoy. Imagine those silly and sarcastic comments made by the players actually being things their characters say in the game. Imagine those crazy situations that come up while playing being illustrated. This is what this book is about, and this is why we created it.

My sketchbooks are filled with silly things that I like to draw. A few months ago I found myself drawing apes as they would appear in the line waiting to get through airport security. Wouldn\u2019t that make a marvelous jigsaw puzzle?\nWhy a jigsaw puzzle? Puzzles are great because you can do them alone or with others. You get to set the pace. You can do the whole puzzle in one marathon session or drag the effort out over weeks. Solving a puzzle sharpens your cognitive skills and helps you learn to focus on details. Snapping a puzzle piece into position feels good and probably releases a flood of endorphins. How nice. And jigsaw puzzles don\u2019t require any batteries, instruction manuals, or wifi.\nMore than 100 primates and a few aliens being extruded through the indignities of air travel.\nWhat makes a puzzle great? I believe the best jigsaw puzzles have three vital qualities. First, lots of color. Next, oodles of details. No boring expanses of sky or snow. Last, a good puzzle is puzzling\u2014a little mysterious and full of false clues, duplicates, and distractions.\nI designed the APES AND ALIENS puzzle to give you abundant colors, beguiling details, and mild mystery. \nHow big is the finished puzzle? There are 1,000 puzzle pieces. Once you put the Apes and Aliens puzzle together, it will measure 19.75\" x 29\" (50 cm x 70 cm).\nHow difficult is this puzzle? Challenging, but not so exasperating that you will have to be institutionalized. We included an overview of the whole image on the box lid and base, so you and a friend can both refer to it while working on the puzzle. If you believe the puzzle is too easy, try solving it without referring to the image on the box. If it is still too easy, do it blindfolded.\nPuzzles make great gifts because they are easy to wrap.\nWhere are these puzzles going to be made? These puzzles will be made at Sarah's XZY puzzle workshop in China. (We know that sounds like a made-up name, but it\u2019s real.) Printed on specially made, heavy puzzle board to prevent delaminating and reduce paper dust. Housed in a sturdy clear poly bag and nestled in a robust two-piece box with an image of the finished puzzle on both the lid and base. \nMy two previous jigsaw puzzles in Kickstarter were smaller. Now they are rare collectibles.\n*******\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of this puzzle will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get puzzles there.\nSometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your puzzles in their luggage next trip.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nCan you find all the aliens?\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com.

While my condition doesn't seem to be getting any better with recent flare ups, there's something else that has had me concerned: my strong urge to avoid the mirror.   \nTo confront my feelings, I did an experiment. For 15 days, I decided to proactively look into the mirror instead of escaping it, without any cover-up. Could I change the way I looked at my depigmented skin? \nSame, same then why different?\nI had a revelation: the option of feeling neither positive, nor negative, but neutral about my Vitiligo. The idea of body neutrality and recognising that I don't have to embrace or feel positive about my Vitiligo has been an enlightening journey of acceptance, and has taken a lot of pressure off of me. \nNot feeling great about your skin is okay, and accepting that can be liberating. My experiment didn't result in any drastic results, but it changed my perspective towards my skin. Through my experiences in the book, I hope to empower people who've felt any shame about their skin, body or any other aspect about their physical appearance.\nTimes are hard, I want to help.\nMy book focuses on body image and acceptance, but the struggles through my journey strongly resonate what we're all currently dealing with: spiralling thoughts, isolation, hopelessness and anxiety. I hope this book can comfort you through my struggles, and make you smile with my candid humour. I'm making it available as an e-book first, so it can reach you faster! \nInside the e-book\nThe 50+ page e-book takes a reader through my always real, often funny, and sometimes dark thoughts and self-talk in front of a mirror. \nI'm collaborating with a fun-loving illustrator based out of Mumbai, Ria Patel, to give my experiences more texture and colour. Each day comes alive through a combination of carefully thought-out words and imagery. We're making sure the e-book has an enjoyable reading experience across all devices: phones, tablets and computers :)\nAn enjoyable reading experience with a mix of words and imagery!\nCover up, buttercup\nWhere your funds go\nA big part of your contributions will go towards making the e-book engaging and overall, a high-quality experience. The tools and experts we invest in, along with the time and effort we put in, add up towards the cost of the book. We've also reworked our pricing and format to make it more accessible during these times :)\nThis project goes way beyond a Kickstarter campaign, but this is where it begins. This is where I commit to spreading a message that is often not spoken about. It needs more attention and awareness, and you can help make that happen!\nYour contributions towards this book would mean empowering others (and yourselves) to feel more comfortable with their skin --> body --> themselves. \nSwift delivery to your (e)mailboxes  \nUs creators...in the time of quarantine\nOn the left is Ria, my talented, fun-loving cousin I grew up with. We're coming back full circle with this project. She has a background in communication design and illustration and loves to spend her time viewing the world with an artistic and often, humorous lens. \nAnd the other is me, an Interaction Design graduate student at the School of Visual Arts, New York City. A very personal project, it's the closest I've ever come to my Vitiligo and although very often triggering, it's been empowering and healing.\nLike a lot of you, we're quarantined and still digesting the strange (and terrifying) world we\u2019re currently living in. Working on this book keeps us sane.\nHelp spread awareness about #BodyNeutrality\nHaving admired all the brave and beautiful people who embrace their skin imperfections, feeling positive about mine seemed like the only way to go. But, I found it incredibly hard. And the more I couldn't embrace it, the more I felt bad about not being able to. \nThe profound revelation of body neutrality helped me see things differently.

For the past 9 years, Saint Vitus has been central to the metal & music community in Brooklyn, and we're using this Kickstarter as a means of working through this unusual time. Think of this page as a virtual Vitus, and our way of keeping Vitus alive until we can hang out in person again.\nOf course, Vitus isn't Vitus without the people who regularly come through here. So, we reached out to our community to help us keep things interesting while we're all staying home to help flatten the curve, and we're going to have a bunch of unique rewards available to our backers. We will have everything from limited edition merch, instrument lessons with some of your favorite musicians, photography, DJ mixes, artwork, and rare one-off items unearthed from our basement. These items will only be available to people who pledge to this fundraiser and we will be posting new stuff a few times a week, so keep checking this space! \nWe got into this game because we've been involved in all facets of the scene. We're musicians, we're bartenders, we're sound guys & gals, we're photographers, we're artists, but before we were any of that, we were fans. We're honored to be a part of this weird, loud community and we want to make sure that Vitus continues to serve it after the pandemic. We know that we can do it (after all, how many show reviews have you seen where bands have \"leveled\" or \"destroyed\" Saint Vitus?), but we'll need your help to get there. \nWe wouldn't be what we are without you. Thank you for the continued support over the past 9 years.\nAnd for the love of Satan...\nWash your hands! Stop touching your face!\nArty, George, Dave and the Saint Vitus Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe timeline for when we'll be able to reopen is uncertain (you know that). We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated as the situation evolves. We've set the goal where it is in the hopes that this ensures that the project gets funded, but would love to surpass the amount we set (and who knows, maybe we'll add some cool stretch rewards!). All our rewards will be printed locally by Made In Brooklyn Silkscreeners. Please expect at least 2 weeks from the close of the fundraiser for the rewards to be printed, and to start being shipped. And of course, if for some reason these weird-as-hell times affect the delivery of your rewards, we'll let you know as soon as we do. Thank you for your patience and your support.

A tv series adaptation of Tales From the Loop was launched just a few days  ago on Amazon Prime Video.\nNow, you can take another step into the amazing world of the Loop. In Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame, 1-5 players take the roles of teenagers who investigate the mysteries originating from the Loop, a huge underground science facility with strange effects on the suburban landscapes around it \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re home in time for dinner!\nTales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame is designed by Martin Takaichi and includes high-quality miniatures by Paolo Parente's Dust Studio.\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nArt by Simon St\u00e5lenhag\nIn 1954, the government ordered the construction of the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator. The facility was completed in 1969, located deep below the pastoral suburban countryside, outside of the big city. The local population called this marvel of technology the Loop. Over the years since it was built, strange phenomena have started to appear in the area - mysterious creatures stalking the land, machines malfunctioning in inexplicable ways.\nIn the Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, you take the roles of local kids and play cooperatively to investigate whatever phenomena that threaten the islands (or perhaps just the local video store), and hopefully stop them. Each day starts at school, but as soon as the bell rings you can use whatever time you have before dinner and homework to go exploring! Player actions are integrated, meaning there\u2019s no downtime as you wait for others taking their turn. It also makes cooperating with your fellow players dynamic as you can react to things that happen in a turn and don\u2019t have to plan it all out from the start.\nAt least four scenarios will be included in the base game (more can be unlocked as stretch goals), and each scenario takes approximately 90-150 minutes to complete.\nFull Setup of Prototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nAll the components of the core game are listed below. More components can be added if stretch goals are unlocked:\nMiniature produced by Dust Studios based on Simon St\u00e5lenhag's design\nThe Loop isn\u2019t the only technological achievement in the \u201880s that never was. Advanced AI, robotics and magnetrine development are highly advanced as well. Riksenergi, the governmental agency tasked with running The Loop, employs different machines to automate a large number of functions on the islands. While some have drivers or handlers, most are running on their internal AI code.\nIn Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, these machines are represented by beautiful miniatures sculpted by Yannick Hennebo based on St\u00e5lenhag's original designs and manufactured by Dust Studios. They are molded in high-quality PVC plastic and are between 25 and 40mm tall. You can buy extra minis as addons, check the Addons section below.\nIn the STANDARD EDITION, the miniatures are delivered unpainted. In the DELUXE EDITION, the miniatures are delivered PRE-PAINTED by Dust Studio.\nMiniature prototypes by Dust Studio - not final product\nADDON MINIATURE SCENARIO PACKS\nIn addition to the machine minis included in the core set, you can add models of a Gorgosaurus dinosaur and the \"Visitor\" robot, along with scenarios to use them with, Addons to your order - check the Addons section below. Each pack includes a model and 20-30 Scenario Cards. The Gorgosaurus and the Visitor are available unpainted or pre-painted by Dust Studio.\nBelow is a video demonstration showing what a turn can look like in the game, by lead designer Martin Takaichi. It doesn\u2019t go into detail about every rule (there\u2019s the downloadable rulebook for that, see below) but gives you a good sense about how the game flows and general gameplay.\nTo let you to try out Tales from the Loop \u2013 The Board Game for yourself, we\u2019ve decided to provide a Print & Play kit for download. It doesn\u2019t contain everything that will be in the final game, but four characters and one scenario is enough to play the game with three other friends! If you just want to read the beta rules the rulebook is available for download.\nDo keep in mind that this is in only a prototype in Alpha state \u2013 things can and will change from the P&P version to the final version. In fact, that\u2019s another reason we wanted to do this, to get feedback from you so we can make the game the best it can be. Use this survey to provide feedback and report on errors.\nLINK TO THE PRINT AND PLAY FILES\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nIn addition, backer Timothy Clark has made two excellent videos that go through how to set up the Alpha and pretty much all the rules for the game in a clear and engaging way. If the Alpha rules PDF put you off, or you simply prefer to learn by example, do check out these two videos:\nAs we have passed our base funding goal, we will be able to expand the games with stretch goals.

His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian and American landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world. Tales from the Loop was ranked one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias\u201d by The Guardian, along with such works as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nMartin Takaichi has been a board game enthusiast since first discovering Drakborgen (aka DungeonQuest) in 1985. Over the years he made a slow transition from not only playing games but first modifying them and then designing them as well. The first published game where he was part of the design team was Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game.\nThe design team beyond Simon and Martin consists of project manager Tomas H\u00e4renstam (lead designer of Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game and roleplaying games ALIEN, Forbidden Lands and Mutant: Year Zero), map artist Reine Rosenberg, graphic designer Christian Granath, co-designer Nils Karl\u00e9n, and last but not least Paolo Parente and his Dust Studio who produce the miniatures as well as all physical components of the game.  Dust is an acclaimed manufacturer of quality miniatures since 2005, producing their own Dust 1947 line as well as miniatures for board game companies like CMON, Monolith and Mythic Games.\nFree League Publishing is a Swedish publisher dedicated to speculative fiction. We have published a range of award-winning and critically acclaimed tabletop roleplaying games, board games and art books set in strange and wondrous worlds.\nOur game range include the recently launched official ALIEN RPG, the Tales from the Loop RPG (winner of five ENnie Awards 2017, including Best Game), sandbox retro fantasy Forbidden Lands (winner of four ENnie Awards 2019), postapocalyptic Mutant: Year Zero (Silver ENnie for Best Rules 2015), space opera Coriolis - The Third Horizon (Judge's Spotlight Award 2017), dark fantasy Symbaroum, and Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game.\nWe have also published the art books Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood  by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, as well as the illustrated edition of the Lovecraft classic The Call of Cthulhu by French artist Fran\u00e7ois Baranger.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you pledge on Kickstarter you put your trust in a project before it is completed and you contribute, with this trust, to making Tales From the Loop - The Board Game a reality.

These are difficult and uncertain times, and at present, our international distribution of physical products has been temporarily suspended due to restrictions following the outbreak of the Corona virus.

The budget and the people will remain the same for the production, but they will invest in promotion, vinyl production etc.."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Going into the studio, and release on danish label Stunt", "update_content": "Dear everyone!

Although a few pieces of video game music already have been recorded and performed, we at VGM Classics feel that more of them deserve such treatment and attention. Indeed, we established VGM Classics as an American company with the goal of wanting \u201cto have more orchestral recordings of the video game music that we love and admire.\u201d\nOur first project, Symphonic Tale: The Rune of Beginning (Music from Suikoden II), was successfully completed thanks to support from backers at Kickstarter. In March 2020, we were gratified to learn that the recording was nominated in the Cover/Remix category of the 18th Game Audio Network Guild Awards.\nFor this crowdfunding of a new orchestral recording, we chose the music from Stardew Valley. \nStardew Valley is a simulation role-playing game developed by Eric \u201cConcernedApe\u201d Barone and released in 2016. In Stardew Valley, each player takes the role of a person who is given ownership of his or her deceased grandfather's farm in Stardew Valley. This game is open-ended: it allows players to take on activities such as farming, fishing, raising livestock, crafting goods, mining for ores and gems, and socializing with the people in the Valley. The music in the game was composed by the developer himself to enhance and complete the peaceful and fantastic world that the players inhabit.\nThe Crowdfunding and the Pledge Goal\nWe originally started this project without crowdfunding in mind. We did several recording sessions in Budapest, Hungary, in mid-March 2020. Unfortunately, we could not complete our music director\u2019s original plan, because of the coronavirus crisis. Therefore, we had to cancel some sessions and leave the country early because the Hungarian government banned many public activities: it shut down music studios and concert halls and placed sever restrictions on who could enter and leave the country.\nAs of now, we have recorded about 25 to 28 minutes of music. Therefore, we could release a CD that would be classified a \u201cmedium\u201d album (20 to 36 minutes of music) as opposed to a full album (30 to 54 minutes of music) and/or an extended album (40 to 72 minutes of music). So, this crowdfunding would be more like a pre-sale. However, if we are able, we hope to finish the originally planned performance of over 40 minutes of music.\nWe have set a pledge goal of $1500 for releasing the current recordings in a pressed/replicated CD, with an extended pledge goal of $20,000 for additional recording sessions to complete our music director\u2019s vision.\nThe Pledge Levels\nLevel 1, Fan = $15 for an mp3 (download);\nLevel 2, HD Fan = $25 for an HD FLAC (HD/Hi-Res audio files download);\nLevel 3, Supporter = $30 for a pressed CD;\nLevel 4, Founder = $50 for a pressed CD, FLAC (HD/Hi-Res audio files), and a credit listing in the CD booklet;\nLevel 5, Producer = $170 for a pressed CD, FLAC (HD/Hi-Res audio files), a credit listing in the CD booklet, and access to a full orchestral score book.\nAn mp3 file is at 320kbps, and a FLAC file is at 96kHz/24bit. Supporter, Founder, and Producer level patrons can buy extra pressed CDs for $25 each: simply add the appropriate amount for what you want when you pledge. In addition, Founder and Producer level participants\u2019 names (actual name or desired pseudonym) will be acknowledged with a listing in the pressed CD booklet. Producer level patrons also will receive a printed music book of the conductor\u2019s full orchestral score in A4 (similar to US letter size).\nOur Musician\nOur music director, Mr. Kentaro Sato, again has transformed the instrumentally and artistically restricted original melodies into a wonderful full concert orchestral medium.  \nMr. Sato conducts the London Symphony Orchestra at the Abbey Road Studios\n We strongly urge you to listen to his work on our first album or on orchestral and choral music from video game titles such as the DISSIDIA Final Fantasy series, \u201cFinal Fantasy Type-0,\u201d \u201cGhost Recon AW 1&2,\u201d and some of the \u201cMedal of Honor\u201d titles. There you will see why we chose him as our music director, and why he is considered to be one of the best composers/arrangers/conductors in the industry.\nOur orchestra again is the Budapest Symphony Orchestra (BPSO). BPSO was founded in 1992 by members of the Hungarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (HRSO) for projects and activities outside their usual performance and broadcast duties. Over the years, BPSO has provided wonderful orchestral settings for many classical music, film, and television productions.   \nthe Budapest Symphony Orchestra\n   Here is a preview video from our first orchestral recording \"Symphonic Tale: The Rune of Beginning,\" by Mr. Sato & BPSO!  \n Creating a new orchestral recording of video game music is a very difficult endeavor in this day and age. We hope you will support our projects and activities so that we can bring more new and wonderful orchestral video game music into reality! VGM Classics is for video game fans and concert ensemble lovers. We will do our best to make your wishes come true.\nSincerely\nVGM Classics \n =======================================\nVGM Classics

album, the risks of this crowdfunding are minimal. However, if the extended pledge were met, we still would have to consider the coronavirus crisis before we proceeded to the additional recording. As of the end of March 2020, the Hungarian government has restricted major public activities and gatherings, and the orchestra has stopped all activities until mid-April 2020 at least, and, depending on the virus crisis, that might extend.

Prohibition, the Constitutional ban on the sale of alcohol in the United States, comes into effect.... And business couldn't be better at the Little Daisy Cafe.\nBut things aren't what they seem. Atlas May, proprietor, uses the charming little restaurant as a front for his real cash cow; the Lackadaisy speakeasy, where flashing the club symbol from a deck of cards grants everykitty in-the-know access to more moonshine than they could ever drink. Life is good... Until Atlas is murdered in cold blood.\nNow, it's 1927. Mitzi, Atlas' widow, struggles to keep Lackadaisy afloat, as the patrons drift away and a skeleton crew of staff sticks by her side. Scrappy young musician/rum-runner Rocky Rickaby, his wide-eyed but tightly-wound cousin Freckle McMurray, and the endlessly resourceful and sharp-tongued Ivy Pepper, heiress to the quickly-dwindling Lackadaisy fortune, are forced to make do in a world of increasingly unfriendly competition, intent on shooting, smuggling, and conspiring their way back to a successful bar, against all odds. \nLackadaisy Cats has been running online since 2006, immersing its readership in a world of sepia-toned crime, adventure, action, and comedy. And now, it's ready for its next big move... to a screen near you.\nWhy a cartoon? Why now?\nThere's never been more interest in adult animation, with shows like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and Primal capturing the attention and imaginations of millions of viewers. \nLackadaisy is an exceptional webcomic, but in her mind, Tracy has always pictured it as an animated film. It\u2019s a side effect, perhaps, of a childhood nourished on Looney Tunes, Disney, and Don Bluth features; a dream of sharing that living, breathing, musical version of Lackadaisy with its dedicated readership. But the when-and-how something like that could ever be achieved has always lacked an obvious ingress.\nAs the 20s dawn upon us again, with new animation tools and techniques available, with talented and excited artists on deck an raring to get to work, and with the internet eager for more independently-created media, the auspiciousness seems writ-large - splashed across an art deco picture palace marquee, if you will. \nNow\u2019s the time.\nThe Lackadaisy animated short proposes a 10-minute, fun-and-action-filled adventure, full of car chases, shootout, sass, and  un-requested violin solos. And with your help, we can make it happen!\nThe finished short will be available for everyone to watch!\nMeet the people in charge of (and contributing to) the project! \nA former game dev, illustrator and graphic designer, Tracy Butler began Lackadaisy after researching the history of her century-old Saint Louis home, and being inspired by her love of jazz music and 1920s aesthetics. Boasting over 1,600 backers on Patreon, Lackadaisy has been her full-time job for years, garnering a dedicated readership of thousands. As the creator of the comic, Tracy will play a role as co-director on the animated short, as well as overseeing art direction.\nFable Siegel is a veteran animation professional, boasting a resume that includes Titmouse, Starburns, the internet phenomenon Hazbin Hotel, and two Game Grumps Animated shorts, along with storyboard work for Cartoon Network (Ben 10), Stoopid Monkey (Adam Ruins Everything: Reanimated History), Warner Brothers (Wacky Races), Shadow Machine (F is for Family), and more, as well as being a board artist, animator, and designer for Six Point Harness (Like Share Die).  Brought onto the Lackadaisy animated short as a production manager, director, and producer, they'll be overseeing the project utilizing their years of professional experience and skill.\n Our awesome line-up of talent, in no particular order:\n Michael Kovach  (@kovox) as Rocky Rickaby! \n Belsheber Rusape (@BelRusapeVO) as Calvin \"Freckle\" McMurray! \n Lisa Reimold (@lisareimold)  as Ivy Pepper! \n Ashe Wagner (@TheQueenViking)  as Mitzi May! \nand SungWon Cho (@ProZD) as Mordecai Heller! \nCharacter Design\nTai (@corvidmonster)\n3D Modeling\nZachary \"Newt\" Nall (https://www.noneuclideandesigns.com/)\nStoryboard Artist\nAshley \"Kilomonster\" Green (@AshGMonstrology)\nSound Direction\nM.

Look no further!\nLackadaisy Essentials is the primary means by which we intend to fund the animated short, and Iron Circus Comics' part in this incredibly ambitious project! Planned as a hardcover volume of about 100 pages, Lackadaisy Essentials contains never-before-published minicomics, one-offs, sketches, and other creative work by Tracy, delving into the world and details of the Lackadaisy webcomic.\n Lackadaisy Volumes 1 & 2 ebooks are the collected Lackadaisy webcomic!

But in case we overfund, we already have some awesome plans to make this Kickstarter even better.\n\nAnd our final two stretch goals...\n\nWhatever you may decide, thanks for getting this far down the page, and reading all about this new venture!

This isn\u2019t your typical RPG as it offers a unique action-based battle system that allows timed attacks and defense along with expansive items and abilities that are inspired by the history of NES games. \nAs you progress the battle mechanics evolve!\nThe goal of the game is to collect all of the original NES Black Box games in order to become a legendary Nintendo collector. As you play through the game, and obtain cartridges for your collection, you will unlock abilities that will give you new techniques that do various things such as adding new attacks or allowing for further progression in the world. These abilities are not automatically unlocked however, as you get to play uniquely programmed mini-games inspired by the original games!\nExample of Playing Mini-Games to Unlock Abilities\nAs you play through the game there are tons of areas to explore and unique characters to meet, along with lots of fun conversations about collecting for the NES. Contributors that originally helped make this game possible are also in the game and there are a lot of references from within the NES homebrew community, which makes this a really fun story to experience.\nThere are lots of Towns and Overworlds to explore...\nCommissioned and Published by Hagen\u2019s Alley and Programmed by Rob Bryant of Sly Dog Studios in 2017, this is the version that was originally funded and released with the Complete NES Kickstarter that collectors have been asking me to re-release for years! The artwork and in-game title screen was hand-drawn by Garbage Pail Kids artist Joe Simko. All physical items will be done at the highest quality possible and I\u2019ll be coordinating with people in the NES Homebrew community as I did with the original physical release.\nThe box design and label will be similar in style to the regular edition from the first printing, with the material quality being as close to a retail NES release as possible. The logo has been recolored so you can tell the difference between the original and this re-release.\nThe Legacy Expanded... in Book Form!\nWe have been asked for years to please re-release a legitimate Physical CIB version of Jeffrey Wittenhagen's Black Box Challenge. Instead of lazily doing another print run of the game, I wanted to do something more, tap into the past, and create a book series that I've wanted to do for awhile now... Welcome to Twisted Realities!\nLots of inspiration from classic gaming books...\nTwisted Realities takes inspiration from the classic Worlds of Power books from the heyday of the NES, however to modernize the formula and really tap into nostalgia, there will also be hand-drawn art added throughout the book, akin to many 80s Adventure books. Here is an example of what it will look like:\nIntro Chapter with art by Charles Moisant\nThis story will go over the events of Jeffrey Wittenhagen's Black Box Challenge and add in some narrative context to the world so you can get a deeper understanding of the people and places throughout. Everything has a purpose within the game world and there is a sinister under-plot that exists! The interior art will be hand-drawn by Charles Moisant of Silver Phoenix Entertainment who is known in indie comics circles for his detailed and morbid artwork. \nIntro Chapter with art by Charles Moisant\nTo finish out the book there will be some Tips and Tricks, along with all of the abilities and items that can be found throughout the game. Think of this as a kind of mini-strategy guide... which we will expand out further if stretch goals are made.\nProject Items\nHere is everything that's available with this Kickstarter campaign. Check it out!\nNOTE: All tiers come with a digital copy of the game, however keep in mind that there is incompatibility with some flash cartridges.\n Guide Book - $20\nThis is for the Twisted Realities book alone. You won't need a physical copy of the game to enjoy this novelization of the game!\nThe book will be a pocket-sized paperback in the same size, design and layout of classic books like Worlds of Power and Choose Your Own Adventure. It is also the same size as previous Hagen's Alley paperback releases.\nCartridge Only NES Game - $40\nJust want to play the game in your NES without any frills? Here you go!\nAs with the original release, the label will be done to the highest quality standards.\nComplete in Box Physical NES Game - $60\nHere is what a lot of people have been asking for! A full retail release of Jeffrey Wittenhagen's Black Box Challenge with the amazing Joe Simko artwork. The design is based upon the regular edition release, however the color has been modified to easily see that it is from this second printing.\nThe game will include the cartridge with glossy label, manual, and glossy box all in a video game box protector. This will be playable on original Nintendo hardware and high quality FPGA consoles. NOTE: Some clone consoles won't support the game.\nPremium Edition Wooden Box - $200 (Limited to 10)\nThis is for the collector's out there and this hand-stained wooden box will not only fit the CIB NES game, but also the novel and any other stretch goal items that we might create. Each one will be numbered to make them special.\nNOTE: Going to use a lighter stain for the final wooden boxes\nThese boxes are wood-burned, inked and stained by hand. Because of this there will only be 10 of these being made!\nStretch Goals\nAs this project grows, we will do more cool stuff with the funds!\n10K (Manual Upgrade) - We will expand the included NES manual, adding in breakouts of all mini-games, items, and some of the bosses that you'll encounter.\n15K (Mini-Strategy Guide) - We will release a separate full-color mini-strategy guide created by 8-Bit Steve! (This will be available to preorder for $20 to all Kickstarter backers regardless of the final price)\n20K (Black Box Challenge NES Sequel) - Want Jeffrey Wittenhagen's Black Box Challenge 2 and see what happened to the Evil Overlord after the epic conclusion? If we get this far I'll begin working on the Action-RPG sequel and all backers will have the opportunity to join the discord server as beta testers! \nNOTE: Backers will also have the first opportunity to get any LEs or physical versions for the sequel in the future.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis game is being released by the request of multiple collectors from the NES Homebrew community as this game has been selling for absurd amounts online. We want everyone to be able to affordably get a copy of this game physically, at the highest quality, that rivals something that was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System during its heyday. 10% of the game-related profits are allocated to Sly Dog Studios should they want it, although they have indicated they want nothing to do with this version.\n\nAs with any physically produced item, delays in manufacturing can happen which is why the release date is later in the year. The game-only backers will get their games as soon as everything is in hand, which is hopefully well before this date. \n\nThe book will take time to produce, so those backers will have to wait until it is completed to get their items, but combo backers will get the option to have the game shipped individually if they cover the extra shipping. Also, because of the \"by-hand\" nature of the limited items, they each take multiple hours to create and they will get shipped out as they are completed based on backer number.\n\nFor those of you who want a more bare-bones version of the game cartridge, there is a \"non-Jeffrey Wittenhagen's\" version that was modified and released by the developer after the game creation in 2017. It has a plain white label, is cartridge-only, and is available to order from time to time. This version is also available digitally online for free, which is why we are also including a free ROM with all pledges for the original version regardless of the amount as a thank you for your support.\n\nI also want to put out that International Shipping is very expensive from the US. There is nothing we can do about that, but we aren't charging a ton with this project as the items aren't extremely heavy as with past projects. We do not make any money on shipping costs, in fact it's typically the opposite.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nBy using the highest quality components possible we are ensuring the games will last.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Twisted Realities Guide Book", "descp": "Already have Black Box Challenge on the NES?

So the art would still be black and white, but the pages would flow more like a comic book with panels and only small paragraphs where things need to be explained and written out.

DUNGEON BREAKOUT is a heavily flavored, tile placement party game, set in the same world and populated by the same weird characters and creatures as DUNGEON DEGENERATES: Hand of Doom. With easy-to-learn rules and fast game play action, DUNGEON BREAKOUT will be a hit with any crowd!\nYou\u2019re trapped in the dungeon below Br\u00fcttleburg, but there is a chance for escape! Make your way through the maze-like corridors, collecting loot and battling monsters, and find the exit first to win! Watch out though, in addition to lurking monsters, there could be a jailor around the next corner, or one of your opponents trying to stop you!\nDUNGEON BREAKOUT is a game for 2-6 players, ages 8 and up & is a great game for players of any skill level. It\u2019s quick to set up and easy to follow. Sometimes a game takes 30 minutes, sometimes it\u2019s over in 5, it all depends on the luck of the draw & how you play your cards! Our simple rule system also includes optional extra rules which can make your gameplay session longer, more challenging, or both.\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n60 Map tile cards which make up the dungeon deck\n  48 Monster cards\n  48 Loot cards\n  8 Adventurer standees\n  1 die (16mm)\n  Rules sheet\n  The artwork in DUNGEON BREAKOUT does repeat characters, items & monsters from our previous game. It was necessary to re-use artwork because Sean suffered a severe stroke 18 months ago, and while he is making gains in his recovery daily, he is not yet to the point where he can make new artwork for games. These drawings have been recolored and recontextualized, so they will be familiar to fans of DUNGEON DEGENERATES: Hand of Doom without looking exactly the same.\nSince our fans are already familiar with the playable adventurers from Hand of Doom and the character expansions, we are going to let you choose which adventurers make it into this game! There are 30 possible adventurers, but only 8 can be part of DUNGEON BREAKOUT! Who will you choose? [Sorry everyone, we are having technical difficulties with the survey, it will be back up ASAP!]\nOur special Kickstarter exclusive for this campaign is the Slimelord pewter miniature! This mini is available in some of the pledge levels, and as an add-on. Feel free to purchase as many as you'd like, this mini will never be available again after this campaign!\nThe Slimelord was a lucky bit of slime that found a mysterious magical amulet and consumed the body of lord Staub, declaring itself Lord of the Slimes or the Slimelord. All the other Slimes of the W\u00fcrstreich cower before the mighty Slimelord & offer it slimy tribute as it leaves a trail of destruction and ooze behind it.\nWhat\u2019s new for this campaign? Of course DUNGEON BREAKOUT & the Kickstarter exclusive Slimelord miniature, but also two new sets of Monster Minis: Greasy Guys & Dungeon Scum! We\u2019ve made a special pledge level (Just the New Stuff) for our fans who have already collected everything else in the DUNGEON DEGENERATES line!\nWe will also be making a special set of 8 adventurer miniatures which corresponds to the 8 adventurers in DUNGEON BREAKOUT - this is designed for people who want the metal minis that go with this game, but don\u2019t want to collect the rest. This new set of minis is not included in the Just the New Stuff or All-in pledge levels, because they are individually available as parts of our other sets.\nOur initial campaign goal to produce DUNGEON BREAKOUT is just the beginning! We have a whole bunch of additional never-before-seen monsters to unlock, which will enhance everyone's DUNGEON BREAKOUT box, and if we unlock all 13 of them, the next step is making those 13 new monsters into a booster pack for DUNGEON DEGENERATES: Hand of Doom!\nAnd there\u2019s even more! If we can raise funds past this goal, we will add even more new monsters to DUNGEON BREAKOUT, and if we can get all of those monsters unlocked, there\u2019s the potential for a second booster pack for Hand of Doom! And there's the possibility that we go even higher than that! We've got other ideas for possible additional stretch goals... we'll see when we get there!\nOur social stretch goal for this campaign is to get this link shared 666 times!  SOCIAL SHARE LINK  Once we hit 666 shares on the Facebook link we will add 5 new never-before-seen loot items to the DUNGEON BREAKOUT game!\nBy fan request, we are making the full line of DUNGEON DEGENERATES: Hand of Doom content available as add-ons in this Kickstarter. This is a great way for people who are just finding out about the game to get in on it, and help us reach our goals for this campaign! It\u2019s especially great for fans in Europe and Canada, who can benefit from discounted shipping and no import taxes by purchasing through the Kickstarter campaign. We\u2019ve even made a few special bundles that offer additional savings.\nIf you would like to purchase additional items, simply increase your pledge amount by the total of the add-ons you'd like. After the Kickstarter campaign is over, you'll have access to our Backerkit where you can select the specific add-ons you would like!\nGet as many copies of DUNGEON BREAKOUT as you'd like, for the special Kickstarter price!

On our end, the design and playtesting happens in our home (or prototypes will be mailed out to other playtesters), so we can proceed with the project on our timeline.

It was amazing, faster, more efficient and it left us feeling clean and fresh! We were shocked and felt lied to our entire lives. Wondering why all of our heads were filled with the same false narratives \u2014 they\u2019re some strange French thing only women use, the butt of a foot cleaning joke from a movie or that they\u2019re big, bulky and an entirely separate unit from your toilet. \nAfter a month of using water to clean our butts our lives were better off \u2014 no more swampy butts, no more dingleberries, no more sore butthole days from wiping over and over again. We became filled with a righteous indignation to try to tell others/red pill all the toilet paper users out there.  \nOur goal was simple - Create the most simplistic, non-electric, water powered, easiest to install butt-shower ever! Then pair that with the most badass marketing plan designed to breakdown the walls erected by society, cute bears and big TP business!!  \nI know this takes some trust, we were you once too, but now we\u2019re your future you, and your future you is telling you to take the leap of faith...we all know in our hearts that water is better at cleaning than paper. Close your eyes, listen to your clean, itch free future butt whispering \u201cback this project, take care of your old friend downstairs, I know you rarely see me, but you can feel me when I\u2019m upset. This decision will make me happy for the rest of my life and when I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re happy.\u201d   \n\nQ&A\n1. How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter. \n2. What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet. \n3. How do I use the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, go back to playing on your phone while moving your butt around a little bit to be thorough, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done. \n4. Is it sanitary for multiple people to use the same Narsehole? Yes. Narsehole is designed to be clean and hygienic with a self-cleaning, auto-retracting nozzle and full-length nozzle guard. i.e. it\u2019s a million times more sanitary then using toilet paper. \n 5. What\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs. \n6. Does the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. This also makes it easier to install. \n7. What is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up:)\n8. What\u2019s the difference between the Narsehole and the less expensive options on Amazon?  \nFast Facts: the cheaper ones have one nozzle (not worth your time) and 90% of dual nozzles are $70-$150.\nNot convinced yet? Here\u2019s the deal: We tested all the (direct from china) Amazon models and the truth is, you get what you pay for \u2014 if you\u2019re used to boxed wine, you\u2019ll still think it\u2019s good \u2014 but the Narsehole is for people who like that fine wine! We\u2019re not judging, but ask yourself, which person are you?  \nWhy the Narsehole is the fine wine of butt showers:\n1 - Spray Nirvana: The Narsehole has a perfect spray stream with separate nozzles and pressure controls for both the starfish and the clam. Trust us, all sprays are not created equal, we spent hundreds of research hours watering our butts to fine tune the Narsehole\u2019s stream in order to take the best possible care of your tender areas! Wanna roll the dice and save five bucks on Amazon? You\u2019re risking getting either a small and pointy spray (ouchie!) or the super soaker that gets your entire bathing suit region wet (might as well just hop in the shower).\n2 - Double Trouble: You can activate both nozzle sprays at the same time for the dreaded diarrhea days. This will take care of your whole butt and restart you back in the game of life as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Side note - thought about what you wanna get your grandparents for Christmas this year? (wink)\n3 - The Blessing of the Vikings: To put it simply, the Narsehole is way more fun than any other tiny butt shower out there. With the Narsehole attached to your porcelain throne, you\u2019ve got one hell of a conversation starter and you\u2019ll have a great follow up anecdote about the Vikings putting their butts over the side of their boats! Bonus round, if you know how to play the guitar you can serenade them with the theme song too \ud83d\ude42! Ain\u2019t no party like a Narsehole party, cause a Narsehole party has clean butts.\nDesign / Prototype - Our main focus on design was finding the perfect spray for both the starfish and clam.  Testing 100\u2019s of different angles and hole patterns, we finally found the perfect spray and are excited to bring it to a butt near you coming this July:)!!\nInitial Design Sketch\nDesign Process & Progression of Nozzles\nPrototyping Nozzles for Perfect Spray", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe supplier has been established, vetted, and final samples have been tested and approved.

After the protests began, political disagreements caused her relationship with her pro-China foster parents to be deteriorated and eventually collapse, causing her to run away from home. She now supports herself financially by working part-time and receiving financial support, in order to take part in the daily protests as a member of the rescue team continuously.\nJoan first discovered she was an orphan upon finding a document hid by her foster parents. Seeing this as a sign that her parents didn't love her, this became a major factor in her decision to move out. A relationship deeply pained by the protests, our film provides a raw insight into the deep-seated love of Joan's parents to their daughter.\nJoan's story is representative of many like her: an ambitious 16-year-old who has quit school and has dedicated her life to the never-ending journey of pursuing justice. Our film paints the portrait of one unlikely hero with a future in jealpordy, but her story is only one of many thousands of brave young people fighting in Hong Kong.\n----\n\u300cAid Girl\u300d\u70ba\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u90e8\u6211\u5011\u6b63\u5728\u5236\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u7d00\u9304\u7247\nJoan\u5728\u5169\u6b72\u6642\u88ab\u9001\u5f80\u5bc4\u990a\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002\u81ea\u793a\u5a01\u904b\u52d5\u4ee5\u4f86\uff0c\u5979\u56e0\u653f\u898b\u4e0d\u5408\u800c\u8207\u89aa\u4e2d\u6d3e\u7684\u990a\u7236\u6bcd\u95dc\u4fc2\u8b8a\u5f97\u60e1\u52a3\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5d29\u6f70\uff0c\u6700\u7d42\u5979\u9078\u64c7\u4e86\u96e2\u5bb6\u51fa\u8d70\u3002\u5979\u73fe\u5728\u9760\u8457\u517c\u8077\u7684\u6536\u5165\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u8ca1\u653f\u652f\u63f4\u4f86\u7dad\u6301\u751f\u8a08\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4ee5\u6025\u6551\u54e1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u53c3\u8207\u6bcf\u5929\u7684\u8857\u982d\u6297\u722d\u3002\n\u6709\u6b21Joan\u767c\u73fe\u4e86\u85cf\u5728\u5bb6\u4e2d\u7684\u51fa\u751f\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u767c\u73fe\u539f\u4f86\u81ea\u5df1\u8207\u990a\u7236\u6bcd\u6c92\u6709\u8840\u7de3\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u77e5\u9053\u5f8c\u5979\u958b\u59cb\u89ba\u5f97\u7236\u6bcd\u6839\u672c\u5c31\u4e0d\u611b\u5979\uff0c\u4e26\u6c7a\u610f\u8981\u642c\u96e2\u9019\u500b\u5bb6\u3002\u4e00\u6bb5\u56e0\u70ba\u793a\u5a01\u800c\u6495\u88c2\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u96fb\u5f71\u4ee5\u7b2c\u4e00\u8eab\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u8a18\u8ff0\u4e86Joan\u990a\u7236\u6bcd\u5c0d\u5979\u5973\u5152\u7684\u611b\u3002\nJoan\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u8207\u5979\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u4eba\uff1a\u4e00\u500b\u5f88\u6709\u76ee\u6a19\u768416\u6b72\u5973\u751f\uff0c\u653e\u68c4\u4e2d\u5b78\u5b78\u696d\uff0c\u8e0f\u4e0a\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u770b\u4e0d\u898b\u7d42\u9ede\uff0c\u5c0b\u627e\u516c\u7fa9\u7684\u65c5\u7a0b\u3002\u6297\u722d\u768416\u6b72\u5973\u751f\u7684\u73fe\u5728\u548c\u4eca\u5f8c\u8a72\u5982\u4f55\u8d70\u4e0b\u53bb\uff1f\u6211\u5011\u7684\u96fb\u5f71\u63cf\u7e6a\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u5178\u578b\u5f88\u50cf\u82f1\u96c4\u7684\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u537b\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u73fe\u6642\u5728\u9999\u6e2f\u6297\u722d\uff0c\u524d\u9014\u5145\u6eff\u5371\u96aa\uff0c\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u842c\u52c7\u6562\u5e74\u8f15\u4eba\u7684\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u500b\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\nPLAY\n\nI'm a second grade university student in Japan. One day, a friend of mine from Hong Kong sent me a message saying \"stand up for Hong Kong, please.\" I couldn\u2019t pretend not seeing it. I was ashamed at how helpless I felt in the face of their political catastrophe. Even as a documentarian, without a full understanding of what was happening in Hong Kong, I couldn't fully contribute.\nThis issue spoke to me because many of those fighting which are for their freedom, including press, rescue team members, and those on the front lines, are students just like we are. \n----\n\u9019\u500b\u4f01\u5283\u958b\u59cb\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u7a81\u7136\u3002\u6709\u5929\u6211\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4f4d\u8a8d\u8b58\u4e86\u4e94\u5e74\u591a\u7684\u9999\u6e2f\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u8a0a\u606f\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u80fd\u70ba\u9999\u6e2f\u767c\u8072\u300d\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u9999\u6e2f\u9019\u500b\u653f\u6cbb\u707d\u96e3\uff0c\u6211\u5c0d\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7121\u529b\u611f\u611f\u5230\u5341\u5206\u7f9e\u6127\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u4f4d\u8a18\u8005\uff0c\u6211\u8a8d\u70ba\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u73fe\u72c0\u6c92\u6709\u5145\u4efd\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c \u5f88\u96e3\u70ba\u9999\u6e2f\u51fa\u4e00\u5206\u529b\u3002\n\u9019\u6b21\u7684\u6297\u722d\u544a\u8a34\u4e86\u6211\u4e00\u9ede\uff1a\u5f88\u591a\u73fe\u6642\u70ba\u81ea\u5df1\u800c\u6230\u7684\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u651d\u5f71\u5e2b\u3001\u6025\u6551\u54e1\u3001\u9084\u6709\u7ad9\u5728\u6297\u722d\u6700\u524d\u7dda\u7684\u4ed6\u5011\uff0c\u5176\u5be6\u5f88\u591a\u4e5f\u53ea\u662f\u5b78\u751f\u800c\u5df2\u3002\nThe reason why we stand up for them is simple.

A prequel story set in The Messenger\u2019s universe, it tells the story of two Children of the Solstice who will combine the powers of the sun and moon to perform Eclipse Magic, the only force capable of fending off the monstrous creations of the evil alchemist known as The Fleshmancer. \nPromising the Sabotage touch in every system, Sea of Stars aims to modernize the classic RPG in terms of turn-based combat, storytelling, exploration and interactions with the environment, while still offering a hearty slice of nostalgia and good old, simple fun.\nComing to PC and Consoles in 2022.\n Key ingredients :\n Engaging turn-based combat. Combat gameplay includes active player input during attack animations (timed hits), multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and strategic defense options to hinder enemies while they are channeling powerful attacks or spells. For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.\n Unshackled traversal. Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tile-based movement.\n Prequel story set in The Messenger\u2019s universe. Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you\u2019ve come to expect from a Sabotage production.\n Full-on dynamic lighting our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.\n The Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre. Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements in order to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and overly lengthy sequences.\n\n   A prequel to The Messenger \nThe story takes place long before the flood, where many islands are waiting for you to explore. As a full-fledged RPG, the adventure promises intrigue, perils and wonders . Those familiar with our previous work may recognize a few faces and get meaningful insight on some origin stories, as well as hints towards the bigger picture of the universe we aim to develop more with each of our games.   \nThe Messenger - Sunken Shrine\nThat being said, newcomers should rest assured that Sea of Stars is absolutely enjoyable as a self-contained experience and doesn\u2019t depend on having played The Messenger. In fact, it will even work the other way around should you choose to play our platformer second!\nTurn-based combat\nNo random encounters, no separate battlefield: Considering immersion a top priority, combat is initiated by physical contact with an enemy, and battle takes place in the same field as navigation, seamlessly, with no loading or transition.\nNo grinding: Character progression in Sea of Stars flows naturally along with the story, without the need for any grinding. This concept is supported by a combat system which relies mainly on strategy and skill rather than statistics. That being said, you will very much be leveling up, increasing your stats and unlocking new special moves.\nSynergies: During battle, everything is based on building up momentum and effects over a few rounds, to eventually unleash massive damage by cashing out on your build up. Featuring six very distinct playable characters, and a lot of synergies between each of them, there are a lot of ways to take down opponents.\nTimed hits: Celebrating the greats of our childhood, we top it off with a \u2018timed hits\u2019 mechanic, where precise player input will increase damage done by your characters, or mitigate incoming attacks. Losing a battle doesn\u2019t mean you should go back and grind, but rather that it\u2019s time to apply what you learned from the enemy\u2019s attack patterns and improve your execution the next time around. With skill and strategy as your main weapons, there is always ample room for improvement when a particular encounter proves challenging.\nSpell-breaking: Making a point to break the potential linearity of turn-based combat, enemies can mount especially strong attacks or spells. While a good use of timed hits will always remove a good chunk of the damage dealt, even the smallest minion can be lethal if left unchecked while casting. \nEnemies in a casting state display a bar with what we simply refer to as \u201clocks\u201d, each with an icon representing the damage type required to break it. For every broken lock, the ensuing spell\u2019s efficiency is reduced. Break all of them, and the enemy\u2019s action is entirely cancelled. This spell-breaking gameplay mechanic truly comes to life when groups of enemies demand clutch reactions and choices as more than one is preparing a spell, coupled with playable characters capable of combo attacks and multi-hit special moves.\nBoss fights: No RPG would be complete without big bosses, and of course Sea of Stars is no exception. For bosses, we are also looking at breaking the potential linearity of rinse and repeat for x amount of rounds to win. Each boss will present different attack patterns to learn, evolving through manually scripted phases and special events.\n\nBanking on the synergies, timed hits and spell-breaking mechanics, bosses will offer ample room for longer-haul strategies, giving players the freedom to see how much damage they can really deal in a single round with enough preparation time.\nBoost: To shake things up even more, performing a regular attack generates \u201cEclipse Orbs\u201d, which can later be absorbed to double the effect of any action (regular attack, special attack, healing, spells, etc...) \nDepending on the situation, it may be wiser to save your orbs for later, perhaps to quickly get rid of an enemy that begins casting a spell with too many locks, or, in the case of longer battles like bosses, to dish out as much damage as possible once everything has been put in place for damage to be increased during a short window. \nUnshackled traversal - no rigid tile-per-tile movement\nPutting our platformer experience to good use, we make a point for moment-to-moment gameplay to present satisfying controls, micro challenges, and varied traversal opportunities. In other words, venturing through the rich environment should be accompanied by a feeling of freedom. While multiple paths and approaches can lead to your objective, leaving the main road and exploring less accessible (or hidden) areas will be rewarded. \nClimb, jump, run, swim, vault and dive as you progress through villages and dungeons of all kinds. Anytime it feels like you can interact with something, the odds are that you can. Hoist up on rooftops, or jump off ledges into deep natural pools to explore underwater tunnels. Stick to the main objective, or follow your curiosity and see for yourself what wonders lay hidden.\nWorld Map\nTraveling between points of interest takes place in a classic World Map view where adventurers can roam around, free of enemy encounters. Those who like to go off the beaten path will find many optional areas concealing upgrades, vanity items, and side quests. \nSailing\nSince traveling between islands is a key part of the adventure, the party naturally gets its own boat. With full analog control, you will be invited to negotiate waves, and take advantage of the upwards and downwards formations to optimize for speed. While it isn\u2019t anything that will ever block the casual sailor wanting to get to the next objective, we expect a lot of adventurers will be spending extra time sailing the world to play around with waves, look for sunken side-areas, secondary islands, or simply take a break from the hardships of heroism. \nThe boat also acts as a mobile base of operations, which can be explored in close-up character view, where the party is fully settled in, and available for banter and guidance in-between major story beats. \nIf you ever find yourself struck by the infamous \u201chaven\u2019t played in two weeks\u201d RPG curse, you can rest assured that someone on your boat is ready to offer clear reminders as to what you should be doing next. \nFull-on dynamic lighting and shadows\nTo truly convey the story of warriors using the power of the moon and the sun, we had to go hard on the lighting system. Spectacular spell effects thus being a given, the game also features real-time dynamic day and night cycles, which the player eventually gets to control with full granularity.\nFocusing sunlight through a prism in order to open some secret area may only be possible at high noon, while a magic flower blooms exclusively in the evening. You may want to follow a trail of glow-in-the-dark aquatic plants only visible at night, while some monsters like to sleep during the day.\nAll of this ties into properly telling the story of Solstice Warriors , while also allowing for multiple puzzles and mechanisms dealing with light, shadows and reflections. Oh, and to make sure this world truly comes alive, we are also throwing in weather variations! Please back us.\n\nSix unique playable combat characters\nSea of Stars features six unique playable combat characters, each with their own backstory, personal objectives, play-style, special skills, and synergies with the rest of the party. In this multi-layered story, motivations sometimes align in unexpected ways. In the interest of allowing you to go into the game without any major spoilers, we will only be revealing the two main protagonists here. \nBorn on the Summer Solstice, Zale is optimistic and bold. He wields a sunblade, through which he can absorb Eclipse Orbs whenever his attacks need an extra kick.\nAs a blade-dancer, he walks the path of the Guardian God Solen. The Elder Mist foretold that, in order to find his light and achieve his full potential, he will first need to \u201cstare at the night inside of him\u201d.\n\nBorn on the Winter Solstice, Valere shows curiosity and balance. Gifted with Lunar Magic, she can absorb Eclipse Orbs in her moonstaff to dish out massive damage.\nTrained in the martial ways of the monk, she walks the path of the Guardian Goddess Luana. The Elder Mist sees great potential in her, believing she might one day be the one to \u201ccreate paths on water\u201d.\n Garl was born a regular kid devoid of any special powers. Along with his training as a cook, his innately strong constitution makes him a capable defensive fighter, giving him the tools to support his two best friends in their Solstice Warrior duties.\nThe Elder Mist saw something peculiar in the stars about him, as it seemed his heart just may be warm enough to \u201csoothe a long tormented soul\u201d.\nEven though we will be keeping our favorite ideas under wraps for the foreseeable future, we\u2019re happy to show you above a few of the things we've been working on for the protoype!\nFor the sake of your enjoyment once the game releases, we want to be very careful with spoilers. However when it comes to mentors, villains, villagers, critters, pirates and abominations... as a full-fledged RPG, you can rest assured that Sea of Stars will have it all.\n\nSabotage\u2019s award-winning composer Eric W. Brown, AKA Rainbowdragoneyes, is back to rock your socks off yet again. He was so delighted to apply his musical genius to a full-fledged RPG production that he even built his own studio at home!\nIn Sea of Stars, the music and SFX include instruments from all over the world, blending the catchiness of retro music Eric is known for with modern sound design\u2019s best practices. Taking full advantage of the Wwise engine, all things audio are dynamically layered and adjusted to transition seamlessly through day and night cycles, indoor and outdoor areas, weather variations, and, of course, battle. \nSea of Stars is built in Unity, the engine which our technical team has been working with for over 8 years. It is our best companion for fast iteration, as well as the development of the specific tools we need to bring this new world to life.\nEven though the game might seem simple at first glance, a closer look reveals visual effects seldom seen in 2D pixel-art games. Notably full-on dynamic lighting, which was mandatory given the narrative emphasis on the Sun and Moon.\nScalding desert suns, unsettling blood moons, lush underwater bioluminescent reefs, foggy swamps and dark caverns. We have the tools necessary to ensure each environment is brought to life with the utmost attention to detail to take you on a gripping adventure full of wonders.\nFor those interested in the technical aspect, here are a few of the components we are working with to tailor our own rendering pipeline based on URP (Caution : buzzwords ahead!) :\nPost processing effects such as Bloom, Color Correction and Ambient Occlusion\nPixel perfect rendering\nFully dynamic lighting of sprites including normal mapping, pixel depth writing and shadow receiving\nShadow casting sprites from multiple angles and punctual/directional light sources\nVolumetric lighting\nScreen-space indirect lighting\nAnimated Height fog\nWater shading including transparency, refraction, reflection, absorption, subsurface scattering and contact effect\nWater simulation for rivers and oceans\n  Languages\nThe Messenger is known for its quality localization that keeps the story intact, and we won\u2019t settle for less when it comes to Sea of Stars. Everything will be localized by finely selected external partners who have a track record of excellence. Extra care and resources will always be directed towards ensuring that every language our games release in lets their player base enjoy the stories and events at the same level of quality as everyone else.\nAt this time we expect to release with full support for the following:\nPlatforms\nThe game should be completed sometime in 2022, and is designed to be played on PC and console. For specifics, rest assured that we are in touch with the key players of our industry, and that the game will be wherever the players are.\nIt is hard to predict platforms as we seem to be at the dawn of a new era, but we are keeping close watch, have extensive porting experience, and fully intend on supporting all current generation platforms with Sea of Stars.\nNot only is the entire team that brought you The Messenger working on Sea of Stars full time, we also doubled its size!\nWe\u2019re a studio that bets on focus, meaning once we enter production all hands are on deck working full time on a single project. Our team now counts 16 cherry-picked members, all cut from the same cloth and working from our studio located in downtown Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada.\nOperating with minimal management and completely open work schedules, our team is composed of self-driven artisans who seek to be unleashed rather than controlled.\nEven though the vision for the game is clearly defined, everyone is given the tools and encouraged to express themselves in bringing everything they want both to the company\u2019s culture and to our games. \n\nCampaign Stretch Goals\nNeither incomplete nor bloated - A stretch goals philosophy.\nWhatever happens with the stretch goals, the game will get made in its full vision. We won\u2019t tack on features that would bloat the game to add more incentives, or remove systems that would make the game incomplete if we didn\u2019t reach objectives. \nThe Crypt : an in-game memorial site for backers\nFound on a seemingly uncharted island, The Crypt is an underground area built to pay homage to our fantasy world\u2019s founders, or to be more precise, top-tier backers. Keeping things as spoilers-free as possible, it is still worth mentioning that the place is not disconnected from the world\u2019s lore, and will plays some role in the overarching story.\nSupporters of the campaign who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers will be immortalized in the game as a unique interactive object within the crypt. \nThere are 3 tiers:\nCommemorative stone (Level 1)\nA stone in the first room of the crypt, displaying the name of your choice when interacted with. Get it for yourself, or for someone dear to you!\nStatue (Level 2)\nIn the second room, which is a bit more luxurious, you can have your own statue displaying the name of your choice, along with a short body of text. A great place to leave a positive message for other adventurers, or to immortalize your positive intentions for someone special.\nClaiming your statue will be a simple process of selecting how you want it to look by customizing its parts, sort of like in a character creation menu. Body type, hair, height, weapon of choice, clothing, etc.\nMonuments (Level 3)\nThe final room, which the crypt was built around, looks especially beautiful at night, as a sunroof lets the moonlight shine on an array of mirrors, filling the air with magic and peace.\nFor monuments, our artists will get in touch with you to create a fully customized character of your choice. Whether you want to be there as yourself, see the hero you envision taking form, invent a fantasy creature, or show the world a special pet. \nAlso interactive, monuments will display the name of your choice, along with a lengthier body of text.\nWhether you choose to leave a message for the world, pay homage to a loved one, or  write a backstory for your fantasy character, our team will work with you to ensure your immortalized presence in our world is meaningful to you.\nThe Cryptwalker\nIn debating whether or not to add an NPC to The Crypt, we opted to leave it up to the community! It is said that this mysterious character who roams the halls may actually come from a different time, and certainly a different place. Could this mysterious presence be \u2026 you?\nShould someone choose to take it upon themselves to ensure The Cryptwalker is added to the game, they will play a key role in defining the character\u2019s personality. This fully animated character\u2019s appearance will be directed by said backer, and will be quite the conversationalist, telling stories and touching on philosophy, to make sure adventurers who enter The Crypt take some time for introspection.\nRest assured that while your input will be considered to the extent you want it to, we\u2019ve absolutely got your back should you not have many dialog subjects to contribute. We are the studio that brought you The Shopkeeper, after all, and there is certainly more where that came from.\nThe vinyl\nSabotage is excited to partner with iam8bit, who were integral to the vinyl renaissance since their first release in 2010. Since then, they've minted nearly 100 videogame soundtracks on wax, and always do so with a premium ilk, from mastering to design to packaging. We previously collaborated on The Messenger vinyl soundtrack and were super happy with the results.\n\nWhy Kickstarter\nLet us be direct : it would be risky to base the funding of an ambitious project like this on Kickstarter alone. As always, we want to remain fully transparent with anyone who wants to support us : 16 people over 3 years is intense budget-wise for a small studio. Taking the bulk of risks ourselves by reinvesting the gains from The Messenger, all we ask for is to hear a big \"YES\" from our fans and other potential players, enough to feel confident Sea of Stars is a game enough people want to see releasing.\nOf course, it is now common knowledge that the value of a Kickstarter goes way beyond the amount of money raised during the campaign; it also makes for the best early feedback loop a game studio can hope for. Again, we are committed to this project. All we ask for is confirmation that Sea of Stars is something you want to play.\nOn a final note we absolutely want to thank everyone who has been supporting us since the beginning, especially our wholesome Discord community.\nWithin The Messenger was the hope for some connection, that some would \u201cget it\u201d, and choose to share their own experiences so that the values portrayed in our fantasy might, to some extent, live, if only within the hearts of those it touched.\nInspired by the overwhelming response, we chose to trust in our fanbase completely, and were thus compelled to create a crowdfunding campaign to reveal our next project as early as possible. Being so engaged with our community both in chat and through the Alternate Reality Game we run on the server, it would have been truly annoying not being able to discuss what we were so excited about on a daily basis. \nNow that everyone\u2019s in the know about Sea of Stars, the fun can begin, unhindered once again!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are aware that Kickstarter projects often come with a certain level of risk for the backer, but we want to reassure you that this game will be completed no matter what happens during this campaign.\n\nOur team has extensive experience shipping games of all scopes, and we are surrounded by veterans from other studios who we can always rely on for sanity checks and feedback. \n\nIt is our promise to every backer, that to the best of our knowledge and experience, the Sabotage team will always make sure the finances are aligned with the vision, that this vision is clear, shared by the team, technically feasible, and validated by players. Challenging each other is embedded in our culture, and no stones will be left unturned.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Keep me posted!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBacker exclusive HD wallpapers for your desktop and phone\nGet the updates\nYou can upgrade your pledge as long as the campaign is running!

It's about a robot!\nHi! We're the Doubleclicks: Aubrey Turner (she/her) and Laser Malena-Webber (they/them). We're a sibling musical duo from Portland, Oregon, who make indie folk music about love, science, and anxiety. We have a cello, we have a ukulele, we have a cat keyboard that goes meow meow meow.\nYou can listen to our music on YouTube, Spotify, or Bandcamp for free!\nWe're known for making music on the Internet with you, other human beings. We also tour and play places like PAX, the JoCoCruise, SF Sketchfest, GenCon, and comics shops, game stores, and comedy clubs. We've released a handful of albums, four of them through the help of Kickstarter, and we want to do it again! Are you ready?   \n Our 7th studio album, Teaching a Robot to Love, is 12 songs about the things we care about. IT IS ALSO: a musical. With a plot. About artificial intelligence and the true nature of \"humanity.\" It's funny, and cute, and real, and all the things that Doubleclicks albums normally are. \nWhy this project, why now? The Doubleclicks started in a dorm room 10 years ago. That's wild. We've been writing dozens of nerdy songs about our feelings for a long, long time. What we haven't done is finished something truly ambitious and narrative. This is a huge challenge\u2014much, much harder than we anticipated. But after a few false starts on different musicals (sorry, abandoned projects, we will be back someday...), we have finally completed writing the music and words to a story we're really proud of!!!\nThis project is happening in three parts:\n1. Doubleclicks songs\u2014a whole grip of Doubleclicks songs about anxiety, friendship, love, art, cheese, and our lives.\n2. The audio drama/cast album\u2014most of these very same songs, plus a few more, fit themselves into a MUSICAL. With just a few little narration pieces, a cast of characters, and bonus songs, we will provide you with a full audio drama version of this musical which is a full story about a robot!! There will be talented folks playing all the characters \u2014 and the two main characters are played by the Doubleclicks. \nBoth the digital album and the CD will contain the \"Cast Album\" along with bonus Doubleclicks versions of some songs.\n3. The staged-reading/video\u2014we will at least be producing one on-book staged reading of the musical, and we will film it when it happens. Backers will get a digital version of the video, and anyone who orders the USB will get the video on there as well.\n4. Bonus process streams\u2014Because of quarantine, we are going to be live-streaming the creative process of this musical as much as possible. You can watch the first quarantine concert we did here! Stay tuned to the updates tab on this page and to the Doubleclicks Discord for more announcements! We've already had fun writing the script with some of you in our co-working streams on YouTube\u2014thank you, Team Productivity!  \nWhat's next? Staging a full musical with costumes and choreography is a task that will require some outside funding and production, but we are looking into that, using this album and the funds from this project as a starting point for pitches and workshops. Our dreams include creating a script and sheet music for a full production. To do this, we will need to give ourselves an extension on the amount of time to dedicate to this project\u2014so... yes, this is a stretch goal question.   \nThe Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded, indie operation. With no major record label, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that\u2014and this is huge\u2014is that there is nothing between us and you. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. If you don't like it, we can't make it. So we do our very best.\n   We need your help to pay for recording and our studio rent; to hire musicians and vocalists, to produce CDs, merchandise, and promotional items for the album; to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins; to master and mix the music; to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores; and to generally \"create something from nothing.\" \n  We thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful, especially right now! Nothing can stop our wackiness. Nothing!!\nA note about timing:\n We know that right now is really tough for a lot of people\u2014financially, emotionally, and everything. This was a genuinely difficult choice, but we decided to launch this project now anyway, because making music is our job, and this project pays our salaries. We would be in financial trouble if we didn't keep making music and if we didn't launch this project. However, we recognize that financial strain is real for many of our fans, and so our songs will still be online for everyone to listen to for free after the project is done. In fact, we just made all our old albums free to download on Bandcamp. Also, we are creating NO Kickstarter-exclusives on this project; if it's on this project, you'll be able to get it later. If you are able to donate, we, our cats, and our families appreciate it! If not\u2014please feel our love and support! \nThe Musical/The Story:\nStacy is a lonely, work-obsessed programmer tasked with building the next big advertising artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014a Google-Siri-Alexa-Facebook hybrid\u2014a profitable program that will sell people things based on their behavior in new and unprecedented ways. But when her program, MarshCom, becomes self aware and realizes that people don\u2019t need to buy things to be happy, Stacy is fired, and she takes her program with her.\nWith the help of her lab-tech roommate Jamie, Stacy finds Marsh an android body and they both start their new lives\u2014Stacy as unemployed, and Marsh as the first brand-new, artificially created, completely synthetic human being. When Stacy becomes jealous of Marsh and a fight turns into a city-threatening computer glitch, new friends need to come together to save the day\u2014or lose everything they\u2019ve gained.\n\u201cTeaching a Robot to Love\u201d is a musical about friendship, love, being human, asking for help, and the costs and benefits of loudly being one\u2019s self.\nStacy is played by Aubrey, and Marsh is played by Laser! More casting announcements to come. \nThe Songs:\nCast album/musical track list (click links to listen to demos!):\nEverybody Needs Someone\nFlipping a Switch\nThe Wrong Body*\nNothing To See Here*\nDo Science At Home!\nHow To Be A Person\n Normal Human Party *\nLet's Just Be Friends\nI Know Too Much\nI'm Right\nHack the Mainframe\n Cheddar*\nEverybody Needs Someone (Reprise)\n*Doubleclicks bonus version will also be recorded/included\nWant to listen to a song from the musical? \nThe Pins:\nDesigned by Meghan Murphy! You will get your choice of \"Rockin Robot\" and \"Sensitive Badass\" pin \u2014 and if you can't decide, you can add on the other pin after the project!\nThe Shirt: \nThe new Doubleclicks shirt is designed by Natalie Metzger and will be available in \"unisex\" and \"fitted/ladies\" sizes S-3XL. We will have size charts available for you so you can get just the right shirt! (This is just a mock-up based on an early sketch\u2014the final shirt design will be more polished)\nThe Dice:\nWe are creating an all-new set of three six-sided dice for 2020 featuring these designs: A party cat, a robot, and a T-rex! Here's what our dice look like, but these are old designs. The new ones will be NEW and have different pictures! \nPrevious Doubleclicks Dice design pictured - new dice will have different designs\nPrinted by Chessex! \nThe USB Drive:\n4GB USB Drive\nThe new Doubleclicks USB drive will include all the albums the Doubleclicks have released, plus the new Cast Album & Doubleclicks song bonuses, and a video recording of the staged reading of the musical. It will also have a video of our hour-long concert special \"Uncomfortable In Public,\" exclusive ringtones, and coloring pages. Earlybird USBs will be signed!\n Add-Ons:\nIf you need multiple shirts, dice sets, USBs\u2014we got you. There will be an add-on store launched after the Kickstarter ends through BackerKit. You don't need to worry about it now, but if you want to, you can add $10 for pins, $10 for dice, $15 for CDs, $30 for shirts, or $50 for USBs on to your pledge.   \nProjects like this take a whole bunch of people to make possible and we'd like to thanks some of them! Kim Newmoney took the photos on this page, and is amazing. The piano in our video and for \"Normal Human Party\" is by the talented Sam Johnides. Our Patrons have helped us get through a year of touring and a winter of songwriting, and are amazing. Our parents are extremely lovely, talented and supportive and we are thankful for them. Richard and Marzipan are the true heroes of this Kickstarter. The following books with AIs and robots are very good and have gotten us extremely excited about AI stories: A Close and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers. All Systems Red by Martha Wells. Autonomous by Annalee Newitz. Atlas Alone by Emma Newman. And thank YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our seventh Kickstarter project! We learn a lot each time. The main thing we learn is this: We shouldn't launch a project until the album/musical/project is WRITTEN. Because we need to make sure the creative work is possible. \n\nWell, good news here: the songs and plot for this musical are WRITTEN. It's ambitious, but the hard part is done. \n\nWhat we need to do now is record, produce, and then do all of the logistical reward creation/printing/shipping.

Since then, we've shipped thousands and thousands of keyboards. We couldn't have done it without you. Thank you!\nWe\u2019re thrilled to be back on Kickstarter to launch our second keyboard, the Keyboardio Atreus.\nThis project is a collaboration between Keyboardio and Phil Hagelberg. Phil designed the first Atreus in 2014 because he needed a go-anywhere ergonomic keyboard. We fell in love with his design as soon as we saw it\u2014we hand-built our first Atreus in the summer of 2014, even before we launched the Model 01. \nLast summer, we started talking with Phil about collaborating to produce a new, professionally manufactured, version of the Atreus.  \nThe Keyboardio Atreus\nFast forward a few months.\nThe design is done. We\u2019ve passed FCC and CE certification. Our factory has already built and tested the pilot run.\nWe\u2019re ready for mass production. The only thing we still need is you. So please back our campaign to help make our new keyboard a reality.\nWe can\u2019t wait to get the Keyboardio Atreus into your hands.\nUntil you see an Atreus in person, it's hard to comprehend just how compact it is. But don't let that tiny package fool you. This is a real mechanical keyboard, with full-travel keyswitches mounted in an anodized aluminum plate and the same generous 19mm key spacing you'll find on a traditional desktop keyboard. Inside, it's powered by a Microchip ATmega32U4 MCU, the same chip that's inside an Arduino Leonardo and a Keyboardio Model 01. It comes with firmware source code, as well as a graphical configuration tool. It connects to your computer or tablet over USB.  \nBut it really is very small. At just 24.3 x 10 x 2.8cm (9.6 x 3.9 x 1.1 inches), it's easy to bring your keyboard with you everywhere.  \nTo get a better sense of just how compact the Keyboardio Atreus is, you can print out this PDF:\nDownloadable papercraft Keyboardio Atreus\n(Make sure your computer is set to print things at actual size, rather than shrinking or stretching them to fit on a sheet of paper. It should fit on a standard sheet of A4 or letter / 8.5\"x11\" paper.)\nThe Atreus\u2019 layout puts all the keys in columns aligned to your fingers, so you never need to stretch or twist to reach a key. The keys are the same size as on a regular desktop keyboard, but they're laid out in a much more compact way that matches how your hands work. Everything you need is easy to reach. (Since the keyboard is so compact, your mouse or trackball is closer, too.) \nAll the keys are in columns right under your fingers\n\nRather than being arranged in rows like a typewriter, the Atreus' keys are arranged in columns, with each column just right for the finger that hits it. Each half of the keyboard is angled inward at 10 degrees, to help keep your arms and shoulders in a more neutral posture.\nA traditional keyboard has 104 keys. A compact laptop keyboard typically weighs in at 78 keys. The Keyboardio Atreus manages to fit all the same functionality into just 44 keys. We do this by assigning keys to different \"layers\". \nThe standard Atreus layout packs a full keyboard into just 44 keys.\n\nThe default layer is where you'll find your letters and most of your standard punctuation. \nThe Default layer\n\nTap or hold the Fun key and your Atreus will shift to the Fun (Function) layer, where you'll find numbers, arrow keys, and the rest of your symbols. \nThe Fun layer\n\nFrom there, press the Upper key to get to the Upper layer, where you'll find media keys, F keys, and other similar stuff. \nThe Upper layer\nLearning to type on any new keyboard layout takes patience and practice. If you've never typed on a split keyboard before, it can be quite an adjustment, but one we think is really worth it. Your hands and wrists will thank you.\nSimilarly, learning to type on a keyboard with multiple layers can be a bit of an adjustment. At first, it may sound a little bit exotic, but it's something most folks can adjust to relatively quickly. After all, the symbols above the numbers on a \"regular\" keyboard are just a layer you access with the Shift key. \nThe standard Atreus layout has been refined over the past few years and is a great option if you're just getting started with split, columnar keyboards. If you're coming from the Model 01, you might end up preferring a Model 01 style layout, which we're still refining. This layout will use the standard Atreus keycaps and will be available on all Keyboardio Atreus keyboards.\nOf course, one of the great things about having a customizable keyboard is that you can customize it. If the layout the Atreus ships with isn't right for you, it's easy to change it to match where your fingers think the keys should be.\nThe easiest way to change the Atreus' layout is using our point and click configuration tool\u2014 no programming required. It runs on Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. (And, of course, it's open source and available on GitHub.)\nChrysalis, the free graphical configuration tool for the Atreus\nOnce you've customized your layout, you can rearrange the keycaps to match\u2014all of the keycaps are the same shape. Additionally, the laminated layout card that comes with your keyboard is blank on one side, so you can fill it in with a whiteboard marker as you learn your custom layout.\nThe firmware powering all our keyboards, Kaleidoscope, is open source and freely available on Github. If you want to build complex macros, add in joystick emulation, change how the Atreus speaks USB, or make keys do things we haven't thought of yet, Kaleidoscope is where you'd start.\nKaleidoscope is incredibly powerful, but we've done our best to make it newbie-friendly. We built it on top of the Arduino core, to make it easy for folks who aren't familiar with embedded development or C++ to be able to do amazing things. At the same time, you're not restricted to the Arduino IDE when working with it. If vi or Emacs is your weapon of choice, everything's set up to build from the command line using standard tooling.\nKaleidoscope supports all the things you'd expect, like layouts stored in EEPROM, serial communications, full NKRO, mousekeys, and crazy USB tricks. Most new features can be added to Kaleidoscope as plugins, of which we have many already. \nHot-swap switches and easy to move keycaps make it easy to customize your keyboard.\nYour Atreus comes fully assembled with your choice of four different kinds of switches:\nKailh BOX White: pick this switch if you love clicky switches. It's satisfyingly clicky, with a tactile bump at 1.8 mm and 50g actuation force.\nKailh Speed Copper: pick this switch if you want highly responsive, tactile feel. It has a high tactile bump at 1.1 mm and 50g actuation force. Many folks say these switches feel similar to the Matias Quiet Click switches we featured on the Model 01. \nKailh BOX Brown: these are a traditional soft tactile switch with a tactile bump at 1.8 mm and 50g actuation force. \nKailh BOX Red: these switches have a linear force curve, with no tactile bump and no click. Smooth typing with actuation at 1.8 mm and 50 g actuation force.\nAll of our switches are made by Kailh, one of the best switch makers in the world. Kailh rates all of these switches for at least 70 million keypresses. \nNot sure which one will work best for you? Don't worry. You don't need to choose today. After the campaign wraps up, we'll email you to confirm your shipping address and switch preference.\nThe Keyboardio Atreus features hot-swap sockets designed to let you remove the switches with a standard keyswitch puller (not included) and replace them with just about any MX-style switch, no soldering or disassembly required.\nThe standard keycaps shipped with the Keyboardio Atreus will be black, laser-engraved keys in the XDA profile. They will be made out of PBT, a high-quality plastic beloved by keyboard enthusiasts for their resilience. The standard F and J keys installed on the keyboard include homing bars. \nIf you have backed for an August-delivery keyboard, you'll have an opportunity to choose between keycaps with English-language legends and blank keycaps without legends after the campaign ends. \nIf you choose a keyboard with labeled keys, your keyboard will come with extra F and J keys without homing bars. If you want to rearrange your keys to a layout like Dvorak or Colemak, you can use the alternative F and J keys so you don't have homing bars in the wrong place.\nEvery keyboard comes with a few alternative keycaps\nAll keyboards will come with Keyboardio Butterfly and 'Any' keycaps.\nSome of our reward tiers include a travel case custom-designed to securely carry the Atreus. Its shell is made of a tough 600D polyester fabric wrapped around internal plastic structural panels and just a bit of cushioning foam.\nThe travel case perfectly cradles your keyboard, with a separate pocket for your USB cable. \nWhile it's small enough to slide into your backpack, the case is sturdy enough to carry on its own. It has a handle made from nylon webbing and two D-rings you can use to attach your own shoulder strap. If instant access to your keyboard on the go is critical, you'll appreciate the case's fold-flat velcro belt loop.\n We designed the Keyboardio Atreus to be small and light, so it's easy to bring everywhere, but many of us spend our days at a desk. \nThe hardwood palm rest\nDrawing on the experience building our first keyboard's body out of wood, we've designed a gorgeous solid hardwood palm rest for the Keyboardio Atreus. \nYour Atreus slides into the palm rest when you're at your desk.\nThe palm rest features a gentle five degree tilt, contoured edges and a wide, deep area for your hands. Each palm rest is precision-milled from warm, beautiful walnut. Non-marking silicone pads on the bottom of the palm rest ensure that it will stay put on your desk.\nNo matter which reward tier you choose, every Keyboardio Atreus comes with:\nA shielded 1.5M USB A to USB-C cable\nA laminated layout card featuring the standard layout on one side and a blank layout for you to customize on the other\nFour extra keycaps: Alternative F and J keys without homing bumps, a Keyboardio Butterfly key, and an Any key\nOur standard one year warranty\nAs a Kickstarter backer, your Keyboardio Atreus and accessories are also priced at a significant discount off our expected retail pricing.\nEarly Delivery Keyboardio Atreus - $99\nWe have a limited number of keyboards from our factory's pilot run available as early delivery rewards for Backers. Because these keyboards are already being manufactured, we will only have 75 early delivery keyboards with BOX White switches and 75 with Speed Copper switches. \nAs of right now, the only difference we expect between these keyboards to have from mass-production keyboards is the color of the cardboard box the keyboard comes in (plain brown vs. black for mass production).\nIf you back for an early delivery keyboard, you need to choose your switch type as you back.  \nIf you choose an early delivery unit, you will have the opportunity to buy accessories at the Kickstarter price after campaign end.  Please don't manually add money to your pledge within Kickstarter. \nThe Keyboardio Atreus - $99\nA Keyboardio Atreus\nEveryday Carry - $129\nA Keyboardio Atreus and a Travel Case\nDesktop paradise - $159\nA Keyboardio Atreus and a palm rest\nEverything - $179\nA Keyboardio Atreus, travel case, and a palm rest\nSwitches: 44 x full-travel mechanical Kailh MX-style switches (Rated at 70 million+ presses)\nHot-swap sockets: 44 x Kailh sockets (Rated at 100 switch changes)\nRollover: Full NKRO (no ghosting)\nMicrocontroller: Microchip ATmega32U4 \nInterface: USB 2.0 over USB-C \nIncluded cable: 1.5m USB-C to USB A \nCompatible operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, iPadOS \nKey plate: black-anodized aluminum* \nEnclosure: Black ABS plastic\nKeycaps: Black PBT plastic with laser-engraved legends\nDimensions: 24.3 x 10 x 2.8cm (9.6x3.9x1.1 inches)\nWeight: 310g (10.8 oz)\nAll of these specs, are, of course, subject to change, though we don't expect them to change much, if at all.\n* Due to an internal error, we initially said the plate was steel, not aluminum.  We're really sorry for the mixup.\nWe designed the Keyboardio Atreus to be easy to field-strip with a standard Philips screwdriver, though it's not something you should generally need to do.\nThe anodized aluminum plate is secured to the bottom tray with 12 countersunk flat-head tapping screws hidden underneath the keycaps.\nRemove the screws to take the keyboard out of the tray\n Once you lift the plate and circuit board out of the tray, you'll see that all of the components on the circuit board are mounted to the bottom side. This makes them easy to access without separating the circuit board and the plate.\nAll of the components are soldered to the back of the circuit board.\nThe circuit board is secured to the plate with seven pan-head machine screws. If you ever need to separate the circuit board from the plate, just unscrew it\u2014no soldering iron required.\nYour keyboard and accessories will ship from our Hong Kong warehouse partner, located just across the border from our factory in Dongguan, China. We've been working with them since the beginning of 2018. As a global shipping hub, Hong Kong is a convenient and efficient origin point for shipments to just about anywhere. \nThe discounted shipping rates we're able to offer you are \"DDU\" rates, which do not include prepayment of tax or duty. You will be responsible for any include duty, tax, or import charges. \nAs of March 2020, we don't believe that you will owe any duty on keyboards or accessories if your shipping address is inside the United States.\nWe will ship to just about any country in the world; if your country isn't already listed as an option in the rewards drop down, send us a message and we'll add it if we can. \nKeyboardio is a tiny company making beautiful, comfortable keyboards. We're a husband-and-wife team that got started when Jesse couldn't find a keyboard that didn't make his wrists hurt, and so decided to spend a month making his own. One thing led to another, and now we've got thousands of happy customers.\nWe've always tried to be open about what we do.

Since then, we've learned a lot about design, factory and supply chain management, and fulfillment. Our second Kickstarter project shipped early. \n\nWe think we've provided a conservative timeline with this project. We have already completed design, selected a factory, had tooling made, obtained FCC and CE certifications, and completed a pilot run with the factory. Our keyboard firmware has been running for several years on thousands of devices. We believe that we're now past most of the milestones that cause shipping delays for Kickstarter projects.\n\nOur biggest concern for delays comes from the ongoing spread of COVID-19 / coronavirus and how that might affect our supply chain. Our keyboard factory has re-opened after the Chinese New Year holiday, but some of their supplier factories have not. \n\nAs of this writing, we're confident that we can get you your keyboard in the timeframe we promise.\n\nWe believe that the electrical components for the keyboard should be readily purchasable in the quantities we might need them, and that the greatest risk of supply chain disruption would be for the travel case and wooden palm rest. If the keyboards are available significantly before the accessories, we plan to ship the keyboards separately and absorb any increase in costs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "Keyboardio Atreus", "descp": "One beautiful keyboard\nINCLUDES:\nKeyboardio Atreus (Choose switches after campaign)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["883 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 129 or more", "title": "Everyday Carry", "descp": "For the typist who takes their keyboard everywhere.\nINCLUDES:\nKeyboardio Atreus (Choose switches after campaign)\nTravel case", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["868 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 159 or more", "title": "Desktop Paradise", "descp": "Your Atreus keyboard will look as good as it feels in a wooden desktop palm rest\nINCLUDES:\nKeyboardio Atreus (Choose switches after campaign)\nWalnut palm rest", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["127 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 179 or more", "title": "Everything", "descp": "The Atreus and all its accessories\nINCLUDES:\nKeyboardio Atreus (Choose switches after campaign)\nWalnut palm rest\nTravel case", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["560 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,250 or more", "title": "Limited Edition Walnut Atreus", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nKeyboardio Atreus with Walnut Keycaps\nTravel case\nWalnut palm rest", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (1 left of 3)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "Early Atreus with BOX White switches", "descp": "One beautiful Keyboardio Atreus from the pilot run.

But let's not stop there! Let's add more content to Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with our stretch goals!\n\nWe reached all of our stretch goals for the campaign and we couldn't be more excited! Thank you to everyone who contributed and helped us make this a reality. \nWe obviously can't promise that Swords 'n Magic will be accepted by Nintendo but now we can afford to focus on porting in case we are. We promise to do everything within our power to get the game there and keep you in the loop every step of the way.\nWe love this community and couldn't imagine developing a game without all of you right behind us.\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is a cute, cooperative, open world video game centered around the joy of discovery. This game is a passion project that I've been bringing to life for over two years now. Swords 'n Magic and Stuff is a love letter to all the game worlds I lost myself in growing up.  The game is being developed with my wife and daughter in mind. We'd searched for years for a game like Swords 'n Magic and finally I just decided that I'd have to take matters into my own hands.\nThe game is a casual journey of discovery. You take the role of a blank slate adventurer just waiting for their chance to carve out their destiny. With no classes, levels or restrictions, you can be whoever you want to be, use whatever weapons and items you can buy, loot or craft, and play however you wish. You can seek out epic adventures laden with legendary treasure or enjoy the simple life of owning a small farm, crafting furniture for your home or even just traveling the world as a simple merchant. In Swords 'n Magic and Stuff you play at your own pace with no hand-holding.\nTirawyn is a high fantasy world where a good king has befallen a terrible curse and fled his throne in an attempt to save his kingdom from himself. The people of Tirawyn are in a state of panic as evil begins to lurk in all corners of the realm and novice adventurers begin to take matters into their own hands. But are they causing more trouble than they're worth? \nWatch the lore episode from the Swords 'n Magic devlog below to learn more about the history of Tirawyn and how the world came to be. \nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff has been designed and developed live on Twitch.tv from the ground up with an audience of passionate fantasy RPG fans. This game is a tribute to this wonderful community who has supported it from its humble beginnings and because of that, fan input has always been a high priority for me. So much so that some of the in-game clothing designs and lore books were actually created by the Swords 'n Magic community through a content submission system for our most creative fans. We plan to continue this effort, and in doing so, keep as connected as possible with fans, treating your ideas and opinions with the respect and consideration they deserve.\nJoin our Discord to see frequent updates about the game, share your ideas for the game and to chat with like-minded adventurers!\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff stands out because of all the individual pieces that fit together to create a dynamic, immersive world for you to lose yourself in. While we understand the excitement of exploring dangerous lands and fighting powerful monsters, as long-time Dungeons and Dragons players, we also understand that the downtime in an adventure should be just as engaging. Which is why a lot of our features revolve around town-life and the act of owning and decorating your own home among many other non-combat gameplay features.\nOur core design pillars are exploration, discovery, curiosity and growth. We use these to drive our core gameplay loop which is designed to be as follows: Players explore a new area, discover something interesting, seek out more about that new interest driven by curiosity and not a quest log with tick boxes, then return to their home to rest and evaluate the items they've discovered in order to progress and grow as a character and a player. Of course, we also believe that getting lost in loops within loops is a very intriguing part of open world game design, which is why we've not only designed specific zones to fit into this loop, but also sections of each zone and even the items within those sections. Everything is driven by discovery and curiosity, which is why it's so important for us to create hand crafted content that's unique and engaging for players of all ages and skill levels.\nHere's a breakdown of some of the most noteworthy features in Swords 'n Magic and Stuff to get an idea of all there is for players to experience:\nPlay with your friends in networked multiplayer\nCollect and discover hundreds of items\nUse anything - No class or level restrictions\nHands-off quests - No breadcrumbs or quest markers\nDual wield anything\nBuy, tame and collect dozens of mounts and pets\nSeasons and weather effects\nSeasonal events and unique seasonal items\nMini-games like tavern dice and target practice\nJoin factions and rise through the ranks\nTitles that show off your accomplishments\nBuild or purchase homes and furniture to decorate them with\nFish, hunt, grow and harvest resources to cook hearty meals with\nGather materials and craft your own furniture and weapons\nExplore a wide variety of dungeons\nPvP Arenas to test your mettle with your friends\nCollect clothes, hats and armor to customize your character\nNon-gendered character creation\nTwitch integration to get your viewers into the action\nA private, dedicated server you can host yourself\nFully mappable keybinds and gamepad support\nWe don't believe in hand-holding or tick boxes when it comes to questing. We're approaching each quest as a separate adventure driven entirely by curiosity. Instead of accepting a quest from an NPC, you'll have the opportunity to add intriguing information to your journal to keep track of information for later. Finding a book about an ancient sword forgotten by history isn't just lore, but a treasure map in its own right. Asking around could lead you on a new epic journey to find that long lost weapon and learn about why it's important along the way, if that's your thing.\nMany games offer multiplayer, but not many offer what Swords 'n Magic plans to. I want to give players the best and most connected experience possible. Playing together means also being able to play apart. You aren't tethered to your friends when playing. Explore the world at your own pace and party up when you feel like it. And when you're ready to join another friend, take your entire character and everything they're holding with you. No need to make a new character for every new server.\n\nHost a game directly through Steam for up to 8 players or host a dedicated server wherever you like so you and all your friends can come and go as you please. Password protect your worlds or invite anyone and make new friends.  Customize your hosted world with options that cater to how you want to experience the world.\n\nSwords 'n Magic is designed to sidestep a drawback my wife and I have experienced many times with multiplayer RPG's. We hate having to start new worlds or new characters when we invite a new friend to play with us. In this game we're doing our best to make sure that not only can a new friend join at any time, but with no level restrictions, they can join in on the fun right off the bat. You can simply share some of your higher tier gear with them, or if they'd prefer to work for it themselves, you can trade your gear out at your house for some of your weaker items and join in on their adventure as an equal. \n\n\nBacking the game gets you access to exclusive Kickstarter rewards. All tiers which include game keys also include access to these rewards. When the game launches we'll also be offering a Hero Edition, which includes even more exclusive in-game content. Because we believe that pay to win mechanics are a dark cloud over the game industry, none of our exclusive in-game rewards offer any actual gameplay advantages and are merely cosmetic. \nWant to back with PayPal? No problem! Head over here to do so:\n\n\nBonus reward!\nGuess what! Because of how much more this campaign has brought in than we expected, we decided to add a new reward for everyone to show our appreciation. Every tier that receives a game key will also get a super cute, in-game, baby fox pet. Here's some awesome concept art drawn by our artist, Kitsunne.\n\n\nKindred Games was founded in early 2018 by me, Michael Kocha. I started Swords 'n Magic and Stuff as a solo project under no studio name thinking it would be a quick 3 month game project I used to learn Unreal Engine. But when I started streaming the game and began growing a small, but very dedicated fanbase, features and ideas started piling up and the game became a bigger project, eventually growing into my dream project.  \n This is when I began Kindred Games. I knew from the start that the studio needed to represent the passion I felt for making games with an audience and my family in mind. Kindred, which means one's family, was such a perfect word for how I wanted to treat this project and ultimately my game studio.\nSix months into development I'd built a nice little prototype of what I thought the game could feel like. I released it to many of my most dedicated fans and received loads of feedback and praise. Though I thought the game only had a couple hours of content, some of my testers racked up over a dozen hours in the project looking for every single secret and trying to find every item in the game. That's when I knew what the core focus of the game needed to be. The joy of discovery.\nI got to work learning more about Unreal Engine and taking the project more seriously. I knew the prototype was a success and that the game was going to be something worth investing my time into. I brought on a programmer (Not Moz!) to add multiplayer to the game at this time as well.\nBut it's hard to make a video game while living in a hotel room for 2 months.\nShortly after we started implementing multiplayer my wife, Janna, was relocated to a state halfway across the country and I had to take 3 months off from the game. Partly because of packing and selling our house, and partly because we were stuck in a hotel room for two months before we could find somewhere to live near Janna's work. This was a huge setback for me and the programmer. When I finally returned to the game I'd lost all motivation and ambition. After nearly 6 months of working with the programmer we still couldn't even play the game together. Nothing was working right and all I'd done in 6 months was build half of a new zone and a single dungeon. \nSo I quit.\nI threw in the towel and let the programmer go. This was the lowest point in the development of Swords 'n Magic and probably in all of my game dev career. I had failed to keep the game and my passion for it alive and it really hurt watching my community slowly disappear. My streams had stopped entirely. My testers hadn't received an update in months. Everyone knew that Swords 'n Magic was now dead. Lost in the indie game graveyard with hundreds of thousands of other unfinished games that had real potential.\nI took a few weeks off to reevaluate my goals as a gamedev. Eventually my 3 year old daughter asked me one day to play the game again and asked why I hadn't been working. I loaded it up for her and she sat on my lap and took the gamepad.  I watched her explore the world for the thousandth time as she asked me questions about who the different NPC's were, what they were saying, why they were where they were and if she could be friends with them. She asked me questions about where she could find a better sword and how to get gold so she could buy another potion to drink. She ran away from the monsters and tried hugging all the sheep. Finally she asked if I would make a new character for her to meet. Within the hour I found myself adding more content into the game for her to play through and I knew Swords 'n Magic and Stuff just couldn't be over. Not yet.\n\n\nOne year later\nThe game has changed a lot. Many of the original mechanics have been reworked and now the game features fully functioning multiplayer. I've hired a different programmer on to help with this. I've also embraced the fact that I can't make this game alone this time around. If I'm going to build a game for a growing, loving community then I would need their help in more ways than one.\n\n\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is being developed by a team of two developers: Me, (Michael, aka Kindred) and Moz. But we're not the only ones contributing to the game's success. Since I've been streaming the development of the game for over two years I've also grown a small but very dedicated and hard working mod team. Many of these wonderful people have proven to have other very useful talents in places outside moderation so they deserve a mention here as well.\n\nSpecial thanks:\n Gideon - Youtube Video Editor\n Cameron - Website Developer\n Janna - Community Manager\n Brendan - Illustrator\n Wendy - Social Media Management\nEven though these awesome people don't do any work on the game itself, they are still a huge help. Without them I don't think anything would get done around here.\nI've been a stay at home dad for just over 5 years. Since quitting my job in retail I went to school for 3D art and animation for games and earned my bachelor's degree. My goal was always to make games, but I didn't think making my own games for a living would ever be a real possibility. Luckily the opportunity presented itself when we learned that child care cost more than what I made at my job. My wife's career, however, was just beginning to take off and she went on to support the family while I followed my dream of being a dev dad.  \nJust over a month ago my wife, Janna, was informed that the position she currently held was being eliminated. This put her in an awkward spot where she had to choose between applying for positions across the country that she didn't want, or to leave the company she had invested her life into for 12 years.\nAfter a few weeks of serious contemplation she decided that it was time to put all of our cards on the table with Swords 'n Magic and Stuff. \nNow that she's helping full time with Swords 'n Magic we have no other income until the game launches. Kickstarter is a chance for us to fund the development of the game without having to go bankrupt in the meantime.\nWith your help we'll be able to see the rest of the development through without worrying about how to put food on our tables, but we'll also be able to give the game the love and attention it deserves. We've budgeted a chunk of the funds for a custom soundtrack and already have a musician ready to go. We're putting some funds toward marketing to make sure that the game has as many eyes on it as we can get. Some of the funding will go into custom animations and sound effects for the game as well as any additional tools and software costs we run into along the way. And finally, we plan on paying our wonderful programmer, Moz, a cut for all the hard work he's already put in with nothing in return. It's not every day you find a skilled programmer who has enough love for a project to work for a revenue share. We're very lucky to have him so you can play Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with your friends and family. As it was meant to be played.\nBut in the event that the Kickstarter fails, we still plan to continue the project. We hope you understand that this means we'll have to cut back heavily on the game's features and content. We'll have to cancel the musician, deal with limited animation and sound effect assets, we'll have to find a way to market the game on no budget and worst of all, rush the project to completion. This means the game won't be what we envision, but I couldn't move on from it without knowing that we did everything we could to make it succeed.\nI truly believe wholeheartedly in this game. I hope that you'll consider supporting us in this project so we can bring  my passion project to life. I can't wait to see you in the game. Thanks for reading. <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBased on all the Kickstarter horror stories of games being abandoned after a successful campaign, I think it's obvious that the biggest risk is this game not being completed. \n\nI've been working on this project for over two years and have restarted the project twice for different reasons. I've since brought on a programmer and have grown a fantastic community through Twitch and Youtube. I think having this many people counting on me, requesting regular updates and cheering me on has kept me on track far longer than I could have done on my own and I have no doubt it will continue to motivate me to finish. \n\nIn the end we think being open and honest is always the best course of action, especially when asking for a community to fund a large project like this. Without your help, this project can't happen, so it's only fair to keep you in the loop when we run into problems or setbacks. \n\nWe promise never to leave you in the dark about the status of the project or issues we encounter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Every little bit helps", "descp": "We get it.

There will be a digital version offered in the form a ROM file of the game that you can play on a Nintendo Entertainment System emulator or on any emulation platform or flashcart of your choice. \n  Imagine a very prehistoric and barbaric world where there are no cities but people live in giant temples instead of cities. Temples located in mountains, deserts and other weird places where humans gather and live together to protect themselves from outside dangers, but and to serve their elders who dedicate their time to communicate with gods in search of knowledge and power.     \nEyra - character design\nYou are Eyra, a young warrior priestess from a barbarian tribe that's been attacked by the Infernal Marauder, an evil warrior ruler from a far away land. You must travel away from the world you know into dark and unfamiliar lands with the sole company of your trusty familiar, a brave crow trained for combat.   \nInfernal Marauder - character design\nYour mission is simple but not easy. Your elders sent you to rescue a group of soldiers who were kidnapped by Infernal Marauder who intends to experiment on them with ancient magic to create an army never seen before that'll help him destroy everyone who opposes him.   \n\nThis screenshot is a mock-up and the final game graphics may differ since some restriction haven't been applied here.\nAlong the way you will face many enemies and a few bosses that will do everything within their power to stop her.  \nWorry not... There will be plenty of bad guys for you to defeat.\nThis screenshot is a mock-up and the final game graphics may differ since some restriction haven't been applied here.\nIf you want to have a taste of the gameplay you can download a demo right HERE \nIt can be played on any NES emulator of your choice or in real hardware using a Flashcart. Please keep in mind that there are still many features missing from the gameplay. We are actively working on the game during the Kickstarter Campaign and as we add and polish features we'll keep updating you with more and better versions of Eyra - The Crow Maiden. We hope that you like this demo and it leaves you wanting more!\n\nThe game will take you through 5 different levels divided into 2 parts each, but there might be some extra stages hidden along the way so keep your eyes open. \nAlong the levels there are several warrior prisoners that you need to free in order to continue.\nAlso... Each level will end with a difficult boss fight before you go into the next one. \nThink you can beat this dude?\nEyra can trust on her weapon training and her brave familiar in order to defeat her enemies and save her friends.\nYou'll be surprised to know how much damage this guy can do to the foes.\nAlong the way you'll find power items that will upgrade Eyra's weapons that grant her more reach and deal more damage.\nEyra's walking animation\nEyra's idle and crouching animations\nAll the game's graphics were made using Gimp and Aseprite. We made sure that all the graphic content was finished before starting to code so we could get the game to look exactly how we wanted it to.\nGame's tiles used for mock-ups of the levels and stages\nOnce the tiles were done we started mocking up the levels to get the right feel out of each one... \nMock-ups... These were made having in mind only some of the console's limitations just to have an idea of how the levels would look.\nIn order to develop this game from idea to reality, we had Antoine (FG Software) whip us up a level editor that would allow level creation to happen while he builds the engine.  \nThe Eyditor - Eyra's level editor that'll also be really usfeul on upcoming projects.\nThe level editor also allows us to manage the tiles and metatiles for the game and picking the color palettes.\nThe music is being made by Famicuber using Famitracker along with his custom NES music development ROM called \"SECT\" (Sound Engine Compatibility Test) SECT was developed to make sure that the music and sound effects play correctly on both emulators and hardware after the sound engine converted  the sound files to code.  Eyra, the Crow Maiden uses the FamiTone2 sound engine made by Shiru. \nEyra is being developed in NESASM3 and is jamming the NROM mapper to the max.   \nPLAY\n\nSome tests on real hardware.\nThe DxS-NROM-256-01 PCB's are a perfect solution for NES programs that utilize the NROM mapper\nEyra - The Crow Maiden will be manufactured using brand new, high quality parts.   \nWe try to use resources from our community when possible. Here's what our local print shop has recently acquired and how we make our NES Boxes: \nPLAY\n\nProject Lead: Adam Welch, who's the team lead and project manager for Eyra, The Crow Maiden has been gaming since the 80's, programming since the 90's, and developing retro games for nearly a decade.\nProgramming: Antoine Fantys AKA Vectrex28, programmer on this project, NES dev since 2014.

Has the fascination for making games and sound for retro consoles and home computers since as a teenager. This is his second project for Second Dimension, the first being for another  Second Dimension game, Family Picross.\nIf the campaign reaches $15,000: We'll make a 16 bit version of Eyra - The Crow Maiden for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive.  New and improved graphics and features will be added to the 16-bit ports.\n If the campaign reaches $17,500: We'll make a 16 bit version of Eyra - The Crow Maiden for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\n These are mock-ups of what the game might look like on the Mega Drive. If the stretch goal is met we will do our best to enhance the gameplay experience as much as we can in every aspect to make a true 16-bit video game. \nWe'd like to send our gratitude to FG Soft for helping with the programming of Eyra (and for also making us a killer level editor), as well as to our friends, family, and fans who continue to make it possible for us to make new and exciting games for you!\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe do our best to mitigate any issues by handling all of the manufacturing internally and most items are sourced locally.

Help us translate three new books in English! These new projects are dedicated to Japanese animation. \n (click on the picture to access the tweet) \nFollow us:   Twitter  - Instagram - Facebook  - Contact Us \nThis is our fifth campaign here on Kickstarter, and the successes of our previous campaigns have been truly rewarding for us. Thanks to you \u2013our backers\u2013 we have become a recognized English book publisher, and we cannot thank you enough. But, most importantly, it has helped us establish a real relationship with our readers. The visibility that Kickstarter has given us, plus the feedback and support that we have received from you, the readers, are very precious to us. Through this new Kickstarter campaign, we hope to continue providing you with our books!\nOur first Kickstarters were a thrilling success. Thanks to you, we have managed to translate 17 books from our French-language bestsellers, including The Legend of Kingdom Hearts, The Legend of Final Fantasy (VI, VII & VIII), Zelda: The History of a Legendary Saga (Volumes 1 & 2), Dark Souls: Beyond the Grave (Volumes 1 & 2), but also Metal Gear Solid: Hideo Kojima\u2019s Magnum Opus, BioShock: From Rapture to Columbia, The Strange Works of Taro Yoko: From Drakengard to NieR: Automata, Devolver: Behind the Scenes, etc. The amazing enthusiasm from our backers has warmed our hearts, and the feedback we have received so far from our readers has been more than positive!\nUnderneath their fancy covers, our books are filled with pages upon pages of impassioned writing\u2014black-and-white text only, no illustration. In addition to looking into the works\u2019 genesis, the books offer an in-depth analysis covering every aspect of the works of art in question; their themes, aesthetic and much more. This is in keeping with Third Editions\u2019 editorial line, embodied by the three core concepts that comprise the framework of all of our books: Creation, Universe and Decryption.\nIn this way, we endeavor to explain how, why and when these mangas or movies were made, what they became, and illustrate their importance in a context of popular culture.\nBased in Toulouse, France, Third \u00c9ditions is a publishing company founded in 2015 by Mehdi El Kanafi and Nicolas Courcier. Veterans of the video game industry and fascinated by print media since childhood, they combined their passions and co-wrote several books on major series: Zelda: The History of a Legendary Saga, Metal Gear Solid: Hideo Kojima\u2019s Magnum Opus and The Legend of Final Fantasy VII. Each release is a comprehensive record produced with true passion and the utmost care for accuracy. Third Editions has now published 70 books in France, all dedicated to the video game industry and popular culture, and is now localizing select titles for the enjoyment of readers around the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fifth Kickstarter campaign, and that in itself is a testament to our experience. We have delivered all the rewards from our first campaigns and we have learned a lot in the process.\n\nOur book-publishing house is located in France, so we have a strong grasp of the production chain here. However, with new territories, come new risks\u2026\n- Localization: We have now produced 17 books in English. The process is already quite solid, but we are constantly working on ways to improve it.\n- International distribution: We now have two fulfilment centers, one in Europe and one in North America. This reduces delivery delays as well as costs for many of our backers.\n- International marketing: The marketing channels we use to publish our French books are not very useful to us when it comes to our books in English. We have found partners to distribute in bookstores, but we are still a relatively small player on the international scene and the task of creating visibility for our products lies upon our shoulders. This is clearly one of the reasons why we are returning to Kickstarter, as this has proved to be a powerful way for us to reach our readers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Thank you!", "descp": "Thanks a lot, every amount counts!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac12 or more", "title": "An ebook", "descp": "The book of your choice in ebook format (ePub and MOBI).

The party begins their adventure in a small town called THE MOUNDS, where civilization has begun to rebound from cataclysm, but awareness of the greater earth is still a mystery. The growing settlement, surrounded by the eight huge grassy bulges, teeters toward civic advancement and progress, ignorant of the strange secrets that lay dormant beneath their feet.\nThe party\u2019s quest begins when a regional diplomat arrives in search of assistance uncovering a hidden resource that could give humanity a new chance at thriving. The adventure will begin to reveal  the secret history of the world, only to find that all that has been lost has been replaced by a new power, and paradigm-changing remnants of the last age of humanity, both terrible and wondrous.\nOn their tenth birthday, every child of The Mounds is told the same story. They are taken to the plateau to the North, and told to gaze out over the lush forests, the Twin Cherry peaks, and a sky filled with stars of every color on the spectrum. Their stark campsite would remain dark, frost forming on their meager blankets, with only fear and awe offered to fend off the chill of the night air, enough to send tremors through their skin and bones, shaking them warm. The elders would speak of the past\u2026\nGenerations ago, a Cataclysm occurred. Fire rained from the sky, melting the landscape into new formations. The Earth, having been violently shocked awake, finally aware of being poisoned and pillaged, opened up its many mouths to swallow civilization. Storms raged, species died, and the sun went black for countless years. Ancestors watched as the world they knew crumbled around them, and they were left to learn how to live in peace with the ground under their feet, with the swaying limbs and snowy peaks above them, and the crashing waves of unfamiliar coasts. As the sun slowly relit, the elders told of dawn\u2019s return, of beginning to build where comfort could be found.\nThe world of BUNKER is inspired by our common fear of climate catastrophe, and by our shared hope for a heavy metal environmentalist utopia: an utopia populated by earth witches and druid circles, by lordless knights who pledge to serve the woods, by smiths crafting reclaimed plastics and e-waste into magical armor. There are also a bunch of monsters and fantasy characters hanging out with, riding, and high fiving bears. Lots and lots of bears.\nThe forces of evil in BUNKER are inspired by the facts of man-made climate disaster: habitat destruction, mass extinction, hubris, and greed. Rivers of necromantic goo erupt from the fractured earth. Trans-planar baddies arrive, lured to the Earth to feed on magic like so many extraction capitalists unearthing a new vein of coal. They coerce and deceive their servants to exploit the fragile balance of a still-recovering world for access to powerful dark magic.\nBUNKER (the zine!) #1 offers the players a sense of the world as their characters know it. It includes:\nIntroduction\nMap\nModule #1\nFive Pregenerated Characters with in-story ties\nBestiary #1\nFillable Character Sheet Design\nIssue #2 (UNLOCKED!!!) takes the game, and the PC experience to the next level with a mind-bending crawl unlocking the mysteries that the world has hidden away. It includes:\nIntroduction\nMap\nModule #2\nArtificer Class\nBestiary #2\nFruit from The Garden (Armory & Special Items)\nBUNKER is designed to be playable & portable, with simple stat blocks that Gamemasters / Judges / Keepers / Referees / Shoggoths should be able to use with the OSR system of their choice.\nModule 1, The Quest for the Forgotten Key, is designed for 3 - 5 1st level players. It welcomes players into the world, and sets the stage for many mysteries, while still offering the chance for both immersive role play and dangerous combat.\nModule 2, The Secret of The Mounds, picks up at the end of module 1, and changes the entire perspective of what this world was, and what it will become now that secrets have been unleashed. \nBUNKER #1 includes an illustrated Bestiary detailing not just stats, but behaviors \u2018n\u2019 flavors of the monsters players will encounter in our world. We\u2019ll also be including a random encounter table to help keep things super-fresh and super-dangerous. \nBUNKER will also include fresh deities, patrons, maps, spells, armor, weapons, and special items that you\u2019ll find nowhere else.\nOur version of the post-apocalypse considers what (materials, structures, ideas) might survive a cataclysm in 2020.

Our manufacturer ensures that the water used in the dying process is still clean enough to be recycled for irrigation and other purposes.\nThe GOTS social criteria requires safe and hygienic working conditions for employees, the payment of living wages, regular and fair working hours, and the right for workers to unionise.

For each skirt you'd like to add, please increase your pledge by $100 AUD. \nTo quickly figure out which level you should back, and the total amount, please use our pledge calculator below! \nIf you're still not sure how to pledge, feel free to message us and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. \nThe size charts below will help you find your perfect fit! The best way to ensure we have your size is to find and measure a similar garment that you already own. You can also use the US and UK size equivalents as a guide, but we recommend measuring as well since sizing can be so variable between brands.\nPlease note that all of the measurements in the charts refer to the size of the garment, not your body measurements. We explain how to use them underneath each chart.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your skirt size, you'll need to get your waist measurement! Use a soft tape measure and measure around the smallest part of your waist (above your belly button and below your ribs). For a more detailed explanation of how to measure yourself, please see this link.\nThe back waistband of the skirt has elastic, and can stretch up to 10cm / 4\".\nIf you prefer a snug fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the high end of the waist measurement range (For example, a size 14 for an 87cm waist). This means the elastic will be more stretched when you wear it, and will feel firmer.\nIf you prefer a looser fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the low end of the range (For example, a size 20 for a 97cm waist). This means the elastic will be more relaxed on you.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your shirt size, we recommend measuring a similar button-up shirt you already own and feel comfortable in. Our shirts are semi-fitted, so make sure the shirt you're measuring isn't loose or baggy around the chest and waist.\nTo find your shirt's chest measurement, lay it flat on a hard surface and measure across the front from one underarm seam to the other. Please watch this video for a thorough guide of how to do this.\nOnce you have your shirt's chest measurement, round up to the next size in the size chart that will fit you. For example, for a 56cm chest you would size up to a M.\nYou can also take your shirt's shoulder width and length measurements, if you'd like to make sure that the size you've selected will fit. The videos linked below explain in detail how to do this:\nFinding your shirt's shoulder width\nFinding your shirt's length\nAll shipping will be handled in the pledge manager after the campaign is completed. You will be charged separately from your pledge on Kickstarter! \nThe chart below is an estimate of the shipping costs, based on your pledge level and your country.

We will do our best to get you a shipping estimate. You can message us through Kickstarter, or send an email to hello@ludocherry.com, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\nIf you are adding items onto your pledge, each additional shirt will add ~$3-6 shipping and each additional skirt will add ~$5-8 shipping.\nIf you are planning on ordering a large number of items and would like a more accurate estimate, please get in touch with us!\nIf you're a retailer interested in stocking LudoCherry in your store, or getting our clothing for your staff to wear to work, please get in touch with us!\nYou can email us at retail@ludocherry.com, or message us on Kickstarter.\n There are a few reasons! \nThe first is that Kickstarter allows us to raise the funds we need to actually make LudoCherry a reality. We\u2019ve already invested a large amount of our personal savings into developing our business, our fabric designs, and our clothing, but the amount of money required for a production run is beyond our reach. With your support, we'll be able to raise the money we need for the production run.\nKickstarter also allows us to solve many of the issues that traditional clothing brands face. Companies often create their clothes in limited size ranges and colours, to prevent profit loss on variations that don't sell. By using Kickstarter, and knowing in advance what our backers will be ordering, we\u2019re able to create a much more inclusive range. We'll be able to order more of the sizes and fabrics that are the most in demand, and reduce our loss on the less popular variations - meaning we can afford to create a wide range of sizes and fabrics for you to wear! \nFinally, Kickstarter allows us to interact directly with our community, and take your feedback and ideas on board. We want you to be as excited to wear LudoCherry as we are, so we want to use Kickstarter as a chance to talk with you about what we're doing well and what we could be doing better.\nFinally we'd like to extend a special thanks to some people who helped us make LudoCherry the best it can be.\nTo James Mathe, Jamey Stegmaier, Daniel Zayas, and Martyn Poole - Thank you for your contributions to the crowdfunding community, and for always being willing to give advice.\nTo Ted and Toni - Thank you for seeing my passion for the industry, and for all your support.\nTo Neil Thomson and the Albury Game Club - All of this is your fault.\nTo my parents - Thank you for always supporting me, even when I gave up politics for game design.\n -Phoebe", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is our first Kickstarter as a company, we both have years of experience working within the board game industry. Phoebe has worked on 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns through her position as Bezier Games' Social Media Manager (raising a total of over $2.5 million USD).\n\nMark has worked in film for 6 years as a Producer and Assistant Director. As a result, he is experienced in managing logistics for large scale and complex projects, as well as meeting production deadlines. \n\nWe are confident that our combined experience will allow us to finalise and deliver a high quality project. All of our art is completed, and we have a manufacturer ready to start production after our campaign.\n\nIn the event that we receive samples back from the manufacturer that are not up to our standards, we may need to make alterations to the garment design or work with them to ensure a higher quality. However, we have built in sufficient time to our estimated delivery date to allow for this.\n\nAs a smaller company, it is also possible for us to be pushed back in the production queue for the manufacturer to prioritise larger brands.\n\nFinally, the ongoing coronavirus crisis in China has the potential to cause delays to our production and shipping. Currently it appears that factories are reopening, but we are not able to tell how the situation will evolve.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur clothes are designed to be high quality statement pieces that will last in your wardrobe for years to come.

Artwork will be unique to this zine.\nDELVE to HELL is a series of 26 isometric dungeon maps that begin at a tavern and end at the gates of Hell. Launched as part of Kickstarter's Zine Quest challenge - the final product with be a 32 Page Zine (5.5 x 8.5). This project is illustrated in the style of such past delves as The Trickle, The Iron Pine, and Hanigan\u2019s Crypt. The maps contained in DELVE to HELL are black & white, highly detailed and great for tabletop play. With the exception of the introduction, all pages are text-free for convenient use as rpg material. The entire series depicts a continuous trek from the surface to the depths of the underworld. Maps can be used individually or together as one complete delve. Great for GMs who enjoy populating dungeons and testing the mettle of players.\nSTRETCH GOAL! \nThanks to all for making this project a go! After checking a few printing sources, I have decided to offer DELVE to HELL as a full-size (8.5 x 11) option - upon reaching the $2500 mark. ALL Backers at the 'physical copy tier' ($20+) will have the choice of Zine (5.5 x 8.5) OR Full-Size (8.5 x 11) booklet.\nSamples of a few of my past delves - The Trickle, The Iron Pine, and Hanigan's Crypt.\nI have been wanting to delve to hell for some time, and Kickstarter's Zine Quest is a great way of mapping a complex dungeon adventure, without all the fluff. The maps are not intended to be religious in nature. They are simply inspired by the mythological and fantastical theme of Hell, and illustrated as a role-playing game accessory. I was raised on Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, so there's likely to be an old-school element or two thrown in. I've got 26 maps to play around with, so things should get interesting.\nDELVE to HELL will include a tavern floorplan, buried ruins, goblin hollows, and dwarven mines, among other things. The trek will continue into the darker depths of the underworld until arriving at Hell's gates.\nSample map style.\nAll artwork will be original to this Zine and has not appeared in any other Randy M or Roan Studio publications. The artwork samples used for this launch are from past projects. For those of you unfamiliar with my past work, there are a few free publications on Drive Thru RPG (under Roan Studio) that will give you a better idea of my mapping style. \n\nSample Cover. The image may change, but you get the idea.\n\nADDITIONAL MAPS\nAdditional maps at higher tiers will be original to this project and consist of add-ons, stand-alones, and a peak at what's beyond the gates of Hell. I've made the decision to print these maps as well, so they will be included with the Zine package (ie. Zine + 5 or 10 printed maps (folded to zine size)). \nSample Map Page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA number of maps have been completed; design and layout is just about done; and printing services have been secured.

Every track was created using only the sound chips inside of a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and a Gameboy (DMG).\nHere's the first cut of the full album playing on the Nintendo Entertainment Turntable for you to listen to while you browse the project details! This is a one-off copy that was lathed so it's a bit crude compared to the polished album. The quality of the sound on the full press will be far superior to what you hear in this example and all of the tracks have since been improved upon based on valuable feedback from friends and fellow musicians.\nI believe this project will be a treat for both casual and dedicated fans alike. However, without knowing what sort of demand there will be, I am unable to invest to meet the minimum quantities that the pressing plant and printing services require. Vinyl is a hefty investment, especially in smaller runs. Additionally, royalties will be paid in advance so that the copyright holders are properly compensated before the album is officially released. Kickstarter is also a great way to reach out to awesome people like you who want to be a part of something exciting! With the help of this campaign and you, the backers, I'll be able to offer a great quality pressing, album packaging & extras knowing exactly how much the initial investment can be.\nI've been creating chiptune music for over a decade and have been composing video game style themes since I was a child. I've also played piano for most of my life and have always enjoyed learning how to play songs from my favorite TV shows, movies, video games, and bands. With the possibilities of using a digital audio workstation to create music, I have spent countless hours over the years arranging and composing midi based tracks. This will be my fifth album and second release on vinyl.\nAround this time last year, backers just like you from around the world pitched in to bring my first vinyl release, \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\", to life and they were handsomely rewarded for their support and pledges. As with that project, I will spare no expense to create the best album I can, complete with plenty of extras!\nThis project simply wouldn't be possible without the backers so everyone who pledges $5 or more will get their name included in the album's \"Special Thanks\" section! I'll ask on the post-campaign survey how you want your name to appear. I did something similar with the \"RP2A\" album insert but this time, the names will be printed on the inside of the Gatefold jacket along with a special shout out to The Flaming Lips themselves!\nA pledge of $12 or more gets you a high quality digital download of \"Soft Bits In\", including a number of digital album cover options. With a pledge of $25 or more, you get three additional full album downloads: After These Messages, Shamroctoroc, & In The RP2A Over The Sea. All digital album downloads will be delivered via email as download codes that can be redeemed at any time.\nThis reward includes an album package containing two quality black vinyl LP records in white sleeves and a dual-pocket gatefold jacket, all protected by a clear, collector-grade poly bag. With this, you also receive the Deluxe Digital Album Download!\nThe Special Edition Vinyl Press has been designed specifically with collectors in mind. In addition to everything that comes with the \"Vinyl Press\" reward, it includes the following:\nFor those interested in the process of creating the album or looking to get into making chiptune music, this hour long, one-on-one screen share session will walk you through it all. I'll share what software & hardware I use, how I work within the inherent limitations, utilize creative techniques, and more! I will answer any questions you have or we can just chat about classic video games, art, music, technology, etc. This reward includes everything that comes with the Special Edition Vinyl Press.\nAfter previous album releases, I've received commissions for chiptune tracks, so I'm offering select backers the same service bundled with the Special Edition Vinyl Press in which I'll create a track just for you using the same setup I used for this album. This can be an original or an arrangement, up to five minutes in length. The recorded track will be sent to you in your preferred format when completed, along with a custom pixel art cover image to accompany it in your music app.\nThis is for the ultimate fan of chiptunes and vinyl - a record player built into a classic Nintendo Entertainment System! In addition to getting everything included with the Special Edition Vinyl Press, I'll create a NES Turntable just for you! It may be a novelty item with the internal components of a Crosley Cruiser but it's fully functional with multiple speeds, adjustable volume, component and headphone audio out jacks, built in speakers - and it is one heck of a conversation piece!\n\nKickstarter is all about transparency and accountability so I'm providing backers with an account of how all of the funds will be allocated.\nMaster stampers, pressing the records, printing the jackets, inner sleeves and clear poly bags to keep everything protected. Kindercore Vinyl and Imprint Indie Printing will be handling these since both did stellar work on my last vinyl album release.\nI've had my application for all of the tracks on this album approved by Easy Song Licensing and will be sending advanced royalty payments upon completion of the campaign to cover all physical copies as well as digital downloads.\nThese colorful 11x11\" gloss-finish album inserts, featuring authentic Gameboy Camera imagery, are included with the Special Edition Vinyl Press and will be printed through Discmakers. They're local to me and printed beautiful posters for the \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\" campaign.\nI'll be printing these 5x7\" pixel art prints, exclusive to the Special Edition Vinyl Press, at a local shop I've been using for over a decade so I can trust them to do a great job. Support small businesses when you can!\nThe Sticker Guy made fantastic pixel Jeff Mangum stickers for the last project so I'll be having them do these stickers included with the Special Edition Vinyl Press as well.\nShipping costs have been factored into pledge amounts for U.S. backers (*international backers, supplemental shipping will be added), plus heavy-duty vinyl mailers, filler pads, a lot of packing tape, and self-adhesive packing slip sleeves.\n*If your country is not currently available and you wish to back a physical reward, please contact me and I will estimate shipping and add it to the options!\nAs we journey further beyond the initial funding goal, upgrades to existing rewards and more goodies will be produced and so additional funds will be going towards these...\nI've done meticulous calculations to determine the outcome of this project whether it barely reaches the goal or maxes out every reward. If the campaign just meets the goal, I will have a small buffer to cover anything that doesn't go according to plan. If it reaches its peak potential, however, I will be upgrading rewards!\nIf the campaign reaches $12,000 then I will be pressing the records in two different colors of vinyl - purple and yellow. Kindercore offers this option for a better cost than many other pressing plants so with just a bit extra, we can make this happen!\nSurpassing $13,000 in funding will get the Special Edition Vinyl Press backers four more 5x7\" pixel art prints with colorful designs inspired by the lyrics of \"The Soft Bulletin\". Can you guess which songs might have inspired these designs?\nIf we manage to reach $14,000, I will perform a live stream of the entire album during which I'll chat with viewers and answer questions. I'll also be doing an encore featuring my last album \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\" in honor of returning backers! Everyone will be invited and welcome to share it with their friends - and for anyone unable to attend the live stream, the video of these  performances will be available on the Doctor Octoroc YouTube channel afterwards so no one misses out on the  experience. The date and time for this is TBD and will be announced shortly after the campaign ends but it will most likely be sometime in mid-to-late April after I've put in the orders for everything.\n$15,000 gets all backers at $45 or more a 4-in-1 sticker strip designed after the Gameboy Printer paper feed. These additional images of the band that inspired \"Soft Bits In\" look like they came fresh off the GBP press and can be cut down to smaller, individual stickers or left intact to resemble the paper strips torn from the thermal paper roll!\n$16,000 in funding gets Special Edition Vinyl Press backers a sleek obi strip! Many collectors love these extras that are common to releases in Japan.\nAt $18,000, all Special Edition Vinyl Press albums will include a lenticular cover art insert with an interlaced image that animates an exploding Gameboy when you tilt it up and down! I haven't cemented the design quite yet but I will be working with the company producing these to come up with the best sequence of images to take full advantage of this unique technology and this is more or less how I want the final effect to look in action.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter campaign has potential risks and many challenges but I've taken every precaution to ensure that whatever funding is raised will be more than sufficient to cover all costs of production and that I am well prepared to take on the challenges of fulfillment. As of now, the tracks are all completed, recorded, mastered and backed up on multiple devices. In addition, all artwork for printing the album packaging, posters, art prints, etc has been finished, formatted and ready for submission to the printers.

I've already arranged for the art I have in mind and I cannot wait to share it with you! \n ACHIEVED! At $2000, all backers at the $5 and up level will receive a second zine! That's right, these backers will receive The Hollow Planet: An RPG & Philosophy Zine, by Eugene Marshall! Eugene is a professor of philosophy by day, after all, so this is in his wheelhouse. The Hollow Planet is a 32 page black and white, pdf-only zine featuring classic 19th Century illustrations both wondrous and strange, as well as three essays of philosophically tinged reflections on the gaming social contract, the game experience, and rules debates in games.\n ACHIEVED! At $2500, the zine will include an adventure that highlights the themes of Ancestry and Culture. All this should double our humble zine from 32 pages up to approximately 64 pages!\n ACHIEVED! At $3000, the zine will include ten custom portraits, each depicting a character made possible by these rules. I'm especially excited for this, because these portraits are so so cool!\n ACHIEVED! At $4000, all backers at $5 and up will receive a second, pdf-only adventure, using the rules and themes of the zine! \n ACHIEVED! At $5000, all backers at $40 and up receive double rewards. That means they will receive not one, but TWO custom ancestries and cultures designed just for them! And those heroes who back at the $100 level will also receive not one, but two Roll20 sessions for them and their friends! That's about eight hours of entertainment for five people, coming to $2.50 per hour, per person -- and that's not counting all the lower rewards on top of that. \nAt $7000, I will create a dozen new fantasy ancestries and cultures! Each new ancestry and culture will be based on a mythological creature that you will want to play! We're still working on ideas, but right now we are considering bird folk, giantkin, goblins, lizard folk, cat folk, snake folk, shapeshifters, constructs, minotaurs, centaurs, satyrs, medusae, rat folk, mer folk, dryads, dhampir, werefolk, and more! Once we've created them, we'll release it to backers as a separate PDF released to all backers at the $5 and up level.\n Have you ever wondered why there are half-elves and half-orcs in your favorite fantasy roleplaying game, but not half-tieflings, half-dwarves, or half-gnomes? And why only allow orcs and elves to mate with humans and not others? Why can't we play the child of an elf and an orc or a gnome and a halfling? \nWhat's more, what if we want to play a human raised by elves, like Tolkien's Aragorn, or a halfling who grew up among orcs? Wouldn't such characters be different than a halfling who grew up among her own people, for example? It would be a delight to be able play such a diverse cast of characters, with such a wide range of ancestries and cultures. \nWell, now we can! This 32-page zine of rules and original fantasy art allows for the easy creation of a variety of new ancestral and cultural combinations and types, without having to make big changes to the core game rules. What's more, they replace the problematic concept of race as it is traditionally used in character creation. Ancestry provides those heritable traits a character might receive from their parents, such as height, average lifespan, and darkvision, and culture provides such teachable features as weapon training and ability. This frees us up to play the characters we want to play and provides us many more options, just dripping with role-play potential.\nIn addition to the new character creation rules, Ancestry and Culture also features original art by Talon Dunning and layout and art direction by Aaron Acevedo. Talon's art has featured in such games and properties as Legend of the Five Rings, Mage: The Awakening, Mummy: The Resurrection, Scarred Lands, Ravenloft, Kingdoms of Kalamar, Thieves' World, and Mutants & Masterminds, among others. Aaron's layout and art direction work can be found in almost every Savage Worlds product, including Savage Rifts and Deadlands, as well as in TORG, Unknown Armies, World of Darkness, The Yellow Sign, and more. \nHumans and their adopted orc brother\n Why replace the rules for Race in character creation for the world\u2019s most popular tabletop roleplaying game, you might ask? First of all, because it makes even greater characters, more interesting story, and richer role-play possible. Think of the possibilities of playing an orc-elf, or a gnome raised among dwarves, for example. And imagine what diverse communities might be like, where dwarven and elven culture, art, architecture mingle! What would their buildings look like? Their weapons? In short, we want to replace race with ancestry and culture because replacing it is easy and makes for more fun!\nBeyond that, there is a more serious reason to replace the concept of race in your games with ancestry and culture: simply put, because the very concept of Race in this game we love is problematic.\nFirst of all, the concept of race used in roleplaying games comes from the analogous concept used in the real world. Biologists, evolutionary theorists, anthropologists, and race theorists have long since shown that the concept as it was used at least from the Enlightenment forward to the 20th Century is, frankly, bogus. This is not to say there is no such thing as ancestry, heritage, and genetic difference, of course. But those differences simply do not map cleanly onto anything in our biology as simplistic as the concept of race, as it is often used. After all, none but the most flagrant racist in the real world nowadays would say that one\u2019s ethnic ancestry, or race, causes a person to have a lower intelligence or gives them a tendency toward extreme violence or evil, yet our fantasy games employ exactly this concept of race. In other words, race itself is a tainted concept, but the way it is employed in fantasy gaming is an exceptionally bad example. Thus I would prefer not to use it, if I can.\nA tiefling-gnome prepares for battle\nFortunately, it is not difficult to replace Race in character creation in our favorite roleplaying game. As I show in this zine, we can acknowledge that gnomes and elves and humans and dwarves might in general have certain biological markers that distinguish them, such as height and lifespan and darkvision, without also ascribing intelligence or weapon mastery or good and evil to their biology. Obviously, those features are more a result of upbringing than genetics. Why not therefore separate out biological ancestry from cultural heritage? That is exactly what I have done here!\nSome advantages of this are as follows: this separates the value-laden concepts of ability bonuses and alignment from biology; it locates skills, weapon proficiencies, languages, and other behavioral differences where they belong, in one\u2019s upbringing; and these rules do so in a way that leaves the rest of the game mechanics largely intact. Indeed, one should be able to swap out the Race options from character creation for these rules without much change elsewhere at all, though it may change the way the fantasy world is depicted (hopefully for the better). Further, using these rules also allows for a lot of fun new roleplaying opportunities, as you can now have mechanics to account for someone of one ancestry growing up among different cultures, such as a human raised by elves or a gnome raised among dwarves.\nAnd as we suggested, these rules even include ways to create characters of mixed ancestry and unique upbringing. In the original rules, one could create only half-elves and half-orcs (themselves problematic and human-centric \u2013 why not call them half-humans? And why only those two combinations?). With these rules, one can create characters with one human and one elf parent, to be sure, but also human-halfling, dwarf-elf, orc-tiefling, or gnome-dragonborn offspring if you like. Surely a fantasy world with magic and dragons, and one that already contains offspring of humans and elves and orcs, has room for halfling-dwarf children as well!  \nAn elf-tiefling\nHi!

I hope to have these images by the beginning of March, in plenty of time to deliver the final product by April or May. I will also complete the Print-On-Demand version before May, with an absolute deadline for everything of June. I expect the final product to be approximately 32 pages.

Before the expedition leaves, a stranger gives a notebook to the director of the cruise Howard Pym \u2013 who is a professor at the University of Miskatonic \u2013 asking him to read it before they reach Antarctica. Preoccupied with the voyage ahead, he forgets about it.\n\n\nAdam Fyna, writer and artist says:\n\"Vast, empty spaces always worked on my imagination, so this is the most picturesque of his books for me. Reading this story, I saw pictures: there were huge snow-covered mountains and a small plane, lost in this space. And everything was colorful: drowned in blue reflections of the sky and violets and oranges falling from the low hanging sun. As in Nicholas Roerich's Himalayan paintings.\"\nHow did you approach the project?\n\"From the beginning I wanted the comic book to be full of colors, even if a large part of the story takes place in the underground corridors. I wanted to show this Lovecraft's story in a different way than we usually expect - not as dark images full of terrifying monsters, but more as a story about the lost in a beautiful but alien world. The challenge was to show the era of that time, all the details - like ordinary torches or clothes used during the expeditions to Antarctica, not to mention ships or planes. So I started working on the comic book by collecting a lot of documentation and it took me some time.\"\nWhy build on the story, instead of a simply adapting it?\n\"First, building on the story wasn't my first intention. Yet reading the book and thinking about its adaptation, I had ideas in my head for other scenes as well. Such as the mysterious character observing the departure of the expeditionary ships or finding the diary, for example.\nSecond, I was interested in the climate of horror and the characters\u2019 search for what are the discovered remains, what are they hiding inside? So I decided to change the whole story a little bit. I thought it might be more dramatic and mysterious to tell the tale of the second expedition, where the crew gradually discovers the terrible story of the previous expedition until they have no way back.\nThirdly, there are already 2 adaptations of this story, but they are very literal.\"\nAt Blue Fox, we don't want you to our word for how great the book is - we give you a free sample so you can whet your appetite!\nTo read the sample, click the button below!\nNo, you're going to love it!\nIn fact, anyone who loves good stories, great art, action, adventure and the Lovecraft mythos will love this book!\nIt's 80 pages of the best madness money can buy... \nWe're running this Kickstarter campaign to help raise the funds for the printing of Mountains of Madness.

Take control of the robot Trophy in this exciting new homebrew game. Save the peaceful planet of Gearus 9 from the evil machinations of Lord Q as you run, jump, and blast your way to victory. Collect power-ups along the way and defeat some of the largest bosses ever seen on the NES!\nThe earliest imaginings of what would become Trophy lie in the mind of a twelve year old Derek Andrews, and more than twenty years later the world can finally see the results. The retro scene is filled with examples of faux 8-bit games (many of them quite excellent!), but Trophy was developed for the NES, a true 8-bit tour de force. As with all of Gradual Games\u2019 NES projects, it was programmed from the ground up in 6502 assembly language, along with using custom tools developed by Andrews for the project. With over ten years of programming experience for the NES, Trophy blazes new territory in the homebrew scene, pushing the technological limits of the NES in ways not seen since the heyday of the licensed era! This process took over three years, and is a true labor of retro love that shines forth in all aspects of the game.\nTrophy is 100% finished and is being published by The 6502 Collective in both physical and digital form.\n\nOn the far fringes of space a peaceful planet of robots is discovered by two spacefaring computer scientists, Jared Sword and Xella Quine. They befriend the inhabitants of the planet Gearus 9, and after a time Sword returns to Earth to reveal their findings. He takes with him the robot Beeper as proof of their discovery, and the mutual understanding between human and robot culture blossoms.\nMeanwhile, back on Gearus 9, an isolated Quine slips gently into madness, dominating the peaceful robots, and proclaiming himself Lord Q! Incapable of violence, the robots are easy prey for his schemes and hidden desires of conquest.\nAhahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nWhen Sword and Beeper finally return to the planet, they are confronted by what Quine has become. Sword, being of frail nature, and Beeper, being unable to commit acts of violence, realize what they must do. Using the technology found on Gearus 9 they fuse into one being, part human and part machine. TROPHY is born!\n\nAs Trophy, you must navigate challenging environmental obstacles and terrain, such as water, snow, moving platforms, and even zero gravity. Collect power-ups and upgrade Trophy's health and weapon systems, all while battling enemies throughout the levels. Be prepared, though, as at the end of each level you will have to square off against one of the largest bosses ever seen on the NES!\nFeatures:\nNine levels of intense, platforming action\nDiverse environments and terrain\nLarge, fully-scrolling levels\nHidden areas and power-ups\nCut-scene narrative segments\nPassword system\nNine GIANT bosses\nEver wonder why games made at different periods of the NES' lifespan look different? It wasn't just that developers were learning to work with the system and improving their craft, there were also some additional things going on under the hood. Games made for the NES during the licensed era came on a variety of circuit boards, running many different flavors of hardware. These \"mappers\" greatly expanded the inherent capabilities of the console, and allowed many of the classic games that we know and love to exist as we know them. More data storage, advanced scrolling, scan line counters, and more were all possible due to this technology.\nAlthough it was the most popular mapper during the life cycle of the NES, the MMC3 mapper has rarely been used in homebrew projects. Beyond its prohibitive cost, many of the features that it provides have not been needed. Trophy, however, uses the MMC3 to its fullest, delivering huge bosses, sophisticated parallax scrolling,  and complex character animations.\nThe magic of the parallax scroll\nUnderstandably, the added hardware of the MMC3 raises the cost of materials, and that is a key reason why we are seeking funding through Kickstarter for Trophy. Circuit boards are made by the wonderful folks at Infinite NES Lives, and manufactured in the U.S.A.\n\nThe main goal of this campaign is to release Trophy in physical format for the NES, in both a Regular Edition and a Limited Edition. Both editions include a cart, box, manual, dust sleeve, and even foam block (just like back in the day!). Additionally, the LE includes a numbered title screen, hand drawn artwork, translucent white cartridge, a signed and numbered letter from Derek Andrews, a blueprint-like poster of the hero, and a 6502 Collective sticker. 85 out of 100 Limited Edition copies will be available during the campaign, with the remainder going to those involved in the project. All 6502 Collective games are made using brand-new parts, so no need to blow into the cart this time around!\nWe are also happy to offer digital options for those who wish to experience the game on a modern device.\nTrophy is the third release by Gradual Games, with their first being Nomolos: Storming the Catsle (2009) and their second being The Legends of Owlia (2015). Programming and music were done by Derek Andrews, and in-game art was drawn by Laurie Andrews.\nTrophy is being published by The 6502 Collective, a joint venture between Sole Goose Productions and Retrotainment Games, whose goal is to help #8BitLegit developers get back to doing what they do best: making games! Your pledge and support directly help us keep physical media alive and well in our increasingly digital-only age.\nOur \"community-comes-first\" vision doesn't stop with programming, and we are happy to work with members of the homebrew community new and old. As mentioned, the MMC3 circuit boards for Trophy are manufactured by Infinite NES Lives, an innovator in the aftermarket retro scene for nearly a decade. LE packaging art is being hand drawn by Jon Piornack, famous for his box and in-game art for the 2019 homebrew hit NEScape! (KHAN Games).\nHand drawn art, just like back in the day\nWhile we like to keep things short and to the point, the Trophy campaign will run a bit longer than normal due to being shown at local events around the USA. It will premiere at PAX East in Boston, which runs from February 27th to March 1st. The campaign will end the last day of MGC, the Midwest Gaming Classic, on April 5th. The 6502 Collective will be sharing a booth with Retrotainment Games at both events, so please stop by and see the finished game in action!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTrophy is 100% finished in terms of programming and packaging art, and has undergone rigorous testing by a crack team of fellow homebrew developers and enthusiasts. Physical production, however, carries with it a different set of challenges of a financial nature. Although the 6502 Collective has an established record of releasing projects, and has an established pipeline for sourcing materials, gauging production numbers is never a sure thing. By seeking funding through Kickstarter, we are able to realistically estimate the quantities needed to ensure that production goes smoothly and occurs in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Version", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the game for Steam or in ROM form for play in an emulator.\nINCLUDES:\nNES ROM or Steam Key", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["232 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Cartridge-Only Regular Edition", "descp": "A cartridge-only copy of the game.\nINCLUDES:\nTranslucent Blue Cartridge\nNES ROM or Steam Key", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "CIB Regular Edition", "descp": "A complete in box (CIB) copy of the game.\nINCLUDES:\nTranslucent Blue Cartridge\nStandard box and label\nManual\nDust sleeve\nFoam Block\nNES ROM or Steam Key", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["360 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Limited Edition", "descp": "A limited edition copy of the game.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited to 100 copies\nTranslucent White Cartridge\nHand Illustrated Box and Label Art by Jon Piornack\nManual\nDust sleeve\nFoam Block\nBlueprint Poster\nNumbered Title Screen\nSigned Letter from the Dev\n6502 Collective Sticker\nNES ROM or Steam Key", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "85 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "The Anguna: Scourge of the Goblin King Campaign Ends Tonight!", "update_content": "While we should have some exciting news concerning Trophy soon (no hints yet, sorry), in the meantime this is friendly reminder that The 6502 Collective's campaign for Anguna: Scourge of the Goblin King ends tonight!

The guides are written 'in-world' as if they are travel guides given to adventurers at information kiosks when they travel to a new land.\nClose-up from the map of the Kingdom of Astivel\nFor people running a campaign, the guides provide inspiration for adventures and a great physical prop for players. The guides provide enough detail to inspire story-tellers, but are mysterious enough to be spoiler free for the party. \nFor players, they provide a high-level overview of each kingdom in Ollustria. The guides tease at potential mysteries, hint at great adventures and let the players see where they are in the world.\nThe maps are hand-drawn, hand-lettered and painted with water colors for a classical medieval fantasy look and feel. \nThe first guide: The Kingdom of Astivel is complete and ready to be printed and the other two guides will be finished if the Kickstarter campaign is successful.\nThe two additional Field Guides will feature:\n The Frozen Haunted Wastes of Everil \n The Mystical Tropical Islands of Khan Zaar \n The Ollustria Field Guides are part of Kickstarter's  #ZineQuest2 initiative.\n\nEach Field Guide features:\n11\" x 17\" fold out map\nLore and Legends\nPlaces and people of note\nSongs, poems and other cultural insights\nColorful Risograph printing\nThe World of Ollustria is a medieval fantasy setting which combines elements of high-fantasy and classical fairy tales. It is a land where ghosts haunt the frozen lands of the north, unspeakable horrors roam The Forbidden Lands and the mountains and forests of the Kingdom of Astivel promise treasures untold. \n\nClose-up from the map of the Kingdom of Astivel\nRisograph printers are situated somewhere between screen-printing and laser printing. Individual colors are laid onto the paper through a screened overlay at varying opacity.  This gives each Risograph print a unique texture and the potential for unique color combinations when combined with colored paper. All of the zines will be printed at a local Vancouver-base printer who specializes in zines and indie projects.\nThree Ollustria Field Guide PDF's\nIncludes a downloadable PDF of each Field Guide: The Kingdom of Astivel, The Haunted Wastes of Everil  and The Tropical Islands of Khan Zaar.  The PDFs will be provided in two formats, one set up for printing and folding and another laid out for reading digitally.\nThree Ollustria Field Guide Printed Zines\nYou get a printed and folded copy of each Field Guide zine: The Kingdom of Astivel, The Haunted Wastes of Everil  and The Tropical Islands of Khan Zaar. The guides are Risograph printed and each guide will be printed in a different paper/ink color combination. Each guide unfolds into a ~11\"x17\" map.\n\nField Guides unfold into a 11\" x 17\" map\nUnfolded Risograph prints of each map\nReceive a 11\"x17\" Risograph print of each map. These are printed on one side and are unfolded so that they are suitable for display, or if you would like to give players a map without the world information (and perhaps roll it up into a scroll). These will be shipped in mailing tubes.\nAn extra unfolded map of each kingdom for display or handing out to players\nAll Digital and Physical Stretch Goals\nIf the campaign is successful, we have many ideas for how to extend the world of Ollustria. Everyone who backs at the Digital Tier will receive all non-physical stretch goal rewards and everyone who backs at any zine tier will receive any additional physical stretch goal rewards that are made.\nThe Generous Dungeon Master\nFor the story-teller who loves to give their players physical props (or for the party that has problems sharing). This includes three complete sets of each printed Field Guide zine as well as a set of unfolded maps.\nName a landmark\nYou can name a landmark in the world on one of the maps. Perhaps you want to name a city after yourself, or name a forest after a player's favorite character who died tragically in a previous campaign. It's up to you. All name submissions are subject to approval and we ask that you keep it all-ages and on-theme. If you're worried about approval, please get in touch.\nOriginal water colored map art\nYou will receive the original ink and water color art used for the map. These are done on professional quality water color paper with professional Qor brand water colors. Each map will be painted in a different color. All materials used are lightfast and archival quality.  This reward will be shipped in a flat box and shipping is limited to US and Canada. The map of Astivel is complete, but the other maps still need to be made. Buying original art, sight-unseen, is truly adventurous.\nOriginal water color map detail\n\nGoal #1: Water Color Covers - ACHIEVED!\nIf we reach $2000 in funding, each Field Guide will get an original hand-illustrated water color cover by Cassandra. The illustration will feature a landmark from that land and will help give the guides a more traditional, hand-made look and feel. \nGoal #2: A Fourth Field Guide -The Forbidden Lands\nIf we raise $4000, we will create a whole new guide to cover The Mysterious Forbidden Lands, bringing the total number of guides for four.\nThe Forbidden Lands Field Guide will be included in all tiers that receive awards. The Digital Package tier will receive the PDFs and all other tiers will receive the additional physical Field Guide and map for their tier.\nAbout The Forbidden Lands:\nThe terrors of The Forbidden Lands have plagued Astivel for centuries. Raiding parties and roaming monsters are held at bay by the brave soldiers and wizards of Stonehold Keep. The ruins of Stillwater are a constant reminder for the kingdom to stay vigilant as the once-great city was lost in a single night to the monstrosities of The Forbidden Lands.\nThe Ollustria Field Guides are made by a father/daughter team to help bring Cassandra's imaginative worlds to life.\nCassandra Neville is a 12 year old cartographer, artist and Dungeon Master. She has a deep passion for fantastic worlds and map making. Cassandra is illustrating the maps and building the lore of Ollustria. This is her first published project.\nShane Neville is a 20+ year game industry veteran (Company of Heroes, Need for Speed, Shellrazer and Bunker Punks) who loves all aspects of making games, physical and digital. Shane made his first zine in the late 80's and been collecting and making zines ever since. Shane is responsible for production, map lettering and additional art for The Ollustria Field Guides. He is also Cassandra's dad.\nWhen we first heard about Zine Quest 2, we thought it would be a great opportunity to make something fun together and put it out into the world. \nIf the Kickstarter is successful, it'll cover printing costs for the Field Guides as well as cover the cost for creating the guides. Proceeds from the project will go towards Cassandra's education; both on-going arts education as well as saving for post-secondary. \nVideo background music credits:\nA Room And A Fire by A Shell in the Pit\nListen on Spotify", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a few low-risk challenges we expect through production:\n- The map-making process is time consuming and if an accident (ie: spilling ink on the map) occurs late in the process of map-making, days or weeks of work can be lost. We've given ourselves lots of time in our schedule so that we can absorb a few mishaps.\n- Risograph printing can be a bit haphazard and the printers can eat up paper. We'll order paper with this in mind, but it's possible that the printers will chew through our paper supply and we'll need to order more, which can create a small delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Support", "descp": "Support the project and follow along with the campaign and project.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 7 or more", "title": "Digital Package", "descp": "PDFs of each map with both printable layout and readable layout.\nINCLUDES:\nThree Ollustria Field Guide PDFs\nAll digital stretch goal rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["17 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 15 or more", "title": "Zine & Digital", "descp": "The full collection of guides and all digital rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nThree Ollustria Field Guide PDFs\nThree Ollustria Field Guide printed zines\nAll digital and physical stretch goal rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 25 or more", "title": "Cartographer", "descp": "An additional print of each map, unfolded and ready for display.\nINCLUDES:\nThree Ollustria Field Guide PDFs\nThree Ollustria Field Guide printed zines\nUnfolded Risograph prints of each map\nAll digital and physical stretch goal rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 50 or more", "title": "The Generous Dungeon Master", "descp": "Three full sets of The Ollustria Field Guides, plus a set of unfolded maps.\nINCLUDES:\nThree Ollustria Field Guide PDFs\nUnfolded Risograph prints of each map\n3\u00d7 Three Ollustria Field Guide printed zines\nAll digital and physical stretch goal rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 60 or more", "title": "Name in the World", "descp": "Have a landmark on a map named after you or a loved one.

The game system is based on \u201cPlayer 1 versus Player 1 versus Player 1\u201d. Imagine that you play a chess game in which three players can play, but you are playing alone against yourself. \nThe game system will allow you to see how you play and, therefore, to understand how you see the world.\n\n The Tribute! \nFirst, I am creating this game to pay a tribute to two great authors. As you may know, they contributed to Star Wars, Dune and Alien. Also Moebius has inspired the scenery of Blade Runner and Jodorowsky wrote \u201cThe Cage\u201d for the Marceau mime artist and there, I don\u2019t know what could have been more beautiful!\nSecond movie clip of my encounter with Mr. Jodorowsky\nPLAY\n\nComplete video (15 minutes) for those supporting the project!\n\nThe game universe\n I must say that I was tempted to stop this project a  hundred times, once I have started trying to adapt 3D objects to Moebius\u2019s style. After one month of cold sweat, I think I've reached something. The hard workwas in the light (I haven\u2019t done any of the textures in the game, everything is from Moebius).  \n The game will have 3 different artistic directions \n  Black and white\n  Watercolour \n   Flat tints \nI\u2019m not going to use the saturated shading rendering because it\u2019s already used in too many games. Right now, I am wondering if I should give the player the possibility to change the art direction as he/she plays, whenever he/she wants. I think we will decide together if this possibility should be given! \nThe game play\nThe \u201cfunniest\u201dpart of the game, is quite frankly, flying like an eagle or weave in and out as a cat, in a scenery designed by Moebius. It\u2019s the crazy part of this experience. But I have a few doubts there. Should we make it easier to play for users without a great dexterity? I think we should find the right compromise together.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n The game system\n Right now, I have a game system which works correctly !\nThe game system is based on \u201cPlayer 1 versus Player 1 versus Player 1\u201d. Imagine that you play a chess game in which three players can play, but you are playing alone against yourself. You will play turn by turn the cat,  play turn by turn the cat, the eagle and the child (With the help of the child you will need to catch the cat). As soon as you get out of character, he will continue to play according to the same mode (for example: stealthy, audacious\u2026). The goal of this system is to make you play against yourself! The game system will allow you to see how you play and, therefore, to understand how you see the world.\nThe game length will depend on your curiosity, but I think it should last around one hour.\nGOALS\n8,000 euros : you move around small areas of the town (reflecting the original graphics) with the characters of the game.\n15,000 euros : you move around the town (imagine you are surrounded with 3D versions of Moebius' graphics) as the cat or the eagle.\n25,000 euros : the game system is effective (P1 vs P1 vs P1), so the game can start!\n35,000 euros : implementation of game elements : The cat has to eat, sleep, avoid the rain... The cat must solve puzzles to find a path (waiting for the sun to      light a path in the darkness, jumping on objects that are unstable due to      gusts of wind...)\n45 000 euros : VR version (oculus, vive...)      \n\n  Game engine \nRight now, the game is only designed for PC. The minimal setup necessary on PC to run the game is: 4go Ram \u2013I7 - gtx 560 or gtx 1050\nThe funding?\nTo be clear, nearly all of the budget I am trying to obtain will be used into creating 3D objects for the scenery, so most of this budget will be given to artists!\n Yes, you may find my funding request quite low, but my goal here is to pay a tribute instead of making money. I think, sometimes, we need to do things just to say thanks.\nYou should know that I have bought the rights to adapt the comic book as a game, but you can\u2019t ask me how much I have spent on this.

Crusaders, charge!\n\n       As you may know, we at Owlcat Games have spent countless hours playing the Pathfinder tabletop RPG. We enjoyed it so much that we decided to bring this experience to the videogame format by creating a classic isometric party-based computer RPG called Pathfinder: Kingmaker. The phenomenal love and support shown for Kingmaker have inspired us to tell another story from the Age of Lost Omens. Today we are thrilled to introduce the adventure we are so passionate and excited about \u2013 Wrath of the Righteous!\nEmbark on a journey to a realm overrun by demons and rise to power by choosing one of six available Mythic Paths. Master their abilities and change the world around you as an Angel, a Lich, a Trickster, an Aeon, a Demon, or an Azata. Each Mythic Path leads to unique skills and appearance, and greatly impacts the game\u2019s story.\nChallenge the mighty Demon Lords and close the portal to the demonic plane of existence known as the Abyss.  \n    Enjoy the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder first edition ruleset. Create any character imaginable by choosing one of ten races, picking a particular class out of the 21 available, each with five archetypes for even greater customization. Gain access to more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities, and select those that suit your playstyle. Take control of your party formation, help set up a camp, and find a way to victory by combining the strengths of your companions.\nLead the armies of the Fifth Crusade to victory in a new strategic layer of gameplay. In addition to the classic CRPG experience, step into the role of the Commander, gather troops, reinforce your stronghold, and send your armies to battle the demonic invasion across the map of the region. Send your crusaders to explore ancient ruins and recover powerful artifacts.\nExperience a non-linear story about the cost of tremendous power that adventurers often seek, with tales of corruption caused by the demonic influence and redemption for those who have stepped on the wrong path.\n  Meet a new diverse cast of characters, including ten companions to recruit to your party and featuring multiple romance options to choose from.\nTake control of five new classes (Arcanist, Bloodrager, Shaman, Oracle, and Witch) and meet a new race\u2013the half-undead dhampir\u2013in addition to the previous roster from Pathfinder: Kingmaker. The number of archetypes per class has increased to five as well.\nDive into the game even if you\u2019re not familiar with the intricacies of the Pathfinder ruleset. Use an enhanced tutorial for newcomers to help you with character creation and get up to speed with the rules of the system.\nExplore the world with updated visuals and a 360-degree rotating camera added for better playability and immersion.\n Current platforms: PC Windows (Steam, GOG)\n Current languages: English, French, German, Chinese, Russian, Spanish (funded by reaching a stretch goal)\nMore platforms and languages may be added in the future.  \nWe want our new game to give you the same feeling as good old Pathfinder: Kingmaker Enhanced Edition. If you enjoyed Kingmaker, you will definitely love Wrath of the Righteous as well. \n        While we have enough budget to bring the concept of Wrath of the Righteous to life, we want this game to provide a truly epic experience. The game is built around the idea of a rise to power via one of six different Mythic Paths, each of which will transform the player\u2019s character into a powerful being with special abilities. They will also significantly affect the story branches, change the world around the character, and impact the player\u2019s relationships with companions and NPCs. This idea can be stretched a lot further than our current budget allows.\nIn order to execute our creative vision in the way it deserves, we need your help. This additional budget will allow the team to develop more complex reactions to progressing on a certain path and expand each Mythic Path into a truly unique experience, with exclusive story branches and character abilities that influence the world around you.\nOur Goal of $300,000 will allow us to make Wrath of the Righteous a game of the scale and quality we\u2019ve been dreaming of. \n     We have also come up with some nice extra perks for hitting our Social Goals. These will be made available to all players if unlocked.

All other goals (follower and backer counters) are for the total overall number.\n         The realm of Sarkoris was destroyed when Areelu Vorlesh, a scholar and practitioner of forbidden magics, opened a rift to the abyssal planes of existence, and hordes of demons invaded Golarion. Led by the evil Demon Lords Deskari and Baphomet, the abyssal forces crushed all who stood against them, turning Sarkoris into a demon-infested land now known as the Worldwound. It fell to the neighboring nations to assemble an army capable of withstanding the demonic assault to protect the world from the flames. Thus the Crusades began.\n    The war has been raging for over a hundred years now with little hope of victory. The enemy forces are numerous and their rage is unmatched. Defeat would be certain if not for the Wardstones\u2014the obelisks of divine power placed along the borders of the Worldwound to hold back the invasion. Created under the guidance of Iomedae's herald, they form a protective barrier that prevents the demons from pushing through.\nIt is no wonder that the Wardstones were the demon armies\u2019 first target. Those villainous forces launched a surprise attack on the frontier city of Kenabres, ripping apart its defenses in mere minutes, corrupting the Wardstone housed there, and scattering the crusaders. In the utter chaos of the burning city, one of the crusaders\u2014to their own amazement\u2014discovers a source of power within themselves. While the origin of the power remains unknown, and the form it takes depends on the person, the purpose is clear: this power may be just what the people of the ravaged city need to survive the assault\u2014and to bring the fight to the enemy.\n       The game tells the story of the monumental conflict between mortals and demons, making you a part of a truly epic adventure. You will confront a variety of demonic adversaries, from lowly dretches to the dreadful Demon Lords themselves. To defeat them, your character will be able to claim mythic power and develop it by choosing mythic spells and abilities according to your tactical preferences and character alignment. The choices you make during your adventure will set you on one of six Mythic Paths, opening the ways to becoming a celestial Angel, a ravaging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, a lawful Aeon, or a rebellious Azata.\n     Mythic Paths are the main feature of Wrath of the Righteous. Mythic character progression was originally introduced by Paizo specifically for this Adventure Path, but our take on it differs from the tabletop version and is adapted to better fit the CRPG both mechanically and narratively. Each path will follow a specific theme, has a profound impact on the main story of the adventure, grants powerful unique abilities, and affects the character\u2019s appearance. You will be able to become one of the following beings:\nThe Angel is a mighty champion of good, leading the Crusade by example. They move across the battlefield on their mighty wings, smiting the demons with a sword of holy flame. Those who are fighting alongside the Angel are certain that they will be protected and healed\u2014and even resurrected in the case of their untimely demise. In times of dire need the Angel can ask Heaven for help and celestial allies will join them in battle.\nThe Lich is an immortal creature, commanding their own army of undead. Even the mightiest adversaries the Lich defeats can be raised as slaves under the Lich\u2019s command. Eventually, this master of undeath and necromancy can even replace their mortal companions with powerful undead minions they create. They master the art of magic\u2014especially necromancy\u2014and wield an armament of unique and especially powerful spells like death realm.\n The Aeon is a cosmic judge of balance\u2014Judge Dredd meets Merlin on a cosmic scale. They can sense where the balance is broken and fix it, often punishing the perpetrator in the process. The cool thing about the Aeon is that they can detect places where the balance was greatly disturbed in the past and travel back in time to fix it. In doing so, they can change their current timeline, usually for the better.\nThe Trickster is a Loki-type character. They are here to have fun and play jokes on even the mightiest creatures. One of their late-game abilities is an understanding that their fate is determined by random chance, like the roll of a die of destiny. Armed with such knowledge, the Trickster can manipulate those die rolls in their favor. Every time the system rolls a natural 1 for them, the Trickster changes it into a natural 20. And players will be able to see it happening before their eyes.\nImpulsive and irrepressible, Demons do as they please with no regard for the opinion of others. The Demon is the epitome of rage; a little push is all that is needed to break their self-control and turn them into a force to be feared\u2014by enemies and friends alike. It is up to the Demon to decide whether to allow the inner beast to take control, or to fight it, chain it, force it into obedience.\nWhen a war has been raging for over a hundred years such as the crusades have, one must be ready to make unexpected moves to achieve victory. Some may claim that Azatas act first and think later, but tell that to the demon hordes, trampled and fleeing in terror from this unstoppable force for good. The Azata trust their instincts and makes spontaneous decisions. They easily befriend those who don't fit well into even rows of the \"official\" crusade, and inspire their allies to fight rather than command them to do so. That makes Azatas the heroes these demon-ravaged lands so dearly need.\nYou also have the option to decline all celestial powers and walk the path of the Legend\u2014\u0430 human capable of great deeds. The acts of a mortal are sometimes more inspiring than those of any deity. Several gods of Golarion were humans before they ascended to godhood, including the crusade\u2019s patron deity, Iomedae. One need not be a mythic creature, an outsider, or one of the goddesses's chosen to become a hero. This path may be a hard one, full of temptation, but the mortal who treads it rightly earns their title: Mythic Legend. \n        We want you to feel the scale of the conflict in Wrath of the Righteous with the Crusade system\u2014a new strategic layer of gameplay built specifically for this adventure.\nAt a certain point in the game, you will take charge of the Fifth Crusade. As Commander, you will not only be adventuring with your party, but also building your forces, dealing with major challenges, and making critical decisions about the course of the Crusade. You will also be able to recruit an army, send your troops to fight the demonic hordes across the world map, and reclaim the conquered land. On the sites of ancient battles you will be able to discover legendary artifacts, lost in previous crusades, some of them already corrupted. In an ancient forge, they could be redeemed to become powerful items for your character and party members. \n       While building this system we worked hard to ensure that it was not only interesting and fitting for the adventure, but also accessible and understandable to any players. We\u2019ve listened closely to player feedback on the Kingdom Management system in Pathfinder: Kingmaker and acted on that to deliver a system that will be more integrated into the whole experience. We aim to make the consequences of your choices more clear and provide a wide range of tools to deal with any kind of a situation that could arise while leading the Crusade.\nYou will launch your Crusade by setting up an army camp in the Worldwound and making it a fortified headquarters that you can develop further. Each enhancement you make will be vital in the war to come. You will expand the roster of troops available for hire and improve the strength of your existing units. Another thing that will greatly influence your Crusade is your chosen Mythic Path. Depending on your actions and alignment, some allies might join or leave the Crusade, triggering various outcomes later in the game. Relationships with your companions, who are helping you by being your councilors in the Crusade, will be affected as well.\n      Since the release of Pathfinder: Kingmaker, our passion for the genre has only increased. Our team has expanded and gained more experience, and is led by the same people who brought you the previous game:\n     Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is our second game to be developed in close partnership with Paizo Inc., the creators of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It has been a pleasure working together for all these years and we are excited to bring you yet another incredible adventure. Every take on the story and each piece of artwork goes through the Paizo team, who provide us with lore-based advice on how to approach the events taking place in the Age of Lost Omens. They also work with us to preserve the feel of playing Pathfinder in a tabletop setting and to carefully translate it to a digital format. This means that anyone familiar with the first edition ruleset will have a great time with our game mechanics.\n       Support our game by choosing one of the reward tiers! Pledge more if you want to include any add-ons in your tier. You will be able to pick a specific add-on later in Wrath of the Righteous Pledge Manager, launching right after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\n    Want to add more great items to your reward tier? Just add the cost of a specific add-on to your pledge and wait for the end of the Kickstarter campaign. You will get access to Wrath of the Righteous Pledge Manager, allowing you to manage your pledge, select specific add-ons, and upgrade your tier. \nNote: Digital Add-Ons require the base pledge to be at a digital tier level ($28 and above). Physical Add-Ons need the base pledge to be at a physical tier level ($55 and above) to cover the shipping and handling fee.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe development process of Pathfinder: Kingmaker has equipped us with efficient pipelines and a real understanding of the scope of such a project in terms of both budget and time. We plan to deliver the game in June 2021 and we are fairly confident about this timeline. But since we aim to significantly extend the game\u2019s features and increase the overall scale of the adventure, we might find out that certain parts of the game require more time to be polished. Our desire to provide the best experience to our backers and the results of alpha and beta testing may delay the final release. The good part is that this should also mean the game ends up being bigger and better than currently planned. Some of the features could also be changed as we move ahead with development and gain feedback from the players during the testing period.\n\nWrath of the Righteous is being developed under the supervision of Paizo Inc., the owners of the Pathfinder IP. That means that all the products presented on this Kickstarter page are subject to change in order to meet the expectations of our licensing agreement with Paizo.\nOur experience delivering rewards in the previous campaign taught us a lot. Production took more time and effort than we expected, and we learned some valuable lessons.

Follow along with all our production news and updates at www.moft.us    \nPeople invented various sit-stand desks since many years ago. But these desks didn\u2019t change much more so far. They usually come with a bulky size and limited by the workspace environment. And some with cumbersome setup may let you go crazy.\nTo make people get a flexible posture wherever they are, we realized we\u2019d have to come up with the most convenient sit-stand desk ever.\nMOFT Z is a truly lightweight and versatile sit-stand desk at an affordable price. It\u2019s designed to offer THE HEAVEY LAPTOP USER a maximum comfort with maximum freedom on location.\n\nA Magazine-sized Desk with 4 Positions\nWith the origami-inspired Z structure, MOFT Z provides one mode for standing and three-mode for sitting.  It helps you develop a healthy sit-stand working posture in the easiest way, keeping you active and productive all day.\nWorking From Home with Right Postures\nThe ultra-versatile yet like a paper-thin desk body makes it friendly to any working environment, not only to be used in the office but also at home or co-workspace.  \nWe designed MOFT Z with a continuous one-piece structure. No tool is needed for setup. Stand it up easily when you need it, and unfold it back quickly when you don\u2019t.\nAll foldings finished in one structure\nMost people usually only want to take a short standing, not a giant stand on the desk all day long. As the same size as a magazine, you can store MOFT Z in any corner you like. Keep it \"invisible\" on your desk. So you won\u2019t notice it when you don\u2019t need it.\nIt follows the consistent design philosophy of MOFT: unseen, unfelt, unnoticed. \nCan you find it? Guess where am I\nSmooth & swift transition between postures\nMOFT Z is a fast-blade to open and close. It quickly switches your sit and stand posture and takes the stress off your back in seconds, letting you get a joyful and relaxing posture.\nSitting all day in the office can be stressful to both your body and mind. A quick switch to standing not only helps you stretch a bit for a relaxing back, but also refreshes your mind with a different angle to see your works.\nStanding Mode\nWhen you are standing, MOFT Z offers a natural height for your palms to rest onto the laptop, and your eyes to look at the screen with no strain or tension.\nSitting Mode\nSurely, you would want to sit back after a short break. Does MOFT Z stopped working by then? Absolutely not. We also prepared three modes to fit your own working style while sitting.\nDedicated flap limiter to stop your laptop from sliding.\n\n\n\n\nThe light-weight body foldable design makes MOFT Z the ONLY sit-stand desk that you can use on your laps.\nUsing MOFT Z on the laps\nWe didn't trade thinness for durability. Apart from the rock-steady Z structure and tri-angle bottom support, We used the fibre-glass to ensure the toughness of panels and a maximum of 22-lbs weight.\nSteady typing in the air\nThe magnetic flap to reinforce the frame, and the PU material to shield all the scratches and heat, while keeping everything soft and premium to touch.\nAs thin and light as it is, you can always take MOFT Z away like grabbing a magazine and work anywhere you feel like, in anyway you feel right.\nYou would never see a desk at the size of an iPad Pro. MOFT Z stays perfectly in your backpack. You can have a flexible working setup anywhere you go like never before.\nTo complete a product is not simply fixing the structure, we want you to feel good even if you aren't actually using it. The vast coverage of PU material makes everywhere you touch feels soft and smooth to your hands.\nThe color on the back not only adds an energetic vibe to your desktop, but also works as an indicator of how you act & use the product.\nA reliable structure also needs to fight the test of time, all corners and folding lines were reinforced to make sure you can always keep using it without wearing or tearing.\nMOFT always aim to make products that all people can buy without having to worry about the steep price. A good design should be everyone\u2019s design. \n\n\n\nPLAY\n\n$500K Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nWe would like to share some cool things: MOFT Z has been honored with the Red Dot Award Product Design 2020! And the 500K Stretch Goal was unbelievably reached, which means that the MOFT Z Leather Black is officially unlocked!\n\nWe found three biggest problems that other products have had: They were too big & heavy for such short time standing; They usually took even longer to store than the already tedious installment; They would still be there even if you don\u2019t want to use them again.  \nAnd we got three answers as well: Small & thin enough to help you forget it\u2019s there\uff1b Fast & easy to use just to save time; Disappear when you are done using it.\nBut a desk is much smaller & cramped than a room, which means we must shrink the size of a chair all the way back while keeping the same rigidity & stability.\nWe then chose fibre-glass as the basic structure for its toughness and flexibility\u2014it restores most deformation under 60\u00b0 foldings, much stronger than usual paper structure. It\u2019s a more expensive material, but it\u2019s more durable for the price. \nTo enhance the basic structure support, we also used 11 built-in magnets between joints to make it even stronger, and snappier when you fold it back and forth.\n\nPeople would still sit down after a standing break, that\u2019s why we must keep the triple angles for sitting position, offering much better usability than a usual standing desk.  \nTo wrap things up, we need to make it aesthetically minimalistic so that it looks and feels just like a MOFT product.\n\n\n\n\nMOFT=Mobile Office For Travelers.\nWe are a team dedicated to design & create products to help digital nomads to work better, healthier, more energized and focused.\nIn 2019 we have launched MOFT Stand and MOFT X Series, receiving hundreds of thousands of support from all around the world, and a whopping $3.2million+ sales throughout the year, making them one of the best-selling stands on the market.\nAnd now we are proud to announce that MOFT Stand has won the iF Design Award!\nThis time, we bring MOFT Z sit-stand laptop desk to you. We hope that all our research, work and creativity has produced a product that will make your office working better. Your support is greatly appreciated. \nDistributor/Retail Business\nMOFT welcomes global distributors/retail to join us.

Our planet is invaded by a race from another galaxy, which destroys everything it touches to become thus with absolute power.\nAfter some time, a group of Ploids decides to take action and return the peace. To achieve this, Alpha and Omega must travel through time to eras of ancient land, in order to obtain sacred stones that will give him the necessary power to defeat the invaders. Some of the ancient epochs are feudal Japan, the ice age, the medieval era or among others. What he does not know is that the invaders tried to get those holy stones before him! \u2026 In addition, time threatens to collapse, and only you can connect to the PLOIDS to save the Earth!\nLearn more from our game V.O.I.D. clicking the image below!\nA couple of years after the events of V.O.I.D. the Ploids have formed the patrol that protects time and space to avoid repeating the history of V.O.I.D. With Dr. Elo, also Alpha and Omega Ploids enter a new link in evolution due to time travel turning them into PLOID X, a skill that allows them to have temporary improvements to their systems in order to fight. In order to become Ploid X, Omega must travel to several ruins in search of the sacred disks that contain the necessary information to be able to take the final step and evolve.\nWe introduce you to the main characters in our adventure. Since they have a background from V.O.I.D. and you may not know them, we give you a brief introduction to them:\nOur protagonist in Ploid, in charge of exploring the ruins and obtaining the sacred records. He has a determined attitude, is tenacious and would do anything for his beloved Alpha. In Ploid he has left the laser gun and has focused his energy on the sword of light to defend himself.\nThe inseparable couple of Omega, very cheerful and intelligent. She will be responsible for collecting and analyzing the information managed by Omega through the sacred disks.\n Ploid is full of surprises:\n8 worlds full of exploration and secrets!\nDangerous traps and monsters\n3 different levels of difficulty\nStory mode\nBosses\nEX-Mode\nand more...\nWill you be able to find all the sacred disc files? \nLet's briefly review some of the things that you will get throughout the game and some of the mechanics in PLOID.\nTo start, we have added 2 extra levels of difficulty to the game, EASY MODE for those who want to enjoy the adventure with 9 lives, NORMAL MODE for those who want to enjoy the game with 5 lives and HARD MODE for those who want to enjoy the game with 1 life.\nAdditionally we have added an extra mode called EX-MODE, in this you will have 1 life, no checkpoint between levels and with a completely new and different initial campaign to the main game, we have expanded PLOID adventure!\nAt the beginning you will find a brief tutorial (Yes ... an NES game with tutorial) it will explain the basic movements of the game... These are: walk, go up and down stairs, jump, interact with other characters and use your sword for a certain amount of time to defend against enemies.\nPLOID will have cutscenes to narrate important moments such as the introduction of the game, this will briefly explain the mission that our Ploid Omega will have, which is to look for the sacred disk files in order to be able to take the next step in evolution.\nThe different dungeons of the game will be full of enemies and traps that will seek to end your energy, but you will also have the help of other PLOIDS friends (Many of them based on backers) That will guide you in the journey of the game to find the sacred discs files.\n And there is a lot more to explore! but be aware that you quest will be hard...\nThe 8bit music of Ploid is in charge of David Ko, he has worked with famitracker to achieve that classic chiptune finish of the NES.

The Ark Worlds play and learn presents key game concepts in easy to follow steps. Just download the play and learn packet, print and cut everything out, then follow the video below. Total time is about 30 minutes if you have  a few tokens available.\nDownload Here\n\nCheckout a full game from start to finish. I think the best \"review\" a company can offer is an honest example of game play, so I've produced high quality video in house for you to check out. If you like what you see and like this style of game consider supporting this project or trying it out yourself with the play and learn.    \nThrough the course of the campaign we will be unlocking new heroes and other fun content. Back early and spread the word to get the most out of your pledge. For the completionists out there, any stretch goals we do not make will be offered as an add on expansion.\nFirst I have to say, don't become a founder if it's a financial burden. At the end of the day this is just stuff it's not that important.\nIf you're still listening and you're considering backing at the founder's level, thank you. Backing at the founders level will give me some extra padding while fulfilling this project to deal with the many unforeseen things that happen while running a Kickstarter. And let me tell you, unforeseen things like to happen when running a Kickstarter and they are expensive. Running a small business as a 1 man show is tough so every little bit of support helps.\nThat said, this isn't just you giving me money for no benefit. That would be silly. Founders will be getting free shipping or reduced shipping for the life of my business. Right now that means just free shipping on this project, but the more Unpossible projects you back, the more your investment grows. Additionally I will be updating you all with behind the scenes content, soliciting your advice on future projects, and generally just staying in contact with you all to demonstrate for you all that support is super valuable to me. \nNow let's be realistic. I'm still just one guy in a room in his apartment that he calls his \"office,\" so it won't be a flood of extra content. A deluge of extra content. But I'm hoping it will be just enough to let you guys know that I'll always remember the first people who stood by me on this journey. Thank you.\nI wanted to offer some transparency about how the funds for this project will be used, and how I plan to fulfill on the project. From the start, I wanted to run this project in a way that has a lot of scalability built in. Whether I was fulfilling for 20, 200, or 2000, I wanted to have a plan for any contingency. \nThe reason I structured the project like this is because this type of game carries a lot of inherent risk. Two player, head to head, strategy, card games, about MOBAs are several niches compounded on each other. For me to assume that there would be 500 or 1000 people that wanted to play a game like that seemed risky. Instead, after my last project, I polled how many users wanted to purchase a small print run and got about 40 replies. Based on that, I set my minimum goal assuming that only half of the people that contacted me would follow through, yet hoping for 2 - 3 times that many to come through in the end. Additionally I wanted to experiment with running a sub $30 game, to see what that was like. Here's what the options look like:\nIf we had only 20-ish backers at $24-ish dollars we would have about $500-ish dollars to work with. (Which I knew would be more than $500, because I know at least a few people personally that always support my creative endeavors). But let's just say that we only had $500 for 20 units. With digital printing, units of the game cost about $18 dollars a piece, which is absurdly high for the production cost of a card game, but is still a budget that I am comfortable with. Since shipping is collected in the pledge manager (which I've already built from Kepler Run, and costs me $0 additional dollars) I would roughly break even in this scenario. \nScenario 2 would be where we've moved over 100 units. At this point we get a little bit of economy of scale. Units would cost around $16, but now would contain 33% more heroes, which is a pretty good deal I think.\nIf we manage to pull 300 - 500 units, then we move into a situation where offset printing starts to make sense. At those levels, then the cost for 500 to 1000 units are attainable. Offset printing requires more lead time when working with the manufacturers, but that's offset by the fact that I will not have to do any manual assembly of the games. This should make up the time difference (however it remains to be seen the impact of the Carona Virus when the project ends in mid March). All of that and the package would contain even more heroes than scenario 2.\nOver all, my last project, Kepler Run, was a more complicated digital production, and a more complicated manual assembly which had a lot more custom components. That game carried a higher price tag to account for that fact.  This time around Ark Worlds is a much simpler and less risky assembly, and should be easy to fulfill, which ever way the campaign goes.\nThe last piece of the puzzle will be the fulfillment company. Last time I used Fulfillrite, and I really enjoyed working with them, and heard no complaints from backers. Only one game box arrived damaged which i was able to send to my backer quickly. I plan to use them again, which makes all of the shipping and fulfillment super easy and EU friendly.\nMy goals with this project are first to keep my promise to my supporters and get this game to backers. Second not lose a bunch of money. Third possibly make money. Overall, delivering high quality products is the thing I care most about with this project.\n Final shipping will be charged in the pledge manager when we're closer to production. Please understand that these are only estimates based on my best guess of the final weight and size of the game. Shipping a Kickstarter is complicated, thanks for your patience.\nFree Shipping US shipping and $8 International shipping for all Unpossible Game Labs Founder Club members for life\nUS: $6 - single, $8 - double. \nCanada: $12 - single, $18 - double\nEU: $15 - single, $25 - double\nChina and Japan: $18 per unit\nRest of World: $20 per unit\na.k.a. boring stuff...\n Refunds\nRefund requests with in 14 days of the end of the campaign will be honored in full. After that, refunds will be made less any fees deducted by Kickstarter. Partial refunds will be honored until the closing of the pledge manager, which will be just before the orders are put in with the factory over seas.\nBacking and Pledge Manager\nBy backing this project on Kickstarter you acknowledge that you are not purchasing a finished product, and instead are helping to create a product as described above. You also acknowledge that it is your responsibility to complete your order, in a timely fashion, at the time that the pledge manager is made available. Failure to complete the pledge manager in the allotted time will likely result in delayed shipping and increased shipping costs proportional to the cost increase to Unpossible Game Labs.

I've been working on consumer facing products for about 15 years now. I got my start in the video game industry and eventually moved onto the wonderful world of tech. Mostly my role is as a software engineer, but I've always emphasized working closely with artists and designers in my day to day work.\nI started Unpossible Game Labs about 3 years ago as a creative outlet. Running UGL has allowed me to practice art, design, marketing, business development, video production, and a large number of other skills. This is really a passion for me, and I'm so lucky that Kickstarter allows small time creators like me to put projects like this together. Thanks to everyone who's supported me and UGL so far.

It's in there forever. No buttons, no functions, no light, fully waterproof and no changing that 10 year battery.\nIt just tells time.\nThis project begins as a celebration of the Casio F-91W wristwatch. Initially released and unchanged since 1989, this affordable, reliable and accurate timepiece is a beautiful feat of engineering. You seriously can't find another piece of technology that's so ubiquitous and does what it is supposed to for as long as it does without any intervention. It's amazing.\n-\nIndividually cast into a transparent resin case, each Solid State Watch comes with its own unique imperfections.\n-\n-\nWhen you receive the watch, it is set to your desired time and cannot be adjusted.\n -\nNo buttons\nThe electronics of the Solid State Watch are completely sealed, so you can't push any buttons to switch modes or adjust the time. Your watch ships set to whatever timezone you'd like. Eventually your watch will drift. Worst case scenario, it may drift up to \u00b11 second/day. But in practice, it will likely be far less than that. If you want to nerd out on its accuracy, check out this youtube video analyzing 100+ F-91Ws that have been running for 13 years (more in the FAQ).\nNo battery changes\nThe Casio F-91W is optimized to last on its 3V CR-2016 battery for 7 years assuming you use the light for 1 second and the 20 second alarm everyday. Since we won\u2019t be using the alarm or light, it should last 10+ years.\nNo light\nYea, we'll miss that cutie LED. Since the buttons are sealed off, you won't be able to access the light. But really... you don't need it and let's save that battery power.\n100% waterproof\nWatches are usually rated for water pressure resistance because gaskets and other waterproofing mechanisms all eventually fail under pressure. Solid State Watch is completely solid and waterproof.\nFun bonus : The display of Solid State Watch is visible from all angles underwater. Most watches have air inside them which causes the watch crystal to act like a mirror underwater (unless your viewpoint is near perpendicular to the display).  Since there\u2019s no air inside Solid State Watch you\u2019ll be able to read the display from all angles underwater.\nWhat's that orange dot?\nSolid State Watch has a circular fluorescent orange dot placed over the date on the movement. The F-91W movement doesn\u2019t account for leap years, so the date will be incorrect after a Leap Year. The fluorescent orange dot simultaneously masks and draws attention to this imperfection.\nWhat about daylight saving time?\nWe\u2019re hoping DST goes away soon. Until then, many countries still use it. Since you can\u2019t adjust the time on a Solid State Watch, you can remember to adjust for DST in your head for part of the year or.... get 2 watches ;)\nIsn't this project wasteful?\nYes. If you consider this as a purely functional watch, it's a waste of materials, time and energy. This watch takes a fully function watch and removes almost all its functions, doesn't let you change its battery, and will become less accurate over time.  \nBUT, we see this project not from a functional perspective. We see this more like capturing a beautiful specimen in amber. One you get to observe as it continues to live on for 10+ years. How long will it actually live for? How much will it drift?  The F-91W is that beautiful to us. As is the experience of observing in real time how a piece of electronics gradually fails and becomes obsolete.\n-\nMaking a Solid State Watch\nClose up of casting resin with syringe.\nMaking your Solid State Watch\nWe\u2019re casting each and every Solid State Watches in our Brooklyn Studio. The process involves a series of steps, beginning with a 3D print of the main body printed on a Form 3 printer. Then we cast, heat, vacuum and UV cure a movement set to your timezone into the body. This casting process is done in multiple steps to achieve our desired finish. All of these steps are done by hand, and we embrace the slight imperfections of the process that make each watch unique.\n-\nBackside of Nick Mankey Custom Hook Strap\u00a9. Note the custom print will be hidden when wearing.\nCustom Hook Strap\u00a9 Elastic Watch Band by Nick Mankey Designs\nSolid State Watch ships with a Lunar Grey custom printed Hook Strap\u00a9 Elastic Watch Band with brushed metal hardware, handmade in California by Nick Mankey Designs.\nKnown for their comfort, quality materials + hardware and ability to absorb strain on your watch\u2019s spring bars, these bands come perfectly sized for your wrist (down to the 1/4\u201d), and have the ability to micro-adjust to the perfect tightness. These are absolutely the most comfortable watch bands you'll ever experience.\nAfter the campaign we\u2019ll ask for your wrist size while we collect your shipping address.\n*** the graphic print on the strap will be hidden when the watch is being worn.\n-\nSpecifications\nSize : 32mm x 38.4mm x 10mm\nWeight : 19g\nLug width : 18mm\nEstimated battery life : 10 years\nMovement : Casio F-91W\nBattery : 3V CR-2016\nOn its original battery, the Casio F-91W is specified to keep accurate time (\u00b11 second a day. In practice it's much less.) for 7 years with ordinary use (assuming 1 second light + 20 second alarm daily).*\nReward fulfillment\nIn order to fulfill your Solid State Watch reward, we'll need your wrist size, desired timezone + time mode (AM/PM or 24 hour).

We like to think of time as a medium, but also a framework to explore ideas surrounding time such as, materials, fabrication, long thinking, precision, accuracy and decay. Che-Wei has written not one, but TWO! master theses on the subject. Some of our favorite projects include Che-Wei's ITP thesis 3.16 Billion Cycles, Earth Clock and Taylor's 1bit 1hz CPU. \nOur most recent time related project, also launched on Kickstarter was Time Since Launch, a single use long scale launch clock used to mark a moment in time and make it yours for 1 billion days.\n\n\nAbout CW&T \nCW&T is the art and design practice of Che-Wei Wang + Taylor Levy. We live in a world of our own making. It's a world where every object has its purpose, although not always purposeful, and where common objects receive uncommon consideration.

The timely shock of a breaching insurrection may provide opportunity to poach this belly of the beast.\n Futility's Wreck \u2013 Slogging through the icing shawl of the south, the crew of Futility find themselves not half a league from a hulking barge inhabited by cultists adorned in death's mark.

Or rather, we were. We stopped performing in 2015, after 20-ish years of circling the globe kicking out the jams in tiny clubs and massive festivals and everything in between. Like Zamfir, the Master of the Pan Flute, we have \"enchanted millions\". Maybe YOU were one of these people!** \n**Or two of these people, if you are looking over the shoulder of a co-worker or spouse. \nOur debut album came out in 1995, first on a tiny Seattle label called Pop Llama, then some <action-packed> months later on COLUMBIA RECORDS. At some point early in the process, we did a sub-license <----(music business term!) with a small Spanish label for vinyl, and they made a few copies.  They continue to be battled over to this day. See below ......\nI'm being told there may have been a Dutch version as well? Maybe a bootleg? Who knows ANYHOOOOO there aren't very many out there is what I'm trying to tell you! \nYikes $185! Yikes BAD COVER!\n Great question!  \n1995 was a time when vinyl seemed like a format whose days were numbered. Because OMG COMPACT DISCS! We stayed very busy circling the globe and kicking out the jams and selling gajillions of these \"CDs.\" Here are some of the concepts we may have lost track of during this turbulent time:\nclean laundry\ntime zones\noccasionally eating salad \nreleasing our album on vinyl \nIt wasn't until years later when INTERNET let people talk to us that we found out we had made a huge mistake\nSo here we are, coming up on its 25th birthday....BOOM VINYL PUSA! \n\nThis is a celebratory FANCY-PANTS edition, white vinyl with green and bronze marbling. There's even a poster inside that you can take right down to your local tattoo shop and say \"please put this across my back!\"**\n**do not actually do this.\nWe are post-rock-band. While we remain friends and enjoy frequent lunches together, we have no label, no management, no infrastructure, no \"team\". That's OK though! We  don't need any of that stuff!*** Thanks to INTERNET and whatnot the music is out there for anyone who wants to hear it (that's my vague understanding of INTERNET.)\nAnd (this is important) we own most of our music, including this album! So involving a label again is kind of the opposite of what we want moving forward. Kickstarter gives us the chance to bring this directly to you, and (also important) figure out how many of you are interested in having one of these hot slabs of wax!  Also: not for nothing, but our research shows that people in general like and trust Kickstarter the most out of all the crowdfunding sites!\n***except the lunches.\n\nWhat kind of a question is that.....what CAN'T you get??\nFirst, the TECHY STUFF: \nBoth formats here are from when we remastered the album in 2005 with Vlado Meller (who is a big deal in the mastering game). It's a little bit shinier than the original, and we like it a lot. So much in fact, that we could find no legit excuse to remaster it again for vinyl.*****\n Everyone gets a link to the album as either WAV or 320k mp3 files. I don't know what that means, but I'm sure they will be higher quality than listening on a streaming service, or most regular mp3 files. So that's nice. \ntl;dr the digital stuff will sound better than what you have unless you have the 10 year anniversary edition in some form already.\nAND I believe we've already mentioned there is a HOT SLAB OF WAX involved! Please take this moment to admire it again! \n*****TURNS OUT the main reason one would want to re-master specifically for vinyl has something to do with the gain levels of stuff that was originally mastered for CD yadda yada I don't know I may have fallen asleep while I wrote this sentence anyway Vlado addressed that and it sounds great so let's relax with a martini poolside\n\n And here is a handsome shirt that we thought looked nice, and you won't find it anywhere else, so I mean it seems pretty important to get one now, right? Fun fact: After the campaign we will contact you to SELECT A SIZE and we will hound you constantly until you do. Eventually we will send some gym socks and a chia pet, and you will have no-one to blame, because you did not SELECT A SIZE on the friendly survey we sent you! \nS, M, L, XL! Sorry, limited sizes!\nAnd look here: a snappy enamel pin. This is a victory lap that can be worn out and about on a hat or lapel! In case you were wondering it is 1.5 inches a side. \n\n\nSTRAIGHT UP OUR NOSES\nKIDDING. The only thing that ever went up our noses were farts on a tour bus. \nBut yeah, us! There's all the normal things that need paying for...pressing, shrink wrapping, packing, mailing etc...there are many bites taken from the apple before the applesauce phase....\nI am using the \"apple\" metaphor because apples are often used to make \"pie\" and Kickstarter even suggests using a \"pie chart\" in this section, but I donut know how to make a \"pie chart\" even though I love pie. I love all desserts, did you even notice that I said \"donut\" instead of \"do not\"?\nWe're thinking of this as a fun way to get a thing into the world that we should have done years ago, while not having to do very much of the actual work ourselves. Instead we're hiring talented people to oversee production, fulfillment, art, and our fragile tempers. Everything is being made here in the USA by independent businesses. The HOT SLABS OF WAX are being pressed in Athens, GA by Kindercore, and inserted into jackets from LA's Stoughton Printing. The handsome shirts will be screened by Ruby Sue Graphics, likewise in Athens. \nHere is some info about our fulfillment partner:\nthey are called Fulfillment Merch, and they have a website.\nthey are very good at shipping vinyl.\nthey use vinyl-specific packaging made from recycled materials, which is nice.\npeople seem to like them! \nholy cow they are ALSO in Athens, GA....this must be some coincidence!\n\n\nSeriously, fam.....\nWe have been so lucky to be able to play music in your earholes and your hometowns and your cars for 20-ish years. YOU made it happen, and we have been humbled and honored by your continued interest and dare I say passion for our particular silly brand of rock and roll music.

This roughly 32 page A5 zine has everything you need to generate natural formations, forgotten ruins, enemies, wyrd magics, and ancient monstrosities. It has a simple turn-based combat system, rules for building your hold, and tips on how to implement your hold into your RPG world.\nInspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, DELVE aims to capture that feeling of building and protecting a fortress in an unforgiving subterranean world.\nAll you need to play is, a pencil, paper (preferably 1\" grid), and a deck of playing cards. \nThe Under-King has put out a bounty to all the holds demanding a Void Crystal, a rare and powerful gem found only in the deepest caverns. \nEach round your dwarves will mine another square of the grid, you draw a card from your deck of playing cards and see what they found. Hearts \u2665 and Diamonds \u2666 are resources and trade goods that you'll use for building and hiring units while Clubs \u2663 and Spades \u2660 are natural formations and forgotten ruins. From ancient libraries to goblin lairs, these subterranean locales will become part of your hold's unique layout and may provide unexpected benefits. Or you might just unleash a horde of ravenous insects in which case, you'll need to fight.\nCombat in DELVE is designed to allow for forward planning and strategic thinking without weighing you down with book-keeping. Essentially, all enemies follow the same goal of trying to reach the surface by killing their way through your hold. They can move one grid space per turn, as can all of your units. Once they get into combat, check the rock-paper-scissors style chart to see which group has the advantage and reduce each side by the STR of the other. \nOnce combat is over, it's time to build! As long as a room has access to the hold via a mineshaft or another room, it's good to go. Just pay the cost, and draw it in an available grid (empty or repurpose an old \u2663 or \u2660 grid space). At this stage, you'll also have the opportunity to build traps, reinforce, and hire units to defend your hold.\nJust, be careful as you get deeper though as the black joker is waiting. Drawing this card releases an ancient monstrosity, a randomly generated beast that needs a well stocked army and hold to defeat. \nThe Story of Blood Fate Hold\nThe hold was off to a rough start as their chosen site led straight into the lair of the mud goblin clan, Rushk. The initial group of soldiers sent with the expedition where wiped out in this surprise attack.\nDeciding that bad luck doesn't just strike once, they built a spike wall to defend their stairwell. A good choice as the next pick strike revealed a hive of cave wasps. Some miners perished but the overzealous wasps dashed themselves upon the spike wall.\nFinally, Blood Fate was started, a barracks built just beyond the hive. It's honey would sustain the expedition and our new soldiers would have somewhere to stay while the miners delved deeper.\nA string of good luck found trade goods and resources by the plenty and so they built a stewpot kitchen to hearten the fighting spirits of the soldiers, a shrine to bless their good luck, and finally, a stairwell to descend deeper.\nThe old adage of \"fool me once\" had become mantra for Blood Fate as they focused their efforts on defence. Rock fall traps on the stairwell, and a dead dwarf alarm that would warn of any approaching threat.\nTheir militaristic efforts where rewarded as after ignoring a buried temple (who knows what god it was built to), they broke through to a structure. A cavernous mansion filled with chandeliers, suits of armour, and a blood stained altar. A vampire queen's coterie. Her thralls poured from the shadows, overwhelming the miners and marching through the hold at their dark mistresses behest.\nThe boulder trap dashed the first zealous few on the stairs, weakening their numbers. The stew heartened soldiers fought bravely, managing to strike down all but one. The vampire queen herself. One soldier swore an oath to the gods and launched himself in a frenzy of spinning axes, injuring her before having his head torn from his shoulders. His sacrifice was not in vain however as his bravery bought the reinforcements called by the dead dwarf alarm time to arrive. \nBlood Fate Hold reeks of death and garlic, they say a fool is someone who doesn't learn from past mistakes and these dwarves are no fools. Every room is decorated in holy symbols to gods old and new and once a year the dwarves let blood in a rememberance ritual called Vampik.\nUNCOVERED - For passing \u00a31200 I'll pay an artist to make a better quality cover for DELVE.

Along the way you'll be challenged by powerful adventurers, other dungeons, and more. Will you be strong enough to keep your treacherous minions under control and defeat the forces of good? Or will you be overthrown and forgotten?\nYou will not have to pay increased postage for a physical copy of RISE\nUNCOVERED - At \u00a32600, pledges will get a copy of UMBRA: A Solo Game of Planet Colonisation (PDFS for all pledges, Print for \u00a37 and higher)\nAs a galactic war rages on, your government has tasked you with leading an expedition into the depths of an alien planet to find the source of a mysterious signal. Could this be the weapon to win the war? UMBRA comes with new features like planet generation, scanners, and above ground building. Will you find the mysterious signal before the war is lost? Will you be the last bastion of humanity? Or will you unleash something much worse on the galaxy.\nUNCOVERED - At \u00a33200, pledges will get an expansion for UMBRA focused on exploring a labrynthine space station and repurposing its rooms for your survival. (PDF for all pledges)\nUNCOVERED - At \u00a33500 I will commission an artist to create interior art for all 3 zines.\nUNCOVERED - At \u00a34000 my ragtag band of packaging minions will be rewarded with a nice dinner at a local restaurant as thanks for their dilligent efforts.
