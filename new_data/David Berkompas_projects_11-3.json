Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image. Copy, paste, and post them on your own social accounts to help spread the word. It's as simple as that! \n4. CHECK IN WITH YOUR FELLOW MSTIES.  We don't want you to pressure anyone, but we do hope you'll check in to make sure they know about this Kickstarter.  And when you do, be sure to remind them that pledging even a $1 token pledge will still help us unlock more Challenge Goals, Bonus Rewards, and get them weekly updates all the way through the production of Season 13!\n5. JOIN OUR \"VIRTUAL STREET TEAM.\" If you've got a little extra time, and want to make sure we reach our final goal, there are more specific ways to volunteer and help. If you want to get specific \"assignments\" to help us #MakeMoreMST3K, you can sign up to be part of our elite volunteer team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we learned last time, there are always risks with Kickstarter... and the world is a little crazier right now than usual.

We have some very nice surprises in store for the project.\n\nCombo Coin Purse and Chinese Coin Shell Set.\n\nPlease check UPDATE #3 for full information.\nFollow us on Facebook for the Latest Updates.\nProduced By D \n\nFounded in 2019 and Supervised by Jay Wang.\n\nArtisan Coin is a New Brand focusing on the world's highest quality and coolest coin gaffs and accessories.\n\nWe have put infinite collaborative efforts into this.\n\nAll coin magicians will agree that the quality of the coin gaff directly affects your performance experience. Therefore,  every Artisan Coin has been through three different standards quality control, manual adjustment, and refinement to perfect every detail.\n\nIncluded are our original and extensive instructional tutorial videos. This allows you to fully maximize the value of each set of gaffs, no matter if you are a beginner or a professional.\n\nAt the same time, we want coin gaffs not to be expensive niche toys, but to be everyday carry items that magicians carry around, so we will sell all our products at AMAZING prices. We also believe great magic is not about the price.\n\nWe also devote ourselves to exquisite and fashionable packaging, so that you can enjoy the unboxing experience.\n\nWe will do our best to bring you every new surprise.\n\nEvery coin is manually adjusted.\nEvery coin passes three quality controls.\nArtisan Coin, A Fresh Height On Coin Gaffs.\nBackers will be the first in the world to get their hands on the Artisan Coin series.\nThe follow-up sale will be at the end of 2022 if it's funded.\n Extreme & Unique discount, only for Kickstarter backers. \n The instructions are FREE for our Kickstarter Backers. \nThanks to Kickstarter's crowd-funding features, we were able to be more demanding on the product itself and further lower the price. We now pass on these savings to you.\n\nBy supporting our projects, you will be helping us share the cost of mass production and allow more enthusiasts and even professionals to experience the value of quality products that are made in China.\nIn 1847, J. N. Hofzinser invented the Shell. \n\nThis was a clear indication to all magicians that Coin Magic from that day forth will be forever changed. \n\nDuring the last 170 years, magicians have built endlessly upon this genius invention. Transpositions, vanishes, appearances, Penetrations. It's hard to imagine that one could create the most incredible miracles with something so simple\n\nIn the field of Coin Magic, where sleight of hand is inevitable, the Coin Shell is undoubtedly the best tool. \nEven after over 170 years, the Coin Shell is still one of the must-have gaffs for any coin magicians. What's more, there are as many coin shells as there are different types of coins.\n\nThe question is, what makes an excellent Shell?\n\nWe have proposed four criteria to measure the quality of a coin shell.\n\n Closeness: The gap between the edge of the Shell and the edge of the coin. The smaller the better.\n Fit: The degree of adhesion between the coin case and the surface of the coin. The better the fit, the better the quality.\n Coverage: The degree to which the edge of the coin shell covers the edge of the coin underneath. The more coverage the better.\n Degree of deformation: The coin needs to be flattened in order to expand the coin shell. During this process, the deformation of the pattern is as minimal as possible.\nTo improve each criterion requires consideration of many factors. The reason being there are contradictions between each of these criteria. \n\nFor example, if you want more coverage, you must make it deeper. However, if you make it deeper, it will cause losses in the degree of deformation. In the production process, it is very likely that to enhance one criterion, other criteria will be affected. There is a delicate balance to be struck here.\nWe spent a year of continuous testing, scrapping, and retesting, and adding manual processes into the production, to make these four criteria to the most satisfactory level. \n\nHere we are: Artisan Coin Expanded Shell.\nPLAY\n\nIn addition to the craftsmanship, the value of an Expanded Coin Shell is also reflected in the performance. The Artisan Coin series entire line of products is accompanied by, what we believe to be the most comprehensive and original instructional videos ever.\n\nIn the instructional videos, there are six complete routines that have been tested across numerous actual performances: Coin Across, Table Coin Across, Coin to Glass, Coin Through Table, Three Fly, Half Set Routine. [You will need 4 regular Kennedy half dollars, which are NOT included, to perform the routines in the instructional videos.]\n\nWhat you see in the promotional trailer is just a small part of the full instructional video. The instructional video will help you quickly grasp the essence of the Expanded Shell, and also allow you to perform wonderful coin effects at a moment's notice.\nWe have also included a section on repairing your Shell which will allow you to easily repair a slightly damaged coin shell.\n\nThe coin shell can be said to be the foundation of modern coin magic gaffs. It is because of the coin shell, that all kinds of amazing coin gaffs were created in the century that followed.\n\nThe Coin Shell is also where the Artisan Coin series begins. \n\nWe hope that each meticulous detail will bring you a brand-new experience, and have more people experience the charm of coin magic.\nPoetic routine.\nHigh-precision gaff coin, the appearance is almost the same as a regular coin.\nRe-milled Half-dollar edge, allowing for a more simplified handling and can more routines.\nComprehensive instructional video, which includes six routines and new techniques.\nAlthough the Sun & Moon Coin was only circulated within a small circle of coin workers, it has also been favored by many coin masters.\n\nCurtis Kam once said, \u201cThe Sun & Moon Coins allows one to perform one of the most impressive and memorable coin magic ever created.\" The Sun & Moon coins in the hands of masters such as Geoff Latta, David Neighbors, Roger Klause, etc. also create all kinds of marvels.\n\nThe changes between the sun and moon, sunset and sunrise. This is the unique romance of The Sun & Moon coins.\n\nCheck the Video:\nPLAY\n\n- In the original version, due to the size, the penny shell could not fit over the half-dollar. Hence, some coins could only be concealed using sleight of hand.\n- For the Artisan Coin series, we have specially made a half-dollar, which is trimmed and re-milled. The appearance is no different from a regular half-dollar. However, because it can fit into the penny shell, the difficulty during the performance is greatly reduced and can be easily controlled, even for a novice.\n\nEven the producer of the trailer commented that it was no different from shooting a regular coin.  Hence we have added the split after the coin roll, in order to dispel any comments that we are using a regular coin for the trailer.\n\nThis should be the highest praise for our Sun & Moon Coins.\nAgain, for you to fully extract the value of the Sun & Moon coins, the instructional video will be more compressive than you imagine.\n\nIncluding 6 complete routines that have withstood countless actual performances: Sun & Moon, CBH1, CBH2, Hopping SM, CS Transposition, Three Colors Fly, and Shell Repairing.\n\n We believe you will enjoy this.\n\nJust use a romantic and poetic routine to conquer your audience.\nIn 1967, a magician from Scotland named Jim Boyd invented the prop called \u2018Confusing Coins\u2019.\n\nHe would not have imagined that the \u2018Confusing Coins\u2019 would become one of the world's most popular magic coin gaffs half a century later: The 'Hopping Half\u2019.\nImagine having two coins, one silver, and one copper, in your hand. You take one of the coins cleanly and put it in your pocket. Then you open your hand and find that both coins are still there.\n\nAfter repeating this three times, you then slowly place the copper coin in your pocket and open your hand. Where the audience expects to see two coins, the coins have now disappeared.\n\nIn our minds, we might think that performing such an incredible coin effect may require a lot of complicated sleights. However, whether you have practiced magic prior to this or not, when you pick up this gaff set, you will be performing the same effect in 3 minutes.\n\nCheck The Video:\nPLAY\n\nSuch an unexpected effect and its easy operation had made the Hopping Halves one of the most famous gaff effects in the world. \n\nHowever, its strength goes far beyond that.\n\nThe Hopping Half is a set that consists of multiple gaffs. if these were used separately, it also encompasses the functions of a variety of other gaffs: The Expanded Shell, original Sun and Moon coin, and 3CM.\n\nThe Expanded Shell in Artisan Coin Hopping Half set is the Artisan Coin Expanded Shell, which is a must-have for every coin worker.\nThe 3CM consists of two shells and one coin, allowing you to perform the vanishes and appearances of three coins. The 3CM included in the Hopping Half set has a double-sided coin, so it also includes a color-changing effect.\n\nThis is the Hopping Half. \n\nWith apparently only two coins, numerous routines are possible.\nA good set of props must not only have an ingenious design but also must have exquisite craftsmanship to be usable. \n\nThe Artisan Coin Hopping Half has undergone long-term experimentation and trial to ensure that the coin shells have a high degree of closeness, fit, and coverage.\n\nIf you want, you could toss and catch not only the USA coins but also the entire nested group of copper coins.\n\nThe Instructional video includes 7 routines that have been refined through countless actual performances: Hopping Half, CBH1, CBH2, Sun & Moon, Hanging Coppers, CS, Three Colors Fly.\n\nIt includes the presentation of two classical routines (the routine, Back in Time requires two additional regular coins), as well as very practical routines such as the Sun and Moon routine...\n\nWe believe that Artisan Coin Hopping Half will reap unexpected benefits.\nEven if you do not have an in-depth knowledge of coin magic, you would have heard of the Flipper Coins a bit.\n\nDuring the Spring Festival Gala of 2010, Lu Chen shocked the whole of China by performing Dean Dill\u2019s coins through table. And Eric Joes also use Oxy-Clean to fool Penn & Teller.\n\nBeing chosen to be performed by these top coin magicians is enough to prove its value.\n\nWhether it is penetrations or vanishes, The Flipper Coin can achieve these effects in a super-visual way. Whether it is penetrations or vanishes, The Flipper Coin can achieve these effects in a super-visual way.\n\nCertainly, the prerequisite of all this is for you to have a great quality Flipper Coin.\nAnd we think we made it.\nIn order to produce the most ideal Flipper Coin, we have mustered the best craftsmanship that was initially used only on high-end silver coins, and instilled them into the Artisan Coin Half-Dollar Flipper Coin, and chose what we believe to be the best structure.\n\nDue to the different workings and principles of The Flipper Coins, they are further segregated into gravity, magnetic, elastic, and Pro Elastic... Even many coin enthusiasts are unclear of the differences, let alone those that have never heard of them.\n\nWhat we have used is an internal groove and also re-milled the edges. The use of a shim allows for it to switch between gravity and magnetic mode. High-precision wire cutting produces gimmicks that are hard to decern even at close range. The shell and coin nests perfectly, almost no different from a regular coin.\n\nThis coin can be said to meet all of your flipper needs.\n\nCheck the Video:\nPLAY\n\nHigh-precision cut. Probably the most undetectable at present.\nInternal groove with re-milled edges. Almost identical to regular coins.\nProbably one of the easiest Flipper Coins to maintain.\nGravity and magnetic dual system.\nIn addition to the craftsmanship, we have also prepared an original and comprehensive instructional video.\n\nIt contains works that have never been published and teaches a total of 6 well-designed routines that have gone through countless actual performances: Coin Across, Coin Through Table, NOXF 1&2 (Need Ex-Shell), COXF, Coin Through Glass, Flipper Three Fly. \n[You will need 4 regular Kennedy half dollars to perform some of the routines in the instructional videos.]\n\nDetailed explanations will allow you to quickly master these routines.\n\nThe routines also include new handlings of opening and closing the gimmick, displays, and other convincers. Hence, if you want to build your own Flipper Coin routine, this tutorial will also give you all the techniques that you need.\nAnother \"Century-old Classic\"\uff1a\nDue to the development of machining technology, coin gaffs have gradually formed over the past hundred years. Those that can have remained till this day are all treasures of Magic. \n\nThe Artisan Coin series is committed to redefining these \"Century-old classics\" coin gaffs with modern technology and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Tri-fold Coin is undoubtedly an indispensable classic.\n\nReferring to its earliest record, in \"Modern Magic\" in 1876, Professor Hoffmann hid it in a magic wand and used it to conjure a coin. Since then, the Folding Coin was developed for more usage and has gradually become one of the more popular coin gaffs in the world.\nThe Choice of Masters\nThe signature usage of a folding Coin is well known to most, the \u201cCoin in Bottle\u201d and \u201cCoin Bite\u201d are seen frequently on TV and Street Magic specials.\n\nFamiliar masters, such as Michael Ammar and the late David Roth, also have their own routines using the Folding Coin.\n\nExpert Coin Magic records the coins across and coins through table effects by Roth using the Folding Coin. The World's Greatest Magic video teaching series has also released a magic compilation on Folding Coins.\n\nMeticulous Craftsmanship\nThe structure of the Folding Coin is very simple. However, there are two important details that affect the user\u2019s experience.\n\n*Precision cuts:\nAlthough regular cutting is not a problem for everyday performances, we still utilized a more precise cutting method. Hence, the cut marks on the coin are difficult to detect even at very close distances. The eagle on the Tail side of the coin can be observed up to a close distance of 30cm. The Head side can be observed at a close distance of 80cm or further for maximum safety.\n*Deeper side grooves:\nIf you have ever performed the coin through bottle effect using a Folding coin, you would encounter a common problem.

Probably the most concealed tri-fold coin.\nThe side grooves are deepened to 2mm+ to increase stability.\nOnline instructional video includes basic handling, as well as new techniques, and coin through table routine.\nIn the instructional video of the Artisan Folding Coin, in addition to the classic effects of the coin in bottle and coin bite, Jay Wang will show you new techniques of using Folding Coins:\n\n- Double-sided display during coin bite.\n- Visual coin productions and vanishes.\n- A very visual three-phase coin through table effect, which makes the routine extremely thought-provoking.\n\nGo and enjoy : )\nLast of the Six works released in the Artisan Coin HD Series.\n\nThis is also the one with the most complex craftsmanship and the highest precision requirements among the six items.\nArtisan Coin HD CSB\nCSB is one of the cleverest inventions in coin gaffs. It is also one of the most powerful transposition effects in coin magic.\n\nNo matter how deep your knowledge is regarding coin tricks and coin gaffs, a good CSB routine will short-circuit your brain in an instant.\n\nEven if you open and laid out the secret in front of your eyes, you will surely be stunned by its simple structure, and then suddenly realize it and applaud in awe.\n\nThe CSB originated from the two copper coins and one silver coin transposition routine by Conrad Haden. Presley Guitar invented the CSB by replacing one of the copper coins with an ancient Chinese coin on top of the foundation of Conrad\u2019s routine. The hole in the middle of the Chinese coin gives the audience the impression that the coin is not replaced, so the whole effect is completely refined and elevated.\n\nIt is not a simple task to make the ancient Chinese coin look identical to a regular coin when nested. Therefore, the built-quality of the gaffed coin is the foundation for achieving such a powerful effect. And making the gaffed coin look as much as possible like a regular coin is the ultimate goal when crafting the CSB.\n\nThe usual process of most mass-produced CSB sets was to directly stick the Chinese coin on the silver coin shell after being thinned. Therefore, the edge of the coin would be composed of two parts, one is the edge of the silver coin, and the other is the edge of the copper coin. This is the same for the double-sided gaff coin. This process is a common practice and is easier to implement during mass production.\nHowever, For the Artisan Coin, this is far from satisfactory.\nFor the Artisan Coin CSB set, we adopted a process that was only used for high-end coin gaffs:\nNo layering on the edge of the coin. After more than half a year of experimentation, finally, the coin shell and double-sided coin can be been merged into one at the mass production stage.\nThe gap of the gaffed coin is completely fitted, making the surface of the gaffed coin no different from a regular coin.\nThe matching regular coin also has a very intricate design. In order to make the regular copper coin and the double-sided coin appear the same in size and appearance, we have specially made the copper coin a hair smaller.\nIn addition,  as always, in order to let you get started quickly and extract its full value, we have included 4 routines that have passed countless actual performances: CSB Routine, Hopping CSB1, Hopping CSB2, Three Colors Fly.\nThis includes content that has never been published. In addition to the visual transposition effects, it also includes interactive routines with the audience. In addition, the original handling methods will absolutely inspire you.\nCheck the video:\nPLAY\n\nNo gap between the double-sided coin and the shell.

There's no limit to what you can do with the right tools!\nWith this Kickstarter you'll be able to buy a screen in one of two orientations in up to 9 colors. You'll be able to add inserts to it in different configurations depending on your needs. You'll be able to clip a binder of inserts to it if you want. You'll be able to add magnets to some panels, track character conditions, add initiative cards to the top of the screen, and SO MUCH MORE!\n\nThe Kickstarter\nAt Hammerdog Games we believe DMs and GMs should have the best tools at their fingertips. That's why, for over a decade, we've been producing and selling The World's Greatest Screen, a 4-panel, 8-pocket customizable game screen. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and every year we hear from customers who own multiple screens, and whose screens have lasted them for years.\nAs a result, it has not been easy for us to find a reason or even a way to improve the screen itself. It's sturdy, durable, reusable, and washable. It works with wet and dry erase markers. And our fans love it. It's a hard act to follow!\nSo with this Kickstarter we decided to give you the tools to trick it out. You can\nAdd inserts as needed for your game system, adventure, or individual encounter.\nAdd a Tome of Inserts that you can flip through in-game so that you have the exact tables that you want when you want them.\nAdd magnet receptive inserts so that magnets will stick to the screen. \nUse magnets to track initiative, status conditions, results you rolled on certain tables, and so on.\nAdd art packs to the outside of your screen to project your game, your personality, or both.\nMake the screen you've always wanted!\nWe just need a bit of help from you! We've set a super low monetary goal because all the hard work for this Kickstarter is done. We just need to know how many orders we have so we can get to shipping them!\nAs a result, we've turned this Kickstarter into a Blitzstarter. We are running a super short campaign with just a few stretch goals. We will begin to fulfill shortly after the Kickstarter begins, with the goal of delivering to all backers in the USA within 30 days of closure.\nThe World's Greatest Screen \nPLAY\n\n\n The World's Greatest Inserts \nPLAY\n\n\n Magnet Power\nPLAY\n\n\n Tricking Out Your Screen \nPLAY\n\n\n\n\nWith this Kickstarter we are introducing a whole new product for Hammerdog Games - The World's Greatest Inserts, short name, TWGi. These inserts are jam packed with information on one side, and a nice piece of art on the other. Fill the pockets of your screen with any combination of inserts, and change them mid-game if you like.\nThere are two kinds of inserts presented in this Kickstarter - Art Packs, and Fantasy RPG Inserts. Future Kickstarters will be launched for inserts that can be used with other games.\nArt Packs \nThese packs contain 4 double-sided full color inserts. There is high quality art covering both sides. Art packs are themed and can show standard RPG imagery - like fairies and dragons, or other imagery that reflects the personality of the screen's owner - like cats and dogs.\nArt Pack - Classic Characters (Contains 4 double-sided inserts)\nTWGi Set 1 - Fantasy Pack\nThe primary release for this Kickstarter is for our first fantasy series, 25 inserts that contain high quality fantasy art on one side, and themed random tables on the other. The themes and tables make them compatible with DnD 5e and Pathfinder 1e. However, they contain so much good information that they can be easily used with or adapted to other game systems.\nJust a Sample of All the Wonderful Tables and Charts Available to You\nYou can fill your screen with any combination of inserts, or store them all in the Tome of Inserts. You can clip the Tome to your screen, replacing or adding a panel to it by doing so. As you flip through the binder, that panel \"changes\" to be exactly what you need. You can of course, always use the Tome like a normal reference book.\nThe World's Greatest Inserts Set 1 - Fantasy Pack can be used to generate the bulk of an adventure, either before you begin play, or randomly during it. The inserts are designed to work together to fill the most common needs of GMs and DMs, whether they are running a premade adventure or a sandbox campaign. \nHere is a simple example of how you can combine these inserts to create an entire story quickly and easily. Note that the Owlbear insert is part of Stretch Goal 1, and is a sneak peek at a future product.\n\nLair of the Feather Bear\nIt's a cold and rainy night, and your players want to throw some dice. You agree even though you have nothing prepared. That's OK. They're not the greatest at staying on track anyways. So you grab your screen, your books, and your favorite inserts. You decide to put your friends up against an Owlbear, and decide that it would be fun if it was an arctic variant. You check your inserts and your options, and within minutes, have the backbone of an adventure ready to go.\n\n The adventure begins in a tavern. \nOn the cold steppes of a northern town.\n\n The tavern is filled with interesting characters, one of which has a quest. \n\nThe group leaves the tavern and travel south to the hills.\n\n Exploring the hills, they find a cave. \n\nThe cave is guarded by an Owlbear.\n\n Whose lair contains several valuable treasures. \nFantasy Pack 1: Table of Contents\nThe complete list of 25 inserts in this Fantasy Pack is as follows:\nDM Aids: Group Tracker\nRules: DnD 5e or Pathfinder 1e\nEnvironments: Arctic, Coastal, Desert, Forest, Grassland/Plains, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underground, Underwater, Urban\nLocations: Cave, Dungeon, Market, Ruins, Tavern, Huts, Homes, Hovels\nDiscovery: Food & Drink, [Mushrooms, Berries, Fruit], Treasures - Tier 1\nPeople: NPC (two parts)\n\n\nVirtual Tabletops\nTWGi Will Be FoundryVTT and Roll20\u00ae Compatible\nWith VTTs surging in popularity and many of us spending all of our RPG time online, it became an obvious choice to officially support them. We are proud to say that The World's Greatest Screen will be produced for Roll20\u00ae and FoundryVTT!\nThese modules will allow you to generate all results from an entire sheet in three clicks or one table at a time with the use of sleek macros and a comprehensible user experience. TWGi on virtual tabletops are very easy to use and understand, so they will always be viable tools for quick adventure generation as seen in the example above!\n\nAll of the items in this Kickstarter are available individually, or in bundles. Bundles tend to have more value than purchasing items individually.\n\nThe World's Greatest Screen - $25\nOur classic screen is the foundation of this project. Its sturdy construction ensures that it will last through years of use. It boasts 4 panels with 8 pockets that hold inserts up to 8.5\" x 11\" in size. It is available in 9 colors and 2 orientations. It works with wet and dry erase markers.\n\nOrientation\nTall/Portrait/Vertical\nAvailable in Silver, Gold, Black, Red, Pink, Blue, Green, Purple, and Orange\nOrientation\nWide/Landscape/Horizontal\nAvailable in Silver, Gold, Black, Red, Pink, Blue, Green, Purple, and Orange\nTWGi Fantasy Pack 1 - $20\nOur flagship product in this line boasts 25 inserts with a fantasy theme. Each insert is double-sided with scenic or fantasy art on one side, and intricate random tables on the other side. These tables can be used to inspire DMs and GMs, to allow them to generate content on the fly, or even to create adventures and side quests with ease.\n\nAvailable for 5th edition or Pathfinder\nAvailable in Portrait or Landscape format\nAvailable and compatible with Roll20\u00ae and FoundryVTT\n BONUS!

An empty Tome of Inserts is known as a Tome of Holding.\n\nFantasy Pack 1 and stretch goals.\n1 page protector for each insert.\n1 3-ring binder to hold and organize your inserts and, if you like, to add a panel to your screen. Note: Binder color may not match your screen color exactly.\nMagnet Power - $10\nTake your screen to the next level with this add-on.

You can now use magnets with that panel.\n\n2 Magnet Receptive Inserts that fit The World's Greatest Screen.\nMagnets will stick to these Inserts through the pockets.\nOne side of the magnet receptive insert is adhesive, so you can create your own custom insert that works with magnets.\nPDF containing Party Trackers that can be printed and used with these inserts.\nMagnet Pack - $10\nComplete your magnet upgrade with this set of tools.

Want free stuff? Please help spread the word about this Kickstarter so we can unlock as many stretch goals as possible. \nART PACKS - Some stretch goals unlock art packs that can be purchased as add-ons. Each art pack contains 4 double-sided pages with a single theme, such as dragons, undead, and furry friends.\n\nENCOUNTER INSERTS - Some stretch goals unlock encounter inserts which are added to the Tome of Inserts for FREE. These special inserts offer a series of tables to use when encountering iconic monsters. These tables might create a unique lair for the creature, allow the GM to create a new version of it, or even control its behavior.\nFor example \"Encounter an Owlbear\" contains tables and information that allow you to\nGenerate the creature's lair and treasures within it. \nReward players that successfully harvest the creature's body. \nGenerate a new kind of owlbear such as a giant owlbear, a winged owlbear, or an alternate creature like a ravenbear.\nPit the group against a skeleton or zombie version of an owlbear.\nUse the \"Fighting\" table to keep players on their toes. Each roll makes the owlbear do something interesting in combat, keeping the fight exciting and fresh even for players who have been fighting owlbears for years! This feature is a MUST HAVE for brand new DMs and crusty veterans alike. \nFunded! - $100\nWe need very little in order to fund this project, just a handful of customers willing to give it a try!\nStretch Goal 1 - $500\nEncounter Goblin/Encounter Owlbear Insert added for free to TWGi Set 1 - Fantasy Pack.\nFurry Friends Art Packs unlocked.\nFurry Friends Art Pack 1\n\nFurry Friends Art Pack 2\n\n\nStretch Goal 2 - $2000\nEncounter Insects/Encounter Sahuagin Insert added for free to TWGi Set 1 - Fantasy Pack.\nFantastic Fairies Art Pack unlocked.\nStretch Goal 3 - $4000\nEncounter Chimera/Encounter Wizard Insert added for free to TWGi Set 1 - Fantasy Pack.\nUnearthed Undead Art Pack unlocked.\nStretch Goal 4 - $6000\nEncounter Ooze/Encounter Ghost Insert added for free to TWGi Set 1 - Fantasy Pack.\nDragons of Doom Art Pack unlocked.\nStretch Goal 5 - $8000\nEncounter Dragon/Encounter Demon Insert added for free to TWGi Set 1 - Fantasy Pack.\nWorlds Beyond Art Pack unlocked.\nFurther Stretch Goals - $TBD\nIf these stretch goals get knocked down early, we'll add some more stretch goals to keep things interesting. Check the top of the Kickstarter for our FREE x-mas themed inserts you unlocked so far!\n\n\n\nAt Hammerdog Games we believe that DMs and GMs should have the best tools at their fingertips. Every product we make echoes our core design philosophies by being customizable, reusable, and affordable. We are extremely proud to bring this Kickstarter to you, as it is a shining example of our beliefs.\nWe had meant to bring this Kickstarter to you earlier this year, but like so many other businesses, we were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now as the year comes to a close, we hope this Kickstarter will add some much needed lifeblood to our company, so that we can make even cooler stuff for you in the future. \nHammerdog Games is a virtual company with no employees. We do however, have a couple of mutts that work very hard to bring solid products to customers just like you.\n\n\n\n\nCaring for The World's Greatest Screen\nThe  World\u2019s Greatest Screen was constructed to be durable, and sturdy, and to last for years. Still, it is not invulnerable. Here are some tips for keeping it usable for a long time to come.\nPRINT YOUR OWN INSERTS ON CARDSTOCK\nCardstock makes it easier to put inserts into pockets and to remove them again.\nAVOID EXCESSIVE HEAT\nThe World\u2019s Greatest Screen is a vinyl product. Excessive heat can make the pockets loose. It can also cause some toners and ink to stick to the inside of the pocket, which will mar its appearance.\nAVOID EXCESSIVE COLD\nBeing made of vinyl, The World\u2019s Greatest Screen can crack and split if it freezes.\nAVOID EXCESSIVE WEIGHT\nDon\u2019t store your screen at the bottom of a stack of books. The pressure can  cause some inks and toners to stick to the inside of the pockets.\nAVOID DARK MAGIC\nAlthough it is considered unwise to expose The World's Greatest Screen to magic of any variety, dark magic is especially hazardous. Not because it harms the screen, but because The World's Greatest Screen kind of likes it.\nWASH IT IF NEEDED\nIf your screen gets dirty, you can clean it with wet wipes or with a cool soap and water. Make sure you don\u2019t use anything that could scratch the screen.\nDO NOT FEED IT AFTER MIDNIGHT\nThe World\u2019s Greatest Screen is happy to pull an all-nighter any time. But if you feed it after midnight we can\u2019t be held responsible for what happens next.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done our best to mitigate the risks in this project. The World's Greatest Screen is already fully designed. The inserts are ready to be printed, we just need to know how many of which to print. We have some small concerns with the virtual tabletop inserts simply because they are time consuming and may take a bit longer to construct than hoped. And we have another small concern that if the Kickstarter blows up, we may be a bit slower to fulfill it than we'd hoped. But otherwise we believe we've done what we can to ensure that this Kickstarter runs very smoothly for you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe World's Greatest Screen is made of strong cardstock and virgin vinyl for years of use. We have had dozens of customers tell us that their screen has lasted them 10 years or more. The inserts will be usable as long as their RPGs are relevant which historically, has proven to be decades.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe #1 feature of The World's Greatest Screen is its reusability. Owners can utilize it in countless configurations and for any RPG in the world. The inserts are designed to be used over and over in endless game sessions, configuring and reconfiguring them to suit each particular game or session. For some people it will be the last screen they ever own.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Screen A La Carte", "descp": "You already own a screen.

To add additional sets, see the instructions under the heading 'Add-ons' near the bottom of this page. \n We created the CC Club Deck Project specifically for passionate card magicians, collectors, sleight-of-hand experts, and Cardists\u2014and everyone who dreams of making miracles with cards.\nWhen you back this project, you will receive:\nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nThe CC CLUB DECK - Timeless Design, Casino Quality Crushed Bee Stock\u2014printed on the USPCC Web Press for expert handling that shufflers, passers, and palmers demand! \nBuilt by experts Aaron Fisher, Adam Grace & Lee Asher to delight passionate and demanding card workers. The CC Club Deck features a rare Antique Back Design, 2 Unique Matching Jokers, an elegant Ace of Spades, the Bicycle Blue Seal. And all that is just the beginning... \nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nI call the solution my Daily Carry Custom Configuration\u2014and I'm sharing it for the first time. You'll find it in every box of CC Club Deck Cards.\nEach deck comes with two additional, unassuming 'gaffed' cards that can actually be removed from a new deck by your spectator without causing any suspicion. These two cards combine to form my Daily Carry Custom Configuration. This versatile combination allows you to perform 10+ miracle routines right out of the box. \nNOTE: You'll get step-by-step instruction on ALL the miracles that follow\u2014and MANY more\u2014during our Out of the Box Experience Live Events. Scroll down for more info! \nThe Daily Carry Custom Configuration lets you open your box of cards and move directly into any one of four different performance modes, so you're always ready for ANY situation. \nFirst, there's the classic Natural Mode\u2014with two duplicate jokers and your CC Club Deck. During the Out of the Box Experience Live Events (more info on that below), you\u2019ll discover a wealth of miracles you can perform without using ANY gaffs. \n Opener Mode:  Choose to wow your audience with your favorite version of the Chicago Opener style routine. This celebrated miracle has been widely considered to be the most engaging close-up 'Opener' by professional close-up card magicians for over 50 years!  \nDuring the Out of the Box Experience Live Events, you'll discover multiple routines, so no matter your experience level, you'll get the perfect method for YOU. You'll discover Aaron's favorite methods for people just starting out in card magic, and exciting 'upgrades' that will fool and excite long-time card workers.\n NOTE: Our Special Guests will also share their favorite secret methods and opening effects\u2014and many secrets will be revealed for the first time anywhere! \nMental Mode:  Imagine the perfect Brainwave Effect that looks and feels like real mind-reading.  Start with a sealed deck if you wish. Or perform ANYTIME\u2014and always end clean.\nWe call this the 'Thunderbolt' because it can close ANY show\u2014even if you only perform ONE TRICK. And of course, you don't need to stop there. Your CC Club Deck can be examined\u2014and you can continue to amaze!  See it now in this video:\nVisual/Formal Close-up Mode: With the entire configuration in play, you can perform an entire 'close-up show' featuring 4 ultra-visual technicolor miracles. Your audience won't believe their eyes, and you can even pass out the deck before you continue the show. See for yourself in the video below: \nBONUS ROUTINES: You'll also discover 3 complete color changing deck routines you can perform using just one CC Club Deck.  Two of the routines are super easy-to-do\u2014and all are designed to be used as 'openers'. Start with a blue deck. Change its color\u2014and continue to amazing with a 'clean' red deck! \nCHALLENGES & IMPOSSIBLE CLOSERS: The impossible revelation of ANY thought of card is one of the strongest effects in all of card magic. It's the perfect way to answer a challenge, and it's strong enough to be a 'closer' for any show packed with powerhouse card magic. Your CC Club Deck and the Daily Carry Custom Configuration make it easy to answer the challenge and perform the impossible. \nAND MUCH MUCH MORE: And still, that's just the beginning. In the video below, you'll see just one of the Bonus Routines you'll discover in our Live Events. This one is called, Blushing Jokers, by the talented card creator J.K. Hartman:\nAt our Out of the Box Experience Live Events, we'll reveal our favorite methods for every situation, so you can ALWAYS do the impossible...ON DEMAND.\n***IMPORTANT:  \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0fLIVE TICKETS for Out of the Box Are Still Available.

We wanted to create the ultimate deck for card workers. That's why we spared no expense, and printed on the legendary USPCC WEB PRESS, using a custom formulation of Premium-Casino Crushed Bee Stock, a traditional cut and an air-cushion finish. \nWHAT DOES USING THE BEST PRESS & CASINO CRUSHED BEE STOCK MEAN TO YOU? \nSimply put, there are no words to describe how well these cards handle. These cards shuffle like a dream. The CC Club Deck is light and airy, with a density that makes the cards rest comfortably\u2014but spring quickly into passes, palms and double-lifts. And for card workers, here's the best news of all: no matter that you put these cards through in training or performance, they snap back into shape time and time again.\nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n\n THE DESIGN: Backs, Faces, Aces & Joker  \nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n The Faces \nOur goal at all times was to great a distinctive deck that promotes  Powerful Card Magic above all else. With the exception of the Ace of Spades and Jokers, we chose to emphasize clarity and contrast. Classic faces ensure your audience can experience every moment of your magic in high definition\u2014like watching card magic in a 'lossless' format.\n The Backs\nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nFrom Aaron Fisher, on discovering the 1907 USPCC 808 Model II Back Design:\nRecently, Lee Asher showed Adam Grace and I a full collection of USPCC 808 back designs, We realized that apart from two or three designs, we'd never even seen most of them.  That made us feel like kids again\u2014and it was a GOOD feeling. \nWe had been looking for a distinctive, elegant design that would highlight great magic.  When we saw the rare 808 Model II Back Design from 1907, we knew in an instant we'd found 'the one'. We said, \"This is it. This design deserves to be SEEN. People who like cards will LOVE this design.  \n\n Note for Collectors: When the United States Playing Card Company was purchased by Cartamundi, the company stopped granting licenses for their classic artwork. Even so, the CC Club Deck was printed by USPCC with full permission to use USPCC back designs, the Ace of Spades, the Joker, and the Box for our CC Club Deck.\nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n THE JOKERS \nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nThis incredible image was first published by the United States Playing Card Company in 1894\u2014where it commemorated the playing card competition at the 1878 Worlds Fair Exhibition. This was a landmark event in the history of playing card history. \nThe image of the king riding the bicycle, and the book on which it appeared, has been the envy of antique card collectors everywhere. Best of all, the graphic has NEVER been used as an actual 'Joker' before now. \n ACE OF SPADES \nPhoto by Kier Gomes\nOur elegant Ace of Spades features a stalk of wheat and comes from a rare Whist design produced by USPCC in the 1920s. This timeless choice emphasizes the organic nature of living communities\u2014like the communities you find on Kickstarter and CC Club. \nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nPhoto by Paul Richardson\nSTRANGER JOKER & RED/BLUE DOUBLE BACKER:\nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nOur 2020 CC Club Deck was designed from the start with the exacting specifications of expert card magicians in mind.\nOpen a fresh deck and perform any one of 10+ miracles immediately Out of the Box \nThe Daily Cary Custom Configuration (Bottom) Red-Backed Joker with a Blue-Backed Matching Joker Beneath it. \nThe Daily Cary Custom Configuration (Top) Red-Backed Joker with a Red/Blue Double Backer above it, blue side down.   \nThis is the Daily Carry Custom Configuration, and as you'll see in the Out of the Box Experience Live Events\u2014it puts a world of miracles at your fingertips. \nPhoto by Paul Richardson\n SUPER SUBTLE ONE-WAY BACK DESIGN: \nPhoto by Amanda Grace\nYes, if you look close you can see this subtle feature built right into the back design.\nMagicians know why a very subtle one-way design will allow you to adapt the hundreds of effects that have been published on the one-way principle.

This is our first Kickstarter card project. However, we\u2019ve released many other magic-related projects before\u2014including premium Live Online Events\u2014and we have a solid reputation for delivering great results and customer service.\n\n2. We have a proven track record in regards to production, fulfillment, live online events\u2014and customer support issues in real-time.\n\n3. This project is proceeding on schedule. The most delicate part of the project (the deck itself) has already been completed.\n\n4. We have the experience, staff, and resources to go above and beyond for our backers.\n\n5. Finally, we foresee no issue that could prevent us from delivering this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur CC Club Deck is printed on the highest grade, most durable card stock available. 'Bee' card stock yields the longest-lasting playing cards available. We wanted cards that stay in good working order for much longer than other decks.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe United States Playing Card Company doesn't send waste to a landfill. The waste product of the card production process is shredded baled and recycled to become tissue or toilet paper.\nSustainable materials\nOut of the many kinds of playing cards on Kickstarter, the large majority are printed on thin paper stock. Central to the core mission of the CC Club Deck is the idea that the most durable, Casino Grade cards last the longest. That's why we pay a large premium to use the most durable card stock available.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe chose the United States Playing Card Company, in part because it's twice been recognized by the state of Kentucky for energy conservation and recycling efforts in an otherwise wasteful industry.\nSustainable Distribution\nYears ago, we made a decision to get rid of print and printed media for all our training materials. The CC Club Deck Project involves 15-20 hours of instruction, all of which will be created, stored, and delivered digitally. We do not print so much as a single DVD to deliver our products.\nSomething else\nConjuror Community has been engaged in sustainable meeting practices and green initiatives long before COVID. Our members recycle, not only in their personal lives, but we conscientiously share and recycle our magic materials as a matter of pride and a belief in sustainable meeting practices for the future. For 5 years, our online meetings have conserved every kind of energy, and we find that our online meetings are MORE satisfying than the magic meetings we used to pursue using planes, trains, and automobiles.

The instructions see below.\nThis will be one of the best T-shirts that incorporates a magic effect you have ever seen.\nReally cool and very easy to do.\n'The Card Pickers'\nPLAY\n\nRemember the feeling you had when you first picked up your playing cards off the floor?\nWhen I first saw \u2018The Card Pickers\u2019, I recalled the above experience, which brought back awkward memories. Then, as I snapped back to the present, I came to appreciate the art of combining a classical oil painting with modern trends. I saw that the people who were picking up the ears of wheat in the painting were gathering the familiar-looking Bicycle Playing Cards. A perfect blend of history and fantasy.\nExcept its deep meaning. Believe me, this will be one of the best T-shirts that incorporates a magic effect you have ever seen(really cool and very easy to do).\nMost things done by a magician will somehow be tied to a magic effect. You could say that it is a tradition ingrained in us. A \u2018beginner's mind\u2019, if you will (i.e. having an attitude of openness when studying a subject just as a beginner in that subject would).\nThe basic effect that can be performed with \u2018The Card Pickers\u2019 is: A card selected and remembered by an audience member. You point to a face-down card in the painting on your t-shirt and tell the audience member that this is the card they are thinking of.\nYou then remove the card from the painting for the audience member to confirm that it is indeed they card they were thinking of. After that, you return the card back into the painting, face-up! The audience can then confirm that the card is indeed back in the painting.\nThe effect had a similar feel to the \u2018hamburger from signboard\" and \u2018Rubik\u2019s cube from shirt\u2019 effects. No difficult sleight of hand is required. It is clean, and the audience can examine it at the end.\nFurthermore, there is more than one face-up card in the painting. So, you can have more variety when performing your routine.\nWith the \u2018The Card Pickers\u2019 You will receive 112 stickers, which include 56 Seven of Clubs, 52 a full deck of 52 playing cards, and 4 \u2018The card you are thinking of\u2019\u2019 cards. Each sticker can be used at least twice, resulting in over 200 performances. Refills can be purchased separately.\nYou can still feel the ingenuity of the makers ingrained into the fabric, the hot stamping process, the sewing process, and even the packaging.\nTo summarize the materials used and workmanship:\n- 210g heavy cotton fabric.\n- Seamless barrel stitching. Pressure creased shoulders.\n- Thermosetting ink printing technology gives a sense of realism.\nWe offer 6 sizes, and the below is the information.\nIf you need the size to be bigger, please contact us.\nFor this special Kickstarter campaign, you just need to add-on HK$229 (US$ 28.90) to your existing pledge.\nOnce the campaign has ended on 24 September 2020, we will send a reward survey to you and you can tell us what you have added on, as well as the size and shipping address details.\n [Reminder: If you already backed this project.

The instructions see Update #3]\nToday we want to show you the first one,  it's pure visual effects that break the boundary between reality and fantasy.\nWe call it 'The Moon' .\n'The Moon' by Kiyoshi Satoh\uff08\u4f50\u85e4\u559c\u7fa9\uff09\nWhen the boundary is not so clear, when you can't distinguish the reality from fantasy. Inside and outside the mirror, it's the same world.\nIf you can't tell, does it matter?\n\u2014\u2014 Westworld\nReality is fantasy. Fantasy is reality.\nThe legend that is Paul Harris and Tayari Casel published a set of lecture notes in 1979, and in it was fantastic coin routine called \u2018Twilight\u2019.  \nThis is the introduction\uff1a  \n\u300cTwilight is an unparalleled close-up discovery that transports an innocent half dollar into the twilight zone of its own mirrored reflection. While in this dimension the coin is visibly condensed, dematerialized, recreated, and reproduced-building to the spectacular \"Twilight\" finale in which the mirror's reflected images are instantly transformed into four genuine half dollars!  Twilight is a close-up masterpiece that destroys an audience's ability to distinguish between illusion and reality. It is unlike any coin effect you've ever seen, read or heard about. Twilight is as close to real magic as you'll ever get! \u300d  \nFewer and fewer people know of this lecture notes 40 years later. It has gradually become the treasure of a few select coin magic lovers. However, as long as you have seen it, you will surely agree with the high praise this routine has garnered.  \nIt seems to be as close to what real magic would look like.  \nDuring the past 40 years, Twilight has also evolved through many versions, and just a few months ago, we were fortunate to have encountered the version that is by far the cleanest and most poetic\u2014\u2019The Moon\u2019.     \nThe Japanese underground magician, Kiyoshi Satoh\uff08\u4f50\u85e4\u559c\u7fa9) is now well known amongst China\u2019s magic enthusiasts. We have just published his card magic book \u2018No Man Land\u2019 recently, so that our Chinese friends can appreciate the beauty of Mr. Satoh's packet tricks.  \u2018The Moon\u2019 is a lesser-known treasured routine of Mr. Satoh. It is a new interpretation of \u2018Twilight\u2019. Based on the original effect, Mr. Satoh changed the handling of the whole routine that even makes you totally unaware of the existence of any sleights, and have perfected the entire illusion.  \nA mirror, a coin, a fantasy journey.  \nThe mirror in the routine needs careful handwork that was described in the original lecture notes. To allow everyone use it immediately, we have already made this special mirror in advance and finished the edges to achieve the best feeling. \nWhen you are performing \u2019The Moon\u2019, you are not only performing this effect, but also the 40-year evolution history of \u2018Twilight\u2019. So, we made a high-grade soft leather bag for the mirror, which is easy to carry and adds a sense of ritual to the routine.  \nAn expanded shell and a soft performance surface will be used in the routine. Considering that most of people already have an expanded shell, we have decided NOT to include an expanded shell.  \nYou can learn this legendary effect right out of the box.      \nNo difficult sleights.  \nPure visual effects that break the boundary between reality and fantasy.\nDetailed online instruction.  \nEach gimmick mirror is handmade and fully polished. The surrounding edges are smooth and neat, which provides protection allows for smooth sleights.  \nIngenious gimmick design makes your magic more fantastic.  \nWith the included soft leather case, it is easy to carry, making the routine more ritual, and can fully protect the props and extend its service life.  \nWith the microfiber mirror cloth, you can clean the mirror anytime and anywhere.  \nContents: A special handmade gimmick mirror + cleaning cloth + soft leather carrying case. [Coins and Expanded Shell are NOT included]  \n'The Moon' will retail for HK$ 349 (US$ 45), but for this special Kickstarter campaign, you just need to add-on HK$229 (US$ 28.90) . [Reminder: If you already backed this project. Please DO NOT select this reward. Or you will lose your current reward. You can add on to your current reward. The instructions see Update #3]\nP/S: You will also need a soft performance surface for this routine. We recommend the leather close-up pads by TCC Presents.   \nAll the best & Stay Safe \nTCC TEAM\n\nToday we present to you three AMAZING magic products.\nThe first one is a levitation device.\nWe wanted to create a really good levitation system, that is easy for you to carry around.\nThat is why it took us three whole years on and off to complete the very first prototype. It took a further six months of constant refinement and research, and three changes in form factor, to make it more compact and more practical. The result is what we now call the Unseen Force.\nUnseen Force is essentially a levitation gimmick.  We believe the soul of this levitation gimmick lies is where it is \u201chidden\u201d, once the audience suspects the existence of a thread during the performance, the magical atmosphere is gone, no matter how good the performance is.\nWe think we have done it.\nWe are proud to present to you, Unseen Force: A brand new way of levitation.\nIt's 100% mechanical\u2026This means no battery is needed for fear of it dying on you.\nIf you want to move and levitate small objects seemingly by just the power of your mind.\nIf you want Possess the ability of telekinesis and perform amazing levitations, animations, and balance effects.\nUnseen Force is for you, all your need is only your presentation.\n Video Frist:\nPLAY\n\n\n Hook up system \nUnseen Force has a new concept and system we have been developing for the last sixth months, with this system you can do many powerful effects with borrowed objects (Playing Cards / Rings / Cigarettes / Bills...et)\nThe all-new unique hook-up system and position greatly minimize the possibility of the IT getting caught on other objects on your body.\nSet up is easy. Once it is set up, the gimmick stays inconspicuous, secure, and out of the way when not in use. Providing peace of mind as you are able to go about your day normally (except when undressing, for obvious reasons).\nNevertheless, you are ready to perform at any moment.\nThe position of the hook up allows you to obtain the gimmick in an easy manner and using a completely natural action. It is highly versatile and adaptable, allowing for flexibility when performing.\nClothing & Management\nPerforming with a jacket may not be practical in most situations, especially in summer, or in hot and humid environments.\nUnseen Force allows you to perform in a short-sleeved Polo T-shirt, even without a jacket.\nYou would be able to perform in the majority of conditions; whether strolling, close-up, parlor, or even on social occasions.\nIt takes up no pocket space, and it has no plastic clips that could break or come loose.\nOnce it is set up, the gimmick is highly concealed in addition to being secure, stable, and reliable.\nHand-built\nThe gimmick is easy to operate. And you do not need any batteries.\nEach one is hand-assembled, to ensure the highest quality.\nTutorial\nIt doesn't matter if you are a beginner or have no prior experience with thread work. Unseen Force comes with a 1 hour-long expertly-shot tutorial video that clearly explains the concepts and effects.\nWith some practice and familiarization, you will be performing miracles in no time.\nThree years of research and design. and six months of hard work and refinement of the routines, resulting in a brand new way of levitation.  \n A set of systems that provides an almost threadless feeling as well as a high degree of freedom.  \nThe unique winding method makes the movement more efficient, which means a movement of 1 cm of your hands can dispense 3-5 cm of IT.\nApart from being able to accomplish a wide range of classic IT effects, the main emphasis of Unseen Force is the robustness of its applications,.\nThinking outside the box, and breaking away from the traditional IT effects, as you can see from the promotional trailer. This is very cool.\nExtremely fast set-up\nAlthough it can be safely worn on your body at all times, if you don't want to wear it all day, you can easily set it up just 5 seconds before your performance\nMost IT workers like yourself would be the most concerned about the IT itself.\nThe default IT that comes with Unseen Force is one of the best in terms of strength among ITs of the same thickness. It allows you to easily accomplish the effects shown in the promotional video.\nHowever, if you prefer ITs of other brands, the tutorial includes instructions to replace the ITs.\nUnseen Force is totally different from other thread systems. \nThe all-new way to carry and hook-up not only allows you to accomplish most other IT effects but also new innovative effects unique to Unseen Force.\nA new concept, and new effects\nInfinite possibilities\nStable to carry & extremely concealed\nPerform in any conditions, anywhere\nExpansibility & easy to operate\nBrand new levitation effects\nSuperior quality & handmade\nDetailed video instructions.\nSponge Ball Magic is a modern classic that exists in most magician\u2019s repertoire.\nIf you have ever performed Sponge ball magic, you know that it never fails to bring joy and astonishment to audiences no matter young or old.\nMaybe you have been performing sponge ball magic the same classic way as everyone else.\nThere is no doubt that there are countless masters of sponge ball magic that have come before us.\nThis time, we want to show you something special with Sponge Balls.\nIt is 2 Products, the first is what we call Sponge System. They are brand new concepts and techniques for Sponge Balls.\nThe other, we call Pure Cup. It's a clear cup with Sponge Balls.\nVideo First,\nThis is the Sponge System:\nPLAY\n\nAnd this is Pure Cup:\nPLAY\n\nThis is the creativity of the TCC team, and this is the story from the Creator,  --- Wicky.\nThe following is written in his own words\uff1a\nAll the effects presented in the promotional trailer you see originated from competitions. I participated in magic competitions in various places.\nAt the time, playing cards and coins were all the rage. Almost 80% of the competitors used playing cards and coins as their main props. From then on, I pondered about what uncommon items that I could use as a theme to create my own competition act.\nAfter trying out many themes and not finding anything suitable, I continued pondering and searching.\nBy a coincidence, I performed a sponge heart routine to an audience member during one of my performances (This effect should be familiar to many magicians, and is one of the earlier magic effects that a beginner magician would have come in contact with. So much so that I almost forgot it).\nWhen the audience opened their hands and the two sponge hearts appeared in the hands of the audience member, I saw an exaggeratedly astonished expression on the audience member\u2019s face. I thought that that moment was real MAGIC!\nFrom that moment on, I began to wonder, would it be more creative to enter a competition with sponge ball magic?\nFrom that moment on, I officially formed an indissoluble bond with Sponge Balls.\nI started to focus on absorbing all the knowledge related to sponge ball magic that I could find. I watched every magic video relating to sponge ball magic.\nHowever, deep down I thought is that most of the performances were more or less the same, once you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. The techniques for sponge ball magic itself were not difficult and not many. I felt that I would do a different kind of sponge ball magic, hence I started to create my own sponge ball magic.\nI continued to explore and refine, from the most basic techniques to advanced techniques. Every move is the result of continuous polishing, practice, and actual performances. From the selection of sponge balls. (different sleights actually require sponge balls of different materials), to whether you will be standing or sitting during your final performance (when performing sponge balls at different heights, your posture when holding the sponge balls is actually completely different). I meticulously crafted every detail and strived to create good sponge ball magic.\nAs I continued to improve my sponge ball magic, I finally created a competition act with sponge balls as the theme. I am honored to have won several awards with this act when I was still a student. However, what makes me happier is that today, I finally made it into a tutorial video to share it with you here. (the techniques taught in the video are all extracted from my competition act, I hope you will like it)\nAs for Pure Cup, my performance of the Sponge System was already quite mature at the time, but I wondered if I needed to add more elements to it. Thus, I sent out to do so. I initially added a bowl, which was the commonly seen bowl and balls routine. Later, I felt that it was not good enough, and added cups. At first, there were three cups, but the routine as a whole looks too much like the classic cups and balls, the only difference was that I used a sponge ball. I then got rid of two cups, only one cup was used. Then, I wondered, what if the cup was transparent?\nWould it be more magical if the same effects can be achieved using a transparent cup? I could no longer restrain my brain, and I started to imagine various scenarios. It was not smooth flowing at first as I had nothing to refer to and only relied on my own trial and error. Initially, I did not know what type of cup was the most suitable, but I persevered. I tried different materials, created logical techniques, step by step, and finally completed this Pure Cup routine. As mentioned above, what makes me even happier is that this was also made into a tutorial video to be shared with you.\nP.S: It has been four years since I wrote the above article. Much of the details have been blurred in my memories. Originally, this should have been a work published four years ago, but it was only published today. There were various reasons. Perhaps I failed to convey the story behind this to you, nevertheless, you will see it again one day back in the field, and then, I will have a better story to tell you.\nThere are no gimmicks. \nEverything you see in the trailer is performed using pure sleight of hand. \nAll moves and techniques are modular and can be easily assimilated into your existing sponge routines.\nTCC Presents Sponge System\uff1a\nEight (8) techniques + one (1) bonus\nInnovative and visual moves\nPure sleight of hand, no gimmicks\nIncludes Two (2) Red and Two (2) Green Goshman Sponge balls\nAcrylic sponge ball case\n\nPure Cup by TCC Presents comes with an entirely translucent cup, made from resin.

When you get to hold this deck in your hands, you will definitely love it! Next, let\u2019s focus on the revolutionary structure of the card box\nThe demo of the opening and closing process ( Wine Red )\nThe card box structure:\nThis is a brand-new, unprecedented card box structure. It took us half a year from conception to production.  After dozens of experiments, we are proud to present you with the final version.\nAt the same time, we also think deeply about what kind of special card box structure can be considered as a fine card box structure? It needs to have the following two features\uff1aOrnamental & Enjoyment\n Ornamental:\nWe have designed the card box as a little mechanical masterpiece. When you open the card box, you will be shocked by the visual impact of this structure and experience a sheer thing of beauty. The entire process of opening the card box has a ceremonial feeling to it.\nThe demo of the opening and closing process ( Deep Green )\n Enjoyment:\nWe felt the box should not only be ornamental but also provide a unique moment of playfulness and joy.\nIn order to achieve our goal, we have done hundreds of experiments, repeatedly adjusted the mechanism of opening and closing. We have also tried out dozens of different papers and created numerous prototypes, the entire process having taken us over six months. Finally, we found the perfect solution: The folding part will rotate 180 degrees and pop up when the front of the box is lifted. The whole process is of great sophisticated elegance, and a lot of fun to operate\nBelieve us, when you get the real deck, you will love to open and close the card box over and over again. The process will be fun and enjoyable.\nThe demo of the opening and closing process ( Indigo )\nMade of 300 gsm high-end art paper board, colored with ancient methods\nAll sets contain 3 Color: Wine Red/Indigo Blue/Dark Green, low profile but luxurious\nHigh-Precision Copper Foil and Embossing.

In the process of design exploration, we are inspired by the auto sunroof of sports cars. The goal we want to achieve is designing an extremely cool structure suitable for the card box. Finally, we did it\uff01\nThe process of opening the package and taking out the deck feels so cool and special.\nThe inspiration comes from the auto sunroof of sports cars.\nThe demo of the black gold box set\nThe Upper GIF shows the box of the Black Gold Collection Set.

Starting with this Kickstarter, and continuing with future campaigns, locations in this setting will be brought to life as richly detailed 3D printable models, and an accompanying pdf will feature information on each location as it is released, including designer notes and development history over the years. This Kickstarter will feature locations such as the village of Dragonshire, excursions into the depths of Shadowgrove, unholy shrines deep within Vallis Mortis, the wight infested barrows of Barrowdeep, and much more! \nDRAGONLOCK\u2122 is an interlocking terrain system that allows you to create fully modular, multi-level 28mm scale village terrain for your RPG or wargame on your home 3D printer. Each set is delivered in a downloadable .stl format via our online distribution partner DriveThruRPG.com, and once you have the set, you can print as many pieces as you like and never run out or need to purchase more. These terrain sets represent the culmination of over fifteen years of gaming terrain design experience.\n PLEASE NOTE:\n All models optimized for printing on FDM 3D printers and do not require slicer  supports.  \nA starter 3D printer begins around $220 (see F.A.Q.)\n Each pledge level includes all previous pledge levels (each individual level delivers per its stated delivery date.) \nEach set delivers as a downloadable .stl file via DrivethruRPG.\n The optional Add-On sets shown below can be added to any pledge level by adding the appropriate amount to your core pledge. When the campaign ends, you will get a survey where you will select which add on sets you pledged for. \nWe do not use an after-campaign pledge manager. All pledges must be in by the end of the campaign. \n\nAll models shown below were printed on Creality Ender 3 and Ender 5 3D-printers. \nPreview of the upcoming Baba Yaga reward which is an EXCLUSIVE for campaign backers!\nLED illuminated Dracolich stretch reward\n\nBonus 3D-printable airbrush stencils for the timber frame buildings included!\n\n\nVALLIS MORTIS is Tom Tullis' home campaign world that players have explored (sometimes even surviving!) for over thirty years. For the first time ever, behind-the-scenes info for this fantasy campaign setting is being made public. As Vallis Mortis terrain sets are released, information about those locations and inhabitants will be added to the Vallis Mortis information pdf. Future Vallis Mortis Kickstarters will grow the terrain offerings for this setting, and the setting pdf will grow as well, expanding with each new Kickstarter campaign.

One or two poorly selling sets could hurt our company severely. By putting potential projects up on Kickstarter, we can be sure if there is demand for that subject before devoting our resources to it. We also get to connect directly with our customers, rewarding those who are early supporters for a set with cool stuff like exclusive pieces not available to customers who purchase the set later on, and free stretch rewards. We have been in the print-and-play terrain business for over 15 years, having released more than 200 terrain sets, and have had ten previous Kickstarter campaigns successfully funded and delivered so supporters of this project can feel completely confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality product as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur clip system was specifically designed to put all stress and wear on the tiny clip itself, not the terrain piece, so the terrain models will last an incredibly long time after years of use with no degradation of the clip port that would result in loosening of the fit.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe PLA plastic the end user will utilize to create these models at home can be broken down in an industrial composter as it is a bioplastic made from plants.\nSustainable materials\nWe only recommend the use of renewable bioplastics in the 3D printing process like PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) which is made from corn or sugar cane plants (thus not using oil like other plastics) and is a renewable resource.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nSince our product is produced by the consumer at home on a 3D printer, there is no factory required for the creation of these models. This eliminates the extensive amount of fossil fuels normally utilized in the mass production of products like this such as steel mold creation (large carbon footprint in the manufacturing of the steel) and the oil used in the injection molding process, plus shipping of final product is eliminated as well saving fuel and eliminating the carbon emissions of both container ships and land-based shipping trucks.\nSustainable Distribution\nFulfillment is digital, thus eliminating all carbon footprints related to the trans-oceanic and over-land shipment associated with physical products.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "DRAGONSHIRE STREETS", "descp": "This pledge features 26 street and sidewalk tiles delivered as a downloadable .stl file.

In the past few years, magicians all over the world have made various changes to its effect, size, quantity and even name, and we have seen many versions of the four links. In any case, they all reflect the fundamental charm of Linking Rings.\nAs a Chinese professional magician, and a team that hopes to create value, we have also producedour own Close-up four ring set 2 years ago, to express our respect and tribute.\nMaybe you have seen this pictures before, For those who understand, it explains what is detail and persistence:\nAnd now, we have come up with 3 new stunning colors for you.\nThis is the promotional video we shot for our existing rings:\nPLAY\n\nWe are proud to introduce our New Close-up Linking Rings.\n Three brand new colors. Brand new look and feel. \n Four rings are included in each set. \nOuter diameter about 10.5cm (4 inches).\n Each individual ring weighs approximately 48.1g (1.7 ounces). \nThe mouth of key ring has been treated specially. Reduces pinching of the skin.\nA soft black carrying bag is included. (weighs approximately 11.5g)\nBasic instructions included.\n Enter a whole new realm of the Signed Card to Wallet. \nThe wallet has long been regarded as a daily tool for storage of currency. The wallet can be traced back to the Xia and Shang Dynasties in China at its earliest. No matter the country or region, basically everyone has one or more wallets that they prefer. The wallet has undergone thousands of years of changes in design and functionality throughout history. It has been integrated into our daily lives just like our food, clothing, housing and transportation.\nNevertheless, with the development of e-commerce, it seems that the trend of using a wallet is gradually decreasing. As currency becomes digitized, electronic payments can be made on mobile phones. This made the wallet appear less and less common. However, this does not mean that the wallet is obsolete. Rather, this has further drove the development, upgrade and evolution of the traditional wallet. The wallet is now gradually becoming an accessory, a symbol of style.\nIn the field of magic, wallet-based magic props are constantly being upgraded and innovated. From different sizes and colors, to the design and structure. Allowing the magic to be performed more directly or visually. Wallets or card holders are now more tastefully chosen, not only for function, but for design and aesthetics.\nAnd this is our wallet: TCC PRESENTS The Edge Wallet\nThe TCC Edge Wallet will open a whole new realm of the Card to Wallet for you.\nYou do not have to worry about the complicated design structure of the wallet inhibiting the magical workings.\nYou do not have to worry about the design of the wallet is suitable only for magic performances and cannot be used as an everyday wallet.\nYour wallet will look modern and fashionable.\nThe TCC Edge Wallet will let you re-experience the awe of performing the Card to Wallet. It will also get your creative juices flowing as you come up or adapt it with your own Card to Wallet routines.\nSee videos here:\nPLAY\n\n Dimensions: 132mm \u00d7 87mm \u00d7 13mm (\u00b1 2mm) [5.2 x 3.4 x 0.5 inches].\n Weight: 79g (\u00b1 5g) [2.8 ounces].\nColor: Black / Tan.\nConfiguration: One exquisite wallet, a card compartment with window, card compartment.\nIncluded: Five white envelopes and five red envelopes.The size is refined and concise.

Neatly stitched with meticulous workmanship.\nExtremely affordable.\nWe do not, and will never earn any profit from shipping. We try our hardest to minimize the cost of shipping so that we can deliver our products all over the world at the most affordable price.\nHowever, due to Covid-19 and the dimensions and weight of the Luxury Close-Up Bag and Luxury Pad, the shipping may cost $ 17 to $ 23 depending on your location.\nIf you decide to back more than one Luxury Bag or more than one Luxury Pad, shipping would need to be paid for each individual Luxury Close-Up Bag and Luxury Pad, as they would need to be shipped separately.\nDue to the dimensions and weight of the Luxury Close-Up Bag and Luxury Pad, shipping them together would cost exponentially more.\nHowever, we have managed to obtain very good shipping rates for you on the Close-up Linking Rings and Edge Wallet. (For additional sets of the Close-up Linking Rings and Edge Wallets, you do not need to pay for additional shipping as long as they fit in the same package).\nWe've been looking for many international express carriers in China, and this is the best price we can get. \nWe appreciate your understanding.\nPledge for an Add-On all you need to do is:\n(1) Go to the project page and click on the \"Manage Pledge\" button;\n(2) Scroll down until you find the pledge that you have backed;\n(3) Add HK$*** to the amount that you have pledged, including postage and change the amount in the field to this new amount, making sure to erase the original amount first;\n(4) Click on the Next button, and continue as you did the first time you pledged.\nWe will send a reward survey to you and you can tell us what you add on and the color then we can ship to you.\nIf you need any help, feel free to message us through KickStarter or e-mail to contact@tccpresents, we are willing to help.\nWe also prepare a gift for the backers who support our New Project Set and Super Set.\nIt's our Playing Card Frame, and the price on Murphy is $ 6.5. t's an elegant card frame to display and protect your single card.\nIf you have a playing card that means a lot to you, put it in, because it's not only a card you put in, but also the memory and the touching.\nHope you enjoy our gift!\nStarted in 2008 and was founded in 2011, TCC is one of China's most well-known and trusted magic companies.\n\n                 Over the past decade, we have been insisting on selling genuine playing cards and magic products in China, we started a few difficulties in the year when pirates were rampant, but we have always believed that this is the right thing to do.\nToday, more and more Chinese enthusiasts respect and support copyright.\nIn 2016, we established a product development team, and the TCC PRESENTS brand was created to develop high-quality, cost-effective magic products and peripheral accessories.\nHere is our slogan: Extreme quality, extreme price.\n\n                 From material selection, to the materials, to the production processes, TCC PRESENTS focuses on producing the world's best magic products and accessories.

Probably the best and the most cost-effective leather Chop Cup in the world.\n\nFirst, we want to present our promotional video.\\. This may the best Chop cup video you have ever witnessed. A balance of beauty and impact!\nThe video begins with a line from the movie <The Curious Case of Benjamin Button>.\n\u300cOur lives are defined by opportunities, even the ones we miss.\u300d\nYou maybe have been looking for a good leather cup or ball set for years. You also may have missed many opportunities to obtain a quality leather cup or ball set these years, The reason may be that the price is too high, or the quality is too poor, or some other reasons.\nHowever, it is precisely because you did NOT purchase those expensive and average quality Leather Chop Cup that led you here.\nSearch no further, as we have what we believe to be the best Leather Chop Cup on the market, at an unbelievable price.\nWe highly recommend that you click on the video below, you will not be disappointed:\nPLAY\n\nAs a classic and signature effect amongst all magic effects, the Cups and Balls routine has birthed many different versions and handlings throughout the history of Magic, but its core, method, and concept never changed.\nIt includes many types of magic effects in one routine----  Vanishes, Productions, Transpositions, even Transformations. The entire routine is presented on the desktop, thus it looks extremely elegant. To a certain extent, elegance should be an idiosyncrasy all magicians should adopt.\nMost professional magicians have their own version of the Cups and Balls routine and deeply believe that it is the path to becoming a true magician (Michael Ammar's Cups and Balls is genius). Each magician will try to add different seasonings to the routine to create his uniquely tasting dish.\nStudying the Cups and Balls routine can help you understand magic better as a whole.\nThe minimalist form of the Cups and Balls is a single Cup and Ball. And the sharpest weapon available in the single Cups and Ball armory is the Chop Cup (the inventor of the Chop Cup is Al Wheatley, here's a tribute).\nThe core point of the Chop Cup is that, it is very easy to get started. However, at the same time, it does not diminish the magic, rather, some believe it is even more magical - if you do not have much time to practice, it is a great choice.\nThat is why we are here today\u2014\u2014Enter the TCC leather Chop Cup.\nMaterials and textures\nThe TCC Leather Chop Cup is crafted from full-grain leather. The vegetable-tanned leather fully exhibits the retro-style. Each cup develops a unique texture after having been used for a period of time.\nWe have carefully selected the colors. Both the cup and the balls are all handmade. We strive to bring classical beauty with every detail.\nIt is worth mentioning that the balls are specially treated and are tested and matched one by one by the TCC production team.\nThe ideal weight, the perfect magnet, the best experience.\n And also brand new packaging texture. \n100 % handmade leather balls, also great for use with your Cups & Balls.\nOur Leather Chop Cup comes with two balls (1 normal with 1 gimmicked), We understand that many magicians would like to have their own set of leather balls to be used when performing cups and balls.\nSo for this Kickstarter we project, we introduce you to the Leather Balls.\nLike we did on the balls in leather chop cup, to ensure the best touch, each ball is handmade with the full-grain leather, and inspected layer by layer.\nDue to the intricate workmanship, strict quality standard and low output, we only have limited quantity available.\nFour leather balls set\uff083 normal and 1 gimmicked\uff09, can be used in cups and balls routine or as an additional ball to chop cup routine. Extraordinary and stylish. \nUses full-grain leather and sewn by hand\uff0cfit and neat.\nIt weighs about 15g and measures about 26mm (mm)\u22481inch (in)\nSimiliar with our Leather Balls Set.\n100 % Handmade Final Leather Load Ball. The perfect ending for Leather Chop Cup.\nIt comes with one 5.7cm (~2,25 inch) baseball and one flannel bag.  Exquisitely made, extraordinary and stylish.\n`\nWe offer basic instruction for all Leather Chop Cup, that's free and you can understand and learn Chop Cup quickly. \nIf you want to learn the routine in our promotional video, we also offer a reward for you at a cost of about $50(Including a set of Leather Chop Cup).\nWe also put tremendous effort and time into our video. There are many new moves which look pretty convincing and surprising. This is our new routine in combination with our amazing Chop Cup.\nWe love the routine. If you want to learn every detail of the routine in our video, this is for you.\nThis will only be on Kickstarter (no longer available after the funding), as we also do not want too many people to know the secrets inside. ^ ^\n Pledge for an Add-On all you need to do is: \n(1) Go to the project page and click on the \"Manage Pledge\" button;\n(2) Scroll down until you find the pledge that you have backed;\n(3) Add HK$*** to the amount that you have pledged, including postage and change the amount in the field to this new amount, making sure to erase the original amount first;\n(4) Click on the Next button, and continue as you did the first time you pledged.\nWe will send a reward survey to you and you can tell us what you add on and the color then we can ship to you.\nStarted in 2008 and was founded in 2011, TCC is one of China's most well-known and trusted magic companies.\n\n    Over the past decade, we have been insisting on selling genuine playing cards and magic products in China, we started a few difficulties in the year when pirates were rampant, but we have always believed that this is the right thing to do.\nToday, more and more Chinese enthusiasts respect and support copyright.\nIn 2016, we established a product development team, and the TCC PRESENTS brand was created to develop high-quality, cost-effective magic products and peripheral accessories.\nHere is our slogan: Extreme quality, extreme price.\n\n  From material selection, to the materials, to the production processes, TCC PRESENTS focuses on producing the world's best magic products and accessories. We strive to reduce costs as much as possible, while at the same time ensuring good enough quality. The price is always unbelievable.\n\n  In the past few years, in the Chinese market, all of our actions have been based on this value, and all our achievements have come from here. This is also what we see as the best reward for the trust of the users who support us.\n\nWe have always believed that the pursuit of one-time profits, the pursuit of the product itself experience more promising;\n\n    It's also our team's dream and we work very hard every day and want to make it happen.\n\n    Magic is our true passion and the driving force that brings us to perfection.\n\n    Now, we want to bring these positive effects to the world. \n  This our first magic project on Kickstarter.\n\n    Thanks to Kickstarter's crowd-funding features, we were able to be more demanding on the product itself and further lower the price.\n\nBy supporting our projects, you will be able to help us share the cost of mass production and make more and more enthusiasts feel the higher cost vs performance quality products that are made in China.\n\n    Looking forward to your support and sharing.\nChoose your rewards tier above, Ger your Leather Chop Cup today.\nClick the picture or here to know more about TCC.\nThis our first magic project on Kickstarter.

Bloody battles and screams echoed throughout the tower until the killers dispatched the final guard.\nThe surviving murderers succumbed to the last wicked trap, however, and failed to penetrate the cellar's secret.\nBecause of this near miss, the Powers That Be decided to bury the tower and hide its existence. Rumours became legends, and legends faded to dust as 1,000 years passed.\nA recent flash flood has exposed the tower top to sunlight once again, offering up the secret to the first souls brave enough to plunder the dark, water-filled levels haunted by grim horrors and deadly traps.\nCan your players navigate the layered dangers of the Sunken Tower of Angry Shadows and discover its ancient mysteries?\nWhat's Inside 5 Room Dungeons Issue #1\nThe sunken tower offers you a unique adventure location. Each level is flooded with water.\nSmart players might figure out how to drain the tower on level three.\nMeantime, this is a fantastic opportunity for your group to master the swimming and underwater rules through fun gameplay.\nThis 5 Room Dungeon also contains layered threats. Characters must first face the dutiful spirits of assassinated guards bent on protecting the secret even after death.\nThen your players must deal with the murderous souls of slain assassins who still seek what's hidden beneath the cellar.\nDefeating these creatures will require teamwork and skill as the undead are well-suited to the close-quarter, inky dark halls, and flooded chambers of this dreadful place.\nLong-time readers of the Roleplaying Tips Newsletter for GMs will know I always like to offer players two paths.\nThe first path, Combat, is sure to challenge even experienced players. Battling incorporeal foes in small spaces while trying not to drown is no light task!\nThe second path, Roleplay, allows clever players to negotiate their way past guards and assassins if they can piece together the clues to understand what the tower dwellers want and would accept in exchange for letting the characters pass.\nAnd then there's the secret in the basement. What riches await those strong and clever enough to bypass the tower's deadly traps and defenses?\nPOD & PDF Supplied By DriveThuRPG\nBoth PDF and Print on Demand version of 5 Room Dungeons Zine will be fulfilled by DTRPG.\nIf you back a Print Tier, you will just pay for printing and shipping.\nHere are the estimated shipping costs.\nAnd estimated cost for a saddle stitched book is $3-$4.\nI will send you a DTRPG Coupon to redeem for the POD version when ready.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter.

That's over 20 years of weekly tips. In addition, I have produced several books and online courses to help game masters have more fun at every game.\n\nLast, I invented the 5 Room Dungeon method in 2003 and first published it in Roleplaying Tips Newsletter #156.\n\nSo, I've got a firm grasp on what's needed to produce a really cool zine that features brand new 5 Room Dungeons full of twists and crazy gaming moments sure to entertain you and your friends for an evening.\n\n* * *\n\nSome artwork copyright William McAusland and Forge Studios, used with permission.\n\n* * *\n\nI feel risks on this Kickstarter project are very low.

But that was before Beazt slew the Children, and Abominous, his creator, broke the world. Scattered, the remaining Children struggled for survival, trying to tame a paradise that had turned against them.\nFor millennia they have been separated from one another by Sorogoros, the worldwyrm, which wraps it's huge serpentine coils around each continent on the planet. Controlling the sea and sky, the Sorogoros ensures that no fish, no fowl, no ship can cross from one \"coil\" to another. And so have the Children been trapped on their continental islands, the knowledge of their brethren fading with each passing day, their desire to travel the open sea long all but lost.\nBut things are changing.\nThe Children are thriving. They are restless. And they once again hear the calls of their ancestors from across the churning seas. Tales abound that the Sorogoros has by tamed. Ships are appearing in ports outside of the safe harbors and the inland seas. Their destination - new lands. Their guarantee - Adventure.\nAre you brave enough to board one today? Are you brave enough to discover what lies beyond the horizon? Are you brave enough to explore Denoa? \nBehold The Doorway To Adventure\nDenoa is a world built for storytelling. It contains a rich mythology and history that inform adventures without overwhelming them with detail. An official campaign story plays out in real time, with key events hosted at kitchen tables and game stores around the world. However, DMs and players can take things at their own pace, and choose to play the meta story, or use it's ideas to tell their own stories.\nBehold a world that feels like home. Whose paths and plains, forests and fields, cities and landscapes feel familiar. Like something you know, and understand, because you've been there before. \nBehold a world that feels fresh and new. Where familiar ideas and common tropes are upgraded, updated, and never stale. Where the familiar is just different enough to excite your senses, and invite you to explore it.\nBehold a world that is strange, and magical, and unlike any world you have seen before. A world where the unfamiliar and uncomfortable clash with the fantasy that you know. Where any - and every - fantasy idea has a place to grow. Where continents, cultures, monsters, and magic have evolved separately from each other. Where each location is amazing, wondrous, and completely unique.\nBehold a world made up of worlds, where all of your favorite settings come together - and clash. Imagine a green world, where humans, elves, and dwarves band together to fight a common foe. Imagine a savage world, where tan, magic-hating barbarians tread the land on sandalled feet. Imagine a frozen world, where snowbound creatures draw magic by singing to the northern lights. Imagine a fairy world where fey folk and talking animals are commonplace. Imagine a burning world, where hell has literally come to earth, and demons, devils, and insect races dominate the harsh landscape.\nBehold Denoa. The world where these worlds - and others - are on the edge of discovering each other.\nDenoa and it's official campaign will bring modern technology to bear in it's story telling. Through the use of in-store-only events, online surveys, and a dedicated app, we hope to gather your experiences and use them to shape our story. What you share with us could shape our official campaign, our next official event, or even a future product! \nUnofficially you can shape the world in any way you choose. We've even built it so that you can add your own world TO Denoa. So if you like worldbuilding, there's no need to abandon your work to play Denoa. Use one of the provided options to put Denoa into YOUR world, or YOUR world into Denoa, making the story you tell uniquely yours.\nDenoa is in every way a collaborative effort. Designed by Danny O'Neill, it will be created by some of the best talent and game companies in the industry (for a full list, see the bottom of this Kickstarter). And that design is guided by YOU and the actions you take during Organized Play events.\nOne of the key collaborators on the project is DGNFOG who will help us build all the maps for Denoa. Another is the community we hope to build around World Anvil and our Organize Play efforts. If you are a retailer, a designer, a writer, or interested in contributing to Denoa in ANY WAY, reach out to us through our social media. We might not have room for your particular talent or idea, but we'd love to include you any way we can. \n There are three major components to this project - the Book, the Denoa App, and the Organized Play. We have set a low goal in order to help with internet marketing algorithms. For the book to reach it's full potential, this Kickstarter will have to earn approximately $15,000. \nThe Denoa app has 3 Tiers. Tier 1, the Basic App is already funded. Tier 2, the Advanced App is our true goal. We will need this Kickstarter to fund between $25,000 and $30,000 for this app to be fully funded. \n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDenoa is a broken, magical world. In the time before time, it's continents were separated by a titanic sea serpent know as the Sorogoros. As a result, the ecology of each land evolved without the others. Each now sports it's own peoples, it's own cultures, it's own magic styles, it's own monsters. Your job is to uncover them all. But for now, things are secret, and information is purposefully made scarce.\nTo discover as much as you can about Denoa, head to World Anvil.\nColarwyn\nOur story starts in Colarwyn, a region which acts as a hub for this project and future ones. Colarwyn is one of 5 regions in the continent known as Ostarwyn. Almost all of the countries in this region border an inland sea, known as Merala.\n\nThe Free City of Arbor\nWe are extremely proud to be partnering with some of the most talented companies, writers, and artists in the business. \nAuthors\nEd Greenwood is a Canadian worldbuilder, writer, game designer,  and librarian who creates imaginary worlds; his best known one is the  Forgotten Realms\u00ae fantasy setting, which he began creating when he was  six years old, and is still expanding  and enriching more than fifty years later.

We will add a freight estimate chart below as soon as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of this time, the risks to this project are minimal. The primary artwork for the book is already completed, and writing has begun. We're in a good place with how the capsules and OP work, and we'll be playtesting within a few weeks.\n\nThe largest challenge we have is making sure Denoa fulfills it's potential by fulling funding the app. The basic version will be enough to stay connected and play Denoa events, but the full version will allow for players to integrate their characters into the storyline with ease. That will allow a lot more players into the collective story we are telling. So although Denoa will survive with even the Basic app, the Full App is what we are truly shooting for. The goal for this is high - we need this Kickstarter to hit $40K to be able to get to this plateau. And that's why we consider this our largest challenge.\n\nThe next challenge we have is to get enough stores into our network hosting Denoa events. If your local game store hosts role-playing games, and if you think they are interested, please tell them about us! With their assistance we can tell a bigger and better story.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Danny O'Neill - Hammerdog Games\n5 created \u00b7 23 backed\nDanny has been organizing, creating, promoting, hosting, selling, and distributing games for over 30 years.

This allows us to charge actual shipping costs just before we're ready to ship out rewards. For this reason...\nShipping costs are not included in your pledges for this campaign. You will be charged for shipping later, once rewards are ready to ship.\nThe above amounts INCLUDE S&H + VAT.\nFor example: If you live in Toronto and back at the Grimmerspace Core Tier, it should cost you $40.00 for your pledge + $12.17 for fulfillment = $52.17 (total cost).\nWe will ship all pledges from warehouses in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United States.\nUnfortunately, there is no easy way for us to collect or pay VAT for pledges made outside the countries / regions in the above list. If you do not live in one of those locations, you will be responsible for those fees when the product gets to you \u2013 most likely, having to pay them at the post office, if at all.\nRewards bound for these countries will not incur extra customs charges!\nStarfinder and associated marks and logos are trademarks of Paizo Inc., and are used under license.

As ENnie Award-winning freelancers and podcasters, we've written, authored, or edited over 2 million words for the roleplaying game industry and bring over 30 years combined industry experience to the table. Not to mention that separately, both Rone and I have launched and run successful businesses outside our gaming careers. And we've also consulted on or outright rescued struggling projects through Kickstarter; for example, forming business partnerships and then rolling up our sleeves to make sure the ENnie Award-winning Razor Coast and its related books finally got to Backers. \n\nWhile there is always risk starting a new company, we think the risks are minimal given our extensive business experience both in and outside the tabletop industry. However no one is an island, so Iron GM Games has signed agreements with Modiphius Entertainment and Gamerati, two companies with proven track records planning, executing, and delivering TTRPG Kickstarters. We believe their extensive, hands-on expertise, plus our other industry relationships, further mitigate these risks.\n\nWhile much of the design and development on Grimmerspace is complete and nearly half the art already purchased, it proved impossible to finish before the Kickstarter. Mostly because, until the Kickstarter completes, we won\u2019t know all the locations you want in the Grimmerspace books. And because every location in Grimmerspace gets an adventure, that means we just won't have a full list of adventures to write until after this Kickstarter. \n\nNonetheless, to ensure the highest quality work and swiftest delivery, we\u2019ve invited only top industry professionals with a history of meeting or exceeding deadlines to join our writing team. Of course, it is always possible for life to prevent a given designer from meeting obligations. Should that happen, we will tap our network and swiftly select a different writer to take over. With over nine top designers signed to the project and nearly a dozen equally proven people \u201con the bench,\" we are confident that our schedule is reasonable, achievable, and that we can minimize any delays that may arise.\n\nLast but not least: In recent months political factors, such as Brexit in the UK and a growing trade war with China, introduced increasing uncertainty into the publishing and tabletop games industries. To mitigate the cost and production risks posed by volatile markets we have already sourced additional solutions with printers and manufacturers in the United States, Lithuania, and Korea.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Space", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nPDF copies of all Grimmerspace books\nAll Digital Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["1,024 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "The Endless Mall", "descp": "RETAILERS ONLY: Your rewards will be shipped before any product is offered to distributors.

It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up in Unity. Read on to find out what this all means and why we are excited for this project.\nFantasy Grounds is a popular system for playing a host of different roleplaying games online.  It is used by more than 130,000 gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and more.  This type of program is commonly referred to as a virtual tabletop, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various part of an RPG session in a digital form.\nWhat makes Fantasy Grounds different than competitors is how we expose character sheets and automate large portions of gameplay specifically for each system we support.  This is done through rulesets.  Your experience playing Deadlands Reloaded will differ from D&D and will be unique to that environment, contain custom graphics, character sheets, and automation specific to that game system.  \nOne feature shared across most game systems is maps.  Some may use hexes while others use square grids and some may not use grids at all.  Facing is important in some and less so in others.  While FG has featured maps for many years, they have been primarily focused as reproductions of maps in existing adventure modules from our many licensed publishers. We believe that we can enhance these to provide dynamic line of sight, fog of war, and even map building support with painting and tiles.\nWhat you get for backing this project will be a license for Fantasy Grounds Unity (or FGU). This new game engine has all the great features of current version of Fantasy Grounds (soon to be called Fantasy Grounds Classic) along with new enhanced features. \nOriginal Features Supported:\nMultiplayer support for playing tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons (2E, 3.5E, 4E and 5E), Pathfinder RPG 1, Pathfinder RPG 2, Starfinder.\nBuilt-in content for D&D 3.5E, 5E and Pathfinder 1\nOfficially licensed add-on content available for D&D, D&D Classics (2E), Pathfinder, Starfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, Castles & Crusades, Mutants & Masterminds, 13th Age, W.O.I.N., Traveller, and Rolemaster Classic\nGeneric system support through our CoreRPG ruleset\nBrilliant Campaign Management\nIntegrated character sheets with lots of automation built in for playing and leveling (depending on ruleset and content owned)\nCombat Tracking\n3D dice\nFantasy Grounds Unity Enhanced Features Include:\n64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)\nNative support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC\nNetwork lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)\nTile based map building\nEnhanced Drawing Tools\nAdditional Dice Macros support\nA new FGU only skin\nDynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers\nPaint with images, such as walls\nAnimated image effects\nBackward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC\nIn addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward. We have lots of ideas for new features and this rebuilt engine will make it easier for us reach those goals and deliver consistent updates for free. \nTile based Map Building\nDynamic Line of Sight (LOS) and Fog of War (FOW)\nLine of Sight - Doors and Terrain\nMap Fx Layers\n New Grid Options\nAdvanced Dice Expression Support\nWe have already devoted over 4 years and 10,000 developer hours to this project. Any funds raised will help us push it over the edge and begin work on new features and functionality. If the project does exceptionally well, this may even allow us to add even more resources to the team.\nWe have over 1200 existing DLC and add-ons. Our goal is to prioritize these by popularity and work on enhancing as many of these as we can. Without enhancements, they will continue to function as they always have in Fantasy Grounds Classic. You will be able to add dynamic line of sight to maps and begin using the new features straight away. As we work through this large back catalog of DLC, we will do all the enhancement and upgrade work for you so you can just load it up and begin using the advanced features without having to define any Line of Sight blockers yourself. \nLink: www.fantasygrounds.com\nGreat! We anticipate that a large number of our backers will already be fans and users of our software. For you, we have added discounted Upgrade tiers available to get you up and running on the new engine as soon as possible. A lot of the time spent building the new engine was devoted towards making sure that everything you've already bought or created will continue to work in FGU. The only difference is that now you will be able to further enhance them.\nOver time, we will begin going through older products and enhancing them for you. Just look for the Update Available button to light up and stay tuned to our newsletter for regular updates on which products have been newly Enhanced. \nWhich Upgrade option do I choose?\nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license in 2018 or 2019, then pick the Rookie Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate. \nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license before 2018, then choose the Veteran Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate.\nIf you are on a subscription, then you will be able to subscribe to the new version once it is released on the store. If you want Beta or Alpha access, then you would need to get a Newcomer tier option on the Kickstarter. \nHow do I upgrade multiple license keys?\nIf your account has multiple license keys, it is possible that some of them are newer and some are older. Pick the tier that best fits your main license key that you personally use and then increase your pledge level for each additional license you have based on the age of that license.  Our survey system and fulfillment will allow some corrections there later on and we can always help on a case-by-case basis through our support email at the time of fulfillment.\nDo I need to pay a subscription going forward?\nOur newcomer tiers are 1-time purchase licenses for Fantasy Grounds Unity. No further subscription is required. If you had a subscription to Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may want to maintain that as long as you want to continue using that version. \nYes, Fantasy Grounds Classic will remain a viable product for many years to come. While the data is backward compatible, we chose to separate the data paths for FGU and FG Classic so that changes to one won't be reflected in the other. You can copy campaigns over to FGU to try things out there and maintain your original copy back on Fantasy Grounds Classic. \nOver time, we expect most users will migrate fully to FGU.\nDo I get access to Fantasy Grounds Classic if I buy Fantasy Grounds Unity?\nNo. If you already have a license or subscription, then you can continue to use that. The licenses will be different even though they share the same add-ons. \nStandard licenses can host or play in a game with other licensed users. An Ultimate license allows the GM to host a game for any number of players and those players can use a free Demo license of Fantasy Grounds. Initial copies will go out to backers only, but we will try to  send out the demo license links to backers at some point prior to launch so those can be shared with players for your game.\nWe have over 1200 DLC items available -- an entire gaming bookstore worth of games. It's too much to feature in the Kickstarter, but we have a select list of bundles below that you can choose from when we send out the backer surveys. Just increase your pledge amount for the add-ons you want from the list below. \nAlso -- Anything you already own on your account at fantasygrounds.com will continue to work with FGU, so you won't have to re-buy any of those. In fact, you can go shopping at fantasygrounds.com if you see anything on sale there during or after the Kickstarter and those items will unlock automatically for your account once you gain access to FGU during the Alpha or Beta.\nWhat if I bought my add-ons from Steam?\nYou will be able to use those in both versions: Fantasy Grounds Classic and Fantasy Grounds Unity. Our system will know what purchases you have made from either location. \n*Note: We have some unknowns about how the Steam Store will reflect purchases across the two versions of Fantasy Grounds. If you bought bundle items on Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may need to buy new additions to the bundle there instead of on the new FGU store page on Steam.  \n\nNew portraits commissioned from the Ultimate Gamemaster level by amazing avatar artist, Mates Laurentiu! \nArtist Bio: Born in Dracula's lands, Mates Laurentiu is a Romanian freelance artist with a love for fantasy, horror and science fiction.

I'd been searching for as realistic as possible, top down tokens for my own RPG gaming. One of my players suggested that I stop searching and make my own and it's been quite a roller coaster ride ever since. It is my hope that you find something to create awe and immersion for your gaming table in my offerings. I'm always trying to make an indelible mark on my player\u2019s imagination and create something that brings them back for more!! I also create Character Packs to help players better visualize the character that they have created to play.

Depending on how long those take, the dates could shift. \n\nOur team has been testing and developing on Windows PCs. We make notes on things that we know we need to check into for Mac and Linux support but we have not yet attempted builds on those platforms. It is possible and expected that there will be a delay between releasing versions for Windows PC and Mac and Linux. In the worst case scenario, Windows PC users may complete the entire Alpha and Beta process before the Alpha and Beta process begins for other platforms. \n\nWe will lock down the FGU Alpha Launch Party by the start of June. If there are significant delays in getting you access to the Alpha, we will still have some hands-on stuff for you at the event but we may delay access to the Alpha keys until a later date.

Jing has been preparing for your arrival for quite some time. First he built a temple to himself, a magical labyrinth, that he placed somewhere between space and time. Next he stole countless treasures from kings and men, gods and emperors - even the plants and animals. These he placed inside his temple so that any visitor could discover and take them. To challenge the bold, he surrounded those treasures with tricks, traps, and an array of deadly monsters. And finally he sent invitations to people everywhere, entreating them to visit his temple - and take whatever treasures they can carry. You are reading one of Jing's invitations right now. Do you accept it? Do you dare enter the Grande Temple of Jing?\nThe Grande Temple of Jing is a megadungeon designed in the spirit of old school RPG adventures - but with modern rules and sensibilities. It is no-holds-barred dungeoncrawl of truly epic proportions, where almost anything can be found. There are *65* themed dungeon levels - ranging from character level 1 to 20 - so there is something for every group and style of play. Some levels are heavy in combat and tactics, while some are filled with riddles, puzzles, or other challenges. Some levels are quick, others are huge sprawls that harken back to the dungeon days of old. Some levels are deadly serious, and some are almost frivolous. Best of all the levels are completely modular, meaning they can be torn apart and arranged any way you see fit. Plus, there are rules for adding your own content easily, and even for connecting the temple to your favorite 3rd party dungeons.\nThe *500* pages that make up the Grande Temple of Jing contain more dungeon goodness than you can shake a +1 stick at. Strange creatures, powerful weapons, and wondrous magic are just the start. Riddles, poems, quests, and campaigns make this more than just a megadungeon - it's also a sourcebook, a toolbox, and one heck of a paperweight. And with levels and fiction from celebrity contributors, there is sure to be something for EVERYONE within its fabled halls. \nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to update and reprint the Grande Temple of Jing to be compatible with 5th Edition. It will remain compatible with Pathfinder, and will work with Pathfinder 2.0. Also it will still be easy to modify for systems like 13th Age and all other versions of the world's most popular roleplaying game. Layout and design will be improved. Miniatures and electronic player-friendly maps will be produced to improve options for gameplay and immersion. \nFor this we are asking for $15,000 in pledges from our backers. This is the bare minimum needed to cover the layout and reprint of the book as well as the molds for some miniatures. Stretch goals will allow us to develop more miniatures and other rewards. \nFeatures include\n 500 pages of epic dungeon crawl adventures.\n 65 levels from tiny to huge. Each level is themed, with challenges keyed to that theme (adventure, comedy, horror, etc.). Levels include classic dungeon style, wilderness levels, and \"meta\" levels.\n Celebrity Contributors - Levels by RPG masters Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, Skip Williams, Ed Greenwood, Jim Ward, Chris Pramas, Stan!, Grimtooth, and Matt Mayhew. Fiction by Dave Gross and Kevin Andrew Murphy.\n Dozens of adventure hooks, stories and quests that allow you to experience the temple in whatever way the DM wishes - anything from a one-shot to an entire campaign. Internal quests that create motivations to explore even the most dangerous and strange parts of the temple.\n Amazing art, cool maps, and everything else you would expect - strange monsters, fantastic treasures, new spells, and so on.\n A toolbox approach to megadungeons that allows the DM to construct and present the temple in any way they desire. Rules are provided for DMs to add their own content and to shows ways to link to their favorite published adventures!\n Wonder on every page, around every corner, and behind every door. The kind of wonder that can only be brought to you by a trickster god.\nYour torch burns red against the darkness, illuminating the strange door in front of you. A thousand times you have passed this way - how did you not notice it before? Round doors are rare enough, but this one is painted gold, so shiny that you can see your reflection in the torchlight. Your torch flickers - and for a long moment it seems as if your reflection reaches towards you, beckoning you to come inside. You realize it's just a trick of the light but notice for the first time - the door is cracked open. You step closer to peer inside when a familiar voice calls out your name. \"Come on in! I've been waiting for you.\" Disarmed, you walk through the door and into pure darkness. The door closes behind you, and you are elsewhere. \nBehold the Grande Temple of Jing.  An adventure like no other. This megadungeon is the temple home of a  trickster god. And he\u2019s feeling very tricky indeed.\nCome on in! Try your hand at Jing\u2019s  deadly labyrinth. You are more than welcome to enter the temple,  explore its vast halls and twisted dungeons and take whatever loot you can carry.\nWho knows? You might even find your way out\u2026\nThe Grande Temple of Jing is the dungeon home of a trickster god. It is the ultimate deathtrap dungeon, capable of hosting anything a DM could possibly desire from the epic to the ludicrous. Jing is the archetypal trickster - the first of his kind - and he spent a millennium adventuring, pranking, and plundering at will. Everyone tried to stop him. They placed guards. They made locks. They devised traps. They created vaults. Nothing stopped him. Jing took anything he wanted, even stealing life itself from the gods of creation.\nEventually he tired of the game, as none could defeat him. And then he struck upon an amazing idea. A creatively wondrous idea. Yet a troublesome and deadly idea.\nHe flipped the script.\nIn short order Jing created his own palace - a temple dedicated to himself. He filled it with all the treasure he had stolen. And then he protected them with the same things he had seen on his journeys - guards, locks, traps, even vaults. He began to send out invitations, beseeching heroes and commoners alike to come to his temple and raid it. To this day anyone, who can find the temple is welcome to enter and plunder it's magical halls. To this day few manage to do so and escape.\nOver time Jing's temple and it's fabulous treasures passed from fact to legend. It became a story, then a set of tales that parents told to scare their children. To this day few believe they will ever find the temple - or return from it, if they do. Most knowledge of Jing and his amazing temple have been reduced to a poem - a canticle - that some children know by heart.\nNow that you know the Canticle of Jing, you are well prepared to enter the temple. Please prepare yourself accordingly and notify your next of kin. We are looking forward to your visit.\nSince the book is primarily a reprint, some rewards are already completed, and our stretch goals are somewhat limited. When stretch goals are hit, they will do any of the following: (1) Unlock one or more miniatures in one of the sets, increasing the value of that set, (2) add content to the DM Treasure Box for free or (3) improve the Deluxe Version of the book. \nTwo stretch goals are driven by the number of backers. If we get 100 backers, we'll add a free set of invitations to the DM Treasure Box. If we get 200, we'll add a free set of Bookmarks. Please help spread the word, so we can get as many backers as possible. Thank you so much!\n\nReward Chart\nEstimated Freight\nFreight will be added in Backerkit. These are estimates only, as add-ons can significantly alter the cost of freight. \n\nThere is so much to the Grande Temple of Jing, that it's hard to describe in a few paragraphs.

Founder and head sculptor at Effin Cool Miniatures. Sculptor of the GaryCon 2019 special convention figure, and more!\nFor players, The Grande Temple of Jing represents the ultimate dungeoncrawling experience. Magic permeates  the temple and being a trickster deity, Jing weaves it for his own  purposes and merriment. He is a major god and wields supreme power in his home. As a result, a room or area can contain virtually anything -  and often does.   \nDo your players like caves full of orcs, and classic dungeons filled with mythological monsters? The Grande Temple's got that. Do they like labyrinths set in sewers, forests, and maybe even a coral reef? The Grande Temple's got that too. Do they like adventures set in taverns, towns, and deep dark forests? Got it. Do they like gauntlets filled with traps, an entire level based on board games, or an arena where they can fight to the death? Check. Maybe they like dragons sitting on huge hoards of treasure, undead rising from their graves, and artifacts that fill them with awe. The Grande Temple's got that and more.  \nPlayers will be enthralled by the many wonders of the Grande Temple and challenged by its many clever tricks. Magical puzzles, devious riddles and wondrous magical effects will keep them entertained  for hours and allow them to experience the height of dungeoncrawling  fun.\nPerhaps the best example of Jing's trickery is the resurrection mechanic. You see, Jing draws great amusement from the trials of his guests. So much so, that if they entertain him\u2026 but die in the process\u2026 he will typically resurrect them so that they can continue. What does this mean to the average player? It means they can seek and find incredible treasures and artifacts - things, which they normally only see in their dreams. And if they die in the search - but amuse Jing in the process - he just might grant them a do-over.\nFor the DM, the grande temple represents the ultimate expression in dungeon design. Levels are modular, so DMs can pull them apart, rearrange them, and add their own content easily. They can even connect the temple to their favorite 3rd party dungeons!\nDespite its size, linked quests keep players moving along, so that the adventure is not just a series of endless rooms. The Grande Temple of Jing can be run as an epic dungeon campaign, as a group of themed dungeon levels, or even as a series of one shots. And since it's the home of a trickster god, the DM is freed up to run the game any way they choose - and even add content that would not be appropriate in any other dungeon.\nPerhaps most importantly, DMs are free to tweak the rules to suit the play style of their group. For example they can modify the dungeon to make it more or less deadly. If the resurrection mechanic is considered too broken, it can be ignored or altered. Also, the treasure level can be set to low, medium, or high. At the high level, the game can be run \"Monty Haul\" style, allowing groups to blow away rooms full of creatures with ease. At the low level it becomes a deadly grind, that will challenge even the most experienced players. \nAnd finally, the DM can set the mood of the game simply by choosing to play levels of a certain theme. Some levels are filled with beasts, others with undead. Some levels host villages and towns, and others are little more than a gauntlet filled with traps. Whatever the mood of the group and  the GM, there is a world of adventure waiting for them in the Grande Temple of Jing.\n The format of the book is another thing that sets it apart from the everyday megadungeon. We try hard to eliminate filler text and get right to the heart of a dungeon adventure. Detailed maps, concise writing, and informative icons allow us to pack a  lot of information into a small space, without losing the details you need to run the game. Many rooms have their own map near their description, so the DM can see important details at a glance, including scale, terrain, hidden objects and initial position of creatures. \nIn fact, The Grande Temple of Jing has been specifically designed, so that GMs can just pick a level and jump right into the game with little or no preparation. Maps are detailed appropriately. Sidebars, icons and minimaps help the GM jump right into the adventure with almost no preparation - and keep play going for hours and hours.\n Here is a detailed description of what you can find inside the book. Details are here for the first few sections. More will follow as the campaign gets underway.\nEntering the Grande Temple\nThe book opens with a 36 page Introduction that explains the temple, it's history, and it's key features.

Many players will find their journey starting in The Entry Chamber, where they may learn about Jing and his temple.\nThe Meta Levels\nThe Central Chambers are part of the Meta Levels, a number of areas that have no fixed spot in the temple. They can be placed literally anywhere the DM wishes. They often connect to the temple in various ways and there are often several doors in the temple that connect to the same Meta Level.  \nMeta levels include:\nThe Central Chambers (C) - The entrances and welcoming areas of the temple, as well as the Great Central Elevator, which moves between the 10 \"Grande Levels\" (clusters of levels) that make up the temple.\nThe Grande Jing Highway (H) - One of the main arteries by which temple residents move between it's levels and Grande Levels.\nTrials (T) - Short levels with a specific goal that must be completed to escape.\nGauntlets (G) - Short linear levels used as short cuts to move between \"Grande\" levels. The challenges of a gauntlet get more difficult with every room and players often have a short amount of time to complete them.\nArenas (A) - There are 3 arenas in the temple where players can fight to become Jing's Champion - and win their freedom from the temple.\nVaults (V) - These are special levels where Jing hides his favorite treasures. They are well guarded, and their doors cannot be opened unless the players collect the proper items to use as \"keys.\" \n\nGrande Level 1\nGrande Level 1 contains 7 levels (so far). It is dominated by two tribes that exist in a \"Balance of Power.\" The first tribe are the Lickspit Kobolds - the janitors of the temple. The other tribe are the Gnashteeth Orcs, cursed to grind their teeth by the Jing-tainted weapon that their leader wields. The players enter this level with the ability to sway the confrontation one way or the other.\nGrande Level 1 Includes\nC1: The Entry Chambers - A wondrous dungeon that teaches key concepts of the temple. \n1.1: Kobold Caverns - Caverns that host the temples most famous denizens.\n1.2: Halls of Deep Darkness - Halls of darkness where the undead await the unprepared\n1.3: Gnashteeth Orc Halls - A tactical assault against a horde of nasty orcs.\nG1: Green Gauntlet - A green themed gauntlet that leads deeper into the temple.\nH1: The Upper Road - An introductory journey down a strange section of road.\nT1: Trial of Copper - A copper themed dungeon and simple introduction to Trials.\n\nGrande Level 2\n\nGrande Level 3\n\nGrande Level 4\n\nGrande Level 5\n\nGrande Level 6\n\nGrande Level 7\n\nGrande Level 8\n\n\n\nGrande Level 9\n\nGrande Level 10", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Grande Temple of Jing was our first ever Kickstarter project. It had a handful of rewards that were not realized, primarily because a lack of interest in them made them uneconomical to produce. Project creep and bad luck caused delays on the book.\n\nFor this Kickstarter we've kept the number of rewards to a minimum so that we can ensure they are all produced. Since the project is a simple conversion of existing materials, there are no anticipated project creep or delays anticipated. Should any delays occur, we'll do our best to be open and honest about them.\n\nThe primary risk lies in print times for the book or miniatures taking longer than anticipated. Should this happen we will communicate regularly and often about the status of the printing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Jing Taunts", "descp": "Jing will send you gentle taunts via Kickstarter, attempting to lure you into exploring his temple.

They are:\n\"Living, Dead, and Yet to be Born\" - A couple of large steamer trunks belonging to the just-deceased Second Lieutenant Charles \u2018Charlie\u2019 Townsend arrive at 33 Golden Square for Captain \u2018Harry\u2019 Hudson. Markham, the Investigators\u2019 newly acquired Butler, directs the two labourers as to where to put the items, some of which already match the late Captain Hudson\u2019s decorating tastes. A month or two passes and then the first attempt against the Investigators\u2019 lives is made, by the Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum orderly who arranged for the H. J. Cave and Sons trunks to be shipped to 33 Golden Square. After his death, strange, poltergeist-like occurrences begin to happen at the maisonette. A short time later, a second deadly attack, this time by one of the labourers who moved everything in, is made against the Investigators. And things only escalate from there...\n\"Making a Lasting Peace\" - The second scenario, Investigators travel to the Ashanti Empire. Starting out in the coastal British Trading Forts, they'll discover that things from the past are best left buried. From there, they'll journey into the heart of the Ashanti Empire and seek out a city lost a millenia ago if they're to have any hope of a lasting peace.\n\"Orphans of Antiquity\" - The final scenario in the trilogy sees the resurgence of the cult with powerful new allies from within the government itself, and it threatens to topple the world-wide supremacy of the British Empire. Shifting alliances and a thin veneer of noble civility will leave Investigators increasingly on their own in a dangerous race to prevent the awakening of a Great Old One that threatens all of humanity.\nStretch Goal Scenarios\n UNLOCKED! \"The Colonel's Due\" - Adding tension to the events in \"Making a Lasting Peace\" military offices are turning up dead in the British coastal forts. Can diplomatic ties be restored if the murders are solved, regardless of who is responsible?\n LOCKED \"The Cost of Empire\" - Set in Ashanti 10 years after the events in \"Living, Dead, and Yet to be Born,\" this scenario brings the Investigators face-to-face with the consequences of their actions.\n UNLOCKED! \"The Devil's Castle\" - by Chad Bowser\nAdd-Ons\nTo purchase any add-ons, you must back at a Physical Reward Level or Higher (London Library Subscription+).

Grimtooth the Troll here. You sorry souls have been dying from my traps for decades. And in all that time, not one of you miniscule mortals has attacked me in my lair! Well, I\u2019ve decided to take pity on you. For the first time ever, I\u2019m going to show you my realm. You\u2019ll finally get to see \u2013 Trapsylvania!\nThis Kickstarter supports the publication of Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania, a 144-page campaign setting and sourcebook! It will be available in print (softcover or hardcover) and electronic (PDF) format. It is fully illustrated, with color cover and B/W interior art. The publisher is Goodman Games, under license from Flying Buffalo. The book is written in a systems-neutral style like all Grimtooth books, with DCC RPG stats compiled in an appendix at the back.\nGrimtooth's Lair\nThis Kickstarter also offers a rare collectible treasure: the \"lost 8th Grimtooth book.\" Flying Buffalo published a total of 7 Grimtooth books. At the Origins Game Convention in 1983, an independent publisher released their own unauthorized bootleg adventure called Grimtooth's Lair. Today, only a single copy of this adventure is known to exist. Thanks to collector Bill Meinhardt, we have been able to scan the adventure for publication. It is being offered as an add-on for this Kickstarter (see below).\nThe only known copy of Grimtooth's Lair - now available as a reprint exclusively through this Kickstarter!\nAt last \u2013 the legendary locations of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps revealed!\nFor over 30 years, Grimtooth\u2019s numerous Traps books have horrified players and inspired game masters with hundreds of dangerous devices, deadly deathtraps and hilarious hijinx! Now Grimtooth (with a little help from kid sister Grimtina) will take you on a personally guided tour of his realm and the central hub of his vast Traps empire.\nRun your own Grimtooth campaign, or pick and choose locations you can use in your own adventures. Explore Grimtooth\u2019s caverns, visit his Inner Sanctum, escape the Deathmaze Testing Center, attend Warthog\u2019s School for Trolls, take a ride on Grimtooth\u2019s Airship, tour Grimtina\u2019s Petting Zoo or get lost in many more gigantic places of doom, like the Infinite Corridor of Hallways. Each of these infamous locations includes maps, descriptions, non-player character details, scenarios, and lots of art. Plus there are more traps (of course) and plenty of things with which to endanger your characters.  \nLike all Grimtooth books, Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania is written in a systems-neutral format, and published in a way that it is fully compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG). A series of appendices at the back provide quick and easy stats for DCC RPG games, covering all the creatures, characters and items described in the book. It\u2019s very easy to fill a graveyard with the corpses of your DCC player characters! (Because once you enter Trapsylvania \u2013 you won\u2019t leave! Suckers.)  \nTrapsylvania is written and illustrated by S. S. Crompton, the legendary \u201cvoice of Grimtooth\u201d who has been working on Grimtooth products for Flying Buffalo for more than 30 years. We\u2019ve rounded up the entire roster of historical Grimtooth contributors to illustrate the book, so you\u2019ll find art not just by S. S. Crompton, but also by Liz Danforth, Micheal Von Glahn, Scott Jackson Phil Longmeier, and Jeff Dee \u2013 all the artists who have contributed to Grimtooth products over the years! The new traps are written by Grimtooth alumni S. S. Crompton, Ken St. Andre, Bear Peters, Rick Loomis, Paul O'Connor and Debora Kerr. The DCC stats are provided by Terry Olson, with editing by Jen Brinkman.\nTrapsylvania is chock full of useful gaming material! How much is there? Well, here's the exact count!\n1 whole country! (Grimtooth's, that is!)\n15 large locations, all described and mapped\n48 scenario ideas\n60 traps or trapped items\n86 creatures (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n26 NPCs (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n23 items (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\nAnd loads of laughs!\nWhat is Grimtooth\u2019s Traps?\nOriginally published by Flying Buffalo, Grimtooth\u2019s Traps is one of the most popular RPG accessories ever produced, with more than 250,000 copies in print since 1981. Flying Buffalo published seven Grimtooth\u2019s books, all of them usable with any RPG. In 2015, Goodman Games compiled all of these into a massive hardcover compilation, and also published two additional DCC-compatible Grimtooth adventures. Grimtooth remains an eternally relevant character and his popularity has only grown since then.\nThe hallmarks of Grimtooth-style traps are wacky humor combined with deadly danger, plus, of course, extremely useful material that can be integrated into any dungeon-crawling RPG!\nWhat\u2019s in the book?\nEverything you need to run a game in Trapsylvania! Whether a single session or an extended campaign, you can give your players a fun time. Here is a preview of the Table of Contents:\nWhat's the Status of the Book?\nTrapsylvania is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. We are in final proofreading stages at the time of the Kickstarter. It will be ready to go to the printer shortly after this Kickstarter ends.\nPledge Levels and Shipping\nThe basic pledge levels are for a PDF, softcover, or hardcover edition of the 144-page Trapsylvania. \nWe are also offering a leather-bound edition. We have 50 copies that will also include a piece of original art by Steve Crompton. The remainder do not include that original art.\nShipping costs are as follows. International shipping is via Priority Mail International. The good news is this means international packages will arrive very quickly, but due to recent rate changes these charges unfortunately must be more more than we have charged in the past.\nUSA: softcover $6.00, hardcover $7.00, both books $8.00. \nCanada: softcover $15.00, hardcover $20.00, both books $25.00.\nUK and EU: softcover $20.00, hardcover $25.00, both books $30.00.\nAustralia and rest of world: softcover $25.00, hardcover $30.00, both books $35.00.\nIf you add on items, please use the \"both books\" shipping - i.e. add +$5 for additional shipping cost. The additional $5 is a flat fee whether you add one book or many.\nStretch Goals\nThe last time Grimtooth ran a Kickstarter, it took off like wildfire. (I love fire!! \u2013 Grimtooth) This time around, we want to keep the Kickstarter simple and easy to fulfill. But we\u2019re still adding a couple stretch goals in case you humans want to throw even more gold at Grimtooth!\nAt $20,000, the books will have fancy printed endsheets! CLEARED!\nAt $40,000, we will include a poster map of Trapsylvania! CLEARED!\nAt $45,000, we will include a new Grimtooth mini-comic by Steve Crompton! CLEARED!\nAt $50,000 we will include cards featuring NPC portraits and stats! CLEARED!\nAnd above that, we have other ideas. Grimtooth said he wants a sticker with his face on it, and a poster map of his airship, plus scenic postcards that can double as player handouts, an art print, and more!\nAdd-On Items\nGoodman Games has published many RPG products, including quite a few that are perfect additions to this project! You can add on additional funds to include these items. All add-on items count toward achieving stretch goals, and those published by Goodman Games are in print+PDF format!\nTo add on an item, simply increase your pledge amount to cover the cost. After the Kickstarter we will send out a survey where you can specify what the \u201cdollars\u201d are for. The add-on items for this Kickstarter include the following:\nAdd On Another Copy of Trapsylvania: You can add on another softcover (+$25) or hardcover edition (+$40) by simply adding on the cost of that pledge level. \nGrimtooth's Lair ($10): This is the legendary \"lost 8th Grimtooth book.\" It contains a tournament adventure centered around Grimtooth-style traps, originally released at Origins 1983. The adventure is systems-neutral and designed to be played with any fantasy RPG. Goodman Games has arranged access to the last known copy in existence, and we have scanned and digitally restored it for exclusive publication via this Kickstarter. The original format was a digest-sized, 12-page publication.\nGrimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps Collection, softcover format ($40.00): A 460-page tome collecting all five of the original Grimtooth\u2019s Traps books! More than 500 traps in a systems-neutral format, suitable for any fantasy RPG. Also includes an extensive interview with the original Grimtooth\u2019s creative team, a black-and-white cover gallery showcasing 30 years of editions (in English and many foreign languages), and a look behind the submissions process.\nGrimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps Collection, silver foil hardcover edition ($80.00): We have a limited number of these special tomes remaining from our last Kickstarter!

Please note that supplies are limited on this item. \nDungeon Crawl Classics #87.5: Grimtooth\u2019s Museum of Death ($10.00): A level 1 adventure for the DCC RPG system. The adventurers must wend their way through a maze of traps in Grimtooth\u2019s Museum of Death, a curated collection of the deadliest and most devious traps ever assembled in one place. Along the way, they might even cross paths with a few of Grimtooth\u2019s allies: Grimtina, Spike the Grimdog, and Sludgeworth. Tread lightly, delver. There are no refunds for this tour!\nGrimtooth\u2019s Tomb of the Warhammer ($10.00): A level 4 Grimtooth adventure compatible with DCC RPG. Written by Tunnels & Trolls creator Ken St. Andre. Can you go where no troll dares to tread? Long ago, the elves killed Grimtooth\u2019s father in a great battle. They hid the troll leader\u2019s body and his mystic warhammer somewhere in the vast plains beyond Trapsylvania. After years of searching, Grimtooth has finally located his father\u2019s tomb, but the elves have magically rigged it so that no troll can enter. Now Grimtooth is looking for a party of foolhardy adventurers to enter Grimfang\u2019s Tomb and return with the legendary warhammer\u2026 \nDungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game: The core rulebook for the most popular old-school RPG on the market today!

These maps are being created on a twice-weekly basis throughout the creation phase of the project (April 2018 - March 2019).\nEach map will be provided to those who pledge $20 (or more) in digital format (JPG) for integration into any tabletop RPG with alternate virtual tabletop (VTT) versions provided simultaneously with each map release.\nMost maps will be geared towards a futuristic setting, though a few will likely have potential of crossing genres. The focus of this collection will be various science fiction locales such as space stations, planetary outposts, asteroid mining colonies, futuristic cities, science labs, spaceship deck plans, alien locations, and interplanetary waypoints, but will also include offerings for subgenres such as cyberpunk, science fantasy, and neo-noir.\nThere are several rewards available with content to be delivered to backers at every pledge level!\nTry it out!

All you have to do is click on the \"Manage your pledge\" button located at the top of this page. Then click on the \"Change your pledge\" button on the bottom of the next page. There you will be able to change your \"Pledge Amount\" and then click on the \"Continue\" button to confirm.\nCheck back during the Kickstarter campaign as additional sample maps will be released every week!\nStart benefiting from your pledge almost immediately! Rather than waiting until the entire project is completed to release content, all of the maps created for this collection will be released to backers who pledge $20 (or more) on a continuing basis via a planned schedule of two maps per week throughout the project creation phase.\nThe first of the maps will be provided to applicable backers tarting the day after the campaign funds are collected (usually about two weeks after the Kickstarter ends). Future map releases will continue with a minimum of twice-weekly updates throughout the creation phase until all the maps for the collection are completed.\nBackers who pledge $20 (or more) will be provided with an URL and unique login information to a special website they can visit to access and download the most recently released maps and all previously released maps for this project.\nScreenshot of the Digtial Distribution Tool (DDT) website.\nA finished book including all of the non-VTT \"Gamemaster\" and \"Player\" versions of the maps will be provided as an indexed PDF to all backers who pledge at the $10 (or higher) pledge levels. The estimated PDF release date is around April 2019.\nBackers at the $20 (or higher) pledge levels will also have the option to buy either hardcover or softcover print copies of the book at the price of production cost + shipping cost when the print version is released to the general public later in 2019. The estimated print release date is planned to be around April-June 2019. More info on pricing for print copies will be provided nearer to the project completion.\nShipping Costs for Print Book Purchases:\nThe print versions will be distributed as print-on-demand via DriveThruRPG.com. Domestic and international shipping charges will be handled on their end with purchase of any print copy of the book.\nVolume 1: Fantasy Adventure was released in hardcover print last week. The following video is a 2-minute flip-thru of the book. We are trending steadily towards Volume 2: Science Fiction being just as huge!\nPLAY\n\nEvery digital map in Volume 2 is created at 600 dpi resolution.\nAll of the digital maps scale up as crisp-and-clear print at poster size. This includes printing at the 1-inch scale popular for use with tabletop miniatures.\nThis project is not producing any physical poster map prints.\nCheck out the demo video below from the Volume 1 Kickstarter to see a sample map printed on premium glossy laminated paper.\nPLAY\n\nFor more information on the poster-print quality digital maps, check out this update from the Volume 1 Kickstarter that explains it in more detail.\nWho is Justin Andrew Mason? I am a professional tabletop role-playing game designer, ENnie Award-winning author (Adventureaweek.com Blog 2014), graphic designer, and professional cartographer (AAW MapMaster 2014 winner).\nI am also the creator and cartographer of the first volume of this series, The Big Book of Maps for Tabletop Roleplaying Games - Volume 1: Fantasy Adventure.\nThat Kickstarter funded with over 1,000 backers raising $24K, and (with unlocked stretch goals) produced 230+ maps, 650+ map icons. It was completed more two months early and fulfilled to all backers months ahead of schedule.\nWatch this project's intro video at the top of the page for a slideshow with several hundred examples of my cartography.\nMy various works have been published and commissioned by multiple game publishers and game-related companies including AAW Games (Into the Wintery Gale, Rise of the Drow, Snow White, Aventyr Bestiary, Underworld Races & Classes, and the Mini-Dungeon Tome), AetherCon Online Gaming Convention, EN Publishing (EN5ider; Friend of the Children, The Mystery of Mordecai's Monster, and Dia de los Dinosaurios Muertos), Dark Naga Adventures (Confronting Hastur, The City of Talos), Kobold Press (Southlands, Advanced Races Compendium, Tome of Beasts, Book of Lairs, Demon Cults, Midgard Campaign Setting, New Paths Compendium, and Creature Codex Kickstarters), Legendary Games (Hypercorps 2099), Mythoard (Adventure Hook Cards), Playground Adventures (After School Adventures), Rogue Genius Games (Veranthea Codex), and TPK Games.\nI maintain a professional blog, Paths to Adventure, where anyone may keep track of my current projects, finished commissions, the latest releases of my work, and several free RPG-related web apps and generators I've developed (like the Tavern Sign Crafter). I even do a bit of self publishing through the platform as well.\nWhat is the difference between VTT and non-VTT maps?\nBackers at the $20 level (or higher) level will be provided digital access to both a VTT (Virtual Tabletop) and a non-VTT versions of every map produced for this project via the weekly releases via the Digital Distribution Tool website.\nA VTT map contains no scaling grid, room numbers, icons, or hidden room contents (such as secret compartments). A non-VTT map includes  these features. The final PDF and printed book will include only the non-VTT maps.\nThe purpose of the VTT version of every map is provide a convenient import to Virtual Tabletop software platforms. In addition to access to the twice-weekly released downloads, at the end of the creation phase of the project all backers at the $20 (or higher) level will be provided a link to download a package (ZIP) containing both versions of every map in digital (JPG) format.\nThere are two non-VTT versions available of every map in this project. The \"GM\" version which includes numbers and labels. And the \"Player\" version which does not include numbers or labels. All downloadable sample maps on this page have been updated to include all three versions of the digital map for reference.\nNot interested in science fiction maps? There\u2019s still something for you here! As an incentive for folks who may not need science fiction maps for their games, I am adding in a THIRD BOOK full of all-new fantasy maps as a reward for reaching a special funding goal.\nWhen this new Kickstarter meets or exceeds the funding met for the previous Kickstarter project ($23,562 US), I will create a third book in the Big Book of Maps series that focuses on fantasy-themed \"Mini-Dungeon\u201d maps.\nWhen unlocked, this extra book will begin production immediately after the science fiction maps for Volume 2 are completed and released to backers.\nThis third collection of maps will be provided as a indexed PDF and released to all backers of this Kickstarter. Backers who pledge $20 (or more) will also get the high-resolution digital files and  VTT maps for the Mini-Dungeons, and a voucher to buy the print copy of the third book at production cost + shipping cost.\nExamples of Mini-Dungeon cartography I've crafted for other publishers.\nWhen unlocked, the third book will include over 100 fantasy mini-dungeon maps.\nWhereas Volume 1 - Fantasy Adventure focused on massive maps that sometimes included as many as 70-100 rooms, this bonus book will focus on dungeon maps consisting of around 15-25 rooms each (great for those one shots, or smaller locales). It\u2019s the perfect fantasy map companion to the first Big Book of Maps!\nNote: If this special funding goal is unlocked, the Mini-Dungeon book is considered a bonus. It's completion is not tied to the estimated timeline for delivery of Volume 2. It will likely take several months after this Kickstarter has been completed and delivered to backers before the bonus book becomes available.\nLicensing Note: The Stock Cartography license provided by the $295 pledge level of this Kickstarter does not extend to the 100+ Mini-Dungeon maps. If you have backed at this level, and would like to extend your license to cover the 100 extra bonus maps when it is unlocked, please increase your pledge by $50.\nEvery week a new Featured Addition will be added to the project. These additions are bonus material, and just my way of saying, \"Thank your for all the support!\" Be sure to check back every Friday during the kickstarter to see what new goodies have been added!\nThe Week #1 Feature Edition is Planet Portfolio 1 and Planet Portfolio 2! Originally created as a print-and-play tabletop solution, Planet Portfolio has now been updated with full VTT support! Every asset of the book has also been provided as a 300 dpi PNG image with transparent backgrounds. You can download it here for free right now!\nPlanet Portfolio 2 is being created as a bonus for this kickstarter project, and will also be added for free download when it is completed. Estimated delivery is 1-2 weeks after funds clear for this project.\nCombined, the Planet Portfolios provide over 100 VTT assets for your spacefaring adventures including: stars, rocky planets, terra-like planets, gas giants, moons, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, and more!\nThe Week #1 Feature Edition is Starship Deckplan Maps! A series of 20 detailed starship deckpans has been added to the collection. Like all other maps, these will include GM, Player, and VTT versions.\nAlso, for each stretch goal bonus map or mini-funding goal bonus map added to the campaign an additional starship deckplan map will be added as well!\nThe Week #3 Featured Addition heralds the arrival of an all new Add-on option! The Starship Builder Kits. Want to try it out? Click here to download it right now. If you want the rest of the kits, you can get them as an add-on by increasing your pledge by $25.\nEach kit includes 20 ship sections that allow you to easily create your own customized starship deckplan!\nThere are 5 core kits, and for every $5k this kickstarter funds, another 5 sets will be added. That means right now there are 25 kits (500 starship sections) with more to be added to the add-on as funding continues to increase!\nDesigned to allow you to utilize various stylized starship sections to compile your very own custom starship deckplan. Each kits is designed to allow you to mix-and-match any of the sections included with sections included in other sets in the series.\nStretch Goals: For every 50 backers that pledge to this Kickstarter campaign, one full-page, full-color bonus map will be added to the collection. This even includes the $1 backer level count, so get your friends to back for a buck and get more maps into Volume 2 of the Big Book of Maps!\nThese bonus maps will be included in the final book and will be released via the backer-only website on a staggered schedule as time permits.\nPlease Note: Should this project result in a very large number of backers, the process of creating the bonus maps could delay the final release of the PDF and Print versions of the book. However, there will be no delay in the twice-weekly release schedule of digital maps to applicable backers.\nIn addition to the bonus map stretch goals based on the number of backers, an additional series of stretch goals based on overall amount pledged to the project can be unlocked.\nStretch Goals ($1k - $14k): When the project is funded, and for every $500 pledged beyond the project's $1,000 funding goal up to $14k, a series of 10 all-new map icons will be unlocked for backers.\nSuper Stretch Goals ($15k +): When the project reaches $15k funding, and for every additional $1,000 pledged beyond that, an additional map icon is added to every previously unlocked map icon set. That's 27 new map icons for every super stretch goal unlocked!\nBonus Stretch Goals: There will periodically be threshold-based bonus stretch goals that are in addition to the planned recurring stretch goals. This include special bonuses that are unlocked at the $5k, $10k, $15 and $20 funding levels.\nThe icons will be released in themed packs as they are created, and made available to all backers via \"backers only\" updates here on Kickstarter as well as the Digital Distribution Tool.\nAll of these unlocked map icons will even be available to $1 backers -- so everyone who shows support for the project walks away with something worthwhile!\nMap icons are the various elements that can be placed onto a dungeon map via a virtual tabletop (VTT) platform or graphic editing software. This includes objects such as doors, treasure chests, furniture, traps, treasure, etc.\nFor the purpose of this project these map icons will be provided as PNG graphic files with transparent backgrounds (to allow easy import and placement via VTT software).\nExample of how map icons will be released in sets.\nThe map icons will be released to all backers in themed sets as they are created. A \u201ccomplete collection\u201d of the map icons in a single download will also be made available for backers at the end of this project\u2019s creation phase.\nThe map icons produced by this project are super-high 600 dpi resolution and especially created to properly accompany the matching high resolution digital maps offered. This means the map icons will also scale up to poster-map quality.\nThe planned release schedule for the map icon sets is once weekly starting the day the project funds clear. These sets will be made available to all backers via the Digital Distribution Tool.\nEach map set initially includes 10 totally different map icons (not just color/texture variations). The number of icons in each set can be increased via unlocked stretch goals beginning at the $15k funding level.\nResources: Music used for intro video: Ambient Music 6 by Essa.

However, I have years of experience with designing or running successful Kickstarter projects for various publishers (including some of the most successful Kickstarter projects by AAW Games and Kobold Press). This isn't my first rodeo, and I have already learned many of the \"difficult lessons\" that many first time project creators face.\n\nIn comparison with some of the more complex Kickstarter projects I've assisted with, this project is very straight forward. I foresee no likely hurdles in providing backers with the completed product as promised.\n\nHowever, as with any project in the making, there are inherent risks. As the sole producer of this material, if something where to happen to me that prevented continued content creation the project could become delayed. Even in that unlikely event, backers would still have full access to all of the content that was created for the project up to that point and a contingency is in place to release any pending and completed maps to backers should the gods choose to cast lightning to strike me down.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please drop me a message in the comments section for this project and I'll get an answer to you as soon as possible (as well as updating the FAQ here if deemed necessary).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Keep Me Updated", "descp": "Interested in this project, but not yet ready to back at a higher level?

What are the true aims of the shadowy organization desperate to find this nameless relic? Most importantly, what dark secret writhes at the heart of a small, picturesque town perched on the New England coast?\nThe Star on the Shore is an adventure for new players and veterans alike. It is an excellent introduction to the dark machinations of the Cthulhu Mythos in those placid parts of the world least able to cope with the cosmic horror of the Old Ones.\nThe Star on the Shore - Struggles Against Evil in 1920s New England is the first in a series of Call of Cthulhu Adventure modules produced by Dark Cult Games.\nThis product is produced under license from Chaosium Inc (www.chaosium.com). Call of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\nThe Star on the Shore is a sandbox adventure in a small coastal town with over 30 NPCs to interact with. Some are helpful, some are oblivious and some are hiding in plain sight. A strange unexplained astronomical event, a stolen statue, a murder of crows, and a cryptic clue lead you and your fellow investigators to a quiet vacation town that is far more sinister and deadly than it appears.\nThe story is a blend of real history and fiction that gives the story a life of its own. The adventure is the result of two years of research, writing and play testing. The real history is fascinating and flows right into the mythos world with very few changes. The more you discover, the deeper you are drawn toward your own insanity.\nThe Star on the Shore is written by Ben Burns, features the artwork of Evgeni Maloshenkov, edited by Alex Burns, and cover layout by Stephanie McAlea.\nJoin me in completing this great adventure, so that we can share it with the world. Please back my Kickstarter today to help make this adventure a reality.\nThe funds will go toward the artwork already commissioned, allow for even more artwork (stretch goals), commissioning of the cartography for the maps, the editing, printing and shipping.\n         $10 Print 8\" x 10\" of your choice\nOr $20 for Both\nFront Cover Art\nBack Cover Art\n $15 Cthulhu Insanity Dice\n $24 An extra Soft Cover Copy ($25 level and up)\n $39 An Extra Hard Cover Copy ($40 level and up)\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is almost no risk at all unless we sell a million or more, then there might be some delay in shipping, but I am willing to take on that challenge.

We are just beefing up some of the lesser encountered NPCs. The initial art is complete and the artist, Evgeni, is standing by ready to draw any stretch goal art and, the cartographer is ready to start on the maps as soon as we fund. I have worked with the Printer for the soft cover version and never had any problems. This will be my first time creating a hard cover print, so there is a risk there, I hope it is small.\n\nI have published 5 other modules before this one, so I am very familiar with the process, and do not expect any surprises.

They focus on the darker aspects of horror roleplaying and, as such, are recommended for a mature audience.\n\nMore inspired by True Detective and Hannibal than Pulp Horror, these adventures involved mythos corruption of the Human psyche and many feature direct contact with entities from outside space and time.\nIdeally suited to one evening's play, they have been written with a compact adventure style and Keepers will need a minimum of preparation time before being able to run them. Each scenario will also have tags in the header image so they can make quick decisions on what to run and then deal with dinner, family, or relaxing before their players arrive. \n\nFor example, a scenario might state: \nMissing FBI Agent-Innsmouth-Deep Ones-Dagon. \nSo the Keeper may think \"Well, we ran a deep one adventure last week, let's try another scenario.\" and then check another header for a scenario more suitable to that evening's play rather than having to skim the scenario.\nGeorge Cotronis' cover\nThe same team who worked on the critically acclaimed book 'The Things We Leave Behind' are also behind this anthology along with a motley crew of mythos tainted individuals who are serving their secrets to you in the form of horror scenarios. \nWhat People Said About Our Previous Modern Call of Cthulhu Anthology 'The Things We Leave Behind'.\n\n\"At times genuinely unsettling ( without ever being exploitative) It is one of the best collections I've seen, and I've played and collected CoC scenarios since 1983\"\nChristian Lehmann, contributing Author to 'Horror on the Orient Express'.\n\n\"Having read through the scenarios now I can say this is probably my favorite release of the year [...] its done with flair, excellently plotted, tightly written scenarios, simple but evocative images, and a overall aesthetic and style rarely seen outside of professional circles.\"\nDriveThruRPG Customer (Name Witheld by request)\n\n\"There is not a bad scenario in Things We Leave Behind, but \u2018Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away Home\u2019 and \u2018Forget Me Not\u2019 both stand out as fantastic scenarios, whilst \u2018The Night Season\u2019 is both fantastic and fantastically absurd. This is a good anthology and a good anthology of scenarios for the modern day, quite possibly the best anthology since the publication of Chaosium, Inc.\u2019s The Stars Are Right. Perhaps the highest praise that can be paid to Things We Leave Behind is that is not hard to imagine Miskatonic River Press publishing this collection, but what is definitely true is that Things We Leave Behind is the first great release for use with Call of Cthulhu, Seventh Edition.\"\nPookie, Reviews From R'Lyeh.\nJeff Moeller is the Editor, Stephanie McAlea will be doing the maps, Badger McInnes will be master of layout, and the art will be from a variety of artists to give each scenario the flavour it deserves. The full list of current writers (which we hope to expand for you) is listed below.\nHidden secrets in the countryside\n  The adventures deal with squalor, dark secrets, underground vice, and a host of other environments and elements. Gangland criminals, psychopaths, cultists, and Great Old Ones can all be found within these pages. Horror stretches its tendrils across the globe and, as such, please be aware that some of the themes are quite mature and are suitable for adult gamers only.\n1. Separation Anxiety, by Jeff Moeller. Disappearances of distinctive looking people stretching back decades leads to an \u201cagritourism\u201d self-pick farm in rural Ohio\n2. Undertow, by Simon Brake. A reclusive, depressed author lives alone with his black dog on the Californian coast, but is tracked down by curious investigators when his new book displays knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos  \n3. Sins of My Youth, by Oscar Rios. The investigators are stalked and attacked by a lunatic who seems to inexplicably know everything about them.   \n  4. Walter\u2019s Final Wish, by Matt Wiseman & Jennifer Thrasher. Cultist in an oldfolks home uses mythos techniques to brainwash the staff for evil ends.  \n5. Whose Fuel is Men and Stones, by Jason Williams. Solo adventure where investigator is a potential sacrificial target of middle-eastern cultists who wish to summon Cthugha in London.\n6. Pulvis Et Umbra Sumus, by Matthew Sanderson. Out of the blue, the investigators are invited to the reading of the will of a wealthy recluse in Maine. However, none of them have ever heard of this person, but they definitely need the money.\n7. The Great God Awto, by Jo Kreil. Several individuals who are working on a new concept car are killed in strange and suspicious accidents.\n8. Spilsbury #9485, by Adam Gauntlett. A butchered murder victim stuffed in a steamer trunk and left on a train in 1932 keeps turning up again and again throughout the decades, and whenever it appears disaster follows as time bends, breaks, and opens up to alternate dimensions allowing the things From Beyond through.  \n9. Lights Out, by Joe Trier.

Thank you so much. - Danny\nDry leaves crackle under your feet as you make your way up the hill towards the dark manse, your path lit by a bold harvest moon. The taste of rain is in the air and you hear a distant peal of thunder. The townsfolk begged you not to come up here. Not tonight. Especially not tonight.\nYou reach the grounds as storm clouds slip across the moon, darkening the yard. You make your way carefully to the front door but find it barred from the outside. It would take a crowbar and some muscle to get in this way. The windows are high off the ground but seem breakable. You test your theory with a large rock, and the glass shatters as the first bolt of lightning slashes across the sky. You climb up and through the broken pane, carefully turning and lowering yourself to the floor of the room inside. The townsfolk may be afraid of this place buy you aren\u2019t.\n\u201cGood Evening\u201d says a deep strong voice that makes you whirl with shock. Your eyes search the darkness but you see nothing. A flash of lightning verifies to your eyes that you are alone.\n\u201cI trust you will be staying?\u201d says the voice. \u201cExcellent, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had company.\u201d Lightning flashes again. The drawing room is empty of everything but old furniture. You turn and scramble to the window, ready to leap through it and to the ground below. But the window isn\u2019t broken any more. Somehow it\u2019s healed.\nYou stop to puzzle this impossibility for the briefest of moments. That\u2019s all it takes. The voice in the darkness gets you, and nobody hears you scream. You should have listened to the townsfolk. You should have come better prepared\u2026for The Dread House.\nGhostly RPG Adventures in a Haunted Mansion of Epic Proportions. Fully realized with floor tiles, miniatures, terrain, and music.\n  Immerse Yourself In the Dread House!\nMusic: A haunting melody by German composers Erdenstern sets the mood for this epic adventure. The suite is inspired by the Dread Wedding. It is provided free to all backers who pledge $10 or more.\nFiction: Ghost stories by professional authors Kevin Andrew Murphy and Richard Lee Byers allow GMs to enjoy the backstory of key adventures in a fun way. These \"Ghost Stories\" can be enjoyed by players after the adventure concludes.\nGM Screen: A custom version of The World's Greatest Screen - Mini. This vinyl 12 pocket screen comes with 12 4\" x 6\" cards that have game stats on one side and spooky art on the other. Customize your screen to set the mood for your players.\nArt Goes On The Players Side - Secrets Go On Your Side\nFloor Tiles: Presented in two sizes, the small pack and the large pack, this accessory allows the GM to BUILD THE HOUSE AS THE PLAYERS EXPLORE IT! When combined with miniatures from this Kickstarter, it amplifies the game experience. NOTE: reward Tiers only contain the SMALL Floor Tile Pack. To upgrade to the LARGE, please add-on $10 to any Tier that rewards the SMALL pack. You can add EITHER pack to any pledge level as an add-on.\nFloorplans Come With Carpets To Decorate Rooms\n  This is the size of the 1st Floor (Work in Progress)\nThe Dread Wedding Adventure Pack: Up your game with this collection of 28mm miniatures. These 8 miniatures are specific to the Dread Wedding storyline, which is the primary adventure in the book. NPCs, villains, and terrain all enhance the experience. When the Kickstarter begins, 4 of the figures are revealed, and 4 are hidden by doors. Stretch goals reveal those hidden figures.\nThe Stars of The Dread Wedding\nDread House Add-On Packs: Master the table and wow your players with this collection of Gothic furnishings packaged in easy-to-buy room packs. All pieces are cast in white resin, are unpainted, and can be used as-is (minor assembly required on a few pieces).\nSet The Scene With 25+ Pieces of Themed Terrain\n    Stretch Goals are represented by Story Packs. When a new story pack is earned, everybody gets new stuff!\n  Each story pack adds two new adventures to the book (thus increasing it's page count). Sometimes a story pack will introduce a new Ghost Story by one of our fiction authors. Every story pack introduces new tiles which are added *as a bonus* to the Large Floor Tile Pack.\nPerhaps most exciting, stretch goals can upgrade miniatures in the Dread House Adventure Pack, the Eldritch Tales Adventure Pack, and the Dark Secrets Adventure Pack, replacing doors with new monsters, NPCs, or terrain pieces!\nThere are 7 pre-planned stretch goals for this project. If all are completed The Dread Wedding Adventure Pack will contain 8 unique figures specific to that adventure, and the large Floor Tile Pack will contain about 100 pages of tiles!\nAll items below can be added on to any reward tier.

It will *at least* include party invitations, The Dread Wedding Lay by Erdenstern, and a short adventure playable with Pathfinder, 5th edition, and/or Call of Cthulhu.\nWave 2 - Book and Tiles: all paper products will ship together as soon as the book is complete. Book, tiles, mini screen, and inserts will ship in the same package in early 2017.\nWave 3 - Miniatures: since minis take time to develop, they will all ship together when completed. European customers will be given the option to ship Wave 2 and 3 together to save on freight. These will most likely ship in spring 2017.\nReward Chart\n  If you have questions please contact Danny via Kickstarter\n  Traveling in remote territory in late fall, the characters find themselves in the sleepy town of Sorenton. There they discover that a curse has been plaguing the people of the town for decades. The towns liege lord and protector Jazef Tashmere was long ago destroyed by his old enemies, the Dread Lords. Kaseh Tashmere, the manor in which Tashmere\u2019s family lived for generations is now cursed and haunted. It has come to be known as the Dread House.\nThe group learns that the house fell on the night before the wedding of Tashmere's eldest daughter. A curse was placed upon the home, and as a result, a dark storm falls upon Sorenton each year during the Festival of the Dead. The PCs will be asked to help rid the town of that curse. Radeg, captain of the town guard is just one such soul that will attempt to guide them to the grounds where they will face many supernatural dangers.\nWhen they enter The Dread House, the group will face its curse head on. Trapped between earth and hell, the house hosts hundreds of ghosts, held there by a demon spirit known only as the Pumpkin Man. Every year, these ghosts pantomime the wedding they never attended, hoping for the day that someone will break their curse and set them free.\nThe group will explore the house and uncover its mysteries. They will ultimately do battle with the The Pumpkin Man, the chaotic dark servant of the Dread Lords. Aided by the ghosts of Jazef Tashmere and his daughter Chrissy, the players will seek to break the curse, lay the trapped souls to rest, and return The Dread House to the people of Sorenton.\nWhether or not they succeed is completely up to you, the Pumpkin Man, and all the restless spirits...in The Dread House.\n This project is licensed by Chaosium. \"Call of Cthulhu\" is a Chaosium trademark and is used with permission. www.chaosium.com \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks in every project but we've taken steps to reduce them as much as possible. The Dread House is protected from project creep, and the bulk of the project is complete at this time. Backer options were kept simple and functional. Software advances allow for easier order fulfillment, address changes, and add-ons. Staggered shipping of rewards will mitigate the waiting period associated with some of the components of the project.\n\nDespite these preparations, small projects like this one are vulnerable to life circumstances. The Grande Temple of Jing was plagued by so many of them that at times, it seemed that Jing himself was toying with us. We don't really believe that, but just in case, for this project - we sprinkled salt around the outside of the house, put a priest on retainer, and sacrificed a rubber chicken.

It has been written for Call of Cthulhu and will be updated for the 7th edition of the rules. \nBack in 2007 I answered a call from famed Call of Cthulhu\u00ae writer and editor Keith \"Doc\" Herber to submit ideas for his upcoming The Outer Gods scenario book. He had specific ideas about making the book different from other scenario collections, and he had a high bar he wanted each scenario to reach. We worked together on the scenario over the next 1.5 years until his untimely death in 2009, but before that, he approved Sun Spots for inclusion in The Outer Gods. His specific words were: \"I think we have a winner here, and one with a lot of fun possibilities. Nice job...\" I hope this project will do his vision justice.\nRight now, I have written nearly 28,000 words for this scenario, play-tested it multiple times (both with friends and at conventions), and have commissioned art by seasoned Cthulhu veterans Jason Eckhardt, Reuben Dodd, Caleb Cleveland and Chris Huth. I'm also bringing back most of my team from my previous Kickstarter (He Who Laughs Last): Gregory G. Geiger for design and layout, Jake Coolidge for maps, and Cynthia Douglas Chernoff as my editor. \nThe funding for this project will be used for completing maps and art, finishing the design and layout of the books, and having the book edited, produced and delivered into your nice warm hands! I can't wait to show you!\nHere is an amazing illustration from Mr Dodd!\n   Now that we're funded, let's talk about stretch goals. I've thought carefully about them and want to make sure that they add to your game but will not impact the scope of the project. \nHere are the stretch goals we've got planned:\nFUNDED $7500: More Art -- Add four more b/w half-page illustrations by our amazing artist Reuben Dodd.\nFUNDED $8500: GM Kit Part 1 -- Provide Playtest notes illuminating the various lessons learned throughout the years of playtesting this, as well as provide a full transcript of the first playtest from 2008. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\nFUNDED $10,000: Red Valley Visitor's Guide -- I will work with Gregory Geiger to incorporate Jake Coolidge's hand-drawn map of Red Valley into a 1920s-style visitor's guide handout. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above, and will be provided as a print copy for the Deluxe level ($70) and above.\nFUNDED $12,000: GM Kit Part 2 -- I'll create 6 pre-generated Call of Cthulhu PCs and put them with the playtest notes. This will be available as a PDF with every pledge $10 and above.\n$14,000: Headshots -- Reuben Dodd will illustrate 10 b/w headshots for various NPCs to go directly into the book. \n$15,000: Director's Cut -- One really fun and interesting scene that I worked on extensively with Keith Herber, but was cut from the final product, will be added as an addendum, to be used by GMs at will. We'll also have Reuben Dodd add two half-page b/w illustrations to this chapter as well. \n\u201cDave Sokolowski\u2019s Sun Spots harkens back to the classic Call of Cthulhu scenarios that we all love and dials up the danger with a number of intriguing twists including a new take on an old god. Detailed, multi-layered, and engaging, Sun Spots shines with interesting characters, nefarious plots, and ancient evil. Sokolowski has another winner on his hands.\u201d - Stuart Boon, author of the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Shadows over Scotland\n\"Dave Sokolowski submitted Sun Spots to Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber for his planned epic scenario book, The Outer Gods. Doc worked with Dave to tweak, build, and perfect it, and was proud of the final result. Sadly, in a blow to the entire community, Doc passed away suddenly long before the project could be completed. It should be noted that Doc\u2019s vision for The Outer Gods contained the following requirement on the spec sheet, \u201cEvery scenario in this book has to be great.\u201d Those who knew Doc and his considerable work for the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game were aware that nothing got approved unless it was truly excellent work. This was the man behind H. P. Lovecraft's Arkham, H. P. Lovecraft's Dunwich, Keeper's Companion, 1920s Investigator's Companion, Spawn of Azathoth, Trail of Tsathogghua, Fungi from Yuggoth, and New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley to name only a few. Keith \u201cDoc\u201d Herber shaped Call of Cthulhu and made it a truly wonderful game. And if he thought Sun Spots was great, what\u2019s your excuse?\" - Tom Lynch, co-founder of Miskatonic River Press \n\"In presenting a new interpretation of an Outer God, Sun Spots brings an uncaring and elemental influence to bear down on New England, but this is pleasingly manifest in an all too human a fashion\u2014pride, belief, and religious mania that are as much a threat to the investigators as the Daemon Sultan is himself. Sun Spots is a delightfully balmy investigation into the dangers of sun worship.\" - Pookie, Reviews from R'lyeh (the full review is here: http://rlyehreviews.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/shining-for-cthulhu-dark.html)\nWe have the following levels of pledge available:\nThanks ($1): Any amount of pledge (from $1 up) will see your name on our Kickstarter Supporter list. Many thanks indeed!\nDigital ($10): This level receives the Sun Spots PDF from DTRPG, as well as any and all stretch goals! All levels from $10 up will receive the PDF copy.\nSoft-Copy ($30): At this level backers will receive a soft-cover copy POD Sun Spots book, plus the PDF and Thanks.\nDeluxe Hard Copy ($70): This level of backing will receive a hard-backed copy POD Sun Spots book, signed by me, plus the PDF and Thanks. These backers will also receive hard-copies of the three maps and any handouts designed for the scenario (this is what makes it \"deluxe\").\nCharacters ($100): In addition to everything at the Deluxe level, I will create 6 Call of Cthulhu 1920s-era PC sheets to your specifications, and then give you both digital and hard-copies of them.\nEntitled ($120): Get everything at the Deluxe level, then choose from a list of 20 NPCs and locations in the scenario that you can name to your liking (scenario-appropriate, please). People can choose in the order in which they chose this option (e.g. first backer at this level chooses from the list first).\nClose Traveler ($250): I will travel within 100 miles of San Francisco to run the scenario for you and your friends. You'll get the personalized PC sheets, 1 hard copy (for you), and 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends). It will be a good time. I'll bring snacks.\nTraveler ($1300): At this level, I will travel anywhere in the USA or Canada, bring 1 hand-signed hard-back copy of Sun Spots, 6 digital books plus handouts (for you and your friends), and run a game for you and up to 5 of your friends. I'll also bring snacks and my gregarious personality. (You will also receive the Deluxe handouts and PC sheets).  \nAdd-Ons\nDue to popular demand, I will make additional soft-cover POD books available at the $30 pledge level. And if you\u2019ve already purchased one book, I will subsidize part of the shipping. Here is what you can do if you want to add-on a softcover POD book to your existing pledge:\nIf you live in the USA or UK: Add $35 total\nIf you live outside the USA/UK: Add $40 total \nShipping\nFurthermore, for shipping of the physical books, I have tried to strike a balance for both myself and backers. I will subsidize part of the shipping, as well as streamline the shipping rates to avoid confusion. \nUS backers will pay $5, UK backers $10 and other international backers $20 for the soft-back copy reward shipments. Hard-copies will be a bit more for UK, as I have to ship all the boxes to my house first, before shipping them out (except where I meet you in person). I hope this will be a middle ground where shipping doesn't overwhelm the budget but backers don't have to absorb the entire cost.  \nI have play-tested this game multiple times since I completed the first draft back in 2009, and it has been honed and edited down to a very clean and crisp story. What used to be a very wide sandbox game with very few boundaries for the investigators now has clarity and focus. There is still a very strong sandbox feel, but the scenario now has guides and structure to get the players heading in the right direction before letting them go.\nWith this much playtesting, I was forced to pull a couple of scenes that I had worked on with Doc, but ultimately got in the way of the best possible scenario. With enough funding it might be possible to clean up this content and get it back in the book in an Appendix. We might even be able to do some art for it.\nI have run this game at multiple conventions (Dundracon, Celesticon, and Big Bad Con) as well as with local gaming groups. I believe it is finally ready for you.\nThis scenario has been around a long time and I really want to get it into your hands, to finally realize Doc's vision, but I need help with funding to get it over the finish line. I want the book to look and feel like the Cthulhu gaming books of the 1980-90s, specifically in the vein of Escape from Innsmouth, which Kevin Ross and Doc created with a host of talented artists and writers. Most importantly, I want this book to be something Doc would love.\nI need funding now to finish the book. To finish the art and maps, to get professional design and layout, and then have it edited so it all comes together in one amazing package. If you pledge now, then we can make it happen together. \nFinally, while the Kickstarter project is live, He Who Laughs Last in all formats, as well as the GM Kit and Short Fiction, will be on sale with 33% off on DTRPG here. \nCall of Cthulhu\u2122 is a trademark of Chaosium Inc and is used under licence.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe scenario has been written and playtested multiple times. Multiple art pieces are complete and more are in progress. This leaves design, layout, editing and production.\n\nThe biggest risks have to do with people and life. Right now, the team is working hard at the project and the book is scheduled to be delivered well on time. I spent many years as a professional project manager, and I have the skills and understanding to keep a project on track. \n\nThe key to any good project is communication. Expect at least monthly updates from me, and I will strive to be transparent in all aspects of my business dealings with my backers. Things may and do happen that can sidetrack a project. But with transparency and accountability we'll still get the book in your hands in the best possible manner.\n\nPlease refer to my previous project He Who Laughs Last if you want to see my communication style first-hand.

My goal is always to quickly and efficiently deliver our products so that you can enjoy them without getting into a slog. I mean, remember, no 1980s module was more than 35 pages, and a classic like G2 Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl was only 8 pages, but it was pure genius! Plus, all backers have the option getting PDF versions as well for easy reference on their computers!\nI\u2019ve already created & fulfilled the initial three modules, The Folio #1 Beneath Roslof Keep, The Folio #2 Tremors in the Machine, and The Folio #3 Curse of the Violet Corruption right here on Kickstarter. Now I want to put The Folio #4 in your hands just as fast. At AotG, we are about quality, content, and speed, and I like to think of myself as a time machine that can bridge the gap between things I loved in the past and what technology can bring us today.\nInstead of making gaming anvils, I\u2019ve drilled the artistry of the game down, found the gems of an extended campaign, and delivered it in such a way that both new and old gamers alike can enjoy and play without taxing their life schedules. In the end, isn\u2019t gaming about being fun for everyone, not just the players? The Folio\u2019s goal is to ensure that, and always give folks the very best quality \u2018lean and mean\u2019 adventures we can.\nMy Project: The Folio #4 is a 1st Edition & 5th Edition combined gaming module. It will be produced as an 8x11\u201d, removable cover [11x17\" once removed], adventure with mostly b/w interior artwork. There are two interior booklets, The Gazetteer and The Dungeon, with the final size being roughly 40 pages of content.\nWho\u2019s it for? ALL gamers, both new gamers and old gamers as it is easily expandable or playable as is.The concept is to allow gamers a starting point for adventure that can be modified to their liking while providing excellent reference content and framework.The base mechanic will be for 1st Edition with 5th Edition insets, but I\u2019ve designed it to be readily modified to any fantasy game, and don't forget the PDF!\nInside Dungeon Cover for ROS4!\nWhat\u2019s in it? All original content. It has been written by myself and my OSR compatriot Mark Timm, with incredible cover art from Dragon Magazine cover artist legend Daniel Horne, and interior artwork by skilled black and white illustrators Brian 'Glad' Thomas, Chet Minton, Matthew Ray, Michael Wilson, Janet Aulisio, and Jeff Laubenstein. I'm even going to throw in at least one interior illustrations by Jim Holloway, because I can never get enough Holloway. We are intent on providing a polished and modern design with creatively nostalgic content that transcends a particular age. The Folio #4 will contain a 3-D map, a Gazetteer, a monster section, a new monster unique to the setting, DM\u2019s notes and guides, and a full adventure.\nWhen? The bulk of the module is complete, we only need to be funding so we can begin the full printing process. This means that PDFs will go out after the campaign wraps in September, and the physical copies should be to you no later than November!\nFull 'wrap' removable cover that acts as a DM Screen!\nWhy Roslof Keep? Well, because I loved gaming artist Jim Roslof, have toured his studio, and always thought he should have received more credit for his work in the dawn of RPGs. This tribute is for his work on the cover of B2 Keep on the Borderlands.\nI can\u2019t do this without you: Art of the Genre needs your help! We've trimmed out all excess costs and have a break even amount of $5,000.This covers the printing, shipping, design, mapping, and the incredible story telling artwork we\u2019ll be using in these adventures. We have already devoted countless hours to seeing this product come together, but to make it \u2018real\u2019 and available to all players, we need your help. We believe in this dream, and we hope you do too!\nInterior 3D Mapping for Folio #3, and you'll find the same in all Folios!\nWhat happens if we pass the goal? If we pass the goal, it will allow us to begin production on new stretch additions for the campaign as well as the next adventure in the series [as we did with The Folio #1, #2, & #3 KS campaigns], and our hope is to find enough support along the way to complete the entire six part Roslof Keep Campaign series of modules. Bottom line, our goal is to make a truly fantastic and age-defying piece of gaming history, each penny we receive goes toward that. This \u2018put everything into the product\u2019 mentality is why this Kickstarter is so thin on \u2018rewards\u2019, as SWAG steals from the overall content of the project, the product, and the backers, as well as slowing the process of getting the module into your hands!\n*TRADEMARK DISCLAIMER\n\"G2 Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl\" and \"B2 Keep on the Borderlands\" and \"D&D\" are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC.

You guys demanded more dungeons, so here I am!\nDungeons on Demand are instant dungeons you can drop into your campaign, each is designed for 4-5 player parties of specified levels, and each dungeon is complete with a back story, hand drawn maps, traps, puzzles, and reference information to monsters and treasure. You can customize each one to fit in your campaign however you wish, and each one can be played through in one or two gaming sessions (depending upon how long you play!)\nI\u2019ve taken a lot of feedback into consideration going into this next volume. For instance, each module is now edited by the talented Rico Gilbert. Additionally, all the Dungeons on Demand adventures now come with player safe maps, so you can give your players something to look at without giving away hidden creatures, traps, or treasure!\nTwo sets of maps for each encounter area, one for players, one for GMs!\nEach Dungeons on Demand PDF contains the following:  \nA dungeon back story to explain what's going on. You have complete control over what's going on and why in each adventure, but this explanation is used to tie everything together. It also adds some flavor to each encounter, and readies you for questions and actions from your players you may not have anticipated.  \nAdventure hooks and quests to get the PCs to the dungeon. How did the players find themselves here? Are they looking for someone or something? Each dungeon presents three great reasons to bring the PCs there outside of one you might use for your own campaign.  \nHand-drawn maps of the entire dungeon for the Game Master. Additionally, each distinct area has its own map as well, labeled with details pertinent to the encounter. Each map uses handy icons to reference what's going on in the area - hostile creatures, hidden traps, treasure, NPCs, you name it!  \nQuick reference icons used on maps and encounter descriptions\nMaps for each area without labels or icons you can present to the players. This gives the players a visual of the encounter area. They're also useful when playing the game online! \nFull breakdowns of each encounter. Complete with references to monsters and magic items, detailed descriptions of traps and puzzles, monster strategies, what developments come from combat, and little odds and ends to brighten the role-playing experience.  \nCombat Difficulty Gauges rate encounter challenges from 1 (very easy) to 5 (deadly!) stars. This gives GMs a quick idea of how hard a fight is!\nA wrap up guide for you to go over after completing the dungeon. Are any monsters or bad guys still alive? What's their deal? Are all the quests or adventure hooks finished? What experience points and rewards are left to be given out?  \nAn appendix for unique monsters, NPCs, and items. Each dungeon has a unique foe or trinket to give your experience something new and different.\nCAMPAIGN GOALS & STRETCH GOALS:\nDungeons on Demand: Volume Two is a reality!\n Thanks making the next volume a reality!\nThe NPC Codex is coming to life!\nI will create an NPC Codex - a handy guide of NPCs you can drop into your campaign. There's no lengthy backstories or alignments here, you decide whether the NPC is an ally or a villain. This will be released as a free supplement on DriveThruRPG and included in the complete Volume Two of Dungeons on Demand adventures.\nYou can see a preview here with Nezira Darkscale, who also happens to be featured in No Laughing Matter.\nLooks like there's some cities and towns coming as well!\nI will create a supplement of city and town maps.

A bell sounding somewhere... somewhere distant?\nEveryone that pledges at the CAMPAIGN level or higher will receive a bonus, level 17 adventure.

At the end of each dungeon, each player should have accumulated enough experience points to gain a level! \nThe dungeons are presented in full color, PDF format - you can easily print them for reference later or open them on your tablet or smart phone during play. \nFor a 2nd-Level Party!\nThe town of Oallhelm is small and remote \u2013 for years they\u2019ve been prosperous, peaceful, and self-sufficient. That's why it was such a surprise when the hobgoblin Thetch Blindeye led a war band of goblins into town and started terrorizing Oallhelm\u2019s citizens!\n\nThe PCs are on the outskirts of Oallhelm when they learn town square is overrun with the invaders \u2013 the goblins are now feasting in the streets, starting fires, setting traps, and terrorizing anyone left behind. They must drive out these mischief makers to save the town!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM MISCHIEF MAKERS \nFor a 5th-Level Party!\nLaugher\u2019s Gorge occupies a stretch of the canyon that runs through the local badlands, named for the haunting laughter that occasionally erupts from its depths. When travelers using the road past the gorge become infected with cackle fever, it\u2019s up to the party to find out what\u2019s causing the mysterious laughing sickness. Though they find a pack of gnolls infesting the canyon, it\u2019s no joke when they discover who (or what) is pulling the strings!\nLaughter and humor are central themes in No Laughing Matter. The players are met with the will of a prankster god, riddles to solve, and may be forced to come up with some jokes of their own. But this isn\u2019t an adventure to take lightly. If the party underestimates Laugher\u2019s Gorge, they may find themselves infected with cackle fever\u2026 and there\u2019s nothing funny about that!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM NO LAUGHING MATTER \nFor a 9th-Level Party!\nWhen the trade galley Fairmorning fails to make it in to port, it\u2019s up to the PCs to investigate. When their search leads them to the depths of the seafloor and a mysterious underwater shrine, more questions arise than answers!  \nA collective of sahuagin barons, led by their matron Mes\u2019Dal\u2019Umbrak (Sahuagin for \u201cMother-of-the-Deathly-Tide\u201d) is using the shrine to concoct something evil and twisted in the deep. The party (with a little help from the concerned merfolk) must defeat the sahuagin forces to keep the seas safe\u2026 but sooner or that sinking feeling sets in - there's something much more evil at hand!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM THAT SINKING FEELING\nFor a 13th-Level Party!\nYuan-ti sovereign Erut-Ro spent his life enslaving free nations, subjugating masses, and ruling with an iron fist... and continued to do so in death when he became a terrifying mummy lord! Erut-Ro\u2019s reign of oppression ended when a powerful group of warriors sealed the mummy and his pyramid away in another dimension for 3,000 years.  \nNow, three millenia later, the mummy lord's pyramid has suddenly sprung back into existence! One might think 3,000 years spent sealed away from society would settle Erut-Ro\u2019s sadism, but, as they say, old habits are hard to break. The mummy lord intends to start right where he left off... as soon as he recovers his full power. The party must contend with the ancient monsters that await them in his pyramid before they can wrap up the mummy lord\u2019s evil plans for good!\nREAD AN EXCERPT FROM OLD HABITS \nInterested in getting a glimpse of Dungeons on Demand?

It's up to the PCs to clear their nest, recover stolen goods, and rescue their hostages. Will the players be bested by these dirty birds? Or will they have the bandits eating crow?\nThe backer levels are grouped into the following tiers:\nThe first thing you should do is pledge!

I now have two broad campaigns going, and this includes installments in both.  The Dimgaard campaign is an XP driven campaign, and we're at 8th level, so here are the 7th level adventures that we played last month (polished up with sidebars and whatnot).  Here is the first of the five as a preview: http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/153614/DG26-Greenville\nThe Drow Conspiracy Saga is a milestone, fast advancement campaign - one adventure per level.  And we're on adventure 11.  1-7 were in previous kickstarters, so here are DC8, DC9, and DC10.\nThere is a new 1st level Dimgaard adventure that I used for a group of new players recently, and I wanted an additional 1st level adventure to square of the 1st level adventures in the Dimgaard series; there were only 3 1st level adventures, while every other block has at least four.\nThere is also an encounter gallery for 7th level PCs.  These are encounters that serve specific function (Inquisition, or retaliations), or single events that are not part of the storyline.  \nHere are the blurbs (which may revise on final edits):\nDG26 Greenville: Odill is a large city where corruption is rampant. And there are numerous strong organizations vested in preventing reform. Even with a regime change, the Cult of Orcus destroyed, and the drug cartels damaged, the reform of Odill seems a Herculean challenge. Maybe it is time for a different strategy. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The first episode in the Villages of Odill Arc.\nDG27 Shaky Alliance: The communities around Odill are not natural allies. Each was established around different philosophies and work to protect its niche in the economy of greater Odill. Forging them into a political block capable of challenging the overshadowing power of Odill is no trivial task. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level adventurers. The second episode in the Villages of Odill Arc. \nDG28 The Question: Slavery has a history that predates humanity. However, many organizations view it as an oppressive and inherently evil institution that should be opposed at every turn. Some even believe that it is worth any sacrifice to overthrow it. It the divisive issue between the Odill villages that agree with reform and those that support Prince Priogrim. Can the PCs keep the Odill region from exploding in civil strife? A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The third episode in the Villages Of Odill Arc.\nDG29 Allies in Trouble: The Order of Tythia was inspired by the alliance\u2019s determination to reform Odill. With the help of the Order of Metal and the Olidammarans, the Tythians tried to inspire a wave of slave rebellions in the agricultural communities, but failed. And during the attempt several were captured and are in the custody of Prince Priogrim. Can the PCs save their allies? A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The fourth episode of the Villages of Odill Arc.\nDG30 Crusade: Things are coming to a head in the rivalry between Odill and its surrounding communities. With both sides nearly evenly matched, the heroes give the edge to Odill\u2019s opposition. But Odill\u2019s position as the most influential city in the area and the seat of the Inquisition gives it an option with dramatic consequences. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 7th level characters. The fifth and final episode in the Villages of Odill Arc.\nDGS14 Natural Balance: One person\u2019s dedicated defense of an ideal is another person\u2019s terrorism. What happens when progress endangers the natural order \u2013 or even nature itself? Can the PCs resolve the differences between the naturalists and the crafters? A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 1st level PCs.\nDC8 War Against the Drow: An agreement reached between the orcs of Fhuu and their neighbors for a coordinated campaign against the Drow Empire. Reserves mustered, weapons sharpened, armor polished \u2013 what could go wrong. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 8th level characters; the eighth episode in the Drow Conspiracy Epic.\nDC9 Drow Island: The campaign against St. Aurelius was thwarted. It is clear that the drow are an imposing force. Rather than an attack on St. Aurelius, a penetration behind aimed at a drow base might have more success. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 9th level characters. The ninth episode in the Drow Conspiracy Epic.\nDC10 Liberation from the Drow: If the capitol (St. Aurelius) can be liberated, it likely would trigger a widespread revolt that the drow could not resist without aid from their Abyssal resources. But the drow cannot draw from their Abyssal resources \u2013 at least for a while. So St. Aurelius is prime for a counterstrike to free it from the yoke of the drow. A D&D 5th edition adventure for 1-8 10th level characters. The tenth episode in the Drow Conspiracy Epic.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point, I think we are pretty secure in the process.

Additionally, I'm kind of wanting to get more comfortable with CC3. \nSo at $1,300, I'll commit to replacing the city and village maps in the Dimgaard campaign with unique ones.

Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our two Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2014-2015 longshoreman west coast work slow down that delayed all of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event did not occur in either of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount of the model.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

And now it\u2019s time for 5E!\nSummary of Kickstarter:\nThis Kickstarter funds the publication of two adventure modules for our Fifth Edition Fantasy line. With stretch goals, we would also like to give backers a third adventure from our Free RPG Day release.\nThe format for our Fifth Edition Fantasy modules is short, 16- to 32-page modules playable in a few sessions. They are stand-alone, world-neutral, and easy to integrate into your ongoing campaign.\nDepending on funding levels and stretch goals cleared, the adventures may be enhanced with additional content, including bonus encounters and setting material.\nFinally, we would like your feedback on what YOU want for Fifth Edition. We invite backers to comment on what they would like Goodman Games to publish for our next 5E Kickstarter!\nCover Art to the Fifth Edition Fantasy Line\n  Fifth Edition Fantasy is Here!\nOur new line of 5E modules is called simply Fifth Edition Fantasy. Authored by well-known adventure designers Michael Curtis and Chris Doyle (each with more than a dozen published adventures under his belt), these adventures combine the streamlined game mechanics of 5E with challenging scenarios explicitly designed to appeal to both long-time gamers and neonates alike. Each adventure includes new races, backgrounds, monsters, spells, and magical items suitable for any 5E campaign.\nWhat are the goals of this Kickstarter? We have four goals with this Kickstarter:\n1. Launch the next two Fifth Edition Fantasy modules. These are FEF #3: The Pillars of Pelagia (by Chris Doyle) and FEF #4: War-lock (by Michael Curtis). Depending on stretch goals achieved, they may be expanded with new encounters and even more content.\n2. Offer our first two 5E adventures to Kickstarter backers. If you haven\u2019t already purchased them from your local store, you can add on to your pledge with the second printings of FEF #1: Glitterdoom (by Michael Curtis) and FEF #2: The Fey Sisters\u2019 Fate (by Chris Doyle).\n3. Listen to your feedback on 5E. Each edition of Dungeons & Dragons is different, with different player and DM needs. As you support this Kickstarter, we\u2019d love to hear what you want from us in our next 5E project.\n4. Give away a free 5E module on Free RPG Day. Yes, you read that right! The ultimate stretch goal for this Kickstarter is to create an entirely new adventure, which will be free to all backers and also printed for free distribution on Free RPG Day! Fifth Edition Fantasy #5 \u2013 for free! That\u2019s 5 F words in the tagline and the last is \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 has a good ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\nSample interior illustration from The Pillars of Pelagia\nTell Me About the Adventures! \nCertainly!

Here are links with art, previews, reviews, and more information:\nFifth Edition Fantasy #1: Glitterdoom\nFifth Edition Fantasy #2: The Fey Sisters\u2019 Fate\nFifth Edition Fantasy #3: The Pillars of Pelagia\nFifth Edition Fantasy #4: War-lock\nHow long will these take to write? The adventures are already written and edited. All maps and interior art are complete, and layout will begin the moment this Kickstarter concludes and we know how much bonus content we can print. Goodman Games has a strong track record of delivering on our promises, and this Kickstarter will continue that record.\nHow can I support the Kickstarter? You can pledge for the adventure modules, of course! Our pledge levels allow for funding of the two new Fifth Edition Fantasy modules, plus add-ons of the two already-published Fifth Edition Fantasy modules.\nWhat makes our adventures special? After publishing more than 100 modules continuously for over a decade, Goodman Games has developed a reputation for a clear perspective on fantasy adventure:\nOur adventure content focuses on unique encounters with unexpected dangers, memorable scenes that conjure strong visuals in the players\u2019 minds, and non-clich\u00e9d plots.\nOur modules are meant to be played, not just to be read. They are structured as short adventures designed to be gamed \u201cin real life\u201d over a few sessions. You can fit these adventures into your busy lifestyle.\nOur adventures are designed to be great adventures \u2013 and not something else. You won\u2019t find our adventures to be thinly veiled attempts to publish an appendix of \u201ccrunchy bits.\u201d Sure, we include some new material, but our primary goal is to ensure that you and your friends have fun playing the adventure. You\u2019ll walk away with great memories of your game sessions. That\u2019s our promise and that\u2019s what we deliver on.\nOur writers are battle-tested and experienced, and it shows in the content. We know that running a published adventure is different from running one of your own creation. You\u2019ll find it easy to integrate our modules into your campaigns because we know how to keep them world-neutral, stand-alone, and easy to ramp up fast.\nAll of our adventures are playtested thoroughly before publication. We believe they play as well or better than how they read. The adventures for this Kickstarter were written months ago, and were playtested long before the Kickstarter was launched. We\u2019re not \u201cracing against the Kickstarter\u201d to write the adventures. \nSample interior illustration from War-Lock\nWhat support is offered? \u201cThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d as the old saying goes. Having published adventures for the third and fourth editions of the game, we\u2019ve learned a few things. Here\u2019s what you can expect as a buyer of our 5E products:\nDownload codes in print products: All of our 5E adventures include a printed code that allows you to download a PDF edition of the module. This allows us to keep the electronic edition current, and you can receive any update seamlessly. (Note: The codes in our first two modules were unfortunately posted to an online pirate site, so future modules will feature randomized codes different in each copy. If you find the download codes from the first two modules don\u2019t work for you, please email us for assistance.)\nContinuous updates: As we learned publishing modules in the transition from 3.0 to 3.5, and the later revisions to 4E, the game can evolve in a way that makes earlier material less relevant. We will update the PDF editions of our modules to stay current (as we have already done with the PDF editions of our first two 5E modules). As a print purchaser, you have ongoing access to these PDF updates.\nMultiple printings: Our adventures have always proven quite popular, and frequently sell out. Whenever we reprint an adventure, we do another editorial pass to correct any minor typos, rules updates, or updated playtest feedback. For the first two 5E modules, you\u2019ll be receiving the second printing, which is already updated with revisions from the first printing.\nOngoing support: Have a question or comment? You can find us. Over more than a decade we have built a reputation for responsiveness to customers. And we love to game with you at cons! Last year, you could find our crew at DunDraCon, TotalCon, Coscon, GaryCon, MepaCon, ConGlomeration, North Texas RPG Convention, Origins, DexCon, KantCon, Gen Con, Tacticon, Pacificon, GrandCon, Necronomicon, Con on the Cob, Gamehole Con, TsunamiCon, U-Con, Post-Apocalypticon, and Marmalade Dog. You\u2019ll find us on the con circuit again this year. Come game with us! And if you have a local con we missed, let us know!\nOne of the maps from War-Lock (players, avert your eyes!)\nStretch Goals\nHelp us make these modules even more awesome! With sufficient funding, we intend to expand our FEF line with a bunch of new stretch goals. Here's the confirmed and still-to-be-decided stretch goals:\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! Starting at $7,000, we will expand Fifth Edition Fantasy #3: The Pillars of Pelagia with several new encounters. These encounters give the PCs more interesting places and creatures to encounter as they explore the adventure site. At $7000 and each $1000 thereafter we will add in one of the five new encounters:\nArea 2-2: The Winding Path STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 2-3: Morella\u2019s Lair STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 3-4: The Laboratory STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 4-4: The Dock STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nArea 4-5: The Hidden Grotto STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! AREA ADDED!\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! Starting at $12,000, we will expand Fifth Edition Fantasy #4: War-lock with additional encounters. At $12000 and each $1000 thereafter we will add in new material as follows:\nApproximately 10 short random wilderness encounters in the hex-crawl through the badlands STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! ENCOUNTERS ADDED!\nTwo additional monster lairs in the final series of encounters STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! MONSTER LAIRS ADDED!\nA full map and description for the Rusted Gorgon Inn STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! THE INN IS ADDED!\nA mini-gazetteer of the badlands hex-crawl with new locations, lairs, mini-dungeons, outlaw hideouts, and other such things. STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! THE MINI GAZETTEER IS ADDED!\nTHIRD STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! At $15,000, we are adding Fifth Edition Fantasy #5: Into The Dragon\u2019s Maw! This entirely new adventure will be added for Free RPG Day release nationwide. All backers will receive a free PDF, with an option to add on the print edition for +$10. (It\u2019s free on Free RPG Day if you live near a participating store, of course!)\nFOURTH STRETCH GOAL CLEARED! All 7 handouts added! At $18,000, we are adding additional player handouts to Fifth Edition Fantasy #3: Pillars of Pelagia \u2013 up to 7 handouts depending on funding level.  Longtime D&D fans surely remember the classic book of handouts from Tomb of Horrors. Something like that is our goal here.\nAnd for every 50 backers, we are adding a free drop-in encounter! Drop-in encounters were a clear \u201cfavorite\u201d in our unofficial survey, right up there behind adventures. For every 50 backers, we\u2019ll publish a new drop-in encounter useful for any 5E campaign: encounters while traveling on a road, while camping, while at an inn, while in a castle, while exploring the underdark, etc. All backers will receive a PDF copy of this new product, Fifth Edition Fantasy: Fantastic Encounters! (tentative title, may change) \nAs we update this on May 23, we have 574 backers, so the Fantastic Encounters product will include at least 11 new encounters. And that number will grow as we add more backers.\nAnd what's past that? Let's see how the Kickstarter does - and see what other cool ideas you have for adding to it! It certainly seems reasonable to add on a print edition of Fifth Edition Fantasy: Fantastic Encounters...\nShipping & Handling\nFor US customers, shipping and handling is a flat $5 whether you order one module or all four. \nFor international customers, shipping and handling charges will be invoiced at the end of the Kickstarter. International postage can vary widely, and this process allows us to give you the best price for your order. We will invoice the orders via Paypal when items are ready to ship. Here are estimated shipping costs, depending on number of items ordered: Canada $10-$14; Europe, Australia, and rest of world: $13-$20\nFifth Edition Fantasy is here, and this is your chance to be part of it from the beginning.

While many locations on the map are familiar from old Necromancer Games titles and more recent Frog God Games products, the map itself did little to tell the story of this region and even less to answer questions that it raised: Who rules beyond the Gaelon River? What hazards and ruins await south of the well-known dungeons of Rappan Athuk and Barakus? And, what has led to this land becoming known as the Sundered Kingdoms?\nAs part of the ongoing strategy of Frog God Games to take older and hard-to-find Necromancer Games products and update them not only to new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords & Wizardry Complete rules but also to incorporate them into the Lost Lands setting as a way to introduce them to fans old and new alike, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms takes three classic Necromancer Games adventures: Patrick Lawinger\u2019s Morrick Mansion, Casey W. Christofferson\u2019s Aberrations, and Dave Brohman\u2019s Crystal Skull and integrates them into a continuous plot for an adventure path that takes PCs from level 3 to 15+, perfect for the party that has finished exploring the dungeons beneath Barakus and is looking for the next road to adventure.\nBut Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms is much more than just an update of those three previously published adventures. To the adventure path it adds three new original adventures written by Greg A. Vaughan called The Beast Within, Shades of Yellow, and Vengeance in the Hollow Hills that both tie in with the three older adventures and also move the plot from one to the next to create the continuity of the adventure path. While you could play any or all of the six adventures as standalone sessions, you can also use them as a single contiguous campaign to explore a large region of the Lost Lands.\nThe First Lost Lands Gazetteer\nIn addition to the updated and expanded adventure path, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms includes a campaign guide that expands upon the regional map of the Sinnar Coast. The central portion of that regional map is called the District of Sunderland, known more colloquially as the Sundered Kingdoms. Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms includes a full-color poster map that focuses on the Sundered Kingdoms from Endhome in the north to the southern extent of the Duchy of Southvale in the south, from Grollek\u2019s Grove in the west to the farthest reaches of Ramthion Island in the east. The adventure path takes players from one end to the other with many a stop in between, but the included gazetteer details the dozens of nations, cities, wilderness areas, ethnicities, and geographic features of note within the area as well. It also provides a regional history including more global events of the Lost Lands that had a direct bearing on the area, giving the first sneak peak at the Lost Lands bigger picture hinted at and referenced throughout more than 15 years of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games products alike. This detailed history and timeline extends back more than 3,000, years telling the history of not only a significant portion of the Lost Lands but also the unknown back stories to classic Necromancer Games products.\nFinally the Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms campaign guide also includes a chapter dedicated to the 13 insidious cults that are endemic to the Sundered Kingdoms region and are, perhaps, the true reason for its centuries of strife. This guide includes not only a write up of some of the most iconic and some not-so-well-known evil powers of the Lost Lands (yes, Orcus and Tsathogga are both there\u2026along with 11 others) but also provides details of their individual cults, where they are located, and how they operate in and affect the Sundered Kingdoms as well as the rest of the Lost Lands.\nOld School Bonus!\nAnd as one more bonus for those old-time Necromancer Games fans (and new Frog God Games fans!) who followed all the releases in order to maintain a complete collection \u2014 even the hard-to-find stuff \u2014 we\u2019ve got something you\u2019ve never seen before. When Crystal Skull was first published back in 2005, a secret level was written as bonus material but was never released. We\u2019ve dug back through the Necromancer Games archives and uncovered this gem; we\u2019ve dusted it off, updated its rules, and incorporated it into the book so that it now serves as the climax of the entire adventure path! Now on the 10th anniversary of its original release, you can experience Crystal Skull as Orcus originally intended but with the bonus of it serving to cap off an entire campaign incorporating three classic Necromancer Games adventures, three brand new adventures, and a whole host of Lost Lands legends, lore, and deepest, darkest secrets.\nBe the master of your Lost Lands campaign; buy The Lost Lands: Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms and remind your players that there\u2019s more to fear in the Lost Lands than just the dungeons.\nVideo Review\nShipping Costs\nShipping costs for United States customers is included in the price of your pledge.

Tales of the Lost Lands: Tales Pack 1 PDF (FREE!) - You\u2019ve been seeing hints and nuggets of the Lost Lands and its characters and history for years, first with Necromancer Games adventures and now with Frog God Games books and adventures. Now for the first time hear some of the actual stories of the Lost Lands told in these short fiction pieces. Written by Lost Lands alum Kevin Wright (The Mires of Mourning, The Northlands Saga Complete) and newcomer Lost Lands fans Arlan Bullard, Rick McCracken, Jeff Provine, and Nathan Shank, these short stories look at some of the most important and interesting characters and events in the Sundered Kingdoms and give you the official story. Each of the short fiction pieces in these Tales of the Lost Lands looks at some character or location specifically located within the Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms book to give the story behind the adventure. As a GM you can use them as plot hooks to bring in your PCs, as snapshots of the campaign to pique the interest of your players, or as seeds for your imagination as you develop your own campaign within the Lost Lands. Each piece begins with a GM Notes section that will tell how spoilery the story is so you\u2019ll know if you want your players to be able to read it or not before the campaign is underway.\nTales Pack 1 unlocked with this stretch goal brings you the pdfs of the first three of the six Lost Lands tales to be told with this Kickstarter absolutely free with your existing pledge.

It is a realm of dark chaos \u2013 for these creatures of the echoing deeps count each other as rivals and enemies. It is a place without peace, a place without virtues, a place where every countenance of evil is to be found in sluggish torpor, stirring restlessly in dreams of cruelty and hatred. These dark and deadly provinces are known as the Under Realms. \nMost named regions in the Under Realms are quite distinct from each other, whether by geological formation or by the types of inhabitants that have established themselves in strategically important areas. Characters who enter this area expecting to find drowic elves, deep gnomes, and other \u201cnormal\u201d features of the Under Realms will swiftly discover the error of their thinking. The Vaults of the Sunless Sea, located to the north of the Cyclopean Deeps, might fit that description, but the Cyclopean Deeps are a different and decidedly more unpleasant area into which the denizens of the Vaults seldom venture.\nThis series of adventures forms a mini-campaign in the depths of the earth, for higher-level characters.

I know both Ernie and Luke are very excited!\nErnest Gary Gygax Jr. and Luke Gygax's\n20K Preludes\nPreludes sets the stage for Gaxmoor and the world of Aihrde. It has adventuring material, fiction and other sundries. All these will be fleshed out and expanded. To give you a taste, here is the tale of the Haunted Valley.\n19K Behind the Curtain\nStephen Chenault pulls back the curtain from way back in 2001 and relates the store of how the contracts with Gary Gygax, Ernie and Luke Gygax, Aihrde, the Canting Crew and Gaxmoor all came tumbling together!\n18K Luke Gygax\nLong long ago, when the Lost City was first explored there were many teasers about the Undercaverns. But no one knew exactly what. But in conversations with Luke, it seems he's a bit anxious to explore them....his adventure, assuming we hit the 18k goal, will be a nice intro piece to what lies beneath the Lost City of Gaxmoor!\nHelp us take a peek into what lies beneath....\nBEER MUG STRETCH!\nWhat would an Ernie and Luke Gygax game be without a beer mug!! We've decided to add more drinkware to your gaming habits! IF we hit 100 backers at the $59.00 pledge level we'll include a FREE beer mug in the $59.00 (and above) package!

He'll add his considerable talent to the fray with a smashing adventure! Print copy available at 59+!\n10K Secret Door Open\nYou've just opened the secret door! Trollzah. Now begins an ever greater treatment of Gaxmoor. We'll select three of the more prominent Areas in Gaxmoor and create Isometric maps for them. These maps, rendered by Del Teigeler will include room contents as well, making the CK's job all the easier. Also, we'll incorporate Jake Parker and Sean King's ideas, allowing for plenty of room for CK notes. The below sample is what we have in mind: \nNEXT GOAL 11K\nWe've hit the hard cover. We've hit the 18 x 22 inch map sewn in the book. We've hit the additional intro adventure. Now we are up against the Map Book! Your going to want this. With a separate book the CK/GM can access maps far easier and use them as displays during game play. And, it puts us one step closer to the Isometric Map of Gaxmoor!\nThough all these maps are slated to be redone, this is a sample map form the original Gaxmoor and the treatment Peter Bradley is giving it:\nABOUT GAXMOOR\nFifteen years ago Troll Lord Games -- fresh in the RPG market -- joined with Ernest Gary Gygax Jr. and his brother Luke Gygax, to bring to life their amazing city, The Lost City of Gaxmoor. The city, caught up in the ruins of time and under the heels of chaos, proved an instant hit and helped place TLG firmly in the RPG market.\nGoing out of print when TLG moved away from d20, the Lost City returned to the brothers Gygax, where it sat in quiet retirement, leaving only the memories of many blood-soaked adventure hours.\nBut now, after many years, the Lost City returns to the Troll Dens! This time, under the Castles & Crusades banner!\nThe Lost City unleashes all the wild imaginings of the brothers Gygax, bringing them to your gaming table! A seamless blend of the old world's iron grinding action and the Siege Engine, Gaxmoor promises an epic montage of wreck and ruin.\nIntroduction by Frank Mentzer!\nFUNDING GOALS: The Lost City of Gaxmoor is a 120 page book, scheduled to release as a softcover book with the sprawling city map divided up into 8.5 x 11 sheets and set within the book. But it needs a far better treatment.  TLG's goals with this are to bring it out in hardcover format and to release the city map in a full color, 18 x 22 inch poster. Our basic goal is to hit a hardcover book, but the stretch rewards will build the project into so much more!\nJoin us! Join the Fray! Bring The Lost City of Gaxmoor back to the gaming table in all the glory the wealth of its adventure deserves!\nEARLY BIRD: THE EARLY BIRD OPTION IS CLOSED. The first 187 backers have locked in the EARLY BIRD. Trollzah! All early bird backers receive a soft cover edition of the Lost City of Gaxmoor. You must back the 25.00 pledge level or above. This copy ships with your kickstarter package unless you are at GARY CON VII. All Early Bird backers receive a digital copy at Kickstarter close.\nNOTE ON PLEDGE LEVELS, ADD ONS and STRETCH REWARDS: In previous Kickstarters, we've counted a pledger's add ons toward their total Pledge Level. So if you pledge 25.00 and bought 25.00 dollars in Add Ons, we counted your over all Pledge as a 50 Pledge Level. If this edged you toward the next pledge level, you earned the Stretch Rewards from that higher level. Sadly, this policy, as cool as it is, has wreaked havoc in the Dens. It's caused payment confusion, mis-shipped orders, delayed orders and overall frustration from the pledger and hair pulling frustration from the shipping department here. So with that in mind, we are, sadly, going to place the emphasis on your pledge level. If you pledge at Pledge Level X, we will only ship the Stretch Rewards applied to that Pledge Level. If you want the next Pledge Level's Stretch Rewards, bumping up your Pledge Level is easy enough. The add on list will be included in the Kickstarter, but only as an add on. Apologies all around for the confusion, delay and changes.\nProposed Tee Shirt Designs: Take a look, then go here to vote for your favorite! \n STRETCH GOALS EXPLAINED\n$4,500: Achieved!

It tells the story of the sorcerer Xon, who was banished by the other members of his order when his ambition and power became too great. Centuries later, he has returned from exile and is looking to reclaim the underground fortresses and dungeons he constructed long ago. However, many of his strongholds have been overrun by creatures of the wild or taken over by power-seeking factions. With only a fraction of his former power intact, Xon needs help.\n\nThis Kickstarter presents \"The Crucible\", a module where Xon puts several teams of adventurers to the test to find a party worthy enough to aid him. Whether his purposes are for good or for ill remains to be seen; The Lost Dungeons of Xon is an evolving story where the motivations of the heroes and villains are shaped by the choices and actions of the players. Nothing is as it seems. An NPC slated to be a villain could end up being a hero instead.\n\nWhat systems will the module support?\n\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon features full support for three popular roleplaying systems:\nPathfinder\n5th Edition\nOld School 1st Edition\nEach system will be supported with its own PDF, which will include both system-specific stats as well as guidelines in the text. For example, only the 5th Edition PDF will reference rules such as Advantage, while the Old School version will be geared more toward combat and non-skill-based problem-solving.\nIn what format will the module be available?\nBecause our module is designed specifically to leverage the capabilities of e-publishing, it will only be available in interactive PDF format. This PDF will have many advanced features, including:\nLandscape format for optimized use on laptops and tablets\nEasy navigation to \"pop-up\" stat blocks by clicking on an NPC or monster\u2019s name\nQuick links from the dungeon map to room and encounter descriptions\nHyperlinks to external spell and monster stats\nProfessionally-narrated embedded audio\nPassword-unlockable player content\nWhat makes The Lost Dungeons of Xon different from other modules? \n\nAll of the dungeons presented in the series are what we call pre-build friendly; the heroes will know the layout of the dungeon in advance. But even with some of Xon's secrets at their disposal, new surprises await them. For the dungeon master, this allows you to present the layout of the dungeon to the players right from the start of the session without spoiling the module.    \nThe Lost Dungeons are designed specifically to make use of two very successful Kickstarter campaigns: Dwarven Forge's Game Tiles and Reaper's Bones Miniatures. If you own either or both of these accessories, the module provides you with specific guidelines on which tiles and/or miniatures to use, including video tutorials showing you precisely how to set up the dungeon. If you don't own them, the PDF will also include printable maps and character stand-ups.\nInstead of commissioning traditional fantasy artwork, our modules feature high-resolution photography of professionally-painted miniatures and three-dimensional dungeons for a unique look and feel.\nWhy is the campaign running for 60 days?\n\nThe main reason we\u2019re Kickstarting the first Lost Dungeons module is to build a community. How many backers we get will determine whether or not we\u2019re able to continue the series with additional modules. The more backers, the better the chances of a successful follow-up.\n\nIf you want to see The Lost Dungeons of Xon succeed beyond just this initial campaign, help us put the word out. Post on roleplaying forums and Reddit. Share a link to our Kickstarter on Twitter and Facebook. If you have a podcast you enjoy, let them know about our campaign. The more people we can spread the word to, the more likely we\u2019ll be able to produce additional modules. With sixty days, we hope to give everyone who's interested the opportunity to jump on board.\n\nWhat do I get for my pledge?\nThis Kickstarter is for \u201cThe Crucible\u201d, the first module in what we plan to be an extended series of modules. The Crucible is a 25-page standalone module for 4 to 6 first-level characters, designed to be run during a single 3- to 4-hour game session.\nFor as little as $1, you\u2019ll receive the entire Crucible module in the supported game system of your choice, along with a companion Digital Player\u2019s Guide that includes background information, maps and clues for the players.\nIf you pledge at the $5 Adventurer level, you\u2019ll also receive extended character write-ups for the more prominent NPC\u2019s in the game, with enough information and stats to use them in other games if you desire.\nAt the $10 Storyteller of Valoria level, you'll get everything from the Adventurer level plus an additional full-length module set in Dwarven Forge's original setting, the City of Valoria. \n* BEST DEAL * At the $20 Completionist level, you will also receive a special side quest \"Moving Dungeon\" module exclusive to this Kickstarter, as well as PDFs in all three formats.

We're pleased to announce that we will be working in conjunction with the folks over at Dwarven Forge to develop a special module set in their original setting, the City of Valoria. This module will be of a similar scope and length to the main module in our campaign, and in addition to all our interactive bells and whistles, it will feature tiles from Dwarven Forge's City Builder campaign. Like The Crucible, this module will be available for 1st Edition, 5th Edition and Pathfinder.\nUNLOCKED! Now that we've reached the big $10k, we'll add quality fantasy artwork to supplement our photography.\nUNLOCKED! We're going to add more professionally narrated audio to The Crucible and to our interactive walkthroughs. More room descriptions, more dialogue, more tone-setting awesomeness.\nUNLOCKED! We'll enhance the Interactive GM Walkthrough with enough features to turn it into a \"Playthrough.\" We'll add more character class options and stats. And while the mechanics won't be system specific, there will be d20-based skill checks and combat rolls. All of these enhancements will improve the interactive experience and increase re-playability.\nUNLOCKED! We'll build the Therigard Almanac, an interactive online repository of all the people, places and things you might run across in The Lost Dungeons modules and all companion setting materials. This will be a wiki-style setup that will be a handy reference for GM's, and players will also be able to use it keep track of their own notes and encounters.\nWhat is Burning Yeti Studios?\nBurning Yeti Studios is a group of highly experienced gamers and creative professionals with a proven record in the gaming and publishing industries.\nJeff Hannes previously worked as Senior Editor for InQuest Gamer magazine and has written material for Iron Crown Enterprises and Wizards of the Coast. \nMichael Searle is Burning Yeti's graphic designer.

We do extensive testing, but we can\u2019t always account for certain versions of software and operating systems. To fully utilize the features of the PDFs, you may have to download a new version of Adobe Reader to your laptop, desktop or tablet, or install the latest system updates for your device.\nDue to the interactive nature of the PDF, the GM should plan to have a computer or tablet on hand to run the module. If the players have technology as well, their experience can be enhanced by using the Digital Player's Guides, but they are not required. All the information in the player's guides will also be available as printable content.\nAlso, note that embedded audio will not work on most tablet PDF Readers, but the PDF will contain clickable links to play the audio off of our website, and all narration audio files will be available as mp3 downloads.

We have closed out all 13 stretch goals. (Wow, that's an unlucky number! I guess it's appropriate for Grimtooth.) Thanks to everyone for their support on this wild ride. It's been a great experience and we can't wait until you see Grimtooth's Ultimate Traps Collection printed in all its glory. And with that, we officially close this Kickstarter!\nAll right humans, this is your chance to own the 460-page hardcover compilation of all five of my systems-neutral Grimtooth\u2019s Traps books \u2013 plus loads of extras! We\u2019re talking 500+ traps and maybe me making a guest appearance in a Dungeon Crawl Classics crossover module. I\u2019m Grimtooth the Troll, and I\u2019ll be your guide on this Kickstarter tour, so gird your loins, get your dice and let me tell you a tale\u2026\nThis is what the humans at Goodman Games say you need to know about this Kickstarter event: \nPublished by Goodman Games under license from Flying Buffalo (and with my permission), this 460-page hardcover collects of all five of MY Traps books, including the original eponymous 1981 edition as well as Traps Too, Traps Fore, Traps Ate, and Traps Lite. Every trap from the original five Grimtooth\u2019s books is included \u2013 there are no exclusions!\nThis massive tome is systems-neutral, containing more than 500 traps suitable for all fantasy systems and games. You have never had so many trap options before \u2013 use them well\u2026\nMy book will be available to you mortals in multiple formats: a basic softcover for table play, a durable hardcover for longer shelf life, and a gold foil edition for the serious collector (available in both faux and real leather, and with a slipcase).\nThe book is also available in PDF edition. All print backers will also receive a copy of the PDF edition.\nFace it \u2013 this is a homage to a VERY important piece of gaming history. (Mine!) The book features a foreword by noted dungeon designer Harley Stroh, and also includes an extensive interview with the original creative team, a cover gallery showcasing 30 years of editions (in both English and many foreign languages), and a look behind the mysterious submission process \u2013 including my legendary \u201cGrimtooth\u2019s Submissions Box\u201d that sits majestically on a shelf in the Flying Buffalo offices.\nAnd I have created more than a dozen new traps specifically for this volume. For the first time in a decade, the Grimtooth\u2019s submissions box has been cracked opened again, and more great entries have poured out to an unsuspecting world!\nPlus the humans at Goodman Games are giving you the possibility of several exciting stretch goals to make this epic project even more impressive: printed endsheets, a satin ribbon bookmark, the cover gallery in full color, a custom dust jacket for KS backers, and a gatefold page featuring the Grimtooth board game that was first mentioned more than 20 years ago!\nAnd if you\u2019re really lucky we might do a cross-over with the Dungeon Crawl Classics line, allowing me (Grimtooth) to make an appearance in a special DCC module produced just for this Kickstarter!\nAnd to wrap it all up, primary Grimtooth illustrator Steve Crompton has dug through his archives to find original art from the earliest books. This original art is available as part of the deluxe book pledge levels!\nListen bub, here\u2019s the bottom line - Grimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps Collection: A gigantic collection of over 500 awesome engines of destruction, delver dicers, character crushers, adventurer anxieties, minion munchers, hero harangers, general tricks, traps and other rare and dangerous items for use in defending game master treasures! You want it and you need it.  And if you don\u2019t order one, I\u2019ll have to hunt you down!\nNow as hard as this is to believe, there may be a few of you out there living in a shack in the middle of Mohave Desert, that haven\u2019t actually seen one of my original Traps books. If you are one of those unenlightened souls, read the paragraph that follows. (The rest of you can click that button over on the right and get your pledge in.)\nWhat is Grimtooth\u2019s Traps? Originally published by Flying Buffalo, Grimtooth\u2019s Traps is one of the most popular RPG accessories ever produced, with more than 250,000 copies in print since 1981. There have been a total of seven Grimtooth\u2019s books produced, and all of them are usable with any RPG. Five of the seven volumes were traps-focused, and for the first time ever, these magnificent engines of player-character destruction are collected in an officially-licensed hardback collector\u2019s volume suitable for both presentation and play. If you play any fantasy role playing game, of any edition, this collection will challenge your players in ways they will never see coming! (All right, you got it now?  Let\u2019s move on\u2026)\nOK, so what\u2019s in my new book? Grimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps Collection contains the following:\nExact reproductions of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps, Traps Too, Traps Fore, Traps Ate, and Traps Lite. These five books are scanned from the recent printed editions and collected together in one volume. Collectively these comprise 400+ pages and more than 500 traps.\nA foreword by dungeon designer Harley Stroh, author of dozens of Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures.\nAn interview with the original Grimtooth\u2019s design team of Steve Crompton, Rick Loomis, Paul Ryan O\u2019Connor, and Bear Peters, conducted by Jim Wampler. Learn the perspective of the original creators as to why this book was such a milestone when it came on to the scene as the first book of traps in the industry\u2019s history, and one of the very first RPG supplements to be written \u201cin-character.\u201d Oh\u2026and of course they interviewed me as well.  After all, I am the most important thing about these books.\nA look at the submissions process. For more than three decades, a dusty box atop Rick Loomis\u2019 file cabinet in the Flying Buffalo headquarters has housed the flood of traps submissions. As longtime fans know, many of the original Grimtooth traps were submitted by the general public. This mysterious box is finally documented in photographic form, and several traps that started as fan submissions are shown in their original \u201cfan letter\u201d submission form prior to publication. Then the submissions box is opened up and, for the first time since the late 1990\u2019s, the contents are reviewed and fan-submitted traps are selected for publication! Which leads to\u2026\n\u2026New traps! A bonus traps chapter includes a selection of new, never-before-seen, recently-discovered tragic tricks, devious devices, fearsome foes, complicated calamities and sneaky scenarios from the one and only Grimtooth! (That\u2019s me!) These are collected from fan submissions, as well as new contributions by veteran Grimtooth collaborators, including Ken St. Andre, creator of Tunnels & Trolls.\nThe Grimtooth\u2019s Traps board game. It's a silly idea based on the Candyland concept, and a fun warm-up game while you\u2019re waiting for your RPG group to show up. Originally a seed idea in a 1990\u2019s Grimtooth brainstorming session, this design is now finally fleshed out. With sufficient funding the board game will be presented as a gatefold page so you can actually fold out the board and play Grimtooth\u2019s Game of Traps from the book!\nCover art gallery. Did you know my Grimtooth\u2019s Traps has been translated into French, German, and even Swedish? And the original Traps has been through seven slightly different editions, with a number of cover variations? With sufficient funding, this cover gallery will be presented in full color!\nAnd other behind-the-scenes ephemera. A variety of rare art (including the first publication ever of the Jeff Dee line art used for the cover of Traps Too), a complete index of all five traps volumes, an accounting of every Grimtooth\u2019s print run, and more fun things to better acquaint us all with the history of the Grimtooth family.\nLet me show you what you\u2019re getting here, chum\u2026 Here are three PDF previews of the book:\nThe first 10 trap pages of the original Grimtooth\u2019s Traps.The book that started it all!\nBehind the scenes: An excerpt from the interview with the original creators.\nThe making of a trap: As we uncover the mysterious box of submissions for Grimtooth\u2019s Traps, we also include some examples of fan letters and how they were answered by me (and in some cases, turned into published material). Here\u2019s an excerpt.\nThe book is 460 pages long \u2013 so that ought to be plenty, even for you greedy humans.\nBy the way, this book is done and ready to be printed! My slaves have already completed this great project.  The content for the book is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. What remains is the printing, and that\u2019s where you humans come in. My associates at Goodman Games have set the funding goal to print in hardcover with Smythe-sewn binding. This is a durable process where the spine is actually sewn to the pages, not just glued as with many RPG products. (There\u2019s nothing like sewing a spine into your book!) This binding will last for decades of use. With sufficient funding we can offer a variety of formats, as well as the specialized production values outlined as stretch goals below!\nAdd-On Copies of the Dungeon Crawl Classics / Grimtooth Crossover: Based on the stretch goals achieved so far, we will be creating a Dungeon Crawl Classics module featuring Grimtooth. This will be given in PDF form to all backers. If you would like a print version, add $10 to your pledge! \nTell me about the stretch goals (I love that term\u2026): Certainly! A 460-page hardcover book of my peerless prose and ingenious designs is impressive on its own. But in addition, we\u2019d like to include these features (assuming enough of you bribe us sufficiently):\nAt $23,000, printed endsheets. FUNDED! The endsheets are the 11\u201dx17\u201d pages that are on the inside board of a hardcover. We\u2019d like to print these with scenes of Grimtooth, Grimtina, and their nefarious deeds. (An extra picture of me and Grimtina?  This is a must-have!)\nAt $27,000, a gatefold page with Grimtooth\u2019s Game of Traps. FUNDED! The Grimtooth\u2019s board game requires an 11\u201dx17\u201d page to properly display. At this funding level we will include a fold-out page (a gatefold) in the hardcover so you can read about the board game, then fold out the next page to actually play it!\nGrimtooth's Game of Traps!\nAt $32,000, color cover gallery: FUNDED! The 8-page cover gallery in the hardcover will be printed in full color, allowing a better representation of the history of Grimtooth\u2019s covers in both English and a variety of other languages. (See Traps history in full, bloody color!)\nMore than 30 years of covers, in a variety of languages!\nAt $38,000, a satin ribbon bookmark bound into the hardcover spine: FUNDED! Because with 500+ traps, sometimes you need to save your place. (My sister Grimtina insisted on this idea, so here it is.) Maybe we'll even throw in two bookmarks. Because with 500+ traps, sometimes you need to remember where two traps are! (And my sister likes satin.)\nAt $45,000, a Grimtooth art print: FUNDED! Who says trolls can't be attractive? Decorate your gamer den with this 8.5\"x11\" fine print of a classic Grimtooth trap image, which will arrive tucked inside the cover of the hardcover.\nAt $53,000, a Kickstarter-exclusive retro dust jacket: FUNDED! At this level, all hardcovers fulfilled as part of the Kickstarter will be wrapped in a dust jacket with a retro design that resembles the very first printing of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps \u2013 the original \u201cgray cover\u201d edition, with blue line art on a gray background. (Use it to protect this precious tome!)\nThe original Grimtooth's Traps cover -- inspiration for our retro dust jacket goal!\nAt $62,000, a Dungeon Crawl Classics module featuring Grimtooth: FUNDED! It\u2019s the collaboration you\u2019ve always wanted: a dungeon crawl into Grimtooth\u2019s own domain. Co-written by Dungeon Crawl Classics author Jobe Bittman and primary Grimtooth illustrator Steve Crompton, this DCC module will be produced \u201cin the DCC style\u201d and distributed in PDF form to all hardcover backers at this funding level.  (Don\u2019t worry, though. I\u2019ll be throwing in my suggestions and stellar commentary as well.)\nAt $98,000, a color poster of Grimtina included in the book. FUNDED! As announced by Grimtina herself in her recent surprise update!\nAt $100,000, we will expand the PDF edition of Grimtooth\u2019s Ultimate Traps (which all backers already receive) to also include Traps Bazaar and Dungeon of Doom. FUNDED! There is a considerable amount of back-end scanning and cleanup work involved in getting this material ready, and we\u2019ll get started on that work the moment we pass $100k.\nAt $110,000, we will insert an 11\u201dx17\u201d folded cardboard game-board into the book: FUNDED! So you can more easily play the Grimtooth\u2019s Traps Board Game! An actual \u201cboard\u201d for the game, if you will. On the back will be game cards and other materials to photocopy and use in play! The gatefold pages will still be included, and this game board should make it easier to actually play.\nAt $115,000, we will upgrade all gold foil and leatherbound editions to include approximately +80 pages of Traps Bazaar! FUNDED! The softcover and \u201cregular\u201d hardcover will still be the existing 460 pages, but all gold foil and leatherbound editions will get an extra ~80 pages at no additional cost beyond the existing pledge cost!\nAt $120,000, we will manufacture a custom-printed, illustrated, corrugated shipping box to deliver the books in. FUNDED! Some of you saw what we did with the Metamorphosis Alpha shipping box \u2013 this will be similar. It\u2019s a really fun way to get a package in the mail, and will only be available to backers of this Kickstarter.\nAt $130,000, we will upgrade all gold foil and leatherbound editions to include the extra +160 pages of Traps Bazaar and Dungeon of Doom! FUNDED! The softcover and \u201cregular\u201d hardcover will still be the existing 460 pages, but all gold foil and leatherbound editions will get an extra 160 pages at no additional cost beyond the existing pledge cost!\nWhat\u2019s beyond that? Don\u2019t worry, we have even more ideas for awesome stretch goals! We\u2019d like to print the DCC module and tuck it inside the hardcover for all backers. We\u2019d love to include a full-length poster of the lovely Grimtina (and maybe her brother Grimtooth) and tuck that poster folded-up inside the back of every hardcover. And I\u2019m sure you have ideas too \u2013 as the project rolls along we\u2019ll solicit your feedback. Let\u2019s blow away all the stretch goals and get into the really fun territory of \u201cwhat else can we add to this thing?\u201d\nI suppose you\u2019ll want to know the pledge levels. No doubt this book will be used in different ways by you humans. Some GMs will use it in games, some readers will use it to reminisce, and some collectors will never open it. Therefore, I\u2019ve ordered Goodman Games to offer several options for pledge levels, which are listed at right. They include softcover, hardcover, gold foil hardcover, slipcased edition, real leather edition -- and even some versions with autograph pages and original art!\nShipping & handling: Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced at the end of the Kickstarter. This allows us to give you the best price for your order. We will invoice the orders via Paypal when items are ready to ship. For USA orders, orders will be shipped via media mail at an expected cost of approximately $5-8, depending on final weight of product. International shipping charges can vary widely. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.\nSHOW YOUR SUPPORT! Use the backer image below for your profile!\nSo there you are \u2013 what are you waiting for?

A call to arms must go out!\n$18,000 Stretch Reward: The Darkenfold...\nThe Darkenfold was part of what once was the Ethvold, a forest which spanned across the entire southern reaches of Ethrum from the Rhodope Mountains in the west to the Ardeen River in the east. From the north, it covered the Shelves of the Mist, and much of Southern Kayomar to lap up against the feet of the Bergrucken in the northeast. Those days were long ago, when dragons were young, and the sentients ruled the soil and men and dwarves were few and unlearned. The Darkenfold is a remnant of that forest, stretching only several hundred miles from the Danau River and the Plains of Kayomar in the east to the doorsteps of the unexplored Rhodope Mountains in the west. In the south, the great Soup Marsh hems in the ancient trees, and the forest continues in wild growth from there to the far-off Shelves of the Mist in the distant north. The Eldwood, to the east, holds the heart of the Ethvold of old, but the Darkenfold holds its dark memories. It is an evil wood, filled with its own wild abandon and creatures of ill intent. Those who live there know that the trees and the soil hold memories of their past glory and do not forget the axes of men, orcs, dwarves, and goblins that have plundered them of their wealth and life.\nRead the full write up from Shades of Mist HERE.\nThe Darkenfold\n$16,000 STRETCH REWARD: WHAT IS INZAE?\nWe are moving toward our next stretch reward, and it occurs to us that some of you may not know what Inzae is. Here's a bit of synopsis.\n What\u2019s next?? The World of Inzae. It\u2019s the inner world.\nIn the beginning the All Father crafted substance from his own being. But in the darkness of the Void he saw a light and there he found the dragon, coiled upon herself, thrashing about. And she rent the fabric of the Void and from the tears came the maelstrom, a madness of elements that spilled into the Void.\nAnd the All Father settled upon the Maelstrom and from it he created the world of Aihrde. But seeing him the dragon thought to make her own world, and beneath the Maelstrom she fashioned Inzae, a grim world, and dangerous. Thus there came to be two worlds, one astride the Maelstrom, one beneath and they hung in the Void for all the long years.\nInzae is another world, apart from Aihrde, yet bound in its mythology. The two are connected through the roots of the Great Tree and the Rings of Brass.\nWhat does this mean for you and your game? There are two worlds to play in, one, Aihrde, more traditional fantasy, the other, Inzae, a dark world of harsh realities, little magic and where death is a constant.\nAihrde was created by Stephen Chenault and Inzae by Davis Chenault.\nWe are only a few hundred from release of the primer for the World of Inzae. In short your getting two for one!\nAbout the World of Aihrde Project\nPresently, the World of Aihrde consists of 2 volumes, the Codex of Aihrde and the Players Guide to Aihrde, with one 27\" x 39\" map depicting the Cradle of the World adventure area. We'd like to expand this, with a particular focus on the maps, improve the content of the book and perhaps make the book full color.\nNOTE:  Both $75 levels come with a PDF copy of the corresponding book. \nA Note on Nomenclature\nAihrde is the name of the world.\nThe Codex of Aihrde is the world setting book. It is divided into two sections: The Andanuth and the Almanac. The book will be printed in hardcover format, is approximately 276 pages long and it's price (depending on whether the map is folded into the book or not) stands around $35.00.\nThe Players Guide to Aihrde consists of player information: racial classes, spells, guilds and orders. This book will be printed in hardcover format, is 76 pages long and its price stands around $20.00.\nThe World of Aihrde Map consists of the entire world, as seen in the image below. There are no plans presently to have this map printed anywhere other than inside the Codex of Aihrde, unless we meet stretch goals as noted below.\nThe Cradle of the World Map (also known as the Lands of Ursal) is that region of the world covered by the Almanac in the Codex of Aihrde as depicted in the map below. It is as you see in the box in the map above. Presently this map is sold separately in 9 sectional maps.\nWant to see a larger preview of the map? Click the one below:\nObjectives\nPresently, the Cradle of the World Map is sold separate from the Codex. We want this bound with the book, folded and fully detachable. This allows for one stop shopping when picking up the book. The max size of this is 39\" wide by 27\" tall.\nBut the Cradle of the World map is too beautiful to keep in such a small form. We want to split the map in half, print two of the same size and ship in a tube. This makes the Cradle of the World map twice as large and keeps it rolled and not folded.\nThe long range goal of this kickstarter is to land the books -- both if possible -- in full color. Printed like the three sisters kickstarter, it will make the whole a far better experience.\nAnd lastly, we'd love to see the Cradle of the World mounted on a spring roller assemble for you to hang on your ceiling, wall, or put on a tripod.\nWHAT IS THE WORLD OF AIHRDE\nAihrde is a complete campaign and world setting for your favorite RPG. Whether your playing Castles & Crusades, Dungeon Crawl Classics or any other RPG, you can find a home in Aihrde.  There is an in-depth history, mythology, descriptions of all the races of the world, from dwarves to giants and elves to orcs, a case by case study of all the relevant kingdoms and peoples and the geographical regions they live. It also includes deities and all the relevant info needed to run them: guilds, orders, significant terrain features and so very much more.  Aihrde is the most complete campaign setting on the market today.\nSee the Full Table of Contents of the Codex of Aihrde here.\nSee a Preview of the Codex of Aihrde here.\nAIHRDE\nThe world of Aihrde spins upon an earth-like axis of ancient civilizations where good and evil have struggled for countless years. It is a world that bears the markings of its past; where ancient evils slumber, stained with the power of eldritch wizardry; where gods dwell in bejeweled halls of wonderment, worshiped by men and women of all creeds; where dragons live in great dens of heaped treasure; where the new stands upon the ruins of the old in beds of ancient glory.\nFor a thousand years and more, the dark god Unklar ruled the world in a terrible reign of Winters Dark. But now, banished to the Great Empty, Aihrde is a world reborn.\nIn the After Winters Dark, heroes tread in iron shod boots and wizards lean on crooked staffs to plunder the buried wealth and power of the ages. Here, the eternal struggle goes on, age after age, for Aihrde is a world of adventure, of undaunted heroes, untainted by the decadent philosophies of those meek who suffer in the shadows of lesser men. For here, the stone columns of history are wiped clean, awaiting the bold to carve their mark and gain entry to the halls of immortality!\nSTRETCH REWARDS EXPLAINED\n$4,000: Unlocked! We are funded.

Just like original Gaming Paper, the rolls are 12' long and 30\" wide, giving you thirty square feet of gaming surface!\nSTRETCH GOAL(S)\nat $3500 we will be making 1\" hexes an option!  Same cost and reward levels as squares.\nWhy an Erasable Version of Gaming Paper? \nBoth online and at conventions, the number one thing we hear as we talk with gamers is the question \"is Gaming Paper dry erase?\" Until now the answer has always had to be \"no, it\u2019s permanent.\" But thanks to this new printing process, we can now give you a giant sized, reasonably priced alternative to the standard expensive and fragile dry erase mat. \nHow Does It Work? \nGaming Paper Erasable is wet coated with a new wax mixture\u2014a mixture that does not easily absorb ink, so the surface can be wiped clean with just a little effort, particularly if you use Quartet Enduraglide Dry Erase Markers. We tested many different dry erase brands, colors, and styles and found the Quartet Enduraglide markers looked the best and cleaned off the best. They\u2019re also easy to find, available online and at most office supply stores.\nQuartet Enduraglide Dry Erase Markers\nHow is This Different than Traditional Gaming Paper? \nThe paper is white with blue squares rather than the traditional tan color. It\u2019s a little stiffer and also more water resistant. The packaging is different, instead of a tight plastic wrap it is loosely wrapped in plastic (because of the wax treatment, the rolls don't hold up well if put in a high heat shrink tunnel).\nHow Many Uses Can I Get from Gaming Paper Erasable? \nWell, it is paper and the wax coating will break down through repeated use, wiping clean, and reuse.  With normal wear and tear, we expect you to get 4-5 uses out of a section of the roll. But each roll has 30 square feet of surface to play with.\nHow Will the Funds Be Used? \nWe have printed a small number of Gaming Paper Erasable rolls already and are using those for promotion. The largest portion of the funds will pay for a full print-run of the product. \nThe next largest cost will be to acquire Quartet Enduraglide markers for the pledge levels that include them. \nFinally, shipping is expensive. The remaining moneys will be used to keep the shipping costs as low as possible.\nLuckily, the manufacturing, packaging, and shipping do not take long\u2014so we should be able to get rewards to most backers before Christmas! (Just think what a large and impressive stocking stuffer a roll of Gaming Paper Erasable would make!)\nWant to know more about original Gaming Paper?

In the depths of space these explorers found millions of star systems, strange planets, and exotic alien races. Centuries later, they form the Known Worlds, a vital region of trade and technology where empires grow and business thrives.\nIt is an unparalleled age. Cutting edge science has opened limitless frontiers of space and consciousness, and has even begun to hint at the mysteries of the universe itself. But to find them, one must travel beyond the familiar, to the last parsecs of reality. \nThe Last Parsec is a science fiction roleplaying game of exploration and adventure. It requires the Savage Worlds core rules and the Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion to play.\nCharacters cross the cosmos under the auspices of JumpCorp, an intergalactic megacorp that contracts exploration, security, bounty hunting, transportation, and everything in between. Adventures take explorers from system to system and planet to planet, finding strange new civilizations, discovering terrifying creatures, and battling pirates, hostile aliens, rival corporations, and stranger things!\nYour hero might be a cynical human, a gregarious yeti, a hot-tempered rakashan, or one of 11 total core races--or you can create your own using the Science Fiction Companion.\nRewards\nA graphic of all the reward levels listed at right can be found at the bottom of this page, but here's what people usually ask us about first--the level that includes \"one of everything.\" That would be the Jump Chief, and it's everything at a discount over adding everything on to a base level separately.\nNOTE: The Jump Captain and Jump Chief backer levels include a set of die-cut Savage Worlds Status Counters on thick cardboard (also available as an Add On). We accidentally left these out of the Pledge levels and can't edit the Reward text to reflect this change, so we're doing it here and on the graphic below. Sorry for the inconvenience!\nWendigo Tales\nIf you'd like to jump into the setting at hyperspeed, check out our short fiction line, Wendigo Tales: Season Three features The Last Parsec, and the first two tales are already out (with four more coming soon).\nThe Searchers, by Shane Hensley, and Scrapped, by Cameron Dayton. Available now!\nBooks\nWe're taking a \"starbox\" approach to the overall setting this time. Races, technology, ships, creatures, and more are all covered in the required Science Fiction Companion, so instead of creating a core book first, we're going to do something a little different.\nThe Last Parsec blasts off with three setting books and several adventures featuring exciting planets, systems, and fantastic events at the edge of the Known Worlds. We'll produce a second wave of books and other material along with an expanded setting book tying more of the background and events together sometime in 2015.\nGet the FREE Last Parsec Primer here!\nIn the meantime, you can get the essential setting information in The Last Parsec Primer, completely free and available now!\nHere are the first three settings for The Last Parsec, written and illustrated by Pinnacle's best. We're only going to sell the books in sets during the Kickstarter--which also gets you the unlocked digital rewards. After the Kickstarter, each book will be available separately as usual.\nEach book contains detailed background on a system, planet, or other location, any new Edges, Hindrances, Gear, Ships, or Setting Rules important to the area, a Plot Point Campaign, Savage Tales, and a Bestiary covering the strange xenos and shady characters one might meet in the distant reaches.\nEach book is full-color, 96 pages, in our standard graphic novel format so everything lines up nice and neat on your shelf. All three settings are available in softback and Limited Edition hardback.\nEris Beta-V: A JumpCorp-employed team of explorers investigates a magnificent ringed gas giant with its numerous moons. Ancient artifacts of enormous power can be found among the rings and asteroids. Every moon is a unique world to be explored. When the system\u2019s valuable commerce is threatened by unscrupulous agencies, the team must root them out and put themselves at great risk on the icy fringes of interstellar space. Written by Matt Cutter (Deadlands Brand Manager).\nScientorium: Hidden away by sheer distance and forever shrouded from the minds of the curious lies a mammoth artifact from the previous galactic age, the library of Scientorium. Its strange experience chambers offer passage to a million histories on a million worlds, secrets and technologies undreamed of. Now abandoned by all but its automated security systems and enigmatic caretakers, its workings are oddly twisted and jealous, meting out reward and punishment in equal measure. This is a classic science fiction saga, an epic journey across space and time in the vein of Niven or Heinlein! Written by Timothy Brian Brown (Dragon Kings, Dark Sun, Traveller).\nLeviathan: Hunt the most dangerous game in the Known Worlds! The jungle planet Leviathan teems with mammoth lacerauns, savage beasts of enormous size and cunning, potential trophies unmatched in any other star system. Intentionally undeveloped beyond a few tourist-oriented settlements, Leviathan nonetheless draws more than just adventure-seeking hunters though, including researchers and those who would see the world left completely untouched. Both are more than willing to turn the tables on any would-be hunters. Written by John Goff (Night Train, Deadlands Noir).\nPoster Maps\nJust like the poster maps we did for Deadlands Noir, Weird Wars Rome, and East Texas University, we're creating two double-sided, dry-erase maps on heavy paper stock. This time out the maps feature four different ships (dropship, freighter, pirate vessel, and research ship) you can use for your JumpCorp team or the treacherous foes who cross their path.\nHere's a peek at the map work in progress--we'll update this with more detailed pics as they near completion.\nGame Master's Screen\nThe Last Parsec GM's screen is a tri-fold, landscape screen featuring gorgeous full-color artwork on one side and all the important charts and tables for the game on the other.\nThe GM's screen also includes The Last Parsec Primer in printed form and an original adventure (that sets up one of our future settings) by Ross Watson called The Enigma Equation.\nMiniatures\nOur friends at Bronze Age Miniatures have created nine exclusive miniatures representing some of the most popular archetypes from the Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion and The Last Parsec.\nThe set contains the aurax, construct, deader, male and female human, insectoid, kalian, Serran, and yeti.\nBest of all, if you pledge for the minis during the Kickstarter and the bonus figures listed under Stretch Goals are unlocked (the Floran, Saurian, and Rakashan), we'll include them in your set free!\nFigures sculpted by Bronze Age Miniatures.\nAdd-Ons\nEveryone who pledges for physical shipments can add additional items to their shipment at no additional shipping cost.

Necromancer Games re-animates itself bigger, better, and badder than ever before for the 5th Edition of the *world\u2019s most popular fantasy roleplaying game. With the help of Steve Winter and Ed Greenwood, we are going to be creating supplemental books (up to 3 of them!) to play the new edition Old School Style \u2014 the Necromancer way.\n5th Edition Foes - between 200-250 additional creatures, beasts, monsters and titans to challenge your players and enhance your adventures!\nQuests of Doom: X Adventures Worth Winning -12+ adventures worth winning, each written by one of our many iconic authors. (X begins with 12 and increases based on stretch goals.)\nBook of Lost Spells - Hundreds of new spells to enhance your 5th edition spell casters and NPCs.\nJust like we did with the Third Edition, our objective isn\u2019t to compete with the the upcoming 5th edition; it\u2019s to offer resources for playing the game the old way, old school style. In general it\u2019s darker and deadlier gaming than the official recommendations. It\u2019s not for crybabies. Between 1999 and 2006, we racked up award after award, picking up worldwide recognition as a publishing powerhouse... and now we\u2019re back!\nAuthors\n\"To pull this project together and give it the right \u201cfeel\u201d for Necromancer Games, we recruited an amazing lineup of writers. Start with a core of Necromancer Games regulars like Bill Webb (Rappan Athuk, The Lost City of Barakus), Matt Finch (Swords & Wizardry, Tome of Adventure Design), J. Collura (Caverns of Thracia Reloaded, Chaos Rising), Michael Curtis (The Dungeon Alphabet, Realms of Crawling Chaos), and Casey Christofferson (The Tome of Horrors, City of Brass). Throw in a few D&D long-timers like Steve Winter (Tyranny of Dragons, Murder in Baldur\u2019s Gate), James M. Ward (Gamma World, Pool of Radiance, Castle Keeper\u2019s Guide), Skip Williams (Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, The Rod of Seven Parts), and Ed Greenwood (The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, The City of Splendors). The result is a stack of adventures that are guaranteed to break bones, stir long-forgotten nightmares, push heroes to their utmost limits, and cement massive grins on the faces of players and DMs alike.\"\nHere's the Problem\n5th Edition is brand new and we have absolutely no idea how many books to print, so Kickstarter is going to be a very important tool. We're going to let you, our valued customers, tell us how many books to print.\nWhat You Get\nEventually, there will be three books, all library-bound hardcovers made for decades of use, written by the Necromancer Games team of Steve Winter, Bill Webb, Greg Vaughan, Matt Finch, J. Collura, Michael Curtis, Casey Christofferson, James M. Ward, Skip Williams, and Ed Greenwood. \n(Covers shown are mockups; the final covers may differ slightly)\nWe start out with monsters: a book called 5th Edition Foes. It\u2019s going to start with 200 monsters in it, which means it will be about 220 pages. That\u2019s an estimate. As we hit stretch goals, we\u2019ll add more monsters as we continue to raise money.\n(Covers shown are mockups; the final covers may differ slightly)\nThe next book is Quests of Doom, an adventure book we estimate at 180-260 pages, depending on stretch goals achieved. It will contain two updates from third edition books (Demons and Devils, Vampires and Liches) that contained a total of six adventures. PLUS, it will contain 6-12 new adventures under the section titles \"Bugs and Blobs\", \u201cGiants and Dragons,\u201d \u201cMen and Monstrosities,\u201d and \u201cElementals and Lycanthropes.\u201d This is where we bring in some heavy hitters as authors, but we haven\u2019t nailed down which author is going to write which adventure. That information might get settled during the duration of the Kickstarter, but we\u2019re not rushing it. The author lineup might not be finalized until after the Kickstarter is finished \u2014 see below about how this Kickstarter is a little different from our prior ones. For those following the Lost Lands\u2122 Campaign Setting, Greg Vaughan will be making sure that the adventures are all fully compatible with and integrated into the Lost Lands. This book will be $40, that's $3.33 per adventure! If we make all of our stretch goals the price drops to $2.22 per adventure! \n(Covers shown are mockups; the final covers may differ slightly)\nThe third book that comes available as a stretch goal is the 5th Edition Book of Lost Spells. This sourcebook will contain hundreds of spells, and we estimate that it will run 250 pages. The contents will be drawn from several books Necromancer Games wrote for 3rd Edition, but we will also be culling out a lot that doesn't work with 5th Edition, and adding a few new ones.\nThis One's a Little Different\nOur team (through Frog God Games) has run, funded, and fulfilled 3 Kickstarters (Rappan Athuk, Swords & Wizardry, and Razor Coast), and we have 2 more that are in the fulfillment process (Lost City of Barakus and Sword of Air). These 5 Kickstarters raised a total of over $600,000. In each of them, we had most of the work done ahead of time, and the main focus was on raising money for the art, the printing, and so forth. For this one, it\u2019s a little different because we\u2019re operating ahead of the normal timeline. Not all of the game\u2019s rules are known to us at this time, and probably a couple of them are still being finalized in the Crystal Towers of Renton. \nThis means we\u2019re creating a product that has some unknown variables, and it means that you\u2019re backing it more as a patron than as a pre-order customer. We\u2019re going to deliver these books, but it\u2019s going to be an evolving process.\nWhy So Early?\nIt might seem like we\u2019re jumping the gun on this project: after all, why not just wait until the Core Books are published by the Wizards, and start then? Two answers. First of all, to be very selfish about it, if we\u2019re first we can snag all the best artists and authors before someone else does. That gives us a superior product and a reputation for excellence. The second reason is that when a new edition comes out, the game masters want more monsters, adventures, and other resources immediately. Some publisher is going to provide them, and we want it to be us. Our products have a lot of lead time, because our book-bindings are library quality, because we work with A-team authors and artists who have waiting lists, and because good editing and good art take time. If we\u2019re going to put top-of-the-line products out there when our customers want them, we have to start now. \nAdd-Ons\nSome add-ons may be added as stretch goals. Hang tight, keep watching, and don\u2019t split the party. \n$50 Signed Adventure Book - If you'd like your copy Quests of Doom signed by all the authors simply add $50 to your pledge.\n$200 Leather Bound Cover (per book) - We do real leather covers, not composite leather (ground-up scraps pressed into shape). We buy leather by the hide, and that\u2019s what goes on our leather-bound books. Our leather covers are the real deal.

We make no claim to, or challenge to, such trademarks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn this Kickstarter, you\u2019re almost certain to get something that\u2019s slightly different from the way we are planning it right at this moment, because we\u2019re raising money and starting work before the whole game is even out on the shelves. Page counts will vary depending on the length and format of the material, licensing requirements might alter the content of updated material, and so on. \n\nHOWEVER, from experience in the many Kickstarters that we have fulfilled or are currently fulfilling, we believe that we have eliminated or accounted for the main risks that cause less-experienced companies to fail. We have (a) already priced the products to account for potential increases in the cost of shipping and postage over the course of production, (b) have a sophisticated in-house pledge management software system that has already been used successfully to fulfill large Kickstarters, (c) have backup authors and editors lined up, (d) already have the majority of the art, (e) already have the majority of the non-rules-specific text written, (f) have our own climate-controlled warehouse space, (g) have a long-standing relationship with two printers based on being a customer that places five-digit orders several times a year and (h) have considerable capital available to use in case there are unexpected expenses or cash-flow glitches. \n\nA number of other factors in this particular Kickstarter may be affected by third parties, including the Wizards of the Coast delivery schedule for books and pdfs, and also our freelance artists, writers, and editors. Several details of rules-presentation may affect page count (the number of lines in a monster stat block, for example). Lastly, a risk we must address is the health of each one of our authors and their ability to write adventures in each one of these books. We do not expect any complications, but if any do arise, we will do everything in our power to write and deliver the books on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "New Bestiary for 5th Edition by Nord Games!", "update_content": "This project by our friends at Nord Games is really taking off!

Our team of industry professionals includes a three-time successful Kickstarter, a former game store owner, and two former editors from the monthly magazine InQuest Gamer.\nWhat is The Lost Dungeons of Xon?\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon is an original series of Pathfinder\u2122 compatible roleplaying modules designed to be used with any campaign world. The Adventurer pledge will include three distinct adventures collectively designed to take a party of adventurers from 1st to 6th level.\nWhat format will the modules be available in?The modules and supplemental material will be released in electronic format only, as interactive PDFs.\nWhat is an \u201cInteractive PDF\u201d?\nMost roleplaying supplements available in PDF format are simply an electronic version of the book. The Lost Dungeons of Xon takes this format to the next level by including several features that simply aren\u2019t possible in print form:\nNarrated Room Descriptions - Professionally-recorded audio narration introductions for each encounter area \nPop-up stat blocks for NPCs and Monsters so GMs don\u2019t need to flip through pages to find them\nDirect navigation to room and encounter descriptions from an interactive overview map \nPRD Hyperlinks to full spell and creature descriptions on Paizo's Pathfinder\u2122 online reference document\nUnlockable content - Password-secured player materials such as maps and clues that can be unlocked by a GM-provided password at the appropriate time during an adventure\nWhat else makes this different from other roleplaying modules?\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon is the first series of roleplaying modules designed specifically to make use of the rewards from two of the gaming industry's most successful Kickstarter campaigns: Dwarven Forge\u2019s Game Tiles\u2122 and Reaper\u2019s Bones\u2122 miniatures.\nAll of the dungeons the players will explore in The Lost Dungeons of Xon can be assembled using just two sets of Game Tiles\u2122, and all the miniatures we feature come from the Vampire-pledge level of the first Bones\u2122 Kickstarter. If you backed either or both of these campaigns, you\u2019ll find specific guidelines for which pieces to use in conjunction with the modules.\nThe Lost Dungeons of Xon are \"pre-build friendly\". We\u2019ve come up with a unique and compelling backstory that allows you to set up the physical dungeons in advance. Because of the way the stories are designed, the layout of each dungeon is in-character knowledge the players will have right from the start of the scenario. Therefore, you won\u2019t be giving anything away by having the entire dungeon laid out on the table.\nWhat if I didn\u2019t back one of or both of those projects?\nWhile our scenarios are enhanced by the use of Game Tiles\u2122 and Bones\u2122 miniatures, they aren\u2019t required; you can run the modules as you would any other pen & paper RPG. We\u2019ve put a lot of effort into coming up with an interesting story with enjoyable puzzles and challenges for the players, so even if you don\u2019t own the accessories you should consider backing our project. With all the interactive features we have, there simply isn't anything else like it.\nUPDATE: The good folks at Reaper have put together a special package which includes all the BONES miniatures featured in \"The Lost Dungeons of Gold and Blood\". There's a special 10% discount, and you can see the details here.\nAlso, for potential backers who do NOT own Dwarven Forge's Game Tiles... When the modules are released we will have printable copies of the dungeon maps available on our website, which can be used as a substitute for the Game Tiles.\nWhat kind of art will the modules have?\nWhile content is king when it comes to roleplaying supplements, we also recognize the importance of looking good. The art direction is another aspect of our project that is unique. The visuals in our modules feature not only pre-configured Game Tile\u2122 layouts, but high-resolution photographs of professionally-painted miniatures as well.\nHow long are the modules?\nThe first module in the series, \"The Lost Dungeon of Gold and Blood\" is a 25-page PDF. The second and third modules - \"The Stronghold of the Banshee Cabal\" and \"The Endless Dark\" will be approximately 50 pages each. All three modules will have companion Digital Player's Guides that will be 5-8 pages long.\nReward Comparison Chart\nRelease Dates\n\"The Lost Dungeon of Gold and Blood\" will be available to ALL backers (at the Explorer level or higher) by September 2014.\nOur Inner Circle members will receive early draft versions of the second and third modules by December 2014.\nThe final versions of the second and third modules, along with any stretch goals and unlocked add-ons, are expected to be available by March 2015.\nStretch Goals\n$16,500 Stretch Goal [Locked]: Character Pack #0\nThis bonus content, free to all backers at the Scout/Adventurer level or higher, will include full-page character sheets and detailed backgrounds for the arrogant and over-bearing Dirk Dunland and the other members of his party. These complete and in-depth character folios will give you everything you need to fully flesh out these NPC's, and even to use them as player characters in another campaign if you choose.\nOther Stretch Goals\nWe have a lot more great stretch goals planned. Some will be free to anyone who backs at the Scout / Adventurer level or higher, others will be paid add-ons available to all backers. (Note that if you back at the Master or Inner Circle level, you get ALL add-ons for free.)\nPaid add-ons will generally be $5 or $10. Some of the goodies we've got planned include:\nCharacter packs with full-page backgrounds and folios for the main NPCs in the modules\nBonus dungeon encounters that aren't part of the main story and can be inserted into any campaign\nA story-based choose-your-own-adventure online character generator\nAn epic Dragon Battle encounter designed and balanced for high-level characters\nAll of the stretch goals and add-ons will include the same high-quality of photography and painted miniatures featured in our main modules.\nNo Surprises Section\nWhile we will endeavor to ensure that all the features of our interactive PDFs work on as many platforms as possible, it\u2019s still a relatively recent technology. We do extensive testing, but we can\u2019t always account for certain versions of software and operating systems. To fully utilize the features of the PDFs, you may have to download a new version of Adobe Reader to your laptop, desktop or tablet, or install the latest system updates for your device.\nDue to the interactive nature of the PDF, the GM should plan to have a computer or tablet on hand to run the module. If the players have technology as well, their experience can be enhanced by using the Digital Player's Guides, but they are not required. All the information in the player's guides will also be available as printable content.\nWhile we are constraining ourselves to the Game Tiles found in the original two-set Kickstarter campaign for the basic dungeon layouts, supplementary and bonus material can and will utilize pieces that were not available from the base Kickstarter.

It quickly went Platinum on DrivethruRPG, and was released in hardcover through voidstarstudios.com and IndiePressRevolution.\nThis new core book will contain the setting information contained in the original Nova Praxis core book, expanded with new material from Machinations: the Nova Praxis GM's Guide. The Savage Worlds rules are being written by Shaintar creator and industry veteran, Sean Patrick Fannon!\nThe Book and PDF\nNova Praxis: Savage Worlds Edition will be released in the same digest format as the Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition. We estimate it to be roughly 250 pages, standard print. We are shooting for an August release in hopes of getting it out to everyone by GenCon.\nIn addition to this book, you will need the Savage Worlds core rules to play Nova Praxis. The Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion is a useful add-on, but is not necessary.\nThe PDF will be a bookmarked version of the print edition. But if we hit the stretch goal (see below), we will also produce an Augmented PDF, featuring a tablet friendly layout and a number of enhancements for improved navigation.

One of the updated visible to backers includes a link to the playtest doc.\nReviews\nNova Praxis was originally released for the Fate system. The Savage Worlds Edition will have different game mechanics of course, but here's what people have said about the original version...\n\u201cNova Praxis has a stunningly realized and fleshed out setting. I mean this in a very good way. The worlds of the solar system, factions and organizations within the world are all well thought out and realized within the game. I think that this is a key to a game that wants to be transhumanist: you have to understand and work out the social structures of the setting. Transhumanism is an evolutionist philosophy (from my viewpoint) that tries to work out how great changes in technology and science will impact not only those sciences but society and people as well. In Nova Praxis, the Void Star Games people have certainly gotten that part right. Thought has gone into the world of their future, and how the advances have impacted it and the people who live there.\u201c \u2013 Christopher Helton, Dorkland\n\u201cMan, it was exactly what I was looking for!\u2026 Needless to say, if you play any kind of Fate, and want sci-fi, transhuman, or cyberpunk elements in your game, then you couldn't go wrong with Nova Praxis.\u201d - Paul M. [5 of 5 Stars]\n[Referring to the Augmented PDF] \u201cQuite possibly the most useful and beautiful PDF ever created for gaming\u2026\u201d \u2013 Seth B. [5 of 5 Stars]\n\u201cI don't do a lot of reviews, but I feel compelled to do so in this case. The game I'm reviewing, Nova Praxis, a FATE-based ruleset, is just that good. And the delivery system, an enhanced PDF, is really amazing in terms of its clean aesthetic and overall usability. Color me very, very impressed.\u201d \u2013 Edgar Johnson\n\u201cIt is a very engaging game with an excellent developed setting that tackles many fundamental issues and themes inherent to the genre itself. Action, conspiracies, ethical and moral issues, social dichotomies, and much more! Basically, this roleplaying game offers us a fantastic playground to develop and create any types of memorable stories.\u201c \u2013 Yohann Delalande\nIMPORTANT! - PLEASE READ!\nIf you back a tier that offers a print copy of the book, when it becomes available, you will be sent a coupon code to get the book at cost from DrivethruRPG. What does \"at cost\" mean? It means the coupon code will cover the cost of the book, but not printing or shipping. Void Star Studios makes no profit at this stage. This is the cost of printing and delivery paid to DrivethruRPG to get the printed book into your hands.\nThe book will be available in softcover and hardcover, in standard and premium color. DrivethruRPG estimates the print costs as follows:\nSoftcover Premium Color - $13.30 to $16.50\nSoftcover Standard Color - $7.50 to $8.80\nHardcover Premium Color - $18.80 to $22.10\nHardcover Standard Color - $12.60 to $14.50\nMake sure you factor this in when selecting your backer tier. This is the amount you will have to pay in addition to your backer tier and shipping costs.\nShipping costs vary by location. DrivethruRPG ships internationally, and estimated shipping costs can be found here.\nTo clarify... After the Kickstarter has ended and the book has been released, you will be issued a coupon code that discounts the price of the print version such that you only pay for the print and shipping costs.

Includes additional mini-adventure \"The Rat King's River of Death\" by Steven Bean.\nYou can support this by pledging for the adventure module itself, and also by pledging for other DCC RPG modules, which are on sale for 20% off as part of this Kickstarter.\nThe project includes many fun stretch goals that, if funded, will make this an even more extravagant module.\nUpdate 6/1: Yet another stretch goal beaten!\nFirst, the Chained Coffin will be a boxed set! All Kickstarter orders of silver foil or gold foil will include the box.\nSecond, we have now passed stretch goal #11! The gazetteer will now be expanded even more!

Support the project with a T-shirt, flask, belt buckle, or beer cozy!\nFinally, please note that the spinning wheel prop will be printed as a separate cardboard handout for the foil editions.\nDungeon Crawl Classics is the longest-running line of adventure modules currently available for tabletop role playing games, with the 82nd sequential DCC module recently released to game stores worldwide. This Kickstarter funds a special feature in an upcoming DCC module: a player handout that includes 3 spinning wheels on the inside cover of Dungeon Crawl Classics: The Chained Coffin. The 3 spinning wheels form an elaborate puzzle that can be solved by clever (or lucky) players. The wheel puzzle contains a number of strange symbols which can be re-used by the judge in future adventures, and the adventure text includes several alternate uses for future modules. This edition of the module features a unique silver foil cover.\nThe wheel puzzle: can you solve it? This Kickstarter will allow all three wheels to be printed on card stock and turn independently!\nWhy Kickstarter? Manufacturing this customized wheel puzzle requires hand-assembly within the printing plant. Publishing books in a standard format is a well-established process that uses standardized machinery, but customized puzzle manufacturing requires time-consuming, expensive hand assembly. This Kickstarter funds the incremental cost of manufacturing the adventure module with a three-dimensional wheel puzzle \u201cthat really spins,\u201d packaged on the inside cover of the adventure module. \nEven without the successful funding of this Kickstarter, The Chained Coffin will still be published. Without the Kickstarter, the puzzle will be presented as a \u201ccut out and assemble at home\u201d graphic. If this Kickstarter funds, however, backers will receive a version of the module that contains the moving puzzle with physical wheels that actually spin, with a unique silver foil cover. At further levels, there is an opportunity to add more fun features, as described in the stretch goals below. \nThe limited edition silver foil cover\nWhat Lies Within The Chained Coffin?\nThe adventure is designed for level 5 characters. A whispered voice calls from a coffin bound in chains, urging the heroes into the depths of the Shudder Mountains, a place rife with superstition and forlorn secrets. In the shadowy, pine-grown valleys of the Deep Hollows lurk mysteries of a bygone age and a new evil emerging from the ruins of the past. The adventurers must plumb the mountains\u2019 secluded reaches to root out this rising terror before its power comes to fruition. Standing in their path are cackling witches, subtle devils, lingering spirits, and a foul thing that moves in the night. Can the heroes appease that which lies within the Chained Coffin and thwart the dawn of a new and terrible age?\nShown here is a physical mockup of what we plan to manufacture. As you can see, each wheel spins independently. Can you solve the puzzle?\nThe Spinning Wheel Puzzle\nThe adventure includes a number of supernatural locations. The entrance to one is blocked by a supernatural door. It is this door that comprises the spinning wheel puzzle that is the subject of this Kickstarter: \nBeyond the ancient bridge is a 40\u2019 wide, 30\u2019 deep ledge that lies perpendicular to a sheer rock face. Set into the rocky cliff at the far side of the ledge stands a great stone archway sealed by an imposing door. Blue bolts of lightning ripple silently across the door\u2019s face, hinting at magical wards or seals. In the center of the door are three circular dials set one inside the next. Each dial bears several different symbols, no two of which repeat.\nArtist Doug Kovacs has rendered this door in a beautiful player handout (see image above). If this Kickstarter funds, the three wheels will be set on top of each other as physical dials that actually spin. What\u2019s the solution? You\u2019ll have to buy the module to find out!\nTo add additional replay value, author Michael Curtis has also designed five additional game mechanisms that utilize the spinning wheel (more puzzles, magic items, etc.). These are included with the adventure module and can be used in your group's future adventures.\nThe normal color cover for The Chained Coffin (without the physical spinning wheel).\nThe Bonus Adventure\nIncluded in the printed module is a short bonus adventure, The Rat King\u2019s River of Death, written by Steven Bean. Steven was a finalist in our 2012 Mystery Map Adventure Design Competition. The Rat King\u2019s River of Death is a stand-alone adventure that continues the escapades of the Rat King, as originally introduced in DCC #1: Idylls of the Rat King more than a decade ago.\nThe Signature Stickers\nTo commemorate this Kickstarter, the first 100 copies of The Chained Coffin that are pledged will include a signature plate. Illustrated by Doug Kovacs and signed by author Michael Curtis, the signature plate will be in the form of a \"skater sticker\" for you to stick wherever you want. Presumably on the book -- and we recommend the \"open space\" on the back cover -- but what the heck, it's a sticker and you can do whatever you want with it!\nAdd On Other DCC Modules and Save 20%!\nTo support this Kickstarter, we are offering printed copies of the older Dungeon Crawl Classics modules at a special sale price of 20% off. That's $8 each versus the regular price of $10 each. You can also include the DCC RPG core rules for $40, and copies of the newer adventure modules at the regular price of $10 each. All products ordered through this Kickstarter receive a PDF copy as well.\nTo add on these items, simply include the additional dollars in your pledge.

We\u2019ll add two more pages of player handouts!\n$12,000: FUNDED! We'll add another short bonus adventure -- which will be a zero level funnel set in the Shudder Mountains!

The Almanac will be expanded with another 8 pages of gazetteer material further expanding the Shudder Mountain region.\n$35,000: We'll print an 11\"x17\" poster map of the Shudder Mountains region.\nThe Physical Product\nThis Kickstarter funds the manufacturing cost of an adventure module including a series of three spinning wheels on the inside cover. The adventure is already written and playtested. Estimated length of the printed adventure is 28-32 pages.\nThe adventure module will be produced with two covers: a full-color cover, and a silver foil cover featuring an alternate illustration. Both covers are by Doug Kovacs, and are already complete. The cartography is by also by Doug, and is also complete.\nThe adventure module will be illustrated with B/W art, similar to other modules in the Dungeon Crawl Classics line of adventure modules.\nNegotiating with Ol' Blackcloak: a fun encounter in the adventure.\nAppendix N Inspiration\nDungeon Crawl Classics adventure modules utilize the rules of the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG). DCC RPG is inspired by Appendix N, the bibliography of fantasy and science fiction literature which inspired D&D co-creator Gary Gygax. One of the most distinctive contributors to Appendix N is Manly Wade Wellman \u2013 a contributor who is often overlooked.\nThe Chained Coffin is inspired by the mountain-fantasy stories of Manly Wade Wellman. His Silver John stories were set in the dark, woodsy places of backwoods mountain country, where spirits and haunts were a real part of everyday life. As author Michael Curtis described his work on this adventure:\nOne of the great joys of writing DCC RPG adventures comes from the game\u2019s commitment to remaining true to the classic pulp-era fantasy and science-fiction stories that inspired fantasy roleplaying, the so-called \u201cAppendix N\u201d tales. And while \u201csword & sorcery\u201d yarns comprise the lion\u2019s share of Appendix N, they are not the only types of stories found within it. The Chained Coffin derives its inspiration from American folklore, as perceived through the atmospheric works of Manly Wade Wellman. You\u2019ll find no kobolds and orcs in The Chained Coffin, but plenty of restless ghosts, shunned witches and conjure-men, and devils willing to make a deal at midnight, all set against a backdrop of superstition-filled mountains and secluded hollows where the still air smells of pine trees. Heady stuff, indeed, and a far cry from your traditional fantasy RPG fare.\nThe Chained Coffin stands as my favorite DCC RPG adventure to date. The opportunity to create and then dwell for a time within a region more at home in the eons-old Appalachian Mountains than the fantastical landscapes of Tolkien, Howard, Moorcock, and Leiber was a designer\u2019s dream. Hopefully, my personal enjoyment will be shared by you, the judge and player. So gather \u2018round the fire, friends, pass the jug this way, and bend an ear to the music of the mountains. There are both horrors and wonders waiting in the Deep Hollows and, if you listen close at midnight, you might just hear a tune or two played on a lonesome fiddle strung with silver strings\u2026\nAbout The Author\nMichael Curtis has been playing role-playing games for over thirty years, and has been a freelance writer and game designer since 2008. He has written or contributed to nearly forty roleplaying games, supplements, and articles. Best known for Goodman Games\u2019 The Dungeon Alphabet (for which he was awarded the 2011 Three Castles Award for Game Design) and Stonehell Dungeon, he\u2019s also worked on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG, Goblinoid Games\u2019 Realms of Crawling Chaos and MAJUS, and Chapter 13 Press\u2019 Tales from the Fallen Empire. The author of ten DCC RPG adventures including Emirikol Was Framed!, The Sea Queen Escapes!, The Croaking Fane, Frozen in Time, and Intrigue at the Court of Chaos, Michael\u2019s work has also appeared in the pages of Gygax Magazine and he is a regular contributor to Fight On! magazine. Michael\u2019s upcoming projects for Goodman Games include The Chained Coffin, The Four Phantasmagorias adventure series, and The Adventurer\u2019s Almanac. He lives in Suffolk County, NY, with the requisite number of cats for a writer and far too many books.\nAbout Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game\nDCC RPG is an old-school tabletop role playing game that uses modern rules. Its inspiration is Appendix N, and its rules set is derived from the D20 system (which powered the third edition of D&D). DCC RPG is a single complete rulebook with no additional products to buy. It is supported by an extensive line of adventure modules, and a robust community of third party publishers. DCC RPG has been widely praised for its innovative approach to \u201cold-school.\u201d You can find more information at www.goodman-games.com/dccrpg.html\nFAQ\nShipping & handling: Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced at the end of the Kickstarter. This allows us to give you the best price for your order. For USA orders, orders will be shipped via media mail at an expected cost of approximately $5-6, depending on final weight of product. International orders will be invoiced at actual postage cost plus $5 for handling. International postage requires hand-written customs forms, and waiting in line at a post office. International postage also has long transit times, and depending on the destination can be very expensive. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.

More material from The Lost Lands is on the way, and while we finish up the massive Sword of Air, we decided to go ahead and get the next volume of material going.\n\nWinner of the 2004 ENWorld Gold Ennie for Best Adventure, this hardcover book is the original (revised and expanded) work by WDBK Kenower and Bill Webb. The book will be produced in 2 versions, one for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and one for the Swords & Wizardry Roleplaying Game. \n\nFor all you Lost Lands fans out there, this one is canon \u2014 it interfaces with Stoneheart Valley, Rappan Athuk, and Sword of Air, and represents the next of many ongoing chronicles of the Frog God Games/Necromancer Games home world. A MUST HAVE book for any fan of our material.\n\nOur base level of funding is small \u2014 we wanted to keep the price point down on this. We listened to your feedback from our last few Kickstarters \u2014 and we are adding more new material based on stretch goals as detailed below. \n\nThe Lost City of Barakus, designed to take characters from 1st to 5th or 6th level (or higher), is as much of a campaign setting as an adventure. Detailed within these pages is the great, bustling metropolis of Endhome, the Penprie Forest and Duskmoon Hills located north of that city, and, finally, the huge dungeon that is the Lost City of Barakus. Within all these areas are many adventures, NPCs, and locations for the party to explore, interact with and conquer. How and in what order the party chooses to take on the various challenges before them is entirely yours (the GM\u2019s) and the players\u2019 choice.\nThough given specific location names, the adventure herein could easily be modified to fit in any campaign world. As always, change, add, modify, delete and alter as necessary to meet the needs and desires of you and your gaming group.\n\nAdventure Background\nCenturies ago, a race of humans built an elaborate underground city beneath the Duskmoon Hills called Barakus. These were a magic-loving people, and for hundreds of years they dwelled peacefully in their subterranean home, delving into the arcane arts. Eventually, however, one of their number, a necromancer named Devron, rose to great power and transformed himself into a lich. The wizards of Barakus banded together, and after a great struggle, banished him to a prison far below the city. Before his banishment, however, Devron forged the helm of power, which he could use to restore his power at some future point.\n\nThough Devron was locked away in a magical prison, the wizards of Barakus knew that someday he might use his powerful magic to somehow free himself, and so they created a weapon, the sword of Kell, which a mighty warrior could use against him. Because they wanted control over who got and used the sword, it was forged such that unless empowered in a specific room in Barakus with the use of three orbs of power which were themselves powered by three \u201cflames\u201d \u2014 small geometric shapes scattered throughout the city. The idea was that the three elders of the city must agree on a champion before they offered their flame: without complete agreement, the sword was useless.\nHowever, before a suitable champion could be found to battle Devron, the lich played a risky gambit. At great expense to personal power, he summoned a stone of madness, which erupted through the floor near the gates to his prison. This magical stone had the power to drive all sentient creatures mad. This it did, and the good people of Barakus soon destroyed themselves, and the city fell into ruin.\nCenturies passed. The stone of madness\u2019 power diminished and most of the city was freed from its effects. Eventually, creatures from the Under Realms and the surrounding wilderness began moving into the city and using its many halls and chambers for their lairs.\n\nBarakus is now a massive dungeon, filled with creatures that have their own designs and desires. Many of the inhabitants over the years have altered the layout of the city slightly to fit their needs, and hundreds of years of monstrous habitation has left the city\u2019s once-great halls filled with forgotten treasures and un-sprung traps.\nOf course, Devron still dwells deep beneath the earth in his magical prison, and as is the wont with trapped liches, he would like nothing more than to escape his prison and find his helm of power, which would restore the power he lost during his captivity. While exploring the city, the party may decide to find the sword of Kell, empower it, and go after Devron. The battle between the heroes and the lich is likely to serve as a climax to this adventure.\nAdd-Ons\n$15 The Lost City of Barakus Hero Lab Files - Hero Lab files allows customers to modify, print or use our NPCs in their home campaigns, fast and easy. It also allows them to export to online formats such as D20 Pro or other virtual tabletops.\nStretch Goals\nAll stretch goals for this Kickstarter will focus on additional content.\n$20,000 Bonus Dungeon Level 4B (UNLOCKED) - \"Hall of the Shield\" (written by WDBK Kenower, Bill Webb.) This level will add a new and powerful shield that the players will find highly useful during the end game and battle against Devron. Further, after the players leave the environs of Barakus, both the shield and Sword of Kell could take them to the next stage of their adventure in the depths of Rappan Athuk or in their quest for the Sword of Air.\n$22,500 New Wilderness Encounter (UNLOCKED) -  Bill will add an additional wilderness encounter of 2000-4000 words to the book.

Designed for use with multiple players, Castles & Crusades puts you in charge of the adventure path. Included within are all the rules of play, how to get started in your very own role playing game, how to run the game and play in it. It\u2019s an easy to learn attribute-based rules system that allows players to choose among 13 archetypal character classes and 7 races to with which create their characters. Spells, equipment, fast-paced combat rules, and all essential information needed to play a game of Castles & Crusades are in this book.\nWant to know more about the game?  Check out this page on our website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoving a product line from black & white to color is a huge risk. The costs associated with the improvement are large. The interior pages need redesigned, the art converted from black and white to color, the whole of it needs to be integrated. Paper concerns in the actual printing play a role, as some papers absorb color better than others. The cost of printing the physical books is large as well, usually double what it costs to print in black & white.\n\nTo bring all three main C&C books out in color is a large leap for TLG and will take a pretty penny to do so.

It is an old city with a colorful, often tragic history, a place where different races, cultures, and religions meet, sometimes blending and other times clashing. It\u2019s a city rich in the arts, where music and food are celebrations of life. Yet beneath it all, there is another city, a haunted place where mysterious cults worship in the surrounding swamps, sagging plantations hide terrifying secrets, and the sins of the past do not stay silent or unanswered. The dark and dangerous powers of the mythos are woven thickly into the tapestry of the Crescent City; they have always been and always will be.\nGolden Goblin Press is proud to present Tales of the Crescent City\u2014Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans.\nThis collection of 1920s adventures for 6th Edition Call of Cthulhu features scenarios by Stuart Boon, Daniel Harms, C. Michael Hurst, Oscar Rios, and Kevin Ross.  \nScenario Descriptions\nThe Quickening Spiral, by Stuart Boon - Wherein the investigators struggle to find a cure to a deadly plague sweeping across the city. Soon, they find themselves suffering the very same symptoms. As they race against time, they will stumble upon obsession, magic, and an evil mankind was never meant to encounter. \nNeedles, by Daniel Harms - Wild stories of mysterious figures kidnapping and performing medical experiments on their victims might be more fact than urban legend, as the investigators interrupt the shadowy figures known as the Needle Men in the middle of their latest abduction.\nBloodlines, by C. Michael Hurst - The investigators find themselves researching an ancient family, once prosperous, but now in decline. Their investigation leads them to a track of undeveloped swampland, a sinister developer, and a reclusive Indian tribe. The fetid swamps of Louisiana hide many things, like family secrets and deadly predators. \nSong and Dance, by Oscar Rios - Wherein the investigators are swept up in a calamitous event striking on New Year's Eve. Musicians, singers, dancers, choreographers, and composers all over New Orleans suddenly lose the ability to practice their art. Some simply fall dead while others go mad, some attempting to take their own lives. But the mysterious crisis is more dangerous than anyone knows and unless stopped, the world may never be the same.\nand... saving the best for last... Twenty five years ago, Chaosium released The Great Old Ones, and within it was a scenario set in New Orleans. \nIt was called \"Tell Me, Have You Seen The Yellow Sign?\", by Kevin Ross. In it the Most Honorable Krewe of the Swords was infiltrated by Papa Screech and the Cult of Hastur. This culminated in a summoning that allowed Carcosa to merge briefly with a haunted stretch of swamps outside of New Orleans. The investigators (hopefully) thwarted the cult, preventing it from granting the King In Yellow a human form to inhabit and restoring the barriers between our world and Carcosa, the realm of entropy.  \nBut then what happened?  Golden Goblin Press is deeply honored that Kevin Ross agreed to come out of retirement and tell us himself. It brings us great pleasure to offer you...\nAsylum - Return of The Yellow Sign, by Kevin Ross - Several years after the terrifying events in the swamp and the defeat of the Cult of Hastur, a strange figure arrives in New Orleans.  Why has he come, and from where? What does he want?  Why does he spread madness and terror wherever he appears?  What is that strange inexplicable symbol he wears, and why does he don a pale mask?  Is it a mask? It seems that the second act has begun, and for some, it will be a final curtain call.\nArt - We're pleased to have back with us Dean Engelhardt creating our player aids and Reuban Dodd as our cover and interior illustrator.  We're happy to welcome Steff Worthington as our cartographer.  For those of you who were lucky enough to get the bonus scenario from our last Kickstarter, \"Owlglass\", you may have noticed the layout style. That's the work of Mark Shireman, who'll be handling layout for this project.\nTimetable - This book has not only been fully written; it's well into editing and is poised to enter layout. We are determined to bring our backers a finished PDF, if not a physical book, within four months after the Kickstarter closes.  \nWe have nine supporter levels for backers to choose from, each named after a New Orleans neighborhood. Some of these supporter levels have a limited availability, so be sure to act fast if something appeals to you.

The first few will enlarge the main book, with additional art, maps, a neighborhood guide of Jazz Era New Orleans supplied by our friends at New Orleans Mythos, and a very special 6th scenario. If we reach the first four goals, each supporter at Algiers level and above will receive a set of Official Golden Goblin Press Mardi Gras Beads.\n#1 ACHIEVED!) $13,500 funded, The Artist Enclave\u2013 If this stretch goal is reached we\u2019ll increase the number of maps, interior illustrations, and/or handouts by a total of three per scenario within Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans. A massive, double page map of New Orleans, accurate to the 1920\u2019s, will also be added to the book. Let\u2019s put Reuben Dodd, Steff Worthington and Dean Englehardt to work giving us even more of the things we love.\n#2 ACHIEVED!!) $15,000 funded, The New Orleans Neighborhood Guide\u2013Who better to show you around a new place than the people who live there, who know it and love it best. That\u2019s why Golden Goblin Press has formed a close bond with the great folks over at New Orleans Mythos. They\u2019ve written up a wonderful guide to 1920\u2019s New Orleans, neighborhood by neighborhood, giving both Keepers and Investigators the inside scoop to The City that Care Forgot. This will be included within Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans, allowing Keepers to really make the city come alive.\n#3 ACHIEVED!!!) $17,500 funded, Black Goat of New Orleans\u2013 Our friends at New Orleans Mythos are planning to publish a campaign set in their beloved city. While it\u2019s still a ways off our backers can get a sneak peak at it. If we achieve this stretch goal all backers at and above the Uptown level ($15) will receive a 24 page digital PDF copy of the initial scenario for their upcoming campaign project, Black Goat of New Orleans. \nBlack Goat of New Orleans, by New Orleans Mythos\u2013 A most unfortunate accident at college football game thrusts investigators to the crossroads of urban legend and Mythos horror. Footsteps from the electric lights and throbbing jazz, as something evil pulses beneath the oaks of City Park. He wants only the strongest, the most cunning, the least merciful. The rest shall die. \n#4 ACHIEVED!!!!) $22,500, Tell Me, Have You Seen the Yellow Sign (GGP Edition) \u2013 Before Kevin Ross began writing Asylum - Return of the Yellow Sign he decided to re-read his scenario Tell Me, Have you Seen the Yellow Sign. Although widely considered a classic which I personally would place in my top five 1920\u2019s scenarios of all-time list Mr. Ross was unhappy. All he could see were the various ways he\u2019d like to improve it. He wanted to do a complete re-write to correct the issues he found and to create an improved, longer, more open-ended version. I told him that Chaosium was doing something similar with certain scenarios in Horror on the Orient Express. Chaosium kindly and generously granted us permission to pursue this as a stretch goal. We are very pleased to offer our backers\u2026\nTell Me, Have You Seen the Yellow Sign (GGP Edition) \u2013 Kevin Ross is doing a line by line re-write of this scenario to improve organization, add new characters, and expand its otherworldly weirdness. This will be a much longer version of the original first printed in The Great Old Ones. This 6th scenario will significantly extend the length of Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans. All of the art, handouts, maps and layout will be completely redone to match the rest of the books aesthetic. Backers will now own BOTH Yellow Sign scenarios in a single book, offering a two part mini-campaign where investigators will battle the abhorrent influence of The King in Yellow across Jazz Era New Orleans.\nBUT WAIT\u2026 That\u2019s not all! Upon reaching this stretch goal every backer at or above the Algiers level will get an set of Official Golden Goblin Press Mardi Gras Beads!\nMock Up, Not Actual Beads\n#5 ACHIEVED!!!!!) $24,000, Legends of New Orleans- Golden Goblin Press is dedicated to bringing the fans new voices and helping develop a whole new crop of authors. Legends of New Orleans will be a PDF collection of non-mythos scenarios based on the historic folklore of the area by talented authors who might not have seen or are just getting to know. We hope to have Legends of New Orleans available in October. It is available free to backers at or above the Algires level and obtained as a $10 add on to any lower backer level. Legends of New Orleans is a semi-exclusive backers only item and won\u2019t be available to non-backers until April of 2015. \nInitially it contains two scenarios; although this could grow as later stretch goals are achieved. The initial pair of scenarios are : \nServa Me, by John A. Almack- Wherein the investigators uncover the haunting past surrounding a young lady's antique chest. Their investigation into local colonial history leads them from the Garden District to the French Quarter, as they seek to unravel a tragic and ghostly mystery in one of the most haunted cities on earth.\nNever Cry Wolf, by Mark Shireman\u2013 Rougarou, the word alone is enough to send a chill up the spines of the denizens of Acadiana; a human cursed to change into a beast that prowls the night, killing the unwary. The investigators respond to a series savage attacks on prominent citizens. Fear and suspicion quickly spreads fanned by sensational headlines and the claims of a respected priest, laying the blame for the attacks on a rougarou summoned by \"The Witch of Bayou Gentilly\".\n#6 ACHIEVED!!!!!!) $26,000, Meet Etienne-Laurent de Marigny- This character was created by H.P. Lovecraft and is one of the most famous New Orleans natives in the Cthulhu Mythos. He is described as \"this continent's greatest mystic, mathematician and orientalist\" and as a \"distinguished Creole student of mysteries and Eastern antiquities\". This important figure, the friend and financial executor of Randolph Carter, appears in multiple scenarios within Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans. This article will give Keepers everything they need to know to quickly drop this expert in the unknown into their home campaign. He is the perfect hook for Keepers looking to involve investigators in local mythos cases and an invaluable resource for advice, assistance, research, or possible rescue. We are thrilled to offer \u201cMeet Etienne-Laurent de Marigny\u201d as our 6th stretch goal, written by none other than the acclaimed Scott David Aniolowski. \n#7 ACHIEVED!!!!!!!) $27,500, MORE Legends of New Orleans- This bonus PDF will now contain two additional scenarios, for a total of four. For more details on the Legends of New Orleans PDF, please see Stretch Goal #5. The two additional scenarios are:\nDeliver Me from Evil, by Jon Hook- Wherein the investigators help an old friend retrieve his prodigal younger sister from the debauchery of New Orleans. However, she may have gotten involved with far worse things than smoking, jazz, gin, or the fellas. Her new friends and employers are not keen on letting her leave, nor are they technically alive. Break out the crosses, garlic, and holy water, boys and girls; it\u2019s going to be a LONG night.\nCurse of the Devil Baby, by Simon Yee\u2013 The story of the cursed Bowes family and their hideous demonic child is a well-known tale in New Orleans. The Devil Baby of Bourbon Street died long ago, and its terrifying story ended there. Or did it? The investigators are called upon by the surviving members of the Bowes family to recover something taken from them. The remains of a child, stolen out of a tomb marked only with an X, must be recovered at all costs.\n#8 ACHIEVED!!!!!!!!!!) $32,000, Five Lights in the Crossroads \u2013 Let\u2019s make Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans a truly massive book, rivaling the size of any scenario collection produced before now. Golden Goblin Press is very pleased to offer this final addition to the core book. This seventh scenario, by Jeffrey Moeller, will round out our collection in epic fashion.\nFive Lights in the Crossroads, by Jeffrey Moeller- What do the missing hand of a hanged convict, whispers from the mouth of a dead man, and the Loa of Voodoo ritual have in common? Tragic consequences, in this intimate, character driven tale of things man was not meant to know, exploring both traditional concepts of New Orleans folk magic and the dark corruption of Cthulhu Mythos.\nBut Wait! If we reach this stretch goal, every backer at and above the Algiers level will receive an 8X10 inch print of the cover art for Tales of the Crescent City - Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans. \n8X10 inch art prints & 16X20 inch posters!\n#9 ACHIEVED!!!!!!!!!!!) $33,500, Even More Legends of New Orleans -  This will add TWO more scenarios to the Legends of New Orleans PDF, bringing it to a total of six. These scenarios are written by Golden Goblin Alumni Tyler Hudak (you may remember him from Island of Ignorance-The Third Cthulhu Companion) and plucky newcomer Nick Nacario, who is trying to fight his way onto the Goblin Horde.  \n#10) $35,000, Photos from New Orleans Mythos - Our friends in the Big Easy have offered to take photographs of the iconic locations used in our scenarios. Many of these will be digitally altered to appear period to the 1920's and used to further augment the art in both Tales of the Crescent City-Adventures in Jazz Era New Orleans and Legends of New Orleans.\n#11) $37,500, A Dark and Deadly Dozen - A collection of four mini-PDF's released over the next four solstice / equinox with detail one dozen original creatures, cultists, mythos tomes, artifacts or places for use in your Jazz Era, New Orleans based Call of Cthulhu game.

Terrors of Octobernomicon is a collection of six (seven if we unlock Stretch Goal Three) call of Cthulhu scenarios by new and newish authors, working with two Ennie Award winning mentors (Matt Wiseman and myself, Oscar Rios). The scenarios take place during the Roman Empire (Cthulhu Invictus), to the Old West (down darker trails), and the classic era (1920\u2019s \u2013 30\u2019s), with exotic locations such as Ancient Arabia, the Colorado territories, Great Britain, Italy, and Egypt (and in the Stretch goal three scenario, Australia). If want to support a new team of talented authors, including two young women, then please consider backing this project. We\u2019re currently 77% funded and would LOVE to cross the finish line and start knocking down stretch goals (which included a fiction companion, for those non-role-player fans of ours out there).

Players work against one another to be the first to assemble a time machine using turn of the century \"Steam Punk\" inspired components.\nSteampunked is a simple game, made up of 4 different card types: Mad Scientists, Quackery, Components, and Actions. The core set is 60 cards and is designed for 2 players, but is easily expanded to play up to 6 players with the two expansions available through this Kickstarter (see add-ons).\n(2) Mad Scientist Cards - used to give each player a unique persona and special ability.\n(6) Special Mad Scientist Cards - these are 6 new playable characters sponsored by backers. They have new special abilities and an optional build list for a more challenging game experience.\n(12) Quackery Cards - used to give players energy in order to play component and action cards.\n(27) Component Cards - used to build a player's time machine.\n(13) Action Cards - used by players to perform special actions.\nPlayers start the game by choosing a Mad Scientist. Each Mad Scientist has a different special ability. Next, all the Quackery, Component and Action cards are shuffled together. Each player is dealt 7 cards and the game begins.\nEach player has 3 phases during their turn:\nQuackery Phase - If the player has any quackery cards face down on the field, they must flip them face up at this time.\nMain Phase - The player may play any card from their hand as long as they have enough energy to do so. Each point of energy is represented on the player's mad scientist and quackery cards. These cards are flipped face down as the energy on them is used up. Player may also draw additional cards and/or discard cards at a cost of 1 energy per card drawn or discarded.\nEnd Phase - the player counts their cards. If they have less than 7, they draw cards until they have 7. If they have 8 or more, they discard until they have 7.\nThe first player to assemble their 9-part time machine and end their turn wins the game. However, this is easier said than done. This is the point in the game where the fur really starts to fly! Action cards are played in rapid succession as your opponents attempt to break and disassemble your machine in order to get parts for their own creation. The only way to assure your victory is to employ a multitude of strategies including, hording parts, conserving energy, forming alliances, and, of course, breaking said alliances at the most opportune moment!\nMad Scientist, Mad Scientist (Expansion #1), Mad Scientist (Expansion #2) - Work with our artists to have your name and likeness used for one of six new playable characters in the Steampunked Core Set, Expansion #1, or Expansion #2.

Get out your favourite sword, your best magic spells and/or your most-cunning stealth boots and set upon performing the will of the Emperor in solving the mystery of the \"magical accident\" that threatens the whole realm.\nJourney to the epicentre of the magical accident - The City - where your former Magical Masters whom trained you in the ways of magic have unleashed magical energies beyond their control and created forces that threaten the whole Empire. Can you discover the cause of the accident? Can you discover the truth behind the cause? Can you reverse it, or hold its encroach or merely stop its flow? Will you discover the real deep, dark truth and what will you do with this knowledge? Step forward, Hero...\nFeatures\nPlay your way. Do the main quest first or go off and do side-quests or just go off and explore. It's up to you.\nChoose a pre-made ready-to-go character class or create your own character class by allocating points to attributes and skills.\nDeal with adversaries via melee, magic, stealth or a combination of all three - it's up to you how to play.\nLevel up your character by gaining experience in using your skills - grow your character your way.\nExplore and/or loot: most of the world locations will be available to you from the start - just make sure you're not too low level for some of the areas!\nEndlessly extendible via content made by fans of the game. Basic mod tools will be released after the game ships (enhanced mod tools will be part of the stretch goals).\nSilicon Game Engine\nThis is a game engine made by myself. It needs work to polish some things and to finish up other things. Its current state has all the things required for a game engine (in various states of completion) is what is being used to made the launch videos. Expect more game engine videos during the lifetime of this Kickstarter campaign; I'll be putting them up on my YouTube channel and linking them in updates to this page!\nGame Engine Features\nCurrently running on PC. Other platforms possible in the future but not currently within the scope of this game project.\nMulti-core engine. The engine can use however many CPU cores your processors has for enhanced physics, etc. Dual-core processor? Fine. Hyper-threaded quadcore cpu (8 threads)? Fine. Hyper-threaded hexacore cpu (12 threads)? Fine.\n3D engine built on Irrlicht, Ogre3D and 6DX.\n3D engine supports Forward Rendering, Deferred Rendering, Hybrid Rendering and simple Ray Tracing with full Post-Process support.\nMulti-core physics via Bullet Physics.\nRigid body, soft body, fluids, cloth and water physics via Bullet.\nProcedual Tree Generation - make endless varieties of trees.\nPath-finding and steering via OpenSteer.\nHuman-readable data files, where possible, for easy tweaking.\nMassive resolution skies and sky-boxes exported from third-party app Bryce.\nOriginal animation files from Truebones Motions. [Modified for use in the engine.]\nCharacter creation, rigging, skinning and animation via Milkshape3D.\nCharacter rigging, skinning and animation via Ultimate Unwrap Pro.\nOriginal building models and props from Arteria3D.com. [Modified for use in the engine.]\nScene editor: IrrEdit from Ambiera with extensions written by myself.\nMulti-core sound engine irrKlang from Ambiera.\nMost sounds and music are licensed from ArteriaMusic.com.\nAlso using parts of the OpenAL SDK.\nxNormal tool used for normal maps/parallax occlusion maps.\nScripting: Squirrel and LUA.\nOptional Full-scene Anti-Aliasing via FXAA from nVidia.\nStory\nThe story is something I have been putting together over a long period along with other copious notes in my \"Tim Schafer\" style notebook. There are some nice twists in there and the ending is \"interesting\" to say the least, but to give any of that away would completely spoil the game. If you want to know more you will have to back the game. :-)\nBTW The main character of the story is gender agnostic - you can choose to be Male or Female to start off as the Emperor's Champion, and there are neither rewards nor penalties for the choice.\nYour background story details what you did after leaving the University Of Magic many years ago in your youth and basically describes how you got to be the character class that you start the game with.\nYou are sent off on your quest in dubious circumstances. Your initial target is the University Of Magic, where you were taught magic in your youth by the Magic Masters. And since you are travelling to an area that is highly dangerous and in high magical flux you somehow end up waking up in a dungeon with no equipment and Level 1 and feeling weak, both magically and strength-wise. Exactly how and why this came about may unfold during your questing. Anyway, your first order-of-the-day will be to get yourself out of Tutorial Dungeon, looting, I mean Treasure Hunting, what you can in the process and start your adventures!\nQuests\nThe open-ended nature of the game means that you can do quests when you please. Main quests and side-quests will generally be available to-do as required. Also, when the mod tools (SDK) are released there will hopefully be the option of many, many fan-made missions that will enhance the longevity of the game.\nEnemies\nIf you have played any fantasy RPG games before then you will have a good idea of what's going to be coming at you (or maybe aiding you, as a summon). Undead, ghosts, skeletons, rats, goblins, dwarves, etc.\nCombat\nHit stuff with shiny swords, rusty battle-axes and huge war-hammer things. Find out what works and what does not. Edged weapons on skeletons may not do much, for example. Build up your character stats to focus on combat or spread your level-up points to build a more rounded character - it's up to you.\nThere are unique weapons out there for you to loot, steal, find and pry from the fingers of deadly enemies...if you can.\nBTW Yes, I realise that \"melee\" has an apostrophe on the end \"e\".\nMagic\nChange the nature of the world, change yourself or even create matter from nothing (from magical energy actually - the law of conservation applies here).\nExamples: unlock doors; turn invisible; summon climbable crates; summon skeleton allies; throw missiles of fire/frost/stone/etc.; jump over high walls (and break your legs on the descent?).\nFunding Goal\nPlease help get this project made by helping me reach and, ideally, exceed the funding goal. The more money I can raise the better game I can make. If the funding goal is not met then, as things stand at the moment, this project will almost certainly not be made.\nBuy a copy for yourself; buy a copy for a friend; buy a copy for Sunday Best; buy a copy for your cat, as we all know cats love fantasy RPG's; if you think the game sounds rubbish, buy a copy for someone you don't like!\nStretch Goals\nI have ideas for stretch goals, such as increasing the amount and quality of the content, but the details are not really relevant until the initial funding goal is met. If the funding goal is not met then this project will almost certainly not be made. Lets get over the first major hurdle first and then we can discuss stretch goals!\nBacker Rewards\nThe game has been priced in the Backer's Rewards in such a way so that backing the game now will be cheaper than buying the game once it it released. If you want the game at a reduced price compared to retail then back the project now!\nAll backers will have their names listed in a Thank You Backers! section in the game credits or the game website. the eagle-eyed among you will notice that the backer rewards are all things that are easily producible  and deliverable by myself - this is for ease of fulfilment. Some backer rewards have been restricted in quantity in order to ensure that the production and/maintenance of said reward doesn't get too overwhelming.\nOh, and if someone backs the BOSS reward and they want a Dragon boss or a character with an arrow in their knee then I cannot be held responsible. ;-)\nPlease note that I cannot make characters or content that impinges upon the copyright of other games, though I will try my best to comply with backers' wishes.\nBeta, Modding Tools and Steam Release\nThe current plan is to release for PC only on the Steam platform. This will allow those Backers who have chosen to take part in the Beta phase to obtain the Beta version of the game from Steam once it is ready, for delivery of the game, for patches and updates to the game and for the Steam Workshop for a common place to find and download user-made mods.\nA completely DRM-free version of the game may be offered but this will probably be subject to stretch goals.\nOf course, this is subject to the game been accepted on Steam. If we have not been accepted on Steam at the point in time when the Beta is ready then we will have to look at Plan B.\nScreenshots\nIn-game screenshot\n  irrEdit scene editor for Silicon RPG\nIn-game building model with real-time Ambient Occlusion\nAbove in-game building - showing real-time Ambient Occlusion only.\nSilicon RPG scene editor - boat scene\nScene editor showing procedural trees\nIn-game screenshot - Castle\nIn-game screenshot - wonder what lurks in this Dungeon...\nIn-game screenshot: wonder if he'll attack me if I loot that chest?\nIn-game screenshot: there's a black cat named Charl there somewhere in this scene...\nThere's Charl! [internet cookie for you if you know who Charl is]\nI said \"no dragons\"! This isn't the rim of the sky, you know...\nRequirements\nSystem requirements have not yet been finalised, but we are looking in the order of a dual-core 2.6Ghz CPU, Windows Vista/7/8/8.1, DirectX9, Shader Model 3 video card with 512KB of video memory and 2GB of system RAM. Recommended system will be above this. Ultimate system will be whatever is in the PC, as the game can handle as many cpu threads as you can throw at it. The game engine is very GPU friendly (as you would expect from a professional graphics engineer) and should handle SLI/multi-GPU setups with little effort.\nNote: Windows XP is due to be unsupported by Microsoft by the time this game is due to be released. Whilst it is possible that the game will run on Windows XP, this platform will be unsupported.\nDirectX-11 and 64-bit versions of the game may be available as stretch goals. Both are currently supported in my game engine but would require work to get them to Release state.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving worked for major Game Studios on multi-million selling titles costing millions to make and also having previously worked on my own as an independent software engineer I feel I am uniquely aware of the issues involved in the project I have proposed in making a small, fun indie video game. I am also well within my second decade of professional software development.\n\nThe biggest issue is having the time to work on the project full-time in order to get it released by the proposed time-frame, which is what the funding from this Kickstarter campaign will help me to do.\n\nI have also personally invested a lot of my own time and money into producing the prototype so I have a very strong vested interest in getting this project to the Release phase once I have been funded.

Face to the wind, back to the mist, they cut the water in their dragon prow ships, bringing the song of death and plunder upon the backs of gods that rose from the maelstrom of eternity. With axe and sword, shield and spear, they rose as if from the ether and opened the world to a storm of primeval lust.\nThe Codex Nordica plunges into their world, exploring the myths and cultures of the Vikings, from Odin's Ravens to the Jotun fortress of Gymirsheim. Brian Young explores the Nine Worlds of the northmen, the legends and myths, the magical creatures, gods, heroes, giants and monsters that peopled them.\nAll this is presented as a back drop to the game you are already playing. Expanding upon the core of C&C material Codex Nordica brings a host of new wizardry and enchantments, gods for the characters, warriors and battle craft.

The base RPG is compatible with Pathfinder, 13th Age, Fate, and Castles and Crusades (SIEGE)!\n* 11 new races and 11 new classes.\n* Combat tracking and character sheets ready to be copied...everything you need to start!\n* A starting adventure to let you jump right in and start playing.\n* A short story written by Richard Lee Byers based on the iconic Fall of Man characters on the cover!\nWhen the world was to end, inexplicably, it did not.\nThe year is 2061, 30 years since the meteor known as Satan\u2019s Maul slammed into the Atlantic Ocean, causing what scientists predicted should have been an extinction level event.\nHowever, Earth had ties beyond those known to man. When all our technology had failed us and our world was being torn asunder, it was magic which stitched and scabbed the world whole again. Today technology and magic fight a silent war for domination; the One God of Earth battles the many gods of Gothos; the magic world merged with earth to sustain it and humans fight for survival in a world now infested with orcs, dragons, elves and even more nightmarish creations.\nWelcome to the Fall of Man.\nClasses:\nIn Fall of Man there are 11 core (starting) classes to choose from that advance through 20th level. Each has its own unique set of skills and abilities.\nArcanist (ARC): A learned spell caster who studies the arcane arts in order to work magic in the fallen world.\nAsphalt Samurai (ASI): A street smart warrior who wields both blade and gun that follows a strange tradition of ancient Bushido codes.\nCleric of the Many Gods (CLR): A divinely charged spell caster and warrior who is a devout follower and prophet for the many gods that crossed over from Gothos.\nDreamwalker (DRM): A martial artist who has connected with Mindar: God of Dreams and is able to alter reality with their waking dream-state.\nFace (FCE): A gifted and charismatic wheeler dealer who is great at bartering as well as lying, cheating, etc.\nGifted, The (GIF): A strange mutant who is naturally gifted with the powers of the arcane.\nMechanist (MEC): A technology wizard who studies the old tech stuff from before the fall.\nPriest of the One God (PRE): The divinely powered followers of Earth's only God before the many Gods of Gothos arrived.\nScavenger: (SCV): A packrat and thief of the new fallen world. Stealthy and clever with an eye for the value of junk.\nSoldier (SLD): A well trained warrior who is adept at the fine art of modern combat.\nWasteland Barbarian: (WLB): Feral mutant savages who are ferocious warriors.\nThe Fall of Man corebook will introduce Advanced and Master classes, which will be available in future supplements. Both Advanced classes, available after 10th level, and Master classes, available after 20th level, will be able to advance past the normal 20th level of most characters.\nRaces:\nHumans: Humans are the surviving native race of Earth and once dominated the planet with powerful technology. Now, the race of man is in a steep decline and competing with the other newly arrived races for basic survival.\nCanite: The Canites are said to be a creation of the stuff of the dream world.  Anamorphic canines, the proud and loyal canite race now run in packs and are well known for their ability to hunt and track.\nDwarf: The Dwarves of Earth have secluded themselves away underground and only a few venture forth to adventure. Some speculate whether this is because of their desire to live alone or due to some other, darker secrets.\nElf: Many of the Elf race were the first to head the warnings of Midnar and take action to preserve their kind in the merging of Gothos and Earth. However some others either did not heed the call or were unable to prepare and now walk the earth \u201cblasted\u201d with foul spirit and intent.\nGnome (The Twisted): Gnomes were once considered to be a happy race. Similar to Halflings in stature, the gnomes were small but had big hearts. They are now cursed in the transition to Earth with something called \"the bent.\" This has gained gnomes the terrible name \u201cThe Twisted\u201d.\nHalflings: True to form, the Halflings seemed to avoid the various afflictions that occurred to most of the other races in the transition to Earth. In fact, halflings seem to now be able to affect the world itself with their stories and song.\nHalf-Elf: Like most half-breeds, the Half-Elf is a displaced creature, especially on Earth after the fall. Sharing both Elven and Human traits, they seem to not fit in with either race.\nHalf-Orc: The Half-Orc is generally thought of as a down trodden sub-race. They are not as smart as humans and not as strong or robust as pure orcs which seems to put them at a disadvantage but they make up for it in raw tenacity.\nHanites: Hanites are a new species of being which originated from man and who will be further previewed during the Kickstarter.\nMutant (Template): In a world where technology, magic, radiation, and toxic effects exist, mutation was inevitable.  Unlike the other races, mutant is a template which is added on top of another race\u2019s abilities.\nReborn: When the first reborn appeared shortly after all the devastation, no one knew what to make of them, instantly assuming they were zombies or something worse. Their ashen, dead, cold skin and their white dead eyes made them obvious targets for undead hunters. It was not for quite some time before someone figured out the reborn were not truly undead and were not always evil or good, being much like humans in this regard.\nWhat makes this setting different: \nIn Fall of Man, it is a fight for survival.\nThe world is warped, twisted and everyone is severely flawed and conflict abounds, even between players. And through that conflict, both roleplaying and tangible game effects engage the players to interact beyond simple camaraderie around the table; it is you vs. the world (GM) and each other.  \nTechnology vs. Magic; The One God vs the Pantheon; Real vs. Imagined; all of these things collide to make a world both familiar yet new.\nCombat is harsh and gritty, but still allows for long term progression and the capacity for heroic deeds.\nAnd everything is not what it seems...  Even among the characters themselves as they evolve not just in their classes, but in their racial and physical (mutant) features.\nFrom the world's pain, we gain a place in which GM's can explore their darkest nightmares and manifest them for their players while the players themselves have the opportunity to respond in kind.\nGothic Horror and Fantasy in a Post Apocalyptic setting. That's what sets Fall of Man apart. \nSystems: This setting is based on the Pathfinder system on steroids. If you have played in a d20 system you will be familiar with the basic rules. It will also be available for 13th Age, FATE and Castles & Crusades (SIEGE), with specialists in each system doing the conversions.\nInformational Videos\nHere is a video we made discussing the Barter and Trade system that is included in the Fall of Man:\nPLAY\n\nAll backers of + levels will receive a 32 page PDF of bonus player character content including new feats, alternate class and racial features, equipment and other goodies.

Please feel free to have a look through my portfolio and contact me for any further information or samples.\nI'll try and tell you a little about myself without taking up too much of your valuable time! I have always had an interest in drawing and as a result decided that an artistic career was for me. I graduated from the University of South Australia studying Visual Communication. After a brief stint working in graphic and web design I made the move into the entertainment art industry and worked as a professional Concept Artist, Creative Director, Art Director and Illustrator/Designer for a range of clients and companies.\nHerald of Thanato\nGill Pearce My name is Gillian Pearce although I do prefer to be called Gill. I tend to lurk around online using the nicknames Hellion or Kharnate. I divide my time between my day job working in a local school and illustrating on a freelance basis. I also help out as art director for Dark Quest Games. I have been illustrating professionally for approximately 12 years now and I have numerous publishing credits in various fields ranging from book cover and interior illustration, card game artwork, role-playing game illustration and cartography. My artwork is created using traditional methods and very little in the way of computer enhancement aside from map labels and the like. My colour work is produced using a heady mix of watercolour and acrylic paint with a hint of ink and pencil and my black and white work is primarily achieved using fine-liners, although I do occasionally indulge in black and white pencil work. I like to consider myself versatile when it comes to subject matter and will tackle sci-fi, horror, fantasy scenes, figures, monsters and maps with the same enthusiasm.\nCity of Pavis\nWar Dragon\nRoel Wielinga has been described as a \"DREAMER\", a description that suits almost every aspect of the artist.

Portrait, Fantasy, Realism, and Science Fiction Art has always been a big part of Roel's life.\nFoM races\n Jhoneil Centeno is a Filipino/American artist best known for his fantasy cover paintings of several d20 books.

Most of us have other full time jobs, so while we have the best intentions it may run a little late. We have people constantly following up so we feel this is a minimal risk.\n\nWe are printing in the USA so that should leave minimal issues with delivery as well since it will not need to go through customs and we will have a faster turn around from the printer. This printer has helped other RPG publishers do very successful Kickstarters and are aware of the potential demand this book may cause.\n\nWe have partnered with Chronicle City for distribution everywhere but the US*.

They will do it in their own, unique, fun way! \nScale - Map Flats are sized in inches and scaled at 1 square = 1 inch. Because this is compatible with most tabletop RPGs and 28mm miniatures games, 1 square is roughly equivalent to 5 feet.\nWet Erase-able - I use my Expo Vis-a-Vis pens on these all the time and they work like magic!\nDurable - These maps have a +100 bonus vs. water, milk, soda, energy drinks, baby wipes and household cleaning products. \nHigh Def - Yup, these babies are better than real life! Printed at 1440 dpi. \nSimpler Solution - These bad mama-jamas are tons easier to haul to your next gaming session than 3D terrain and hold up better than any card-stock or cardboard maps that exist on the market currently.\nModular - These maps do not bind you to keep re-playing the same set up over and over. You can arrange and re-arrange the settings as much as you need to.\nAffordable - You've seen a lot of maps out there, and sometimes, as a broke gamer, it's not always attainable to get decent quality maps that will hold up against the vicious battles that will be waged on them. It is our goal to provide not a decent quality map, but a STELLAR quality map at a price that a financially impaired GM can justify. \nD'Nal and the Hathonian Plains -\nHuh??? That's right, we decided to create a world around these maps! We're that cool! \nThat's not to say, or deter you from using them in other known worlds by any means. We simply want to paint the canvas of a new and exciting world for you to throw your unwitting players into! \nD'Nal - is a large continent in the world of Etheros. D'Nal is rich in culture, crops, mystery, and adventure. We start our Map Flats sets with the Hathonian Plains.\nHathonian Plains - The plains on D'Nal take of most of the center mass of the continent. The elevation and climate are perfect for growing crops and raising livestock. Inhabited mostly by human peasants and famers, the wealth is found in the soils of the farmsteads. \nThe plains, however, are also home to monsters of all shape, size and intelligence. Under the Hothonian Empires protection, the vast plains are filled with pockets of unwatched and unexplored territories. \nThe houses and structures found on the Hathonian Plains can act as a sanctuary to weary travelers, or as the setting for terrible acts that only the heroes can face and survive. \nBring on the samples!!\nPLAY\n\nHathonian Tavern: What noteworthy adventure doesn't involve a tavern? A sinister plot, meeting with a new employer, or just looking for a brawl. The tavern has always been a key component to storytelling.\nTavern\n Farm House: A great setting for a side quest, the scene of a dastardly deed, or just a place to catch some shut eye on the road to journeys end.\nFarm House\n What you will get: \nWhat you get solely depends on your pledge level... but we all know that.

This flat brings a common structure to vivid life!\nArmorer\nTownhouse bottom floor\nTownhouse Top Floor\nAlchemist shop\nPush Goals: \nOK everyone! I'm throwing out some push goals! These will all be added to the Hathonian Plains Core Set and above. These are just a few of the samples that will be included with each set. There will be 12 of each addon set. \n$2000 - Treasures & Crates\nTreasure Hordes\nTreasure Chests\n$3000 - Traps\nMagic & Standard\nTraps\n$4000 - Blood Effects\nBlood Trails\n$5000 - Hex Grid Option\nAt the $5000 level, you will have the option to select the Hex grid or Square Grid in your survey after a successful campaign. So for those of you wanting that hex grid option, here it is! \nStretch Goals:\n$6500 - Map Augments*. I know... you're saying - \"What does that mean?\" Well, I'll tell you what that means. \nOur maps are made with specific dimensions. This limits their re-usability. So we have come up with some 'Augments' that will spice up what would otherwise be redundant scenes. \nTavern Private Room\nFor example: We have a few augments for the tavern, one is a nice sized stage area that you just lay on top of one of the sides of the tavern. Or how about a secluded room off to the side of the tavern for private meetings? We are including these augments as a free addon at the $6500 mark!\nSpare Bedroom\nFull list of augments coming soon! \n$7000 - Plains Map*. All core sets will include a 2X3 foot plains vinyl map with 1 inch square grids. \n$7500 - The Keep*. All core sets will include a two floor keep. Both floors of this structure is  24\"X30\" and is the perfect addition to the Map Flats family.\n$8000 - Merchant Ship*. All core sets will include a 4 floor merchant ship. These ships will be put out on four 10\"X30\" maps.\n$9000 - Dungeon Map*. All core sets will include a 2X4 foot dungeon vinyl map with 1 inch square grids.  \n$10,000 - Double Sided Maps* - All maps will be double sided with square 1 inch grids on one side and 1 inch hex patterns on the reverse side. \n$12000 - 2X4 upgraded to 3X5* Dungeon and Plains map sizes are upgraded to 3'X5'. \n$15,000 - Surm Kara Crater Teaser* - This is a teaser set for another part of D'Nal. Once home to an ancient metropolis tens of thousands of years ago, the Surm Kara (land of the dead) crater is all that remains. It is said that a great fire destroyed the city and all of it\u2019s surroundings. It was a fire so terrible that to this day even vegetation will not grow on the lands. This does not mean that the area is void of life. Many adventurers seek ancient treasures and glory in the crater, but few return. Those unfortunate few, however, return with grim stories of strange and distorted creatures prowling the barren lands, taking refuge in the crumbled remains of a long forgotten city. At this level we will include the following maps: \n(Qty: 1) Surm Kara Crater Terrain Map (3'X5')\n(Qty: 4) Scavenger tent (4X5)\n(Qty: 1) Chieftains domicile (6X6)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 1 (12X10)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 2 (10X8)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 3 (8X6)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 4 (6X4)\nCity of EeSos Teaser:\nThe great city of EeSos is located on the Tounge of D\u2019Nal, a plateau that hangs over the ocean. The city is home to tens of thousands including the King of D\u2019Nal. The city is rich with culture, but also has it's own secrets.\nDeep beneath this city, hundreds of feet under the plateau, are the docks. This is the main hub of exports, imports and black market dealings.  \nThe docks are connected to the city by stalagmites and stalactites that have fused together over thousands of years. The stalagmites are enormous in size, some so large that they hold the homes of the peasants and other merchants who reside under the plateau.  \nThis teaser set will include 10 additional maps including:  \n4 structures from the city\n4 structures from under the plateau\n1 City Map\n1 Map of the 'Pillars'\n*Virtual orders that qualify for stretch goals will be delivered in virtual products. So if you have pledged for virtual maps, you will get the stretch goals in virtual formats. Also if you have pledged for vinyl and virtual maps, you will receive both formats of stretch goals.\nBackground: \nThe Map Flats concept came from Ted's love of high quality graphic game maps and his inept ability to transfer the images in his mind to the mats he was gaming on. An avid Gen Con attendee, he admired the 3 dimensional gaming supplements but immediately recognized the inherent problem of 'easy transport' of the pieces. Also, there is a limit to customizing those pieces during play. When you draw on them, typically the only way to 'erase' the markings is to re-paint them.\nMap Flats was then born. It started with putting together a small collection of commonly used structures and items\nWe're also participating in Kicking it Forward. This is an amazing project where we pledge to give back 5% of our profit to other Kickstarter projects. We have a great community here and we're proud to be a part of it as both creators and backers!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want to utilize Kickstarter as a tool for several reasons. One is to get a strong feel for the market for this product as well as get funding for more map genres and expansions. We also want to raise awareness of these awesome products and try to get them into gaming stores all over. With your help, we can achieve national exposure and get more exciting maps and genres underway!\nWhere's the money going? \nIn short, production, packaging, artwork, shipping and marketing. The goal is to continue producing high quality maps for you to use in all your game genres and create a new world for your gamers to explore. \nRETAILERS:\nWant to sell Map Flats at your store?

All original stretch goals unlocked!\nUpdate: Pledges of $20 or more will now also receive the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\"Honestly, we wouldn't have been able to tell the stories we wanted to tell in Pathfinder without the Advanced Bestiary.\"\nF. Wesley Schneider\nEditor-in-Chief, Paizo Publishing\n\nIn 2005 Green Ronin Published the Advanced Bestiary for the d20 System. It was a monster book that took the idea of templates and ran with it. The Advanced Bestiary featured over 100 new templates and sample monsters built using them. It was a terrific toolkit and added value to every monster book GMs already owned. For years people have been asking us to do a Pathfinder version of the Advanced Bestiary and with your help, we are going to do it!\n  The rules revisions are already well under way. The question is, what will the book\u2019s final format be? We are starting with the assumption that the book will be a 264-page hardback with a black and white interior like the original, and that we\u2019ll keep the book\u2019s existing art. Really though, we want to give you a full color hardback with all new art! That\u2019s built into the stretch goals of this Kickstarter, so the final format is up to you all!\n\nUpdate: Full color printing and all new art are unlocked! \n\nYou Can\u2019t Eat Accolades! \nThe Advanced Bestiary got great reviews as soon as it was released. This was in the later days of the d20 era, when it was harder to impress people and much harder to have a hit book. The critics loved it and sales were solid. Mission accomplished, right? Well, no, as it turned out. The Advanced Bestiary and two other titles (The Black Company and Egyptian Adventures: Hamunaptra) had the misfortune of coming out when our fulfillment company (Osseum Entertainment) was dying and stealing money from our sales to stay afloat. Those three big, expensive-to-print products all sold pretty well\u2014and we saw not a dime of that money. We were, of course, still on the hook for all the associated bills: writing, editing, printing, art, etc. What should have been a triumph thus turned into a disaster. I remember figuring out at one point that for every dollar we paid the designer, Green Ronin lost three dollars. The \u201cOsseum Debacle,\u201d as we came to call it, nearly killed Green Ronin Publishing. We managed to survive though and slowly paid down all of our associated debts. \nThe fact that the Advanced Bestiary became a cornerstone book for Pathfinder development has thus always been bitter sweet. We were certainly flattered that Paizo used the Advanced Bestiary in so many of its own books and we were glad players and GMs got so much use out of it. You can\u2019t eat accolades though, so for years I had hoped we could bring this book back and actually turn a profit on it. \nEarlier this year we did a highly successful Pathfinder Kickstarter for our Freeport city setting. Last month I hired Owen K.C. Stephens to be our Pathfinder developer for Freeport and more. I believe now that the Stars are Right for the return of the Advanced Bestiary! Let\u2019s make it happen, Pathfinder fans! \nThe Stretch Goals \nAs I mentioned, we want this book to be full color and featuring all new art. We\u2019ve baked that into the stretch goals and we are revealing them all so you can see what we ultimately hope to achieve with this campaign. We are also keeping expansion of the book fairly limited by design because we want to have the finished product out to backers next July. The more we might add, the longer this would take, so we are capping the new material at 32 pages. Note, however, that there were originally five web enhancements to the Advanced Bestiary and we\u2019ll be including all of those in the new book. \nd20Pro Add-on\nd20Pro is a Virtual Table Top (VTT) program that allows pen-and-paper gaming groups to play online and now you can buy d20Pro files for the Advanced Bestiary for only $10. Simply add $10 to your pledge and you'll get the files when they are released. They will be available to the public later for $15, so this is a great deal for d20Pro Users.\nFantasy Grounds Add-on\nYou also have the option of Fantasy Grounds support for the Advanced Bestiary! Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table. If you'd like Fantasy Grounds files with your Advanced Bestiary, just add $10 to your pledge!\nThe Rewards\nHere are the reward levels for the Advanced Bestiary!\n\nHISTORIC BEAST: You get a PDF of the original (3.5 d20 rules) Advanced Bestiary.

Owen will work with you to create an awesome creature/template combo and to name the resulting monster! You will be credited in the final book, of course. Choices are subject to our approval.

See the Kits section, below.\nMonte Cook Games is thrilled to announce its next big tabletop roleplaying game: The Strange! Written and designed by Bruce Cordell and Monte Cook, The Strange is a game that crosses multiple worlds, called recursions, which player characters can explore and defend. In The Strange, your characters change with each world they travel to, taking on new aspects suited to help them function in that recursion's unique laws and structures. But dangers found in these recursions threaten not only characters, but also our very own Earth. If characters persevere, however, they can not only save themselves and Earth, they may even gain the ability to create a recursion of their own! \nIf you enjoyed the inspiring scope of games like Planescape, Gamma World, or Numenera, or mind-bending scenarios like Moorcock's Eternal Champion series, the TV show Fringe, or movies like the Matrix, you're going to love The Strange.\nWe've assembled a great team to work on The Strange. In addition to Bruce and Monte, the exceptional Shanna Germain will serve as lead editor, and she's developing some amazing concepts both for the game and the presentation of the material. Superstar artist Matt Stawicki serves as the lead artist. He's working with us to create a unique visual look for the setting. But we'd love to see you join the team too, either as a backer, or even a contributor (see the backer levels for more information).\nFor more information, please visit TheStrangeRPG.com. A lot of news about the game can be found there, and much more is coming! And keep checking back for frequent updates and more previews!\nIf you've pledged to a Kickstarter before, there are some aspects to this Kickstarter that are a bit different than others you may have seen. The differences are primarily in the way we are organizing the rewards we're offering, and the way we are handling shipping.\nMany of the rewards for this Kickstarter are grouped together into packages and kits. One of the things we learned from our prior Kickstarter for Numenera is that all the different rewards and add-ons can get confusing, particularly as we reach stretch goals. So the backer levels, all listed on the right-hand side of the page, grant you access to different combinations of packages and kits to help organize your rewards and ensure you get what you want.\nPackages are the way we group the primary rewards of the Kickstarter--the books, mainly. You get these based on the backer level you choose. For example, the \"Real Deal Package\" offers you the main game rulebook in print, which we call the corebook, and a unique character card. The \"All the Ebooks Package,\" on the other hand, offers you the corebook in PDF form, as well as the PDF of the Player's Guide, the PDF of The Dark Spiral adventure, and the PDFs of any books that are offered as stretch goals. Stretch goals may unlock additional packages. Read more about packages below.\nKits are collections of extras The Strange Fan Kit includes items serious fans of the game won't wan to be without. The Strange Player's Kit includes game aids that are great to have around the gaming table. Stretch goals may unlock additional kits, or additional features for these kits. Read more about kits below.\nBoth packages and kits will grow larger and more valuable if we reach the stretch goals we have planned. Plus, entirely new packages and kits will be offered if we reach certain stretch goals. \nLastly, as you're glancing through the backer levels, you'll notice a reference to credit toward shipping. We're doing shipping differently for this Kickstarter--rather than dictating to you the shipping method we'll use, we're putting that decision in your hands. When the products are ready to ship next year, you'll be able to give us your current address and tell us how you'd like us to ship your stuff. If your package or kit gives you a credit toward shipping, you can apply that to the cost of your preferred shipping method. If you're in the US your shipping credit is designed to cover the entire cost of basic shipping--so shipping will be free. But we're giving you the flexibility of upgrading, at the time of shipment, to faster or more trackable shipping options and apply the credit toward that cost. Read more about shipping below or on The Strange website.\nThe Strange is a cosmos-sized artifact built in the afterglow of the Big Bang. The original alien builders lost control of it eons ago, but their dark energy network remains \"beneath\" our universe. For those on Earth who've discovered it, everything is different. These select few know that the Strange hosts recursions: unique but limited worlds with their own laws of science and even magic, seeded into the network by the creative resonance of pure imagination, but still nonetheless very real. Thus, the Strange is a place where fictional worlds become realities of their own. One prominent recursion, Ardeyn, is a land of extravagant sorcery, imprisoned devils, and lost gods. Another, called Ruk, has hidden in Earth's shadow since before humanity evolved, populated by creatures that were never human, born of the fiction of somewhere else. And those are just a few of the hundreds of recursions that speckle the dark energy web around Earth. Each recursion is a place of wonder, but each risks drawing the attention of vast entities that scuttle through the primordial reaches of the Strange like bloated spiders on a web: voracious planetovores that eat worlds, recursions and prime worlds (such as Earth) alike. Many PCs are going to want to champion one or more these worlds to defend them against these horrific threats.\nThe game system that drives The Strange is the same one used by Numenera, which means it's fast-moving and streamlined, facilitating the stories the group wants to create, the imaginative places and creatures the GM needs to share, and the amazing ideas encouraged by exploring the Strange. If you're familiar with Numenera's game system\u2014referred to as the Cypher System\u2014you already know how to play The Strange. \nIf you're not familiar with it, that's okay too. The Strange is a stand-alone game. Character generation is fast and fun, because you create a sentence based on the choices you make: I'm a Clever Vector who Wields Two Weapons at Once. I'm a Strong-Willed Spinner Who Utters Words of Power. And so on. Each part of that statement helps determine your stats and abilities. \nAn experienced player will find a whole new wrinkle, however, as her character's focus (the third part of that statement) actually changes based on which world she visits. A single adventure may span many different recursions, so through the course of the game, a character will change and adopt new aspects and abilities to deal with the challenges she faces.\nWhile the Strange could potentially be host to a multitude of recursions, we focus primarily on two--Ardeyn and Ruk--in addition to the prime world of Earth, because they are the most prominent and the first two discovered by humans. As your characters explore the Strange, they may find many more. GMs will be able to add their favorite fictional settings, brand new recursions of their own creation, or even past campaign worlds from other RPGs to help populate the Strange. The possibilities are endless!\nOn Earth (and by that, we mean modern-day Earth), The Strange is an RPG of espionage, intrigue, and sometimes horror (particularly when creatures from recursions come to our world). Characters become involved with organizations like the Quiet Cabal, whose members are invested in the Strange and aided by mysterious backers; the September Project, which may have a link to a monstrously powerful figure in Ardeyn called the Betrayer; or any number of additional secretive groups that have interest in or knowledge of the Strange. Earth is a prime world, a hub of information and secrets. If you control a prime world, you control its recursions. Most new PCs in The Strange will start on Earth. \nArdeyn is a world of magic and monsters, created by humans on Earth and nested--only recently--in the Strange. Despite its genesis as a fictional world, Ardeyn has become a real place, with real inhabitants and and all too real sorcery. The denizens of Ardeyn wield mystic blades sheathed in living souls, use the dead to guard an imprisoned god, and ride incredible flying dlamma. Not all Ardeynians are human, either. The qephilim are tall, dark, angular-faced creatures with varying innate connections to the magic of their realm. It is known as Ardeyn, the Land of the Curse, and Lotan's Prison.\nRuk is an unimaginably ancient artificial construct that traveled through the Strange. While on the run from the horrific planetovores, it \"ran aground\" in the shoals of the Strange around Earth, long before humanity evolved. \n\nRuk can be thought of as part alien world and part cosmic shipwreck. The inhabitants are masters of biotechnology to the point where they shape and reshape their bodies as needed and--as we are just now discovering--they have been coming to Earth for millennia in human form for some mysterious purposes. The inhabitants of Ruk are not a unified group, and not all of them are humanity's friends.\nThe Strange corebook will be a 416-page, full-color hardcover book done in the highly beautiful, art-heavy style of Numenera (although with its own sensibilities, of course). The two books will look very nice on your shelf together. The Strange corebook will include the rules of the game, character creation information, the details of the very unique setting, some creatures and NPCs, some GMing advice, a double-sided full-color poster map, and even an adventure to get you started.\nThe Strange Player's Guide will be a 96-page full-color softcover book that collects all the character creation information from the corebook, plus an overview of the setting. This book is intended for players.\nThe Dark Spiral will be a 96-page full-color softcover book that contains a number of linked scenarios which take characters from Earth to both Ruk and Ardeyn, as well as into other minor recursions. This book is intended for GMs.\nThe Bestiary will be a 160-page full-color hardcover book chock full of creatures native to Ruk, Ardeyn, and the Strange itself.\nStrange Recursions will be a 160-page full-color hardcover book with additional detail on Ardeyn, Ruk, and other recursions.\nCharacter Options will be a 96-page full-color softcover book chock full of interesting options for characters from Earth, Ruk, Ardeyn, and possibly other recursions as well.\nThe Strange Compendium will be a 160-page hardcover book covering new Ruk tech, Ardeyn magic, Earth gear, and items and cyphers from other recursions and the Strange itself.\nMore Strange Adventures (working title) will be a 96-page full-color softcover book with several Strange adventures.\nThe deluxe corebook is identical in content to the standard corebook, but will be a leather-bound, gilt-edged edition with a cloth bookmark, special endpapers, and extra color plates. This will be a Kickstarter exclusive, with few if any copies available by any other means.\nIf you've seen the Numenera corebook, the Player's Guide, or The Devil's Spine adventure, you know these books will be beautiful. Numenera fans will find The Strange products to be excellent companions to their books, with new descriptors, types, foci, creatures, and more that they can use (the rules for the two games will be entirely compatible).\nCheck out the many reward levels we're offering on the right-hand side of this page. You'll notice that many of The Strange rewards come in packages to make them easier to understand. The contents of these packages are described below. Further, should we reach our goal and proceed to stretch goals that add additional rewards, these rewards will be added to the appropriate package, expanding the packages greatly with no additional cost to you!\nAll the Ebooks Package: You receive all the PDFs funded by this campaign.

More kits may be created by future stretch goals!\nThe Strange Fan Kit: This kit includes an exclusive, numbered, deluxe bookplate hand-signed by both designers, Monte Cook and Bruce Cordell. Further, they will personalize it as you request (subject to some restrictions on length and content).

Along with the book, you receive a $10 credit toward shipping.\n$60 The Strange print corebook upgrade to deluxe. Applicable only to rewards that include a print corebook. You will receive a deluxe corebook instead of a standard print corebook.\n$120 The Strange deluxe corebook. This is the deluxe version in addition to your regular rewards (as opposed to an upgrade that replaces your print corebook). Along with the book, you receive a $10 credit toward shipping.\nAs mentioned above, we're doing shipping a bit differently. Instead of locking you into a single shipping method of our choosing, we\u2019re giving you some options. We\u2019re doing this by including a shipping allowance with most of our physical rewards. For example, if you are getting the Real Deal Package, you'll get a $10 credit to shipping.\nWe've designed this allowance to cover the cost of basic shipping in the United States, which will cost $10 or less. Thus, if that's what you want, you shouldn't have to pay a penny more.\nBut you aren't limited to that option. When it\u2019s time to ship your rewards, we\u2019ll ask you how you want yours shipped. You can choose a faster or more trackable method, but it will probably cost more. If your shipping allowance doesn\u2019t cover it, you can pay the difference at that time.\nInternational backers will have the same options, but the final cost of even basic shipping will probably require some additional payment. (That's why we don't have any special, more expensive rewards levels for overseas backers, or require any additional payment at this time.) But just like domestic backers, international backers apply their shipping credit to the cost of their shipping, reducing it accordingly. And just like domestic backers, international backers will have the choice to use an expedited method.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how much shipping will cost\u2014shipping rates change, we may gain some efficiencies that save us money, and it can vary dramatically by destination, shipping method, and how many rewards you\u2019re getting. Rest assured, since we're paying a portion of everyone's shipping ourselves, we're going to try to get the best rates.\nAnd here's an extra bonus: If shipping your reward costs less than your shipping allowance (which is likely for US backers choosing basic shipping), we'll apply the surplus as a credit to purchases from the Monte Cook Games online store, so you can get even more cool stuff if you'd like.\nYou'll choose your shipping method in the weeks just prior to the delivery of your rewards.\nAlthough the estimated delivery date is listed as August 2014, it is our intention that Kickstarter backers will receive their copies of The Strange corebook and The Strange Player's Guide before they are generally available elsewhere (this includes retailers that are backers of the Kickstarter, who will, of course, be able to sell the books as soon as they arrive). Having recently fulfilled the Numenera Kickstarter--the largest, most complex RPG Kickstarter campaign yet fulfilled--we have the expertise to handle shipping quickly and efficiently.\nAs a final note, please be aware that while the estimated delivery date listed on each backer level is based on The Strange corebook, some rewards may come earlier, and some--such as The Dark Spiral and certain stretch goal products--will come later.\nFor additional information about shipping, visit the Kickstarter section of our website.\nWe are very excited about this project, and we hope that you'll join us in making it a reality. With your support, we'll all have an amazing new game to play next year! \nSpecial thanks to artists Matt Stawicki, Reece E. Ambrose (Epic Realities & Graphics Corporation) and Lee Smith for their gorgeous images and graphics. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe chose to Kickstart this project at its very earliest stages to enable backers to get involved in the playtest and be in \"on the ground floor\" of The Strange. That means, of course, that the product is not created yet. That's our biggest challenge. But as we showed with Numenera, creating a fantastic game book is what we do best.\n\nIf The Strange Kickstarter gets big, fulfillment is also a challenge, of course. We learned so much with Numenera (the largest RPG Kickstarter, by far, ever to reach the fulfillment stage), however, that we feel that literally no one knows how to do that better than we do. Although we experienced setbacks as we blazed a trail with Numenera, we overcame all them to deliver the vast majority of products on time to delighted backers. And shipments of later products (such as the recently-fulfilled The Devil's Spine) have gone almost flawlessly. \n\nLastly, if a meteor hit Seattle and killed the entire creative team in one fell swoop, that would also be a setback. Thankfully, we have secret robot designers in an underground bunker set to activate and finish the game should that contingency arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "The Strange, the Cypher System, and a Big Sale", "update_content": "As a backer who helped make The Strange a reality, you know its history: It was MCG\u2019s second-ever RPG\u2014before No Thank You, Evil!, Invisible Sun, and Cypher System settings like Gods of the Fall and Predation.

And its success in that regard ultimately led to those other games\u2014and in particular, to the Cypher System Rulebook.\nThe beauty of this is that every product for The Strange can be taken from that context and used for any Cypher System campaign\u2014and conversely, any title published for the Cypher System can be used in a campaign of The Strange.

Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters.

Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Each issue will be offered in PDF and full-color Print formats, with separate map bundles with both GM and player maps, giving you the flexibility to game in the manner that best suits your needs from the Pathfinder RPG publisher who understands there's more than one path to adventure.\nDon't wait, come grab fifteen of the best adventures you could ask for and help make a great periodical even better\nWhat do we want?\nRite Publishing wants to Kickstart the next 4 issues of Adventure Quarterly issues # 5-8, because we want to step up our game. Our primary goal is to bring all-new, original custom cartography and artwork for the new year, to complement the stellar writing and editing we already have. We will also continue to offer this product as a full-color Print and PDF product.  \nWhat is Adventure Quarterly?\nAdventure Quarterly is not surprisingly, a quarterly periodical that harkens back to the days of Dungeon Magazine, bringing you three Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventures of Low, Medium, and High levels each and every issue plus two articles on Game Mastery. Previous authors in the series have included such industry talents as Tim Hitchcock, Adam Daigle, Mike Welham, Tim Connors, Bret Boyd, Jonathan McAnulty, Matt Banach, Justin Sluder, T. H. Gulliver, Creighton Broadhurst, Robert N. Emerson, and Steven D. Russell.  \nACHIEVED! Initial Goal $3,000.00: Rite Publishing will create 4 new issues of Adventure Quarterly including all new custom cartography by Tommi Salama (we will no longer be using computer programs like Dunjinni or Campaign Cartographer to create our cartography, instead going with a hand-drawn style)\nUNLOCKED: 1st Stretch Goal $4,750.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art in issue #5 (we will no longer be using stock art).\nUNLOCKED 2nd Stretch Goal $6,500.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art in issue #6 (we will no longer be using stock art), also if we hit this goal I will include Coliseum Morpheuon PDF (PFRPG) as a complimentary bonus for all $10.00 or higher backers. \nUNLOCKED 3rd Stretch Goal $8,250.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art in issue #7(we will no longer be using stock art), also if we hit this goal I will include The Gift PDF (PFRPG) as a complimentary bonus for all $10.00 or higher level backers. \n4th Stretch Goal  $10,000.00 (+1,750.00): At this level Rite Publishing will be using all new custom interior art (we will no longer be using stock art in any issue); aslo if we hit this goal, I will incude 101 Not So Random Encounters Urban PDF (PFRPG) as a complimentary bonus for all $10.00 or higher level backers. \nCartography by Tommi Salama\nCartography by Tommi Salama\nCartography by Tommi Salama\nCover image for Adventure Quarterly Issue #5\n Illustration by Dallas Williams\nIllustration for Issue #5 by Gordon Napier\nIllustration from Issue #5 by Ian Greenlee\nAdventure Quarterly #4\nAdventure Quarterly #3\nAdventure Quarterly #2\nAdventure Quarterly #1", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRite Publishing has already shown it can produce 4 issues of this product with high quality writing and editing as well as beautiful cover artwork. Our challenge now is bringing in high quality custom cartography and after a dedicated search we have chosen a talented professional in Tommi Salama. \n\nOur next challenge is to keep him on schedule, however even if Tommi where to become unavailable Rite Publishing has a history of working with talented cartographers just as the Ennie award winning Jonathan Roberts (George R.R. Martin's Lands of Ice and Fire poster maps, and the Fantastic Maps line) and James \"Devin Night\" Hazelett (Devin Night's Tokens). So even if something were to go wrong we have back up plans. \n\nRite Publishing has been in business for over 5 years and has two current ongoing kickstarters Kaidan and A Novel Set in Dream. We are on track to fulfill these two projects and we have a long track record of fulfilling our crowdfunding projects. \n\nDirect Crowdfunding\nHeroes of the Jade Oath: Fullfilled \nA Witch's Choice: Fullfiled \nTo Kill or Not to Kill: Fullfiled \nRace for the Crystal Fold Fullfiled \nLitorians: Fullfiled \nColiseum Morpheuon: Fullfiled \nCurse of the Golden Spear Trilogy Fullfiled \nThe Breaking of Fostor Nagar: Fullfilled \n\nVia Kickstarter\nThe Demolished Ones : Fullfilled \nLords of Gossamer and Shadow Fullfilled\n\nThis works because no one from an ongoing project is working on the same project. For example Kaidan's author Jonathan McAnulty is not writing for Adventure Quarterly, Kaidan has its own cartographer, layout artist, artists, and editor who don't work on Adventure Quarterly. While author Matt Banach is not working on Adventure Quarterly and is only working on his Novel (he has turned over the intitial rough draft. \n\nRite Publishing believes in weekly updates and transparency. For example:\n\nWith Lords of Gossamer & Shadow we released the PDF to customers on time on Sept 30th 2013, and we released the print version to backers on November 7th 2013. \n\nAdventure Quarterly #5 is already written, we already have a cover image, The first adventurres map is completed, and its in editing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "This Concludes Our Broadcast", "update_content": "Backers!!!\nAll backers have now received the PDF of all 8 Adventure Quarterly Products! \nAll backers that were due a softcover versions of Adventure Quarterly have been sent their products.

This requires that I go on pain meds, muscle relaxer, and bed rest. This makes it near impossible to get work done, due to drug induced fatigue and pain if I try to moderate the drugs.

This campaign has been continuously running since 1977. Many of the adventures published by Necromancer Games and Frog God Games are directly inspired by this campaign. They have evolved over the decades, and more material continues to flow from it as the dice keep rolling. \nSages and wizards of legend speak of the Lost Lands\u2014many of the players who have lived and died in Bill's campaign over the years now have a place in history (in the books).\nFrac Cher the dwarf, Flail the Great, Bannor the Paladin, Speigle the Mage, and Helman the Halfling are well known to the fans of Bill's work. This is the game world, and these are the adventures in which the players of these famous characters lived and died. Hundreds of players over the past 35 years have experienced the thrills and terrors of this world. The Sword of Air is the centerpiece of the Lost Lands.\nFor a more in depth explanation of The Lost Lands and The Sword of Air please see this PDF Download: What is The Sword of Air? (2mb)\nSCROLL DOWN FOR AN EXPLANATION OF ALL THE PLEDGE LEVELS\nCurrently, this epic tome (estimated page count 500+) consists of several parts:\n1. The Hel\u2019s Temple Dungeon\u2014kind of like Tomb of Horrors on crack. This six-level, trap-and-puzzle infested dungeon formed the basis of Bill's game through his high school and college years. Clark Peterson\u2019s very own Bannor the Paladin spent several real life months in the place, and, sadly, finished the objective. This is where the fragments of the fabled Sword of Air can be found\u2026perhaps.\n2. The Wilderness of the Lost Lands extending to the humanoid-infested Deepfells Mountains and providing detail about the nearby Wizard\u2019s Wall. This so-called \u201cwall\u201d was raised by the archmages Margon and Alycthron harnessing the Spirit of the Stoneheart Mountains to raise the land itself, creating a massive escarpment to block invaders from the Haunted Steppes. These archmages are actual player characters from the early 1980s who live on in the legends of the Lost Lands. Over 70 unique encounter areas are detailed, and each one is a mini-adventure in itself. New wilderness areas may be added based on bonus goals described below!\n3. The Ruined City of Tsen. Legend has it the city was destroyed by a falling meteor. This place forms an aboveground dungeon area the size of a city, with over 100 detailed encounter areas. It\u2019s a very dark place\u2026even at noon.\n4. The Wizard\u2019s Feud\u2014This campaign-style adventure pits the players in a long-running series of intrigues and battles between two archmages. Which side will they take? Their actions all play into the overall quest, and could well determine which side wins. Law and Chaos are not always what they seem, and if the wrong decisions are made, the entire ordeal could fail. Remember, one of the wizards WANTS Tsathogga to win.\n5. New monsters, new demons, new spells, and new rules for various aspects of play.\n6. [Bonus level\u2014see bonus goals below] The Tower of Bells. This dungeon is the result of the workshop Bill ran at PaizoCon 2013, where the participants assisted him in building an old-school dungeon. Visit the tower and discover the secrets of the \u201cartist\u201d within. Beware: those entering may never come out!\n7. Character-killing Session (Bonus Module! See below). This adventure is a sequel to Wizard\u2019s Feud, and was first survived by a party in Dallas this June. This is what happens to the players should they choose the wrong side in the war between the wizards; a sort of \u201csecond chance\u201d should they fail. The adventure itself harkens back to 1980 or so\u2014even so, no one ever lived through it until recently.\n8. [Bonus Map\u2014see bonus goals below] A fold out map of the entire Lost Lands\n9. Bill Webb\u2019s Book of Dirty Tricks. This utility will allow Bill to share some of his infamous secrets of play in the Lost Lands. It contains many nasty adventure hooks, fake leads and other tricks that a Judge can spring on his players; and it\u2019s keyed with some links to this adventure.\nThe bonus module titled Character Killing Session will be added to the book; estimated page count 32 pages. This book will only be available with this Kickstarter at certain pledge levels. Bill Webb\u2019s Book of Dirty Tricks will be available later for purchase.\nFunding Level Required $75,000\nBonus Goals\n$85,000\u2014 The Tower of Bells will be added to the book; estimated page count 36 pages\n$100,000\u2014 The main book will be printed in color instead of black and white\n$120,000\u2014 The bonus map featuring the Lost Lands Setting will be added to the book\n$121,000+\u2014 One additional wilderness encounter area will be added to the book (approximately 0.5-2 pages each) for each $2,000 over the target amount ($121,000), to a maximum of 100 areas total!\n$130,000\u2014  Fat Dragon Games will provide a pdf 28mm miniature-scale 3D modular dungeon building set that can be used to recreate Hel\u2019s Temple Dungeon (or any other dungeon layout) for all contributors!\n$140,000\u2014 Herolab files will be available for purchase ($17.99)\n$150,000\u2014 Bill will write a Players Guide (estimated page count 48-60 pages) and we will include it as a pdf for $5 for all pledge levels.\n$170,000\u2014 We will print the Players Guide as a softcover book and make it available as an add-on for $10 per copy\u2014with a retail price of $20 after the Kickstarter. All pledge levels over $100 can order this for no extra postage.\nCollector Editions\nSIGNIFICANT deluxe editions will be available for you collectors.\nTwo are available; one embossed leather, and one that the printer is referring to as the \u201cnuclear edition.\"\nThe cover art will be included on the endpapers in both deluxe editions. There will be a strict limit of 40 of each leather book, and the number ordered of each nuclear edition book for each version (Swords & Wizardry and Pathfinder Role Playing Game).\nThe \"Nuclear Edition\" will have a Metal X steel coated (1mm thick) cover, with a metal clasps, and will come nestled inside a wood, velvet lined box. A truly unique item for those collectors out there. Oh yeah, the nuclear edition comes with a VELLUM map\u2014not paper.

The campaign is now over, which means Kickstarter has frozen this page and it can never be updated.  Which means that everything here is absolutely, 100% guaranteed to be hopelessly and comically out of date.  The actual Robot Turtles activity is now happening at www.RobotTurtles.com, where you should proceed immediately (after watching my adorable children in the video above). \nThank you so very, very much for your support.\n-- Dan Shapiro\nRobot Turtles Forever!\nAnd now, the campaign that started it all...\nRobot Turtles is a board game for kids ages 3-8. It takes seconds to learn, minutes to play, and will keep them learning for hours. Kids won't know it but while they're playing, they're learning the fundamentals of programming.\nI'm a father of four year old twins.  Teaching them to program a computer is the single greatest superpower I can give them. I made Robot Turtles so that my kids could learn programming basics without needing a computer. In fact, they don't even need to be able to read!\nI've been told that this would never sell in the toy aisle.  I've shown it to board game designers and manufacturers; they told me this would never work on store shelves. Learning programming just sounds too complicated.\nBut I disagree.  I think programming can be as simple as playing with these four turtles.\nThat's why I'm here on Kickstarter.  If there are a thousand of us, we can do this.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in believing that programming literacy is going to be key to our children\u2019s future. How many of us are there?\nI\u2019m a software guy who\u2019s been programming since I was 7 years old.  I invented Robot Turtles as I pondered these questions in the shower one morning:\n1) Why are kid games either pure luck (Candyland) or a frustrating exercise in trying to lose on purpose, without the child noticing (Tic-Tac-Toe)?\n2) How old does a child need to be to learn to program? (Do they even need to read?)\n3) What's something cool I can do with my kids this afternoon?\nI got out of the shower, printed out some generic robot clip art, and told my 4-year-old twins that I had a new game for us to play.  We started experimenting with the rules, and the kids couldn't get enough of it.\nI got so excited about this game that I took a leave of absence from my job at Google and spent the summer working full time to develop it.\nNow I just need to find homes for 1,000 copies so I can meet the factory minimum order!\nOne of the unique things about Robot Turtles is that only one person (the \u201cTurtle Mover\u201d) needs to read the rules. That means the kids can just start playing!  Here\u2019s how it unfolds.\nFirst, put away the Laser and Function Frog cards.  They'll get to unlock these later!\nEvery player (\u201cTurtle Master\u201d) gets to pick a turtle and gets a matching deck of cards.  \nStack the cards on the table, in piles, face up, and build a maze for each player out of walls and a jewel.\nThen read these three rules out loud to your turtle masters:\nThe youngest turtle master goes first.  They put their first card down and you move the turtle accordingly.\nIt might help to point out that the purple card turns the turtle toward the purple flower, the yellow card toward the yellow flower, etc.\nAs they progress, they build their program up on the table. If they make a mistake, they can shout \"Bug!\" and debug it.\nPretty soon your kids will figure out the secret of Robot Turtles: it lets the kids control the grownups!  The little programmers put instruction cards down, driving the turtles through the maze, but the grownup is the computer, executing commands on the board.  At its heart, Robot Turtles is a game about bossing around adults. Just like programming is about bossing around computers.\nKids love unlocking new features of Robot Turtles, like powerups in a video game.  Each unlockable changes the game to make it more challenging, so Robot Turtles can grow with your children.\nIt may not look like it, but Robot Turtles is a very simple programming language.  It drew its inspiration from Logo, the first programming language I learned as a kid (and the first programming language to prominently feature a turtle).  \nWhile the Robot Turtles programming language isn\u2019t Turing complete, it prepares kids with the skills they\u2019ll need to learn to love programming as they grow up:\nExperiential learning. Kids start the game the same way they start programming \u2013 at the command line. Every instruction they issue is executed immediately. They quickly discover that they can learn by trying things out.\nDebugging. The \u201cBug\u201d undo feature offers the simple confidence that they can try anything. If it doesn\u2019t work out, they know they can back up and try again. For new computer learners, discovering that there\u2019s no cost for being wrong is essential to their growth.\nLimited syntax. Computer programming is about expressing complicated ideas with just a few simple building blocks. The first time they play, kids will want to tell you what to do, or point the cards sideways to make them do something different. Learning Robot Turtles is a process of learning to use a new, simple language to express complicated thoughts.\nOrder of operations. It\u2019s quickly apparent that \u201cforward, forward, right\u201d is very different from \u201cright, forward, forward\u201d.\nPlanning a program. There\u2019s nothing more cool then when kids graduate to \u201cPlay 3\u201d and \u201cWrite Program\u201d and you see them planning out the whole course in their heads. Just like real programmers, they mentally run their code and debug it. Then they get frustrated and just try it to see what happens\u2026 also like real programmers.\nFunctions and optimizations. Although the youngest turtle masters may not be old enough for Write Program and Function Frog, this offers slightly older kids a level of abstraction and challenge on par with \u201creal\u201d programming. Yes, kindergartners can refactor code!\nComputers work for you. Somewhere along the line, programmers learn that writing code isn\u2019t like doing your homework \u2013 it\u2019s like ordering around a devoted (if not very bright) servant. Guess what? You are the computer and they get to order you around. (That\u2019s why kids love this game!)\nMade in America\nI spent a lot of time figuring out the best manufacturer for Robot Turtles, but in the end the decision was easy.  Delano Service is based in Battle Creek, Michigan.  They're over a century old and manufacture fantastic games like Anomia and Fluxx. Their CEO, Kim Drayer, is wicked sharp and a pleasure to work with.  And while we live in an international economy, I'm particularly proud to be able to send your family something that was made entirely in the country in which I live.  No matter where you may be! Which takes us to...\nInternational Backers\nRobot Turtles has the most amazing backers imaginable. 47 volunteer translators have already offered their services to help localize the Robot Turtles instructions in to 21 languages.  The game has no text except the instructions and the box art, so it's perfect for audiences around the world.  So far, backers plan to have the instructions available in the following languages:\nAfrikaans , Catalan, Chinese (Simplified) , Danish, Dutch, Australian English, UK English, Finnish, French , German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian , Polish, Portuguese , Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.\nIf you would like to help, please sign up!\nRobot Turtles is available internationally for a single, fixed shipping price. All tiers except the early bird pricing tier (read why) are available to international backers, including the 3-pack and 10-pack discount tiers.\nI can't believe you made it this far.\nBut if you did, you must be terribly interested in what kind of turtle experiences are available!  I will try not to disappoint.  If anything's unclear, let me know and I will clarify.  It's frustrating when you can't figure out what's in a pledge level and what isn't, so I tried to summarize each one below for you.\nThank you ($1)\nThank you for your support! Every dollar helps bring these adorable robotic terrapins in to existence. \nSummary:\nMy thanks, transmitted psychically and through email\nEarly Turtle: Full Game with Discount ($29) \nSmall print runs of games are extremely expensive - most of the cost comes from set up, so the first thousand copies are the most expensive. Still, I want to get Robot Turtles in as many hands as possible. So the first people to pledge get robot turtles for just $29, including free shipping in the US. Unfortunately this tier is not available internationally (read why). \nIncluded in the box, you get:\n1 quad fold game board (20\" x 20\" heavy duty chipboard)\n1 full-color set of rules\n4 robot turtle tiles (all tiles are 2\" x 2\" heavy chipboard)\n4 decks of cards (one for each turtle player) - 36 poker-sized cards each\n14 stone wall tiles and 10 ice wall tiles\n4 robot gem tiles\nand an incomparably good time with the kids!\nUpdate: the incredible backers of this project have enabled me to make the game even better! More cards, more tiles, and more fun.  See the updates section for details.\nSummary:\n1 game\nRobot Turtle: Full Game ($40)\nIf you pledge at this level, you'll get the same as the Early Turtle tier. Unlike the Early Turtle tier, this one can be shipped internationally (and so can all the tiers below).\nSummary:\n1 game\nThank-you Turtle: Letter & Game ($60) \nYour kid is going to be very happy: in addition to the full game, your child(ren) get a full-color letter, addressed to them by name, with an inked turtle-foot signature on the bottom. You get to choose which turtle sends it, too. And inside the game box? Their name is in the credits in the manual! This tier includes one letter with up to four children's names on it.  Note that an email will be sent asking for your children's names on Sept 27, and you must reply within three days of the project's closing (by midnight PST on September 30th) in order for them to be included in the manual.  You also get a digital printable version of award-winning illustrator Matthew Cordell's \"Turtles Playing Turtles\".\nUpdate: Because of your incredible support, a full color pick-your-own-path 32-page ebook will be included at this tier!  It's a fantastic tale where kids make decisions at each page that guide the story. It tells how Beep the turtle learns how to work with his new friend the Function Frog.  \nHere's a draft of the first of the 16 amazing illustrations in the book.  It's going to be something else. \nSummary:\n1 game\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\nTriple Turtles: Holiday Shopping 3-pack ($80) \nNot one, not two, but three teams of turtles will march their way to your door. Not only do you get to stockpile games for when they go out of print in the inevitable turtlve-pocalypse, you get three boxes of turtle joy while just paying for two! You also get a digital printable version of award-winning illustrator Matthew Cordell's \"Turtles Playing Turtles\". This level doesn't include the letter or the recognition in the manual.\nSummary:\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n3 games\nLaser Turtles: Extraordinary 3D Edition ($200)\nAs terrific as Robot Turtles is, I have been itching to make something truly unique. Something gorgeous. Something 3D.\nSomething that gave me an excuse to spend some quality time with a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter.\nAfter evaluating miniatures (big minimum order), 3D printing (ugly plastic and too expensive), and various handmade options (I have no artistic skill whatsoever), I settled on laser turtles - a special edition where all the tiles are upgraded to pure laser-made awesomeness.  \nEach one of these is made by hand, probably by me although I'm still entertaining fantasies of recruiting someone's teenager to babysit the lasercutter. They are labeled for ages 12+ (not for little ones) because they absolutely cannot go in little mouths.  But damn, do these make the game amazing!  (This tier also comes with the standard game, which you'll need for the board and cards, plus you can play it with younger ones). And you get the Thank-You Turtle.\nHere are the current prototypes. I'm going to keep experimenting with methods and materials to make this as fantastic as it can possibly be!\nIt is awesome.\nIf you want the laser turtles AND another tier, see the FAQ entry for \"How do I get two rewards?\"  \nSummary:  \nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook  \nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\n1 game\n1 Laser Turtles upgrade pack\nTen Turtles: School-size Deca-pack ($240) \nA very noble cause.

I had no idea there was going to be this kind of excitement. That means I get to place a bigger order, which means I get to make more units available at a discount!  (Note that, because international shipping is already discounted, I can't offer it as an option for Early Bird, so the best value for international backers is the 3- and 10-packs). \nInstant coloring sheets thank-you.

Award-winning children's artist Matthew Cordell has created a limited edition of 25 prints, \"Turtles playing turtles\", that are available at two pledge levels, signed and personalized by the artist. \nPrintable \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" For those of you who don't get the collectible limited edition print, all pledges at $60 or higher will get a digital, printable version of the print. \nPick your own path book. All backers at the $1 level and up get the text; backers at the \"Thank-you Turtle ($60)\" and up levels get a full-color ebook! This is shaping up to be an amazing 32-page book, illustrated in a style similar to the box cover, where kids get to decide at each page what to do next.\n50% more tiles. The original design had 32 tiles, which was plenty for basic play but could run a little shy if you really wanted to build something incredible. Every copy of the game now comes with extra walls for a total of a ridiculous 48 tiles, enough for mazes that would make a minotaur marvel. \nWe found a bug. Every game now comes with four unique bug cards, one in each deck, that kids can point to when they find a problem with their program.\nMore cards. Each deck has been upgraded from 36 to 45 cards, for bigger mazes and more turtle goodness!\nThanks so much for making it all the way to the bottom.  This project has been amazing because of people like you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first time delivering a board game. I've spent months learning everything I can about the process and interviewing some of the greatest game developers around. I've been cataloging a huge litany of problems and mistakes, and making plans to avoid them. Here's what I've come up with.\n\nI'm working with Delano Services, a major game publisher in Battle Creek, MI, that's been in business for over a century. I've quoted every aspect of the process so I know the costs and materials used. I've talked to the CEO, who fully supports the project, and has agreed to let me fly in for the initial print run to inspect the results (and to package up the collector's edition boxes and ship them immediately). \n\nBecause Delano is in the US, I can and will hop on a plane if something goes wrong. Since Robot Turtles uses standard cardboard parts, the risks of unforeseen production difficulties are minimal (but not zero). \n\nShipping is something that trips up many Kickstarters, so I've been working on that for a while. It's insanely expensive. If I took delivery of a pallet of games to my basement and shipped them out to you via UPS ground, it would cost me more to ship the game than it would to manufacture it! So instead, I'm shipping the games to Amazon and using their third party fulfillment services, which saves cost (and my basement, and my sanity). \n\nBut that adds another level of complexity. So I've spent some time working with an ex-Amazon consultant to do my best to ensure that everything goes smoothly. \n\nMy biggest concern isn't actually getting you the game. It's getting you the game in time for Christmas. I've reviewed the schedule with Delano, and everyone's confident that they can do it. But in the unlikely event that something holds up production of the game - natural disaster, turtle rebellion - I will get all the backers a print-and-play PDF version, then ship the games ASAP. I don't think it'll come to that, but that's the backup plan.\n\nInternational backers have additional uncertainty. It is more likely that shipments may miss the holidays because of shipping delays, customs holdups, or border gremlins. I don't know the taxes, duties, or tariffs you may owe when the game arrives. \n\nIt's possible that, if problems occur, I may not be able to fix them to your liking. My options to make things better will be limited to refunds and, if extra inventory is still available, replacements. If extra inventory isn't available (or if there's a problem that can't be fixed, like a special reward that can't be delivered), then you're going to be stuck with a refund instead of a game.\n\nBut I'm deeply committed to getting this product in to your hands, and the hands of your kids, as quickly as possible. Whatever comes up, I will keep you posted, step by step.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Robot Turtles latest: Target in Fargo, and why that matters", "update_content": "I can't believe it's been more than a year since the crazy Robot Turtles adventure started. All sorts of amazing things have been happening, but let me tell you the part I'm most excited about.\nWhen I was two years old, our family moved to Fargo, North Dakota. I lived there until I was 12. I've been asked, \"What brings a family to Fargo, ND?\" It's the answer to this riddle: \"Where can two newly-minted professors (my parents) get a decent job at the same place and same time?\" NDSU was hiring. \nSo I grew up in the midwest, the land of the Frozen Chosen. Wonderful people, winters that would send a polar bear looking for a space heater. There weren't many options for things: ethnic food meant the chinese place on the overpass. \"The Mall\" meant West Acres, a place where people occasionally died of hypothermia in the parking lot in the winter.

Any campaign you can imagine can be built into d20Pro, though as GMs everywhere know this is a lot of work. In addition to their own creations, many GMs want access to high quality art, fully populated maps, compendiums of monsters, and all the way up to entire adventure arcs.\nIn response to our community\u2019s demand, the d20Pro Marketplace was launched to deliver top quality, ready to play products from your favorite publishers and artists. The Marketplace is now fully operational and contains some great content, but there are infinite shelves to fill with more of the product you know and love. As a small indie software developer, we need your help to fund the detail oriented work of taking each product and programming it into the Marketplace.\nThis is where you factor in. The d20Pro community needs your pledge to get the ball rolling. Also for those new to d20Pro, in addition to the motherload of content, this is an excellent opportunity to get a great deal on the software too (for which you pay for only once and it never expires). And after the content is built, you can play these adventures immediately with everything set up for you: revealable maps with built in boxed text and notes, player handouts, NPCs, and of course every stat block for encounters and wandering monsters. This allows you to put focus where it belongs: on the action and story telling.\nThe process by which the content will be entered into d20Pro is creating jobs for programmers, artists, cartographers, and fans well versed in the use of d20Pro and Virtual Table Tops (VTT\u2019s). Maps will be upgraded to VTT resolution levels and fog of war built onto them so the players can discover the treacherous plans ahead with complete surprise. GM\u2019s will have notes about traps and monsters hiding around the corner on the map that only they can see! Stat blocks will be built so they can be loaded in herolab immediately, making them alterable for the GM who wants to scale up the encounter or look at what the monsters special abilities are far in advance. More art tokens will be added to give GM\u2019s additional options to hear one of their favorite phrases from players, \u201cWhat is THAT!?\u201d.\nSo please have a look below at the books that will be lovingly, painstakingly programmed into d20Pro for your gaming group\u2019s enjoyment. More will be added as we hit the stretch goals. Thank-you for your support!\nWe begin our kickstarter with a classic from Frog God Games, The Jungle Ruins of Madaro-Shanti! An adventure for 4-8 characters between levels 4-7. You can read more about it here! http://www.talesofthefroggod.com/ons-jungle.html\nStretch Goals Phase I\nMore exciting follow ups to One Night Stand 1 : Jungle Ruins of Madaro-Shanti\n$3,000 - One Night Stands 2 : Death in the Painted Canyons \nPainted Canyons Example Map\nThe party should include a mix of abilities, especially characters with investigative and survival skills. It would be helpful, but not necessary, if at least one PC has some knowledge of the Painted Canyons, or at least some experience with desert survival. Also, a PC or companion with the outdoor abilities would be helpful, but is not needed. If your party lacks investigative skills, there are clues as to the criminal conspiracy in the gnoll encampment, or you can just drop that aspect of the adventure and run it as a stand up fight. Parties lacking survival skills or desert experience can hire a guide at Salt Springs for 3 silver shekels (gp) a day. There is a hidden secret behind all the events of Death in the Painted Canyons; a great deal of combat can be expected, and those attempting this adventure should be prepared for a vicious battle before resolving the plot. Death in the Painted Canyons is an adventure for 4-6 characters levels 5-6.\n$4,500 - One Night Stands 5 : Scorned \nScorned Orc\nThe PCs arrive in the bustling town of Whiterush and are hired to help solve protect a caravan from bandits. However, there is much more going on in the town than meets the eye and the PCs are in deeper than they originally thought.\nStretch Goals Phase II\nThe Lost Lands : Stoneheart Valley \nStoneheart Valley\nFinally, welcome to the World of Necromancer Games! From Bill Webb and Clark Peterson's home campaign comes the old-school setting of The Lost Lands: Stoneheart Valley. For over a decade, fans of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games have been asking to see the world behind the adventures. And at long last, here is where it all began, in the Stoneheart Valley near the town of Fairhill. This mini-campaign was originally presented to the fans of Necromancer Games in three separate modules: \"The Wizard's Amulet\", \"The Crucible of Freya\", and \"The Tomb of Abysthor\". Frog God Games has taken the full series from the 3E version plus supplemental material previously available only online, and converted it all to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system.\n$5,000 - The Wizards Amulet   \nThe Wizard\u2019s Amulet is a short, introductory adventure for six newly created good-aligned 1st-level characters. The adventure revolves around Corian, a fledgling Sorcerer. While an apprentice, Corian discovered a letter written by a wizard named Eralion, who it is said some years ago attempted to become a lich \u2014 and failed. Accompanying the letter was a mysterious amulet with strange markings. Joined by newfound companions, Corian set off in search of Eralion\u2019s keep and his supposedly unguarded treasure. But Corian is not alone in desiring to unlock the mystery of Eralion\u2019s fate. Darker, more evil forces have designs on the secrets reputedly hidden with Eralion \u2014 forces willing to stop at nothing to obtain\u2026The Wizard\u2019s Amulet.\n$7,000 - The Crucible of Freya  \nA challenging adventure for four to six characters of 1st or 2nd level, The Crucible of Freya is an excellent beginning to any new fantasy campaign. The adventure begins with the players\u2019 arrival in the village of Fairhill, but quickly involves them in a quest to recover a stolen holy item recently taken in an orc raid. In hot pursuit of the thieving orc band, the characters discover the orcs have taken up residence in a ruined keep nearby. Once there, the party learns that even more sinister forces are at work: the keep\u2019s original owner may still wield some influence over his now-ruined abode.\n$9,500 - The Tomb of Abysthor\nNorth of the city of Bard\u2019s Gate, in the hills of the Stoneheart Mountains, lie the ruins of twin shrines dedicated to Thyr and Muir \u2014 the God of Justice and the Goddess of Virtue and Paladinhood. Near the ruined shrines lies a series of catacombs used as burial halls for the followers of Thyr and Muir. Long abandoned, these catacombs are now home to various evil creatures. The complex has come to be known as the Stoneheart Mountain Dungeon.\n$10,500 - Saturday Night Special : The Mires of Mourning\nThe Mires of Mourning is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure designed for a party of four to six 6th-level PCs. It is set in a swamp and takes place both in the swamp itself and the sunken remains of an old asylum that still stands there. The Creeping Mire, as the swamp is known, sits on the outskirts of the provinces that form the borders of a major kingdom. It is officially within the province of Keston, though it is far enough away from the main centers of power to be all but forgotten. Even if remembered at all, it is more a source of rumor and dire reputation than any sort of first-hand knowledge. It is a place where undesirables go away to be forgotten, and everyone seems happy with that arrangement. The Creeping Mire and province of Keston can be easily placed in any campaign world where an established kingdom has a swampy wilderness area on one of its outer boundaries.\nStretch Goals Phase III\nSwitching gears from full adventure content, here is a giant compendium of awesome horrors to pit against your players. Due to the sheer volume of this book (800+ pages and 700+ monsters worth), it's distributed in pages from the table of contents. Please pledge and tell your friends so we can get the entire Tome programmed in to d20Pro, with every horror within at your fingertips.\nThe Tome of Horrors Complete\nThe Tome of Horrors? But that\u2019s been done already; why do it again? Well, actually it\u2019s been done three times, but never like this. With the advent of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game as the newest torchbearer for the world\u2019s most popular role-playing game, we need monsters\u2014lots of monsters. That\u2019s where The Tome of Horrors Complete delivers in spades. Starting from the original Tome written with the 3rd Edition rules along with the later releases of Tomes 2 and 3 for version 3.5, Necromancer Games was in the unique position to bring you updates of the classic monsters not formally released by the OGL, as well as, loads of new ones never sprung upon unsuspecting players before. So well received have these monsters been by the gaming community, that this open content has appeared again and again in game publications by other companies including updates to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system and even appearances in its own bestiaries.\n$11,500 - Monsters Aberrant to Demon\nA compendium of 50+ fully programmed, 100% ready to play creatures including: Angels, Beetles, Clockwork, Daemons, and Demons.\n$12,500 - Monsters Devil to Golem\nAnother compendium of horrors such as: Devils, Dragons, Elementals, Giants and of course Golems.\n$13,500 - Monsters Gorgons to Rat (Dire)\nInphidians, Mephits, Oozes, Puddings, and Rats round out this compendium.\n$14,500 - Redcap to Zombie\nHave at the ready Ropers, Sea Serpents, Swarms, Trolls, and Wolves with this versatile compendium of random encounters.\n$15,000 - Appendix\nJust for good measure, here is the appendix with favorites like: Frogs, and templates for Clockwork, Dire, and Undead and many more.\nStretch Goals Phase IV\nThe Tome of Horrors 4\nThis massive tome of never before seen monsters will be done in our characteristic textbook bound hardcover style, but this time in full color! Featuring over 300 new monsters from our design team led by Scott Greene and illustrated by Chris McFann, it provides new fiends to terrorize your players with for years to come.\n$16,500 - Addarth to Living Monolith\nMore horrors to throw at your players: Blood Orchids, Demons, Dinosaurs, Drakes, Elemental Lords, Giants, Golems, Korogs, Living Monoliths, and more.\n$18,000 - Lizard to Zombyre\nRounding out the Tome of Horrors with Megaswarms, Nagas, Piranha, Proto-Creatures, Shadow Hunters, Spideres, Treants, Trolls, Weirds, Witchlights, and plenty of other deadly creatures.\nPlay Faster, Play Better, Play Anywhere!\nPathfinder/3.5/4e compatible with Hero Lab:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately the risks for this project are minimal.

We hope you\u2019ll enjoy the adventures we present and the storylines we describe\u2014but we know that you\u2019re going to find a hundred ways to use the material in this book to build your own compelling storylines and epic adventures!\nYour journey into the fantastic realms of Primeval Thule begins with the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book.

We\u2019re a small company, working out of our homes. We believe that we have a fun, compelling\u2014dare we say awesome?\u2014vision for an old-school D&D world delivered with passion and a 21st-century design aesthetic. But writing, illustrating, printing, and shipping a high-quality campaign setting book isn't free. We\u2019re also committed to working with the best people in the RPG business and paying them the way they deserve to be paid. So, to do this right, we need your help.\nTo support Primeval Thule, all you need to do is click on the Back This Project button at the upper right-hand side of this page (right beside the video), or select the backer level of your choice. Kickstarter will walk you through the process and take your pledge and billing information. It\u2019s a snap!\nWe intend to make three different versions of the Primeval Thule book, one for each of the RPG systems we\u2019re supporting. Whether you\u2019re a fan of Pathfinder, 4th Edition D&D, or the excellent new 13th Age system, you\u2019ll be able to bring Thule to your gaming table. When our Kickstarter campaign closes, you\u2019ll receive a backer survey from Kickstarter. At that time, you\u2019ll be able to select the rules set you prefer for your Primeval Thule book.\nMany Kickstarter campaigns become quite complicated, and offer rewards and goodies that really don\u2019t have much to do with the actual creative project. We want to keep our campaign simple and straightforward\u2014time and effort we spend on making T-shirts is time and effort we\u2019re taking away from making the best RPG setting we can make. However, there are a few add-ons we think we should make available.\nTo make an add-on to your pledge, just add the value listed to your existing pledge. You\u2019ll be able to tell us how you want to use your total pledge during post-Kickstarter survey and communication.\nNEW!! +$50 Signed Todd Lockwood Cover Art Print\nAdd $50 to your pledge of $40 or more, and we'll also mail you a signed, 16\"x24\" (~40x60cm), full-color print of the Primeval Thule cover art by Todd Lockwood. This print will ship separately, and shipping is included to any address in the US, Canada, or Mexico. Please add $15 for shipping outside North America.\n+$15/+$35 Active Duty Military Upgrade\nAdd  $15 to your Primeval Thule Setting Book or $35 to your Deluxe Primeval Thule Setting Book reward level, and we\u2019ll upgrade your setting book to the next trim level. This is a savings of $10 or $20 for our active duty armed forces personnel to say thank you for your service. We'll want to verify your status, either through a base, APO or FPO mailing address, appropriate .mil email address, or via the dmdc.osd.mil site.\n+$10 Primeval Thule Soundtrack\nAdd $10 to your pledge and get the following 4 tracks from the Ambient Environments soundtrack by Blue Moon Studios: moaning caverns, the tunnels deep, the dark forest, and frozen tundra.\n+$15 PDF, Second Copy of Digital Thule (Obsolete)\nOriginally intended to allow you to pick up a PDF for a second system, this add-on is now obsolete, as we are now providing all three versions of the PDF to backers whose reward originally included a PDF for only one game system.\n+$40 Upgrade Deluxe to Premium\nFor backers at the Merchant Prince or Dungeon Builder pledge levels only, add $40 to your pledge to upgrade to a premium leatherbound book.\n+$50 Basic Book, Second Copy\nIf you want a second copy of the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting, we\u2019ll be happy to send it to you. Just add $50 to your pledge of $60 or more. Get a spare copy to share around the table, or buy Thule in a second rule set (you can tell us which rules sets you want in the post-Kickstarter survey). Limit 2 of this add-on per backer.\n+$75 Deluxe Book, Second Copy\nIf you want a second copy of the Deluxe Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book (including the DM screen and additional maps that come with it, of course), add $75 to your pledge of $80 or more. You can tell us which rules set or sets you want in the post-Kickstarter survey. Limit 2 of this add-on per backer.\n+$125 Premium Book, Second Copy\nIf you want an additional copy of the premium leatherbound Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book and its accessories, just add $125 to your pledge of $125 or more. You\u2019ll be able to choose the rules set or sets you want in the backer survey later. Limit 2 of this add-on per backer.\nIf we receive contributions beyond our target number, we\u2019ll be able to offer several exciting stretch goal rewards for our contributors. Most of these apply to ALL reward levels\u2014by helping us to reach our stretch goals, you\u2019re making the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting bigger and better for yourself, and everybody else!\nThat\u2019s pretty key, so we\u2019ll say it again: Your Primeval Thule book gets bigger and better as more people back us. Tell your friends!\nAt $70,000,  the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book will include an adventure by the world-renowned creator of the Forgotten Realms, Ed Greenwood! In addition, the Accursed Trio - Ross Watson, John Dunn, and Jason Marker - the designers behind the upcoming Accursed: A Savage Worlds RPG Setting, are generously providing a bonus PDF adventure to our Digital Thule bundle if we reach this goal.\nAt $80,000, we will increase the size of the book to 288 pages. With the additional page count we\u2019ll include more character narratives, more monsters, and an adventure by noted Pathfinder and 4th Edition designer Owen Stephens.\nAt $90,000, we\u2019ll continue to expand the book by another 16 pages. In addition, we\u2019ll add an additional poster map to the Deluxe and Premium editions\u2014a tactical map gridded in 1-inch squares depicting a key adventure locale from the setting book.\nAt $100,000, we\u2019ll bring the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting book to a full 320 pages, including additional character origins, terrifying new monsters, and an adventure by Pathfinder RPG lead designer Jason Bulmahn.\nAnd if more support is forthcoming, we\u2019ll keep adding content and awesome game accessories to your Primeval Thule experience!\nWe\u2019re a brand-new game publishing company formed by three longtime RPG industry professionals. We\u2019re all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we worked and played together for years on 3rd and 4th Edition D&D. We have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the RPG biz, and we\u2019re assembling a dream team to make Primeval Thule a reality.  Here are some of the key players:\nRich Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. He was one of the core designers of 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons, and wrote or contributed to scores of D&D adventures and sourcebooks in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Edition. You may know him from the Birthright Campaign Setting, the Alternity Science Fiction Roleplaying Game, Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords, and the 4th Edition Dark Sun Campaign Setting.\nDavid Noonan counts more than 50 3rd edition, 4th edition, and Pathfinder products among his credits. He was also the lead writer for the TERA MMORPG and consults with video game companies on script and narrative design issues.\nStephen Schubert worked on more than 50 3rd edition and 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons products as a designer/developer, and was a core developer on the D&D Miniatures Game team. He has since branched out into digital games.\nRenowned fantasy artist Todd Lockwood, our cover artist, is known for bringing R.A. Salvatore\u2019s Drizzt Do\u2019Urden to life on numerous novel covers, and was the illustrator who reinvented the dragons of D&D for 3rd Edition.\nChristopher West is our lead cartographer. His credits include poster maps for the Star Wars Miniatures game, the Maps of Mystery feature in Dungeon magazine, and the Numenera Roleplaying Game.\nOur stretch goal designers include some of the best-known writers in the RPG business. The legendary Ed Greenwood is the creator of the Forgotten Realms setting and hundreds of memorable characters, most notably Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale. Owen Stephens is a fellow Wizards of the Coast veteran and a Pathfinder RPG contributor who worked on the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. Jason Bulmahn is the lead designer for the Pathfinder RPG. You can\u2019t find better writers and designers!\nOur production expert is Wizards of the Coast veteran Larry Weiner, who\u2019s forgotten more about the global printing business than most people will ever know. He\u2019s the reason we can deliver a top-notch product like Primeval Thule at an affordable price. Finally, talented newcomers Justin Mayhew and Klaus Pillon are the concept artists who created the images you see on this Kickstarter page, and our logos are the work of graphic artist Mackenzie Schubert of Strip Search fame.

That said, it's entirely possible that wild drop-ins may appear if the backer count reaches these numbers between now and when the campaign ends.\nAdd-ons:\nThere are three add-ons available for the project: \"Ominous Cow\" percentile dice and a hardcover option. These are available to any backer tier that receives a physical copy of the books. You can purchase the add-ons by increasing the amount of your pledge by the indicated add-on amount. When backer reward surveys go out, there will be a question asking you whether you purchased one of the add-ons and if so which one; you'll simply indicate then which of the options you paid the extra amount for. The add-ons are as follows:\n$5 Add-on: For $5 over your selected tier, you receive a pair of \"Ominous Cow\" percentile dice. These are two 10-sided dice, one of which has the 1's place and one of which has the 10's place for your rolls. In the 0 and 00 spaces on the dice, the Ominous Cow Productions cow-head logo will appear instead of a number. Note that this is only available for the $25 backer level and above as it is included in the $20 backer level (and lower levels can upgrade to that level.)\n$30 Add-on: For $30 over your selected tier, you receive a hardcover copy of the 1d100 book that is signed with a personalized thank-you note. The drop-in/campaign book will still be softcover.\n$50 Add-on: For $50 over your selected tier, you receive hardcover copies of both the 1d100 book of lists AND the drop-in/campaign book. Both books will be signed with personal notes.\nThere was also a limited run of one-of-a-kind handbound upgrade options available, but unfortunately they sold out; see Update 35 if you're interested in seeing what they looked like.\nWelcome to 1d100!\nWhen you're running a game, it's important that your players have something to do. While meeting up in a tavern is fine and dandy, eventually the players are going to have to leave the tavern and actually get out there into the game world.\nThis can be problematic, however, as most players will expect to actually find things in the game world to quest for, rescue, loot, or kill. And if you're running the same module that everyone else has already played, your players might not be all that surprised when that group of kobolds jump out from behind that rock.\nThat's where 1d100 comes in. By harnessing the power of random encounters, your players won't know what to expect!\n1d100 isn't just a list of random monsters, though. You'll find lists for loot, NPC dialogue hooks, available weapons and armor, and more. With just a few quick rolls you can customize the shops in a town, determine what sort of characters the party encounters, and even randomly determine what sort of treasure is in that chest the party just opened... if it's even treasure at all.\nSo what is this?\n1d100 is a book that contains lists that you can use in your favorite game to generate random encounters, random items and more. As the name implies, each list contains 100 items. In most cases there will be no repeating entries; most if not all of the lists will contain 100 different entries to give you the maximum benefit of random generation. All that you have to do is roll a 100-sided die (or two 10-sided dice if you don't have a d100 on hand) and look up the corresponding number on your list.\nTo give an example, let's say that you're running a game and one of your players accidentally sets off a trap. You could go with a basic trap from your core game book, OR you could roll on a trap table in 1d100. A couple of 10-sided dice later and your player will find out whether he set off a dart trap, filled the room with poisonous gas, or something even more deadly!\nThere will be several different categories of lists included in the book. A few examples include Monsters/Random Encounters (the one that most people are familiar with), NPC Abilities, NPC Conversation Points, Subplot Threads, Found Items/Treasure, Weapons/Armor Inventory (to generate primo inventory for armories and shops) and more. Multiple lists may cover the same topic in some cases, giving you access to lists that are appropriate for different character and skill levels.\nEach list will start with a one-page summary of the list (for easy reference), followed by descriptions of each item/monster/effect in the list. The entries in the list are designed to be largely system-neutral, though they will have a d20 system leaning. A quick guide in the beginning of the book will cover how you can customize the lists for your favorite system (which should take only a few minutes while you're planning out your game.)\nIn addition to the main 1d100 book, a second book containing all of the drop-in locations, items with random effects, and possibly even a full campaign will be included with your reward. If you pledge at the digital level, you'll receive digital copies of both books. If you pledge at the physical book level, you'll receive physical and digital copies of both books. That's two books for the price of one, and this bundle won't be available in the future once 1d100 is complete and ready for retail!\nWhat is the money needed for?\nThe main purpose of the money raised by this campaign is setting up the book with things like an ISBN and other associated costs. Once that initial funding goal is reached, additional funds will be used to add content to the book and improve the overall quality by commissioning additional artwork and similar upgrades.\nSome of the money will also go toward shipping costs for print copies of the book. Shipping is included in the cost for domestic (US) backers, and an extra $6 is added to help cover the cost for international backers (this is in addition to the shipping funds included in the tier cost.)\nWhat are the rewards?\nThere are only a few rewards associated with this campaign, both because of the low funding goal and because I'm trying to keep the focus of the campaign on the book itself. Here's a quick rundown of the rewards:\nThanks/Website Mention:These are fairly common rewards, but they're very important. Without backers, things like this book wouldn't be possible. I'm thankful for each and every backer who supports this project, and will post the names of all backers (who want to be listed) at the $2 or greater pledge point. If you don't want to be listed, don't worry... in the surveys I'll send out after the campaign is finished, I'll give you the option to not be included and will let you specify how you are identified in the listing.\nThe Book:  Available in both ebook and printed versions, the book will contain all of the lists created for the campaign plus any stretch goals that are added. The current plan is to include 25 lists, but stretch goals will increase this.\nThe Dice:  Two reward tiers offer dice as part of the reward. Depending on the tier you pledge at, you will either receive two 10-sided dice or one 100-sided die with your print copy of the book.\nThe Awesome List: This is a step beyond simple autographed copies of books. In addition to an autograph, you'll receive a hand-written list of reasons why you're awesome. Hopefully you'll get at least a few laughs out of some of the things that make the list.\nThe \"You Build It\" List: If you really want to have an impact on the book, this reward gives you direct input to make sure that the list you want appears in the final version. You get to suggest the list title (pending approval, since it must be appropriate for all ages) and will be sent a copy of the list after it's created to read over. If there are things that you'll like to see differently on the list, you can suggest changes and I'll work with you to get them on the list! You will also receive credit in the book for your list. NOTE: These lists do not count toward the total number of lists projected for inclusion in the book. Any lists added in this manner are in addition to the 25+ standard lists in the book.\nYou mentioned stretch goals... what are they?\nThe project has a relatively low fundraising target, so there's a decent chance that the total amount raised will surpass the target. Because of this, there are a few stretch goals planned which will go out to everyone who pledges at \"The Full List!\" level or above.\nHere are the stretch goals that have already been achieved:\n$500 - List Upgrade! - ACHIEVED!: If we reach $500, the book will increase from 25 lists to 30 lists!\n$650 - Wonder of Wonders! - ACHIEVED!: If we reach $650, the book will add weapons that have random effects for use in your games. Think Rod of Wonder on a larger scale. This upgrade will consist of two staves, one that produces wondrous effects and one that produces horrific effects.\n$800 - List Upgrade #2! - ACHIEVED!: If we reach $800, the book will increase again from 30 lists to 35 lists!\n$950 - Art Upgrade! - ACHIEVED!: If we reach $950, additional art will be added to the final book to improve the overall look and feel of it.\n$1,100 - List Upgrade #3! - ACHIEVED!: If we reach $1,100, the book will increase again from 35 to 40 lists. That's a lot of random content!\n$1,250 - The Lost Maze! - ACHIEVED!: If we reach $1,250, a supplement will be added to the end of the book that includes a new location that you can drop into your games. It is a maze like no other; each doorway teleports players to a random room, making standard navigation practices impossible! (A guide for using the maze is also included, complete with tips on how to make sure that your players don't get lost for too long.)\n$1500 - List Upgrade #4! - ACHIEVED!: Similar to the previous upgrades, this one will take the project from 40 lists to 45. Wow!\n$1750 - The Chaos Blades! - ACHIEVED!: In addition to the two random staves, three enchanted swords with random abilities will be added to the book. One will be good, one will be evil, and one will be neutral. Behold, the Chaos Blades.\n$1900 - List Upgrade #5! - ACHIEVED!: As with previous upgrade, this one takes the project from 45 lists to 50. It also introduces a new genre category - horror!\n$2250 - The Mysterious Cavern! - ACHIEVED!: Another drop-in location, the Mysterious Cavern represents a (seemingly) natural cavern system that is generated randomly as players pass through it. As with the Lost Maze, a guide for using the Mysterious Cavern is included to help GMs avoid getting their players hopelessly lost (and helping them cover what to do if players want to head back through previous rooms.)\n$2400 - List Upgrade #6! - ACHIEVED!: This upgrade brings the total number of lists from 50 to 55, and introduces another new genre category - cyberpunk!\n$2750 - The Gauntlet! - ACHIEVED!: A third drop-in location, the Gauntlet will keep the party's thieves and rogues on their toes. It's almost like it's not a maze that has traps in it, but is instead more like a series of traps in the rough shape of a maze. Maybe it's the security system for a treasure vault, maybe it's the entrance exam to the Thieves' Guild, or maybe it's the only way to get to a hermit who really doesn't like people dropping in unannounced. As with the other locations, a GM guide on how to effectively use the Gauntlet will be included.\n$2900 - List Upgrade #7! - ACHIEVED!: Can you say 60 lists? Good, because that's what we're getting with this goal. This will help to ensure that all of the book's genres are well fleshed-out.\n$3250 - The Vault! - ACHIEVED!: A fourth drop-in location, the Vault is the hidden treasure vault of the world's oldest and largest secret society. Long thought to be impenetrable, the Vault is as deadly of a location as it is tempting. A GM guide on using the Vault is included.\n$3750 - The Township! - ACHIEVED!: At $3750, a fifth drop-in location will be added that allows you to randomly generate towns in your adventures! With a few rolls you'll be able to tell exactly what options are available in town for your players on the fly. A GM guide to using the Township is included.\n$4000 - The Dice Roller! - ACHIEVED!: At $4000, a 1d100-branded dice-rolling program will be available to all backers. The program will be available for Windows PCs and Mac OS X.\n$4500 - The Fleet! - ACHIEVED!: A two-in-one stretch goal! The Fleet adds drop-in generation of ships in a fleet armada AND generation of airships similar to those seen in popular video game RPGs. A GM guide to adding these transportation options and customizing them to the needs of the game is included.\n$5500 - The Dice Roller 2.0! - ACHIEVED!: An upgrade to the Dice Roller, a portable 1d100 dice roller app will also be made available for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and Windows RT devices.\n$7500 - The Campaign! - ACHIEVED!: At $7500, all of the drop-in locations and other drop-in content will be developed into an original campaign module that will make use of each location. The module will contain a GM guide for each location, plus a narrative adventure framework that you can use to build an adventure in the RPG system of your choice. A guide on using the framework with popular games such as D&D, Pathfinder and others will be included.\n400 Backers - The Chaos Caster! - ACHIEVED!: At 400 backers, a template will be added to the project that you can apply to wizards or mages in your favorite game system. Instead of a spell list, you'll roll off of a table of spell effects and build your spells on the fly! Each caster level will grant you additional rolls which will chain together to create more powerful effects. Will you shoot a rainbow from your hand, turn your opponent into a frog, or launch a fireball that freezes all that it touches? Only the dice know for sure!\n450 Backers - The Divine Conduit! - ACHIEVED!: At 450 backers, a template will be added that you can apply to clerics or priests in your favorite game system. Instead of a divine spell list, you'll roll off of a table of divine effects to craft spells from raw divine power! Each caster level will grant additional divine spell rolls to chain together more powerful effects. A separate roll will allow you to affect undead or evil creatures as well.\n$10,000 - The Digital 1d100! - ACHIEVED!: A major upgrade to the Dice Roller, it will now not only generate dice rolls but will also allow you to generate results from 1d100 lists from inside the program itself!\n500 Backers - The Seedbearer! - ACHIEVED!: At 500 backers, a template will be added that you can apply to druids or similar nature-based classes in your favorite game system. The Seedbearer has a direct connection with nature itself, and instead of spells you'll roll off of a table to craft nature effects and commune with plants, animals and more! Each caster level will grant additional rolls to chain together more powerful effects.\n$13,500 - 1d1000! - ACHIEVED!: If we reach this amount, the final 1d100 book will be expanded to contain a total of 100 lists (including backer-created lists and entries in the Short List.) This will likely delay production slightly, but the additional lists should be worth it.\nThe Not-a-Stretch-Goal - ACHIEVED!: $13,500 is the final stretch goal. I'm officially not creating any more stretch goals for this s project. But if the backer count breaks 700, there will be a little something extra in the campaign book as a thank you. It may very well be monk-shaped and bear a resemblance to Jackie Chan. But this is not a stretch goal! ;)\nOk, this sounds interesting. But who are you?\nI'm just a player who loves adding new and exciting things to my games. I've been playing role-playing games since I was a kid, and I've spent time as both a member of the party and as a GM. In my time as a gamer I've found that the adventures that are the most fun are the ones where you're not just following a script note-for-note... it's the random elements that makes things really exciting. So that's what I'm creating here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs the book is based on some work that I've already done, the risks should be minimal. Delays could occur as a result of unanticipated problems with fleshing out some of the lists or general life issues, but the October estimate was chosen to give myself plenty of time to complete the book so I don't think that this will be an issue. Stretch goals (if achieved) may increase the workload which might in turn slow things down, but any delays will be reported to backers as soon as they occur so all backers will know what to expect.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #95", "update_userinfo": "September update coming", "update_content": "Just wanted to send out a quick note to let you know that I haven't disappeared again.

She said, \"You mean this?\" And she sang a song I had never heard before! I asked her to sing it while I recorded it, and when I got home I Googled. Googled this phrase, that phrase, this combination of phrases, and... it was a very old traditional song with virtually no existence on the Internet. I could find the lyrics, but no printed music. I could only find one recording\u2014of a variation\u2014on iTunes. I assumed every traditional song could be found free on the internet, but I was wrong. \nWhat I've learned is that traditional songs collected by Alan Lomax get remembered; songs that made it into elementary music curriculums get remembered; songs recorded by Pete Seeger get remembered. Though we are thankful for these sources, there are other songs that are just as much a part of the American musical experience, and they are slowly being forgotten. There are song variations I've heard that I can't find on the Internet. \nOh, if you're curious what my grandmother sang, here is the recording I made: \nI can't guarantee that I will find dozens of gems to publish. But I know there are a few rare variations of songs and rhymes I've heard family and friends sing. I know they exist, and I want them to be remembered. I want to publish these traditional songs, rhymes, and their variations and make them freely available. \nIf this project gets funded, I plan to conduct field research, make field recordings, collect, transcribe and publish the results. Since Kickstarter is funded upfront, I will publish my collection to the public domain using a Creative Commons CC0 license. \nI'll be using the notation software Finale for engraving. The final project will be published as a PDF. Spiral-bound hard copies will also be made. \nAny funds above the project goal will go into making the project even better.

It's not possible to simply make people remember a song their grandmother used to sing to them. But I've also found that people are happy to share with others their cherished memories of nostalgic songs. Even if another rare song or variation doesn't surface in field research, I believe I already have enough rare material already to make this project worthwhile. I will publish both the rare and well-known traditional songs that make up part of the musical history of this area. \n\nThe easy part will be the transcription and data entry process.

To help save her friend and colleague, she had tried to kill the old man -- and she had delivered a gruesome blow, to no avail. Visions of the blow replay in her mind, but Corbitt's yellow gaze continues to mock. She can't bear to watch her own demise.\nBut Corbitt has no mercy, only hunger and malice -- and the enveloping aroma of her essential liquid. Her blood will make him strong. Savoring the moment, hoary Walter Corbitt stoops low to the shuddering Jenny -- then a sharp stab of ice-cold terror rips his shoulder. No, it cannot be! \nWith a roar of manic fury Harvey, who stitched together the shards of courage left to him, unsheathed the ancient ornate knife from his left hand and with the other drives the blade deep into old Corbitt. Those long years suddenly take their toll and Corbitt cries out for the last time, crumbling to the floor in disgusting chunks and pieces. \nHarvey kicks at the remains. \u201cBy his own weapon is the devil worsted!\u201d\nLATER\u2026\nLaying flowers at the foot of the hospital bed, Harvey takes a seat.

Lovecraft.\nBy Sandy Petersen with Mike Mason, Paul Fricker, and Lynn Willis.\nThe Great Old Ones ruled the earth aeons before the rise of humankind. Originally they came from the gulfs of space and were cast down by even greater beings. Remains of their cyclopean cities and forbidden knowledge can still be found on remote islands in the Pacific, buried amid the shifting sands of vast deserts, and in the frigid recesses of the polar extremes. Now they sleep -- some deep within the enveloping earth and others beneath the eternal sea, in the drowned city of R'lyeh, preserved in the waters by the spells of mighty Cthulhu. When the stars are right they will rise, and once again walk this Earth.\nCALL OF CTHULHU is Chaosium\u2019s classic roleplaying game of Lovecraftian horror, in which ordinary people are confronted by the terrifying and alien forces of the Cthulhu Mythos. CALL OF CTHULHU uses Chaosium\u2019s Basic Roleplaying System, easy to learn and quick to play. This bestseller has won dozens of game-industry awards, is a member of the Academy of Adventure Game Design Hall of Fame, and was voted the #1 Gothic/Horror RPG of all time by the GamingReport.com community. CALL OF CTHULHU is supported by a growing line of high quality supplements.\nThis Kickstarter project aims to build a new edition of this classic horror game and expand its award-winning tradition.\nTHE NEW EDITION\nAs currently envisioned, the CALL OF CTHULHU KEEPER'S RULEBOOK is a new edition of the CALL OF CTHULHU rules incorporating new options, an improved flow of combat, new scenarios, and a cleaner page layout with box and page decoration evocative of the primary period of play in the 1920s. Here are eighteen chapters including H.P. Lovecraft and the Mythos, Creating Investigators, Skills, Game System, Combat, Chases, Sanity, Magic, For Keepers, Tomes of Eldritch Lore (with over 100 tomes), Grimoire (with over 100 spells), Artifacts & Alien Devices, Monsters, Beasts & Alien Gods, three scenarios, plus a reference chapter containing Lovecraft Country, Historic Timelines, Mythos History of Earth, Sanity Quiz, Play Aids, and more. The \"Skills\" chapter contains full descriptions for each skill, including guidance on opposed skills, setting difficulty levels, examples of how to \"push\" the different types of skills, and suggested consequences for failing a pushed skill roll. The \"Chases\" chapter provides rules for all types of chases, whether on foot, driving a car or boat, flying airplanes, or being pursued by monsters.\nWe also wanted to address the players directly, and simultaneously we will also release the INVESTIGATOR HANDBOOK, intended for all players, which includes ten chapters expanding Creating Investigators with optional background packages, more than a hundred Occupations, Skills, Investigator Organizations (nine separate organizations described - The 'Wipers' Pals, Wrath's Circus of Wonders, Strange but True!, The South 13th, SKT Research, Novem Angelus, Ratched's Children, The Resurrectionists, The Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained), Life as an Investigator, The Roaring Twenties, Advice for Players, plus a references chapter. \"Life as an Investigator\" takes a look at investigative procedures and equipment, and also provides examples taken from the files of the Theron Marks Society.\nWhen Will It Come Out?\nWe want to have these books in your hands by Halloween (October 31) of 2013.\nThe rule book has been fully revised and carefully restructured to bring you the rules in the most user-friendly way. Call of Cthulhu is a well established game with a wealth of supporting scenarios, campaigns and source books. It's important to note that the 7th Edition rules remain backwards compatible so that previously published scenarios and source books all remain playable with the revised rules. We\u2019ve gone to great lengths to revise the rules in a way that retains the essence of what makes Call of Cthulhu such a great game.\nHere's an overview on some of the revisions that will be found in Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition...\nCreating your Investigator\nThere are lots of great options for creating investigators, along with advice on integrating your investigator with the story. It also provides you with support and tools for generating an investigator\u2019s backstory, enabling players to create fully rounded characters with a reason to investigate the Cthulhu Mythos.\nSkill rolls\nNot everything is so easy for the investigators -- if they attempt an especially difficult task the new rules introduce the \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018extreme\u2019 skill rolls. Revised skill descriptions and new skills like Intimidate and Charm have been added to provide investigators with more ways to investigate and uncover the secrets of the Mythos.\nOpposed rolls\nNo need to refer to charts -- everything you need is right there on the character sheet! \nPushing skill rolls\nSometimes your investigator fails a task. With the new rules, if you want to try a second time you can -- if you can justify it! But beware -- failing a second \u2018pushed\u2019 roll will have dire consequences -- opening the door for the Keeper to take the story in all sorts of new, exciting and sometimes unexpected directions.\nLots of Advice for Players and Keepers\nThe new rules have been written with a mind to helping all players get the most of Call of Cthulhu. Particularly, a special advice chapter for Keepers on how to construct a scenario, how to build tension and horror, and how to develop the story and engage your players. Whether you are new to the game or have been playing a while, there\u2019s information and tips for everyone .\nToolkit\nOver the decades many gaming groups have developed their own style of Call of Cthulhu play, and 7th Edition provides you with options, tools and advice on how to tailor the game in a way that will suit you and your group. Whether you like things more pulpy or gritty, there\u2019s optional rules to build and scale the game you want.\nMissed a clue? No worries!\nEver had your players get stuck because they don\u2019t know what to do next? The new rules provide a mechanism for handling such tricky situations; a revision of the Idea Roll rule. Now you can throw tricky investigations at your players and not have to worry if they pick up every clue or not. The new Idea Roll helps to keep your game on track without unnecessary railroading of the players.\nSanity\nThe sanity track remains, however the Keeper is provided with new guidance on how to deal with episodes of insanity, including phobias, manias and delusions. Plus the Keeper is provided with advice on how to tamper with the investigator\u2019s backstory -- potentially corrupting their relationships, their possessions and other important aspects of their life as they sink further and further in to the cosmic abyss of the Cthulhu Mythos.\nArt used in our Spanish-Licensee publication, now available for our use!\nCombat \nSometimes your investigator will have to rely on his or her fists! All unarmed attacks now come under the one skill of Brawl, allowing you to describe your attacks as befits the situation. Weapons and firearms retain their own skill categories. Combat now works with opposed rolls, allowing you to resolve combat scenes faster than ever before and avoid drawn-out \"miss - miss\" situations, whilst giving players more options on the things they can do during a fight. Fast paced and exciting combat!\nCombat maneuvers replace the old grapple rules. Now you just describe what you want to do and roll versus your opponent -- allowing greater freedom to create exciting fight scenes. Your investigator can do more during combat than just fight or flee!\nChases\nAn entirely new chase system that allows you to combine vehicles, monsters and pedestrians in exciting chase scenes. Remember the chase scene in Lovecraft's 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth' wherein the protagonist, Robert Olmstead, flees the Gilman House hotel via a window and is pursued across Innsmouth by deep ones? These new rules enable you to stage exciting chases like that in your game.\nMonsters\nYou\u2019ll find a host of old favourites here, along with a few new faces, as well as insightful marginalia providing details, notes and ideas on many of the monsters and gods therein.\nSpells and Tomes\n7th Edition provides revised rules for how to handle magic in your game and also revisits tome reading times, as well as providing advice and ideas on how to use tomes in your scenarios and games. If your investigator has never cast a spell before you may find you get more than you bargained for! Likewise, insane ancient Mythos wizards and monsters have access to deeper realms of magic and a range of spells have suggested effects for just this type of insane casting.\nNew scenarios\n\"The Haunting\" -- the old faithful scenario is back, with added, step by step Keeper\u2019s advice for new players. Plus two new scenarios: \"Amidst the Ancient Trees\" and \"Crimson Letters\", designed for both new and veteran Keepers. \"Crimson Letters\", set in witch-haunted Arkham, provides the ideal starting point for a campaign.\nAnything else? The entire rulebook has been revised, edited and will be presented in a brand new layout with loads of cool new artwork. \nCall of Cthulhu was originally written by Sandy Petersen. Paul Fricker and Michael Mason have written, revised, and developed the new edition, in addition to developing the book's structure and adding new content throughout.\nBadger McInnes will perform the primary layout for the 7th Edition books. He worked on the award-winning Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd edition and numerous books for Chaosium and other publishers.\nPaul Carrick, the artist who created the award-winning cover for the Chaosium publication Cthulhu by Gaslight, will be creating new art for Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition. Stefano Marinetti and Alberto Bontempi have created art for Call of Cthulhu and for this Kickstarter page, and will create more.\nSteff Worthington is already working away on maps, plans, and diagrams.\nThe Story So Far...\n(read from the bottom to the top)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we face as a publisher is making sure that deadlines are met.

Scott Taylor helps create the shadowed metropolis of Taux, where Razor Duelists and mailed and heavily armed Sturgeons try to hold back the tide of ghosts, Moon Cultists, and shadow magic that lurks inside the slithering coils of Wizard\u2019s Mist.  Rogues, harlots, and merchant princes share the same streets, and all watch their backs as the stones of the city call out to the living in a never ending game of cat and mouse for the true ownership of the great port. \nOn the final night of the Festival of a Thousand Blossoms, a foreign paladin has come to Taux.  Her investigation leads to the vigilante murder of a moon priestess recently released from the stone walls of the infamous Silk Purse brothel. Our intrepid characters, themselves all suspects, must protect their own hides while also shielding the real killer. It'll be a game of wits and magic, with justice on the sword's edge.\nMemories of Lankhmar, Sanctuary, and Waterdeep merge in each unfolding tale, and award winning fantasy artists Todd Lockwood, Jeff Laubenstein and Janet Aulisio bring form to each story with their incredible pen and ink renderings.  Lockwood also lends his artistic vision to another epic cover that wraps this project in a package so special it\u2019s almost too good to be true!\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it, just check out some unsolicited reviews for Tales of the Emerald Serpent, Volume I.\nKeith West of Adventure Fantastic writes: There's not a bad story in the lot, and some of them, such as \"Between\" by Todd Lockwood and \"Charlatan\" by Scott Taylor tell of the same events from completely different points of view.  The overall effect creates a book that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Along with reading some good fiction by old favorites, I've discovered some more writers whose work I'll be reading.\nLou Anders of Editor-In-Chief of Pyr Books writes: I'd highly recommend Tales of the Emerald Serpent. I like what it does and how it goes about it. It's a smart, good looking package with some real gems of fiction inside. I have no knowledge of a sequel in the works, but I'd certainly fund another Tales of the Emerald.\nAndy Goldman of Lithicbee writes: If you like dueling swordsmen (and -women), magic-filled action and adventure, love both true and enchanted, and stories that work on their own and as part of a shared whole, get thee hence and pick up a copy of Tales of the Emerald Serpent. What Scott and the involved writers have accomplished is not only a solid shared-world book, but stories and characters that call out for a sequel. Here\u2019s to a new era of shared worlds!\nIf you like fantasy, and you remember the days when books sang with slim stories of high adventure and burst with rich illustrations to lend solidity to every epic tale, then Tales of the Emerald Serpent Volume II, A Knight in the Silk Purse is what you\u2019ve been longing for. \n*Note: Everyone who contributes to the 'Golden Ticket' reward level or higher will receive a digital copy of Tales of the Emerald Serpent Volume One [upon request] along with any other digital products produced by this Kickstarter! \nLike Tales of the Emerald Serpent, we\u2019ve set our goal to bring you a single volume, A Knight in the Silk Purse, but over the course of the two years all our authors and artists have been working on Taux, we\u2019ve scripted an entire series, all culminating in a final conflict that will not only decide the fate of Taux, but also the entire Nameless Realms.To accomplish this dream, we\u2019ve built in stretch goals to ensure that our readers get to experience our epic tale in its entirety.\nAnd we are committed to make this the most spectacular fantasy fiction Kickstarter of all time, with more stretch goals added as this project moves forward. And remember the bulk of all these stretch goals are designed to give Golden Ticket and higher level backers access to them for free!

When you reserve your copy, we'll include the Deep Magic PDF as a thank-you for that extra push on this project!\nFollow the Book's Progress\nThe funding is done, but the work is ongoing to complete all those stretch goals and compile a final, beautiful volume for Pathfinder RPG. Follow us as @koboldpress on Twitter, Kobold Press on Facebook, or at the KoboldPress.com blog.\nH.P. Lovecraft invented the Necronomicon. Dungeons & Dragons had its Unearthed Arcana, and the Pathfinder RPG raised the bar with Ultimate Magic. No matter how you slice it, magic is at the heart of fantasy. Nothing says magic like a massive tome of spells. \nThat's exactly what we're compiling here. A tome of every awesome incantation, spell, cantrip, and glamer derived from seven years of Kobold Press publishing\u2014more than 500 new and compiled spells by the best in the business, including Paizo staffers and A-list freelancers. And we're adding a lot more to that list: variant magical systems, real scrolls for amazing props, and yes, even more new spells.\nThis project is not just for wizards and sorcerers. Deep Magic is going to expand the horizons of what's possible for wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and oracles with something new for every casting class, from adept to anti-paladin, and from bard to summoner!\nNew Magical Traditions for the Pathfinder RPG \nWith these new spells and options, your characters (or your villains) can become masters of clockwork magic, dragon magic, or shadow magic. Seek out hidden colleges and academies of lost lore. Learn new runes, glyphs, and incantations to crack open the walls of reality,or just bend them a bit.\nDeep Magic contains all magic from start to finish!\nWe asked D&D Next designer Bruce Cordell why magic is so important to fantasy RPGs. He told us this: \"I love new spell design because every single spell is a chance to break the rules of reality in a small but important way.\" \nDeep Magic is the ultimate sourcebook for new and variant magic in any fantasy setting, offering over 200 full-color pages (exact page count will depend on the level of pledges!). Those pages feature: \nAt least 12 new schools and styles of magic, including blood magic, clockwork magic, diabolism, dragon magic, geomancy, grudge magic, ink magic, labyrinth magic, ley line magic, star & shadow magic, saint's magic, and more\n12 magic colleges and academies, each home to a magical style or tradition\nMore than 500 new spells, including new ones for every spellcasting class in the Pathfinder RPG\nNew spellcasting archetypes and new mythic spells\nAnd much more!\n\nWhile Deep Magic starts by compiling almost every spell published by Kobold Press in the last few years (we might have missed one!), it also updates and expands these spells, to include mythic versions, to clarify language, and to update some of the earliest ones from D&D 3.5 to the Pathfinder RPG format. \nDeep Magic also includes all-new work such as spells designed by the finalists from the Lost Magic contest, a new system of incantations, and at least 15 new archetypes. It also includes new spells by well-known designers and a few spells written by backers\u2014fully reviewed, developed, and refined by Kobold Press, of course. (And yes, we reserve the right to throw any bad ones out!)\nHere's a sneak peek at the table of contents as it stands now. It has grown quite a bit from the start of the project, and is now a 2-page table instead of fitting on 1 page!\nRichard Baker, designer for 3rd Edition D&D and developer on Paizo's Emerald Spire for Pathfinder RPG, notes: \n\"Anyone who's ever played a wizard can tell you how important it is to choose the right spell. Big offensive spells are great, but I always felt that the real artistry in playing a wizard resided in choosing spells with multiple uses: offense, defense, and utility. \n\"For example, the wall of ice spell gives you an excellent defense by blocking off attackers, but you can also drop it on bad guys for decent damage\u2014and it makes a fine bridge or raft over water. Finding unexpected ways to use your spells is the best part of playing a wizard. Finding unexpected new spells is even better.\"\nHere's the spells and other items already added to the book (listed as the \"Spell Cast\" items)--the project grew by more than 50 stretch goals so far, each of them improving the final hardcover. See the \"Pledge Levels\" section after the goal scroll to see exactly what rewards went with each pledge level.\nThis is the final and complete listing of the reward for each pledge level.

QUOTES AND COMMENTS\nEd Greenwood notes: \"I love magic.  You can never have too much of it. Big books of it hum and glow and mutter sinister eldritch sagacity in tenebrous corners, keeping me warm on cold and foetid nights.\n   \"Magic is the spark of life, the smiter of evils that come slithering to my door, the fire in my hand against death and tax collectors, and the provider of handy peanut butter sandwiches when it\u2019s just too long and perilous a quest down to the kitchen.\n    \"I REALLY love magic.\"\nAdam Daigle, Paizo staffer and developer of the Midgard Bestiary says: \"You know what's awesome? Magic. You know what's awesomer? More magic. What spell caster doesn't want to stumble upon or learn about a huge tome of magic? What self-respecting spell caster doesn't want to find new and creative ways to shape reality to your whims? What's better is that this is coming from Kobold Press, so you know it's good.\"\nProject add-ons help you grab additional rewards from Kobold Press, catch up on the Midgard Campaign Setting, or brush up your design chops---and of course they help the project reach stretch goals.\nTo Add Items from the PDF Add-ons List\nClick on the green \"Manage my pledge\" button.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has shipped 30 crowdfunded titles since 2006, including about four small and large releases per year, and it has won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work. The creative team is experienced and we keep leveling up!\n\nFor Deep Magic, much of the spell design, development, and editing work is already done; we worked hard this past winter and spring. Right now, the majority of the book is ready to be laid out. Likewise, we already have cover and interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book. \n\nThe main challenges are in gathering, developing, and editing the additional spell and character text from backers, and in doing the same for any and all new design from stretch goals. Backers who pledge at those levels must deliver text promptly and it will be developed and edited fairly quickly. Theoretically, though, one backer could hold up the project. In practice, if a backer fails to deliver a character or spell for inclusion in a timely way, we'll move ahead on deadline rather than hold up the entire project.\n\nOh, and if our Kobold Press HQ is threatened by a rampaging bulette? We're counting on an armored horde of shieldmaidens to save us. Possibly with some saintly paladins and a pair-bonded couple of Nurian geomancers if it is an advanced bulette...\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #69", "update_userinfo": "Final Week for New Paths Compendium Expanded Edition", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Deep Magic of the Midgard Project", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "New Magic, New Races", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #66", "update_userinfo": "Escapist Nominates Deep Magic For Best RPG Supplement of 2014", "update_content": "We're incredibly pleased to share that Deep Magic is a nominee for The Escapist's Editor's Choice Award for Best RPG Supplement of 2014.

Do you feel... different? Is strange magic happening all around you? Are you suddenly mindspeaking with a sentient animal? In \"The Awakened\", this could be you.\nSixteen exciting stories pull you into the diverse and unusual world of Grimaton, where the twin moons above might mean a lifetime of change. Join our celebrated authors as they explore the world of The Awakened and spotlight the heroes, the villains, and the magic; where a random few may find themselves bonded to an animal companion for life, or might find they are the possessor of weird and powerful magic they could never have imagined. How these exceptional few are treated and how they learn to use those unasked-for powers... Well, that is the adventure we have started here.\nExperience the highs and lows of becoming an Awakened, decide if you would use your power for good or for evil, and grow with characters who will make you proud... or make you angry.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI created this world over ten years ago but never pursued it; now it is time. I love this setting, and the reason I do is not because it came from my mind, but because those fifteen other writers made it come alive and feel so real to me. The emotions I felt as I read through their stories were fantastic and I cannot wait to go back and read again as both a writer and a fan.\nTake a look at the tiers to the right and see how you would enjoy The Awakened best; as an eBook, paperback or hardcover; being part of the next book (which is already planned and includes exciting changes); talk one-on-one to a publisher and author; heck, I will fly to you with an armload of books from the Dark Quest library and we can hang out for a weekend!\nNext, take a look at the stretch goals and see what we can do with your support --we can bring you more short stories, add art to the print copies, and guarantee more books in the series-- so take a chance on us and we will not disappoint!\nThe stories are written, edited and in layout. Now what we need is you: we need you to help us keep these characters, this world, this dream, alive. By pledging and showing your support, we will have the supreme honor of being able to write for you again and again.\nYou can do that for me. With your pledges, you can let us go back to a world we love creating. If we reach the stretch goals we can revisit this world with you! Please be a part of the team and maybe, just maybe, you will be Awakened!\n-Hal Greenberg, The Awakened co-author and setting creator\nBecome one of \"The Awakened\" on Facebook!\nArtists:\nGreg Opalinski - Greg grew up in Poland, quickly realizing that he wanted to be a professional artist.

He was first published professionally in the ENnie Award-winning Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting from Paizo Publishing after placing in the Final Four of Paizo\u2019s inaugural RPG Superstar! competition in 2008.\nA member of the WereCabbages Creative Guild and the Monumental Works writer's group, he is a frequent freelance contributor to Rite Publishing, Sean K.

Since 2001, he has written, edited or contributed to over 25 books and games. In 2004, his book Torn Asunder: Critical Hits received a prestigious Gen Con ENnie Award while another, Dweomercraft: Familiars made honorable mention in the same category. When not writing, Steven spends his spare time with his beautiful wife, Kim, and his teenage children.\nTorah Cottrill - Skytouched has been losing herself in fantastic worlds since she first discovered the secrets of wardrobes. Now, she explores new worlds of her own. Torah is a reader, writer, and editor from Seattle. She is also member of the writers' cooperative Monumental Works Group.\nDarrin Drader - The Outcast has been an avid fan of the fantasy genre since reading The Hobbit somewhere around age ten. As a bored sixteen-year-old, while sitting in English class one day, he decided that he was going to be a writer when he grew up. Unlike other fanciful notions that had come and gone, this one stuck. Before graduating from high school, he wrote numerous stories. In college at Washington State University, he enrolled in several writing classes, and co-founded an extra-curricular writing group. After the university, he committed to chasing the dream and embarked upon a career in tabletop roleplaying game design. This led to employment with Wizards of the Coast and work on such Dungeons and Dragons products as the Book of Exalted Deeds, Forgotten Realms: Serpent Kingdoms, and D20 Apocalypse. He currently has over forty published works that range from roleplaying books, to articles, to fiction.\nDarrin's recent debut novel Echoes of Olympus is currently available on Amazon, and he has already begun work on its sequel, The Pearls of Atlantis.\nHal Greenberg - Awakened is a five-time ENnie nominated game designer who recently started a new company, Samurai Sheepdog, with his previous business partner Doug Herring. Hal has been a guest speaker at Necronomicon and GenCon and has been honored to work with many of today\u2019s leading writers and designers, including but not limited to: Monte Cook, Todd Lockwood, and Ed Greenwood. This year Hal will have Bluffside: City on the Edge for Castles and Crusades published by Troll Lord Games and a new children's book called Sam the Hanukkah Dragon on Kickstarter with renowned fantasy artist Jeff Easley . He also has a few other projects still in the developmental stage (read: secret) including boardgames and more fiction. You can find Hal on Facebook and Twitter.\nEd Greenwood - Girl and Her Scaly Bits is a Canadian writer, game designer, and librarian best known as the creator of the Forgotten Realms\u00ae fantasy setting.

Delacorte Press will publish her middle grade fantasy novel, The Mark of the Dragonfly, in 2014.\nRosemary Jones - Birdie writes.  She always has.  After growing up in a household with a writer, and being made a beta-reader from an early age, she graduated to writing articles, stories, and eventually whole books. These days, most of her writing is loaded with supernatural events, superheroes, steampunk ladies, dragons who don't look like dragons, and other oddities. Her books for Wizards of the Coast explore the dungeons and graveyards of the Forgotten Realms, and she's known in the D&D fiction community as \"the quirky one.\" She thinks the \"quirky\" may have something to do with topiary, wererats, small dogs, and the liberal use of skeletons in key scenes. When not writing, Rosemary cruises the shelves of Seattle's many bookshops, hangs out in different coffee emporiums, or sits in darkened theaters. One of her earliest memories is listening to a recording of Mary Poppins and being spooked by the \"Feed The Birds\" song.\nTy Johnston - Assassins of Opportunity was born and raised in central Kentucky. After 20 years as a newspaper journalist, he returned to his first true love, writing fiction about swords, sorcery and things that go bump in the night. He lives in the South with his wife, their beagle and a house rabbit.\nKevin Kulp - Elephants and Rain is a Boston-based writer, game designer, and a storyteller who develops both video and pen and paper games.  He helps run the independent RPG site ENworld.org, and his recent work includes Disruptor Beam's Game of Thrones Ascent for Facebook, and the upcoming fantasy western game Owl Hoot Trail from Pelgrane Press.\nColin McComb - The Hunted has been a professional writer of one sort or another since 1991, though his primary venue has always been games. He first started writing for TSR Inc on that company's various Advanced Dungeons & Dragons titles, with such credits as the award-winning Dragon Mountain, the Birthright Campaign Setting, and as a developer for the Planescape Campaign Setting. He later moved to California to work on computer games for Black Isle Studios, where he wrote for Fallout 2 and Planescape: Torment. Most recently, he has self-published his series, Oathbreaker, and for the next two years will be serving as the Creative Lead for Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nDarren W Pearce - Rook's Gambit was born in 1969 and was very quickly immersed in fantasy and science fiction by his parents. He lives in the United Kingdom with his wife Gillian Pearce and their 5 cats. Darren has worked professionally in the Roleplaying Game Industry since 2000 and has done work for an online video game review/news website Games Xtreme since 2001. Darren has worked on Knights of Honor, Breed and the game Savage.\nDarren has worked on such properties as Lone Wolf with Joe Dever, Doctor Who Adventures in Time and Space through Cubicle 7 and numerous Mongoose Publishing products recently via the Legend RPG system. Darren is also an Award Winning anthology author having been involved in the 2011 Epic E-Book award winning Bad-A$$ Faeries 3 anthology for Best Anthology.\nDarren has also written short stories galore and has numerous works published both in print and e-book formats, as well as a novel (in editing) and a novella (also in editing).\nDarren writes regularly for The Chronicles of Wyrden webcomic with his wife Gillian (Illustrator) and has numerous other works in the pipleline for 2013.\nYou can find Darren's work with Neal Levin in such anthologies as: Vampire Dreamspell, Cats In a Dreamspell, New Blood, Barbarians At The Jumpgate, Mind or Metal Fantasy Anthology, Zombonauts, Dream's & Screams, Bloody Carnival, Bad-A$$ Faeries 3, In An Iron Cage: The Magic of Steampunk (and many more).\nDarren has a lot more RPG projects coming and is the lead writer on the 13th Age compatible Nightfall product, which aims to bring a sense of Gothic Horror to the new RPG system and is a proud member of the Monumental Works Group.\nRichard Redman - Fire was born in Florida. He grew up along the East Coast, and attended the University of Virginia. He led a platoon of tanks in the First Gulf War and spent over ten years working for Wizards of the Coast.\nNow an eccentric recluse, Mr. Redman publishes digitally because it\u2019s easier from his mountaintop fortress in Tibet. He claims to have a harem of first readers, and an army of bloodthirsty, opium-addicted, yetis who keep the children off his lawn. He subsists on a diet of mercury, sulfur, arsenic salts, and cheese.\nAllegations that he is a master of Sinanju and a leader of the World Crime League remain unproven. No records can be found for his patents of the interocitor, the Mr. Fusion home reactor, the flux capacitor, or the oscillation overthruster.\nMr. Redman is a multiple winner of National Novel Writing Month. He has written for dungeonaday.com, Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game, Pathfinder, Star Wars, Dark*Matter, and d20 Modern.  He also writes fiction.\nRai Smith - Litha Mabon works by day in the fast paced corporate world, but when night falls the typing and magick begins! A writer from a very young age Rai liked to provoke thought and spark controversy with her speeches and articles (much to her teacher\u2019s dismay). Several years and a family later, she has turned that passion inward to fantasy fiction. Her writing has found its publishing debut with Dark Quest Books as a contributing author for The Awakened.  She currently makes her home in central Florida with her ever encouraging husband, a wee one who is most certainly of Fae decent and three very demanding cats.\nDark Quest Books\nDark Quest, LLC was originally formed to promote the explorations of medieval reenactment through silversmithing, leatherworking, and various other crafts. In 2001, the corporation spawned off a new division responsible for game development. Since the majority of the staff previously involved with the company were long time gamers, this was an obvious evolution in the grand scheme of things. Little did the designers know that this gaming hobby would expand into such a growing business. The balance kept shifting over the years; the more staff we add the more we found an imbalance. In 2008, Dark Quest Books was brought into existence to handle fiction products spawned from our roleplaying game settings. There is some overlap between Dark Quest Games staff and Dark Quest Books, but for the most part they operate separately.\n\nInstant library backers go here to look at all the books available from the publisher: Dark Quest Books\n\nPraise for 'The Awakened':\nIf you hunt around, you can still find something fresh in the worlds of magic \u2014 something different \u2014 and the stories in The Awakened can prove it.\n-Matt Forbeck (Deadlands, Guild Wars and Eberron novelist)\nThe Awakened anthology is a fantastic romp brought to you by writers both new and those you already know.

It is available on Android and iOS.  It allows you to watch the notes light up as the music is played on the sheet music image or an instrument.  This project is still a baby.  It only tries to detect notes and rhythm.  It is regularly 95% accurate, but sometimes it is 100% accurate.   It is also inaccurate with certain types of sheet music.\nProject Goals\nHere is what I will accomplish with funding from KickStarter backers:\nImprove note and rhythm detection to be reliably 95%+ accurate.\nDetect clef and time signatures.\nDetect rests.\nDetect musical ties, staccato and triplets.\nEliminate false positive note detections.\nAccurately play back one full line of sheet music per snap.\nAllow treble line and bass line to be played simultaneously.\nI have already overcome several challenges related to parsing photographs and I will overcome many new challenges ahead.\nI am asking folks to help fund 200+ hours of research, development and testing.  I also need funding to purchase several iOS/Android smart devices and lots of sheet music for testing.\n\nBenefits\nThis project has the potential to help students learn music.  It will also help advance OCR technology by creating a new market for others to pursue.  Imagine, one day people will be able to look at a piece of music with their glasses, blink a couple times and hear the play back while watching the notes light up.  I might not make that happen, but somebody will.  And this is the project that started such an advancement on the mobile device platform.\nAvailability\nThis app will continue to be available on Android and iOS platforms.  As I meet new milestones, I will release updated versions.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOCR from photographs is a challenge. Photographs are less predictable due to lighting, strange angles, page curls, auto-focus, and other factors. I have already overcome some of these challenges. I am looking forward to overcoming the next set of challenges.\n\nAndroid devices are very numerous. It is a challenge to interact with hardware components, such as the camera, to ensure things work correctly. These challenges are easier to overcome if I possess the hardware to test.\n\nSheet music glyphs are not always consistent in various publications. For instance, the low resolution images on the internet are very different than sheet music printed in a hymnal from an OCR perspective. I will strive to be able to support a variety of styles of sheet music representation. Realistically, this app will likely not be able to work well from low resolution photographs from a computer screens, low resolution paper copies of sheet music, shape notes and hand written notation. It will be optimized for high quality sheet music such as that found in most music books, professional PDF's and hymnals.\n\nI have been solving problems and writing code for 17 years. I love this project. I'm a fiddler and a singer (a much better fiddler than singer). This project marks the intersection of my vocation and hobby. No matter what happens, I'm going to make it work.

I want as many miniatures as I can lay my hands on!\nOne of our fantastic backers has created a \"pledge calculator\" so you can see what you get and for how much! Click on the lnk below to see what each pledge level can receive!\nhttp://centerstageminis.com/TOH\nThe $100 and $200 levels have the potential to grow IMMENSELY as our backer pool increases. The more pledges, the more miniatures unlocked, and the more freebies added ad different levels!\nWho is doing the sculpting? And why aren't all the greens ready NOW?\nWe've already made contact with our regular sculptors Tim Prow, Mark Evans, Jason Wiebe, Nicholas Genovese and Patrick Keith. We've also contracted with two sculptors who are new to CSM -  Gary Morley, a former Games Workshop sculptor, and Drew Williams. We're excited about acquiring some new talent on that front! Now that we've acquired our initial funding goal, they are hard at work - We'll continue to show their talents as time goes on, but these are the miniatures completed so far, so you can see how exciting the rest of this project will be!\nPretty cool so far! Tell me about the rest of the project. What are the rewards levels, stretch goals, and more?\nAt the $87.4K funding level, we add 2 more LARGE miniatures - a Gorgimera and a Furnace Golem to all pledge rewards packages of $200+. They will be available as swaps for the $25/$50$75 packages, and swaps OR $5 add-ons at the $100 level.\nAt the $95.5K funding level, we add 2 more LARGE miniatures - a Shedu and the Archdevil Lucifer, as well as the (M) sized Chalkydri to all pledge rewards packages of $200+. They will be available as swaps for the $25/$50$75 packages, and swaps OR $5 add-ons at the $100 level.\n\nI'm very confident that this Kickstarter is FULL of value, and anything past this reward level is pushing the capacity of a growing company to fulfill in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, with the acquisition of the actual Tome of Horrors terrain piece miniature, we conclude our offering of stretch goals and rewards. We don't want to overpromise, and at this point, we're confident fullfillment of everything will happen within the allotted time and right on schedule.\nThis Kickstarter is just the beginning, however - Center Stage Miniatures has signed a five-year contract with Frog God Games to produce miniatures from this hulking volume.

We started with only a few releases our first year, but have built up momentum and now have over 250+ products ready to be integrated into our online store this Spring and Summer. With the acquisition of some major  miniature ranges, most notably the Julie Guthrie Fantasy Personalities (from Grenadier Models/Mega Miniatues) and Dungeon Crawl Classics Miniatures (from Goodman Games), we're poised to support your need for high-quality fantasy miniatures for years to come!\nWe will begin setting up our own in-house metal casting operations, as well, in 2014, thanks to several dedicated investors and our continuing growth.\nCSM has already completed two very successful Kickstarter projects - our Demons and Devils Kickstarter ($65K+) and Torn World RPG Miniatures Kickstarter ($4K+). Torn World is in mail-order fulfillment as you read this (a month earlier than projected!), and our Demon/Devils Kickstarter reward surveys just went out, and casting is keeping our affiliates at Valiant Enterprises busy all month long.\n\nAnd a big \"Thank You...\"\n...goes out to \"Skeeter\" Green, Chuck Wright, and Rachel Ventura of Frog God Games, for being as excited about this project as I am and helping get this Kickstarter set up. Your enthusiasm is motivational! To Skeeter, specifically for helping set up the later pledge rewards and making errata changes and being my biggest cheerleader, to Chuck for his T-shirt design, and to Rachel for appearing in our promotional video (and for not letting me scare our backers away by being in the video myself!)\nAnd thanks also to Bill Webb for allowing us to move forward with the Frog God licensed ranges; and to Matt Finch, a good friend, class act and fellow businessman who believes in second chances.\n...and finally, but NEVER least, our backers, without whom this project never could have happened. \"Thank you,\" from the bottom of our hearts!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe two biggest challenges facing any miniatures producer are waiting for sculpts to be completed and then the production time required to fulfill all of the castings required in a Kickstarter project.\n\nBut as you know, crowdfunding has become increasingly popular and is now a means used by many different miniature manufacturers to fund their projects. \n\nOur current contract casting company, Valiant Enterprises, has never let us down on the timely shipment of an order and their quality has been impeccable. They assure me that their facility has never been truly tested to \"capacity,\" meaning that they have yet to encounter a job that throws them off schedule! \n\nAs you can see from our \"About Us,\" our Demons and Devils Kickstarter is shipping a few months behind schedule. That - as I explain in this section - is due to latecoming sculpts (many miniatures were commissioned after the KS funded! Imagine one sculptor cranking out the bulk of an entire range in six months - he's still lightning fast!) \n\nSometimes a company has no control over \"3rd party\" delays should they occur, but that has not been our experience to date. \n\nOther than that, both Frog God (our licensor) and CSM have excellent track records of customer communication.

Through Elmore's vivid visual renditions of unique personalities, clashing nations, fantastical creatures, and enchanting landscapes along with a saga weaved by Weis & Hickman, the culmination chronicled the struggle of mortals' attempt to master the unfathomable power of the Sovereign Stone given them from the gods--an artifact forged for peace among races but ignited war between brothers.\nSovereign Stone and the continent of Loerem originated as the brainchild of the award-winning, iconic fantasy artist, Larry Elmore. Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman (of Dragonlance fame) recounted its gripping conflict in a best-selling novel trilogy from HarperCollins, while a collection of sourcebooks further refined and detailed the setting.\nBeyond the arc that took us from the explosive destruction of Old Vinnengael to the final showdown with Dagnarus, the Prince of Void, Mr. Elmore still had plenty more stories to tell: about the dragon-hunting bahks, the wandering monks who record history as tattoos on their bodies, the magical Portals, the aftermath of the Vrykyl War... everything!\nWith your help, we can both introduce an amazing world to those who have yet to experience its rich past, and discover the future of Sovereign Stone together.\nTimeout Diversions intends to achieve the former by marrying the property to the Pathfinder\u00ae game system under Paizo Publishing's Pathfinder\u00ae Compatibility License. As the most popular RPG worldwide, Pathfinder\u00ae boasts legions of players for us to acquaint them with all that is unique about Loerem and Sovereign Stone, from distinctive races such as seafaring orks, nomadic dwarves, feudal Japan-like elves, pint-sized pecwae and their human barbarian Trevinici protectors, to a whole new interpretation of magic and spellcasting specific to the setting, yet with familiar Pathfinder\u00ae mechanics. Additionally, we plan to present innovative options, including modified and expanded mechanics for Hero Points that reward personal accomplishments and cooperative roleplaying. Your pledge will enable us to not only revive Sovereign Stone, but create new enthusiasts for the setting.\nYou also have everything to do with the latter. Given your help, we can continue to explore Loerem with new, engaging storylines from Mr. Elmore, whose storytelling has regaled friends and fans at conventions throughout the world. What will become of the Sovereign Stone and those destined to inherit its power (who could very well by YOUR character in a campaign)? What new forces will rise, and what alliances will perish? What mysteries and wonders await daring adventurers in the uncharted land opposite Loerem? Your pledge will open the door to infinite intrigues.\nNow, Timeout Diversions humbly seeks your help in returning the heroic adventures and breathtaking backdrop of Sovereign Stone to gaming, in an iteration re-envisioned by the creators and redesigned for the most popular RPG system in the world -- Pathfinder\u00ae Roleplaying Game. (Note: You need the Pathfinder\u00ae Core Rulebook to play this edition of Sovereign Stone RPG.)\nWHO ARE WE?\nTimeout Diversions is responsible for Wild World Wrestling, the undisputed champ of all pro-wrestling RPGs (which features a nifty maneuver system to make your own moves on the fly!), and Killer Thriller, a game designed to simulate slasher movies to the last drop of blood. The outfit is led by Tony Lee, who has been designing, developing, editing, and contributing to game-related stuff for over 15 years.

Snags are always a possibility and often an occurrence at every stage of production.\n\nFrom design standpoint, conversion to the Pathfinder\u00ae system presents the issue of game rules vs. setting flavor. Striking the perfect balance may require additional brainstorming and playtesting. The numerous supplements previously published for Sovereign Stone will all require conversion, thus possibly lengthening production time. Fortunately, our creative staff is comprised of experienced designers and developers to minimize such delays should they surface.\n\nComputer and equipment malfunctions can slow down graphic design, layout, and typesetting. While we plan to use digital short-run printing technology (or print-on-demand), the printer may run into difficulties such as supply or labor shortage, scheduling conflicts, etc. that are beyond our control. But like our creative team, the seasoned production pros we have are able to mitigate problems as well as explore alternatives to put the project back on track.\n\nPackages can be lost in shipping or take longer than expected to deliver.

See update #49 for more info.      [COUNTDOWN]\nA lot has changed since we first launched Dungeon Dice.  Many of the changes are based on feedback from backers.  In fact, I believe we've addressed every concern brought up so far.\nThe dice are now injection molded, which means the images will be recessed, not printed on.  The price has been reduced significantly and our minimum goal has been lowered, which we've been able to accomplish by starting as a 3-player game.  However, we have already unlocked the 4-player stretch goal!  Each game will now have enough dice for four players, with the option to buy a booster pack for five-player games.  We're including extra dice that backers earned in the first project.  Stretch goals are now available to everyone who buys the main game.  We're disclosing all information on costs, because we want you to trust us.  We are not a big company, and we are grateful for the opportunity Kickstarter offers to help us realize a small dream.\nWe look forward to your feedback.\nYou love dice.  This game has dice.  All sorts, really.  Weapon dice, potion dice, and monster dice.  We've even got some secret magical artifact dice.  They're locked up tight though.  You'll need some key dice to get your mitts on them.\nThe good news?  Keys are not particularly well-guarded.\nThe bad news?  Your friends are well-armed and grabbing up every treasure they see.\nStill don't get it?  Close your eyes and picture reaching into a dice bag to pull out a random treasure.  If this does not interest you, you are excused.  I hear that Kickstarter has some wonderful card games that might be up your alley.\nTo all else, welcome to happiness.\nThe king of Elorim has been killed.  No surprise, really.  The kingdom is overrun by monsters.  Fortunately for you, this means there is a vacant throne. \nThe previous king was eaten, and the king before him was burnt to a crisp.  The people have unanimously decided that the next king must know how to hold a sword.\nThis is where you come in.  You may be a bit green, but you did stab a slime once that was creeping into your kitchen.  You might have a chance to prove yourself.\nUnfortunately, every half-wit, braggart, and two-bit warrior in the kingdom has the same idea.  If you are to prove yourself in battle, you will have to do it before anyone else or *cough cough* die trying.\nWe've chosen Kickstarter for a few reasons.  First, producing custom dice is expensive.  And we have over 90 dice per game!  For such a small company, this is simply not possible without a little Kickstart.\nDue to some confusion on the prices, I've tried to reword this section for clarity.  Starting at our base goal of $16,000 we will only need an additional $10,000 to make the game (which we can comfortably manage).  However, due to increased costs as we gain backers, reach stretch goals, and cover your shipping costs (this is substantial) we will not begin to make PROFIT until we reach $60,000.  Roughly.\nWe are not worried about this, because the game will sell.  Our first priority is to support our backers.  If anything, we may do that a little too well.\nIf we get enough funding, we will include even more dice.  The more money we get, the more quality we can pump into this game.  That's right.  The more people who pledge to this project, the more stuff YOU get.  No catch.\nSo tell your friends.  Kickstarter is a wonderful forum to get the word out to as many people as possible.  \nLastly, we have seen the audience and enthusiasm for classic dungeon games on Kickstarter.  Happily, this is our passion, and we are eager to spread the love!\nYou get the following stuff:\n[This section has been updated with every stretch goal met]\n1 LARGE STORAGE BAG\n1 Black Monster Dice Bag\n1 Green Basic Dice Bag\n1 Blue Treasure Dice Bag\n1 Red Potion Dice Bag\n1 Yellow Artifact Dice Bag\n22 Monster Dice (1xZombie, 1xSlime, 1x Monstrous Crab, 1xAsp, 1x Bat, 1xGiant Spider, 1xWolf, 1x Goblin, 1xSkeleton, 1xGhost, 1xGolem, 1xFire Elemental, 1xWitch, 1xDemon, 1xDragon, 1xUnguarded Treasure, 1xCockatrice, 1xHarpy, 1xNecromancer, 1xDark Knight, 1xVampire, 1xTrap)\n12 Hero Level Dice\n5 Monster Level Dice\n6 Spell Dice (Gust, Drain, Fire, Heal, Pain, Toad)\n22 Equipment Dice (3 unique swords, 3 unique spears, 3 unique whips, 2 hammers, 2 axes, 2 unique bows, 6 armor, 1 skeleton key)\n8 Artifact Dice (Drain Whip, Fire Sword, Healing Mail, Great Hammer, Great Axe, Wind Spear, Elven Bow, Magic Armor)\n16 One-Use Dice (3 keys, 3 healing potions, 3 strength potions, 3 curses, 2 bombs, 2 scrolls)\n3 Legendary Dice!

However, our intention is to add additional dice to the game as we reach higher levels of funding.  Check out our stretch goals for more information.\nHere's a couple images for the limited number of customers who will receive luxury dice bags.  Close your mouth so you don't get drool on the keyboard.\nThe bags will be distinguished by color-coded beads.

Plenty of room to dig your fingers into.\nThe following upgrades may be tagged on to any existing game.  Simply increase your pledge by the indicated amount and list your ADD-ONS in the final survey. \nUpgrade you bags to velvet bags with satin interior in Dungeon Dice colors.

The cost represents upgrading existing bags.\nADD $8 TO ANY EXISTING GAME ORDER.  If you have purchased multiple games, you may purchase multiple upgrades.\nUpgrade your game to include 6 additional Monster dice, including the unique Thief, 3 Hero Level dice, 5 Equipment dice, 2 Artifacts, 4 One-Use dice, and 1 Experience Tracker.

International backers, please add $4.\nOrder some game mats to help organize your dice.  These mats are 1/16\" rubber with a polyester top.

They also have a chance of running away.\nADD $12 TO ANY ORDER.  No international fee.\nAdd six NEW dice to your one-use bag. We're throwing in a key to maintain game balance. This pack includes the boomerang, toad potion, poison potion, luck potion, sleep potion, and invisibility potion.\nADD $15 TO ANY ORDER.  No international fee.\nADD $2 EACH TO ANY ORDER.  No international fee.\nTo begin playing, each player grabs one Hero Level die.\nNext, each player randomly grabs two pieces of equipment from the treasure bag.  Here's an example of five possible items: an axe, a whip, a hammer, a spear, and armor.  Each symbol has it's own effect in the game.  For example, the whip \"tangles\" the enemy and their lowest die is removed from play.  All of the individual effects are explained below in the FAQ section.\nPlayer 1 randomly pulls one die from the monster bag and rolls.  Here we have the zombie die.  You may fight a level one zombie, a level two zombie, or a level three zombie.  The level three zombie has the \"drain\" icon, which means it takes your lowest die and adds it to its own total.\nLet's say you roll a level two zombie.  Since it is level two, you will roll two Monster Level Dice...\nYou roll all of your dice and compare to the monster's total.  Whoever's total is higher wins. \nIf you win, you gain the potion pictured on one side of the die.  Go ahead and reach into the potion bag and grab a random die.  The potion bag contains one-use items, such as healing potions, strength potions, scrolls, bombs, and keys. \nEach monster has different abilities and different rewards.  The rewards are potions, treasures, and locked chests, which contain artifacts.  If you happen to find a locked chest AND you have a key, happiness ensues.\nSince you want to see more monsters, we'll include a few more for you.  Here we have the Asp, Giant Spider, Golem, and Witch.  Notice that the level two Witch may cast one spell, while the level four Witch may cast two.  The basic set has three spell dice to choose from.\nFor a more detailed explanation of the rules, see the FAQ below.\nThanks to backers, the monster set is now complete.  We have added enough dice for four players and now we're focusing on adding variety to spells, equipment, and artifacts.\nDue to the stretch goals we've reached, the game currently includes 17 unique monster dice!  Here they are:\nIn the initial set we have the Bat, Slime, Zombie, Asp, Giant Spider, Wolf, Goblin, Skeleton, Ghost, Golem, Fire Elemental, Witch, Demon, Dragon, Cockatrice, Harpy and an Unguarded Treasure die. \nIn addition, we introduce the following stretch goals.\nCongratulations! We will now add the Asp to each game.  The Asp is a level 1-3 monster with the ability to tangle your lowest die, removing it from the game.\nAt $20,000 we will add the Goblin to each game.  The Goblin is a level 1-3 monster with the ability to reroll one die.  The Goblin is the weakest creature in possession of treasure.\nAt $22,000 we will add the Wolf to each game.  The Wolf is a level 2-4 monster with no abilities.  The Wolf is the highest level creature in possession of a potion.\nAt $24,000 we will add the Slime to each game.  The Slime is a level 1-3 monster. Slimes are edible, and defeating a slime heals one wound. \nAt $26,000 we will add the Ghost to each game.  The Ghost is a level 2-4 monster. A player who defeats a ghost takes one wound for the ordeal.\nAt $28,000 we will add the Spider to each game.  The Spider is a level 1-2 monster. However, with the ability to tangle your lowest die and then drain the next highest, it proves to be more difficult than it looks.\nAt $30,000 we will add the Fire Elemental to each game.  The Fire Elemental is a level 2-4 monster with the ability to add a flame spell to its combat roll.\nAt $32,000 we will add the Dragon to each game.  The Dragon is a level 3-5 monster and the only creature to offer up to 3 Fame points.  The Dragon adds a flame spell to its combat roll, and may force a reroll of the entire combat when losing. \nEnough dice will be included for four players.  This includes 3 additional Hero Level dice, 3 additional equipment dice, 2 extra one-use dice, and 1 extra experience tracker.  These dice have already been added to the total.\nWhat do the all the different symbols mean?\nBelow is a brief explanation of each symbol.  For in-depth explanations, please see the symbols section in the complete rules here.\nWhat are the different monsters?\nHave you planned any more dice than are pictured here?\nCurrently, we have planned three expansions to the game.  Official playtesting has not yet been scheduled for any of the expansions.  We are offering rewards for those of you interested in taking part.\nEPIC BOSSES - These extremely powerful monsters will come on jumbo dice.  All players have a chance to gang up and attempt to kill them.  The expansion will include a few new symbols and equipment using those symbols.\nDUNGEONS - The dungeon expansion introduces static dice with global effects.  The set includes specific locations, weather effects, traps, and secret passages.  We'll even throw a Mimic into the treasure bag.  It makes grabbing treasure a little scarier.\nCLASSES AND RACES - This expansion introduces dice representing classic classes and races.  A few of these dice have been play-tested with the original set.  For example, the thief die has a chance to pick locks and may even find additional treasure after a fight.\nWhere's my free download?\nFor those of you who want to play cheaply, we offer a print-at-home version of the game here.  This file is intended to be printed on a large sticker label (the sort used for shipping), and then cut and applied to blank 16mm dice.  As a two-man project, assembly may take a couple hours.\nThis version is designed for 2-Players.  We've throwing in the monsters from stretch goals because we can.  Enjoy.\nNot interested?  That's fine.  We've included the option because we believe that many of you will appreciate it. \nBelow are two shots of the printable version applied to blank dice.\nTo save you time, we're also including a card version of the game, which is easier to print.  The rules are the same, except you roll a standard die to determine the effect of each card.\nYou can download it here.  Below is a picture of the card version.\nCould you explain the rules in more detail?\nYou can view the official rules here.  Or you may read the summary below.\nPlayers are in a race to gain Fame and claim the throne.  The first player to obtain 4 Fame wins the game.  Fame is earned by defeating high level monsters and by obtaining magical artifacts.  Artifacts award one Fame point.  Red monsters award 1 Fame point.  Black monsters award 2 Fame points.  The Gold Dragon awards 3 Fame points.\nPre-game, each player grabs one Level die and two random Treasure dice.  Players may only equip two arms worth of weapons and one piece of armor.  Other dice may be used without restriction.  Dice from the potion bag may only be rolled once, and are then returned to the bag.  This includes potions, curses on other players, and keys, among other things.\nPlayers take turns grabbing a random monster from the monster bag.  That player has 'found' a monster and he may choose whether or not to confront it.  Before he decides, he may invite one other player to join him in the fight. \nEach monster icon also depicts a number.  This is the monster's level.  Once combat begins, roll a number of Monster Level dice equal to the monster's total.  This represents the monster's total strength. \nOnce the active player enters combat, there is no escape.  Either the hero rolls higher than the monster and gets items and experience, or rolls lower than the monster and takes a wound.  Helpers automatically get experience, and may also receive items in exchange for their service.\nAll players in a combat roll their dice and compare to the monster's total.  Secondly, all abilities are played.  In general, armor is played first, and then the active player decides the order of remaining abilities.  If the monsters are required to make a decision, the first player to the active player's left (who is not in combat) makes decisions for the monster.  For example, the active player could not choose to have a monster reroll a combat that it is already winning. \nMonster abilities affect only the active player, not their helpers in combat.   For example, if two players defeat a slime together, only the active player recovers a wound.\nDice may be traded at any time.  However, equipment may not be changed during combat.  When two heroes feel they have equal claim on a treasure, they may roll off.  For example, Player 1 finds a locked treasure and Player 2 has a key.  They may agree to roll a die with equal chances.  On the other hand, Player 2 might only agree to help if he has a 2 in 3 chance of receiving the treasure.  If Player 1 agrees, they roll a die and agree who wins on each number (1-3, 1-4, etc.).  Roll-offs play a key roll in bartering.\nWhen a player reaches 3 experience, he gains a second Level die.  At six experience, he may gain a third Level die and gain 1 Fame.  When a character loses a fight and takes a wound, he temporarily loses 1 Level die.  This may be replaced by consuming a healing potion, or by resting.  If a player chooses to rest, he may skip his turn in order to regain one lost Level die.\nIf a monster awarding Fame is slain, the active player keeps that die as a trophy.  Like all other dice, these trophies may be traded and bartered for any reason.\nPlease feel free to contact us with questions or clarifications, and we will update the FAQ.\nHow many people can play?\nThe game is for 2-4 players.  Currently, you may upgrade your game to include enough dice for five players (see Add-Ons).\nHow long does a game last?\nGames usually last about twenty minutes.  A long game could make it up to forty.  If you find that your games last longer than you want, you may simply decide to play for fewer Fame points, and the games will be shorter.\nWhat size and quality will the dice be?\nThe dice will be injection molded at multiple sizes.  They will look nice.  The monster dice are 18mm, the one-use dice are 14mm, and the rest are 16mm.  This allows for easy sorting, and reference. \nThe Epic Dice in a future expansion will be 22mm, with an 18mm \"randomizer\" die that goes in the monster bag.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are coordinating between multiple companies to produce all of the parts for Dungeon Dice.

A few short months later we had a bassist, a drummer, a steel guitarist, and a name. A few short months after that, we were playing our first gig at Chicago's Abbey Pub.\nThe band is formed. The songs are written. The album... that's where you come in.\nTHE MUSIC\nOur goal has always been to write songs that devotees of the Doctor will enjoy, of course, but to also make those songs interesting and enjoyable to folks who've never seen an episode. Above, you can watch us in the studio recording our very first song, 'Little Amelia'.\nTHE GuiTARDIS\nThe TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space), a deceptively-small-on-the-outside time-and-space-machine disguised as a blue police box, is the most iconic image in Doctor Who.

For the task of building it, we could trust none other than our own Chris Rice.\nWe've had loads of people ask about the guitar, and TWO of our Kickstarter supporters now have the chance to own one of these unique instruments! Check the rewards sidebar for more information.\nOTHER REWARDS\nIn addition to the GuiTARDIS, we've got plenty of the standard rewards associated with musical Kickstarters, including copies of the album (digital and physical), a set of 1-inch buttons, and a t-shirt that will ONLY be available to Kickstarter backers!

Not the jackpot, \"just\" a thousand bucks, and being a typical middle-class middle-manager a thousand dollars is nice, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't going to change my life.  So I decided to do something special with the money.  I decided I wanted to spend it to bring something that would last;  I would spend it to try and bring Jack Chick's epic 1984 graphic novel / tract to film.\nI wrote Chick Publications explaining this to them and I'm super-excited to announce that I have obtained the video rights to make a movie based on Dark Dungeons.\nDark Dungeons: The Movie\nIf you're not familiar with Dark Dungeons you can read it in its entirety here;\nDARK DUNGEONS:  THE COMIC\nBut all you really need to know is that it sets out to show what Jack Chick knows to be the truth behind role-playing.  It shows that;\n*Playing RPGs can make you gain real life magic abilities\n*If you gain a high enough level you will be invited to join a secret cult\n* Gamers whose characters die are in danger of committing suicide. \n* That DM's are vile temptresses that are out to corrupt their players to the forces of evil. \nGiven all those startling claims it's amazing that the crusade against RPG's has not been more successful!  In fact, the last movie to crusade against D&D was Tom Hank's 1982 classic, \"Mazes and Monsters.\"\nWe are going change all that. I'm already investing all of my lottery winnings in this project but it's just not enough to get it filmed and that's where you come in. \nIf the idea of seeing a movie where all the anti-RPG arguments above are made with every last drop of drama and conviction I can wring out them appeals to you, then I want you to invest today and make this movie a reality. \nPlease check out the video above to see what we are capable of and remember that you are only charged if we meet our funding goal.  If the project does not receive it's complete funding you are charged ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! \nNEW REWARD:  Backers of every level will receive their name on the movie credits if they wish.  Size of that name depends upon level of backage.\n______________________________________________________\nUPDATE: I am thrilled to announce a partnership myself and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment (makers of The Gamers and Journey Quest)!!!\nOur mission is to combine our powers to develop, produce, and distribute Dark Dungeons: The Movie!\nZombie Orpheus will be working through multiple versions of the script until we get the story that we know needs to be told and will be providing directing, filming, and acting talent as well!\nJust think what ZOE can do with the Dark Dungeons story!\nPlease spread the word about this partnership, as I know that together with ZOE we can all make the movie that you want to see.\n____________________________________________________\nUpdate:\nWE are funded! Dark Dungeons: The Movie! is now going to be made. I want to give a big thanks to all our backers out there who shared my dream to bring this to life.\nBut there is no resting on our laurels as it's time to announce some stretch goals:\nStretch Goal #1: $18,500 - the Necronomicon and Cthulhu mythos are all too real, according to Jack Chick's website, so if we reach our first stretch goal I will be glad to expose the Cthulhu threat in Dark Dungeons the Movie!\nStretch Goal #2: $21,000 - One of the most powerful ways to get across the powerful emotions that a serious drama like this raises is through song. I'd like to include a dream sequence where Debbie visualizes her internal struggle through verse:\n(Debbie, in a sad, thoughtful singsong:)\n\"Is this God in my hand, or is it just a d4?\nOh can anyone tell me what I'm rolling for?\nAre there traps and daggers, magic missiles galore?\nNo, this ain't God in my hand, it is just a d4.\"\n(Ms Frost, cackling:)\n\"You have mastered the magic, you have mastered the spell,\nYou are ready to unleash the powers of hell!\nYou have God in your hand, and you have your d4.\"\nNow I hope that you know what you're rolling for.\"\nStretch Goal # 3: $25,000 - Dark Dungeons the Movie! is a fictionalized account of the oh-so-very-real dangers of Role-playing but we would like to include a short documentary on the DVD about the fearless crusaders who have stood up to \"Big Gaming\" in the 1980s and find out why the crusade did not enjoy more success and where it stands today.\n__________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am the best person to make this project work because I am the only person who CAN make this project work. There is no guarantee that Jack Chick will allow anyone else to make a movie based on his work in the future either. He might, but he might not. But I have the right to make a movie about Dark Dungeons right now and I have the ability to make this happen. The time is now. The place is here. The power is mine. \n\nThe quality of the movie will probably be very similar to that of my introductory video; that's the best we can do with what we have. So please take a look at that to judge what type of movie we are capable of making. \n\nThe fact is, we are going at this with an ultra-low budget and that makes things incredibly harder. When the million and one things go wrong I won\u2019t be able to throw money at the problem but will have to improvise as best I can. I also will be making the plot fit the budget, rather than the other way around. This includes simple things like not setting any scenes at night (lighting can be expensive and time consuming), no large crowd scenes (more people mean more complexity means more money), and showing puppet demons fleeing Debbie instead of using CGI demons. \n\nBut I feel that the epic story of a girl who wants to be Debbie instead of Elfstar deserves to see the light of video and will put all my time, energy, and love into making this film and will do everything it takes to get it done.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "From the Makers of Dark Dungeons - New JourneyQuest!", "update_content": "Hi Dark Dungeoneers! \n Once again, thank you so much for making the Dark Dungeons the movie exist.

Ugli Studios Presents #2 is three separate stories told in three unique styles which culminates in one killer anthology that would make even Quentin Tarantino proud.\"  - Brian Berg, CEO and co-founder of Total Party Kill Games \n\"Jason Lenox has an incredible inking style and great layouts.\" -Erica Schultz, Writer/Co-Creator of M3, 2012 Winner for Best Comic\nBook at The Burbank Int'l Film Festival\n\u201cThe Painted Ladies of San Quentin\u201d is a fantastic mix of history and\nfantasy. The artwork is visually stunning and appeals to the eye. The\ntrue history of San Quentin is represented with the outlaws,\nscoundrels, and crocked politicians that put San Quentin on the map. I\ngive the graphic novel high marks for entertainment value alone.\nTommy Winfrey \u2013 San Quentin Prison News\nNotes\n*Another successful Kickstarter from Berg Management!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks associated with this book is that something very unforeseen and tragic happens to one of us- rabid dog mauling, flame thrower accident, ink pen lacerations from a correction gon bad, radioactive poisoning etc. Basically we need about 6 weeks to wrap up \"Painted Ladies of San Quentin\" and get the coloring done for the book cover and put the files together for the printer. This project has been in some stage of production since Winter 2012, so we are realistically about 90% done at this point already.

One such risk is obviously quality control ... everyone has heard horror stories about poor quality products being imported and subsequently recalled. If necessary, we will tackle this challenge by utilizing a manufacturer headquartered in Florida, who constantly monitors the production process at their plant overseas and stands behind their products.

You\u2019re a scoundrel, a villain, a wastrel, a vagabond, a criminal, a sword-for-hire, a cutthroat. Respectable people belong to guilds, the church or are born into nobility. Or barring all that, they\u2019re salt of the earth and till the land for the rest of us. Your problem is that you\u2019re none of that. You\u2019re a third child or worse. You can\u2019t get into a guild\u2014too many apprentices already. You\u2019re sure as hell not nobility\u2014even if you were, your older brothers and sisters have soaked up the inheritance. The temples\u2014they\u2019ll take you, but they have so many acolytes, they hand you kit and a holy sign and send you right out the door again: Get out there and preach the word and find something nice for the Immortal Lords. And if you ever entertained romantic notions of farming, think again. You\u2019d end up little more than a slave to a wealthy noble. \nSo there\u2019s naught for us but to make our own way. There\u2019s a certain freedom to it, but it\u2019s a hard life. Cash flows out of our hands as easily as the blood from our wounds. But at least it\u2019s our life. And if we're lucky, smart and stubborn, we might come out on top. There\u2019s a lot of lost loot out there for the finding. And salvage law is mercifully generous. We find it, it\u2019s ours to spend, sell or keep. \nTorchbearer is a riff on the early model of fantasy roleplaying games. In it, you take on the role of an adventurer seeking his or her fortune. To earn that fortune, you must explore fornlorn ruins, brave terrible monsters and retreive forgotten treasures. However, this game is not about being a hero. It is not about fighting for what you believe. This game is about exploration and survival. You may become a hero. You might have to fight for your ideals. But to do either of those things, you must prove yourself in the wilds. Because there are no jobs, no inheritance, no other opportunities for our deadbeat adventurers. This life is their only hope to prosper in this world.\nTorchbearer is part of the brand of games Burning Wheel HQ has been producing for over ten years. So like all of our other games, this is a game about making difficult choices while exploring the world and your character through the game rules and systems. And like all of our games, the heart of the experience is about how your character changes when faced with adversity. \nThis is a hard game, not a simple one. There are many moving parts and it\u2019s not possible to experience the whole game in one or even two sessions. But if you\u2019re ready to sink your teeth into a good game that will reward you for mastering the system over 10 or 20 sessions, this is the game for you.\nThe Game\nTorchbearer was designed by Thor Olavsrud, our long-suffering editor. It's based on our 2008 game Mouse Guard. It shares the same core system and concepts, but it adds a layer of complexity in the form of resource management, turn structure and conflict.\nIn the spectrum of BWHQ games, Torchbearer is advanced Mouse Guard. It\u2019s not as complex as Burning Wheel or Burning Empires, but it\u2019s certainly more involved than Mouse Guard or even FreeMarket. From a broader perspective, it's Basic D&D on Hard mode. \nThe Book\nThe book itself is a 200-page letter-sized hard cover with a four color cover and black and white interiors. We're breaking away from our traditional digest-sized book as a bit of an experiment. We want to see what it feels like to publish a big ol' RPG book. And of course it's an homage to all those great AD&D hardcovers.\nUpdate: Since we have had such a wonderful outpouring of support for the game, we've upgraded the book for all backers! Read about it here.\nPreviews\nYou can see previews of the character creation and world-building chapters in our updates. We hope you'll be inspired to make a character and a world and post them to our forums. \nDigital Content\nAll backers who pledged to a tier will receive PDFs of the following: the rulebook, the character sheet, the player reference sheet, the GM reference sheet, the Thief bonus class, the Paladin bonus class, the Middarmark Gazeteer and the bonus scenario The Dread Crypt of Skogenby.\nKickstarter\nWe're using Kickstarter this time because we really and truly are out of money for this project. We've spent it all on art and editing. To go forward, we need you to tell us if you want to see this game in print.\nCharacter Sheet\nTorchbearer Character Sheet Front\nCustom Leather Bound Books\nOur custom-bound books will be created by friend and fan Dan \"thebookguy32\" C. He's created custom covers for our other books, as well as Dungeon World and other games. \nSamples of Dan's custom binding work\nSketches by Dro\nThis is a sample of what you can expect if you'd like a sketch in your book from Dro. Dro is not an illustrator. Yet he insists on drawing strange creatures on his character sheets. Honestly, he might draw your character or he might draw anything that catches his attention at the time. No one knows what transpires in the land of Dromagination!\nDrollustrations", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been publishing roleplaying game books since 2002. In all, I've published 12 titles, about one per year. While there have been hiccups and a disaster or two, I always make sure my fans get their books and get them in good order. \n\nWe've decided to keep this project as simple as possible. We're only seeking to fund the book\u2014and thus we're avoiding swag and other stuff that might put the main project at risk. The book is being printed in Ann Arbor Michigan at Cushing-Malloy, with whom we've worked for the past 11 years. We chose to stick with CM for this project to avoid the headaches of shipping from overseas.\n\nIf any books are damaged in shipping, we will of course replace them\u2014except for the Dro-sketched copies. Those will not be replaced if damaged. They are an artifact and will arrive \"as is.\" \n\nThis is Burning Wheel HQ's first Kickstarter campaign and honestly, I'm terrified.

You just read some boring boxed text and send a couple of goblins into the room. A SECOND-GRADER COULD DO IT.\nSome of my critics disagree. \u201cEASY?\u201d they say, as globules of rage fly across the room. \u201cYou think running an inventive, engaging, BADASS RPG adventure is EASY?\u201d\nThat\u2019s right.

It\u2019s called Flaming Deathpits of the Minotaur Mage: Descent into Doomfire! It has a hackneyed \u201cSave the Princess\u201d plot. It has pyromancer named \u201cSteve.\u201d It has ROLE-PLAYING.\nYeah, you\u2019re right: it sounds like a total train wreck.

Let\u2019s start with experience: I\u2019ve been playing RPGs since I was 14. I\u2019ve been attending GEN CON since its Milwaukee debut. That\u2019s A LOT of gaming. I\u2019ve playtested rules systems, written \u201cdungeon duel\u201d-style Con events, and helped host NASCRAG \u2013 the longest-running independent RPG tournament at GEN CON. I know what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and what doesn\u2019t even qualify for unemployment.\n\nSecond, I know a dirty secret regular RPG authors would NEVER tell you: your game can be fun DESPITE the scripted adventure. That\u2019s my goal here. To take a trite premise and a hackneyed plot and prove that NONE OF THAT MATTERS when you game THE DUNGEON BASTARD WAY.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the reflexively amplifying nature of trying to create the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl: anything that goes wrong inherently makes the adventure EVEN WORSE. You've heard of a \"WIN-WIN\"? This is a FAIL-FAIL-WIN!\n\nThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m deliberately trying to tank this thing. On the contrary, I take pride in delivering a QUALITY PRODUCT \u2013 whether that\u2019s the written adventure or the final video of the live event. I\u2019ve worked with professionals in the field, and I share their professional standards.\n\nI have the experience, equipment, and team in place to make the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl TRULY AWESOME.

Check out this PDF excerpt from The Pirate's Guide to Freeport that gives you an overview of the City of Adventure!\nNote that while some of the PDF rewards are for older Freeport books that used the 3.5 d20 rules, Freeport: The City of Adventure, The Player's Guide to Freeport, and the Return to Freeport adventure series are all being done with Pathfinder rules. \nThe Quick Pitch\nWe've added a lot to this Kickstarter since it began, so here's a run down of what you get at the Freeport Pirate level ($100 or more). We think it's worth the ducats! \n* You get a print and PDF copy of Freeport: The City of Adventure.\n* You get all six parts of the Return to Freeport PDF adventure series as they release in 2014!

I have a tale to tell. It's a story of pirates, thieves, merchants, sailors, swashbucklers, cultists, and the place they call home: Freeport: The City of Adventure!\nAt GenCon 2000 the Third Edition D&D Player\u2019s Handbook debuted and launched the d20 era. On that day, WotC had no adventures or support material to sell, but thanks to a new-fangled thing called the Open Game License there was something else you could buy that day: a 32-page module called Death in Freeport from a young company called Green Ronin Publishing. We and Atlas Games were the only companies at GenCon to make the leap of faith required and see if D&D players would buy from third party publishers. And did they ever! Death in Freeport was huge hit, and two further modules followed quickly. That was the beginning of Freeport: The City of Adventure, and little did we know what a long life it would have.\nOver the years there have been many Freeport books, and the city\u2019s design made it easy to use in nearly any fantasy campaign setting. These last few years we've been concentrating on licensed games like Dragon Age and A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying, but Freeport was never far from our thoughts. We know there are tons of Freeport fans out there and we know that many of them graduated from Third Edition D&D to Paizo\u2019s Pathfinder RPG. Thanks to the rise of Kickstarter, we now have a way of doing a new Freeport book the way we want to and that\u2019s what this campaign is about.\nWe want to do a new edition of Freeport: The City of Adventure sourcebook that is bigger, meatier, and sexier than ever before. Our goal is for a 512-page full color hardback, with new locations, new NPCs, and a brand new adventure for low-level characters. The book will include full stats for the Pathfinder RPG, though it will also be easily usable with other games. Player-oriented rules support like classes, prestige classes, feats, and spells will also be available in a Player\u2019s Guide to Freeport PDF.\nIs this a lot of work? Damn right it is, but we\u2019re getting a little help from our friends: Fiery Dragon! If you were around during d20\u2019s heyday, Fiery Dragon needs no introduction. They burst onto to the scene with NeMoran\u2019s Vault and went on to join Swords & Sorcery Studio and to publish Iron Heroes. We've made a deal with our good friends at FD to help us on Freeport: The City of Adventure. They will put the book together under the guidance of Freeport creator Chris Pramas. They've done some great adventures over the years, so we\u2019re excited to see what they can do with Freeport!\nWe've also got Pathfinder experts on the project to make sure the rules are done right and up to date with the current state of the game. \nOur goal for this Kickstarter is high at $50,000 but there are good reasons for that. For one thing, we\u2019re going to be commissioning an enormous amount of brand new color art and a new cover painting. For another, printing a 512-page hardback is not a cheap undertaking. We've always had to do Freeport on a strict budget before. This time we want it to be the total package!\nSo strap on your cutlass and get ready to cast off for Freeport: The City of Adventure! We need a big crew to make this happen, so spread the word like a drunk sailor in dockside bar!\nReturn to Freeport Adventure Series!\nFreeport: The City of Adventure is shaping up to have at least 150 pages of new material. We've heard from a lot of folks who want more frosting on their Freeport cake though and who are we to argue?\nWe are pleased to announce Return to Freeport, a brand new adventure series that will be released in six parts over 2014. The format will be similar to our Mutants & Masterminds adventure series, Emerald City Knights. Every other month starting in February, we\u2019ll release a new chapter of Return to Freeport in PDF format. Each will be about 20 pages and retail for $3.99. The first chapter will be for 3rd level characters and it will scale up from there as the PCs gain xp.\nIf you back the Kickstarter for $30* or more, you will get all six chapters of Return to Freeport for FREE! \nConfirmed authors right now are Steve Kenson (Mutants & Masterminds, Pathfinder Game Mastery Guide), Stephen Radney-Macfarland (Pathfinder Advanced Player\u2019s Guide and Ultimate Combat), Jody Macgegor (Cults of Freeport and WFRP Nights Dark Masters) and Chris Pramas (Dragon Age RPG, Pathfinder Chronicles: Guide to the River Kingdoms). We will announce the remaining three as they come on board.\n* Note that backers who picked Scurvytown Special do not get this reward. That choice is for the book and its PDF only. \nDark Deeds in Freeport Adventure!\nBackers at $100 and up will also get a PDF of the new Dark Deeds in Freeport Adventure from Kobold Press for FREE! This official licensed adventure should be released by June, so you can get some Pathfinder Freeport goodness to tide you over until the new book is ready. What is Dark Deeds in Freeport? Let the Kobolds tell you all about it!\nDark Deeds in Freeport\nWhy has truth suddenly become so commonplace in Freeport? Can the city support not one but two churches dedicated to truth-speaking? How are the secrets of thieves, assassins, Captains' Council members, and \"legitimate businessmen\" becoming common knowledge, and what can be done about it? What should be done about it? And is any of this linked to the rash of thefts, murders, and insanity plaguing the city?\nDark Deeds in Freeport is a 64-page adventure arc of five connected Pathfinder RPG scenarios designed for a group of four PCs beginning at 9th level and ending at 12th.\nDark Deeds in Freeport...\n* features new spells, new magic items (from minor to near-artifact level), news monsters, new fully-statted Freeport NPCs.\n* mixes swashbuckling, investigation, and insanity in ways familiar to fans of Green Ronin's popular Freeport setting.\n * is fully integrated into the history and ongoing storylines of the Freeport setting and its adventures can be used individually or in a level-spanning mini-campaign.\n* is written by Christina Stiles (editor of Green Ronin's Black Sails Over Freeport and lead designer of Kobold Press's Journeys to the West) and Mike Franke and Phil Minchin with contributions from Ryan Costello, Jr., Robert Hahn, Carlos Ovalle, and Rory Toma.\n* is edited by Spike Y Jones (editor of Green Ronin's Testament and Wild Cards and Kobold Press's Midgard: Player's Guide to the Crossroads and Monsters of Sin series).\nIf you pledge at Freeport Pirate or above, you'll get Dark Deeds as soon as it releases!\nAs our Mutants & Masterminds fans know, we've been working with the fine folks at Lone Wolf for years to provide M&M support for their Hero Lab software. Hero Lab, as many games can attest, is a super useful character creation program. It helps you make and maintain a character, doing a lot of the hard work for you and giving you a character sheet with everything figured correctly.\nIf our Kickstarter funds, we will make the Freeport rules content available to ALL Pathfinder users of Hero Lab for FREE. You\u2019ll be able to use our classes, feats, magic items, spells, etc. when you create your character or NPCs. It\u2019s something the whole Pathfinder community can use and enjoy but only if we make our goal!  \nPromo Miniature!\nBut wait, there's more! We are teaming up with Eastern Front Studios to bring you a Freeport promotional mini as part of this Kickstarter. Acclaimed artist Brian Snoddy has done concept art for a degenerate serpentman mini, complete with a Yellow Sign shield. If you support the Kickstarter at the Freeport Pirate level or above, you get a serpentman mini for free! The mini will be approximately 28mm in size and made of pewter. \nIf you want more than one, or if you have pledged at a level lower than Freeport Pirate and still want some sweet serpentmen, you can get them as an add-on.\nIf you pledged at the Freeport Pirate level or above, you can add up to 10 more minis for $7 each. Just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount.\nIf you pledged at Lubber to Buccaneer, you can add up to 10 minis for $7 each, but please add $5 for US shipping and $10 for international shipping.

Funded!\n$75,000: Our (final?) stretch goal is that we will commit to doing the Advanced Bestiary for Pathfinder (likely as its own Kickstarter).

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGreen Ronin is an experienced publisher. We've been in business since 2000 and have published well over a hundred books. The risk on this project is low. We have an experienced staff and we make roleplaying books day in and day out.\n\nOur target date for the PDF release of the book is November, with the print version to come out two months later. The main risk, as with any RPG project, is lateness. One of the reasons we partnered up with Fiery Dragon is to allow us to do this project in a reasonable time. Still, a 512 page book with new art and layout is a big job. It could be it takes us until January to get the PDF out if some things don't go smoothly. \n\nThat said, I'm confident we can do this project in the time we outlined if we are funded.

Written in the noir genre (crime literature featuring tough, cynical characters and bleak settings) will have you petitioning the Pulitzer Board to award it the prestigious prize for fiction.\nHere are a few excerpts: Penny Farthing rolled over looking for a cigarette. Dressed in only her panties she found her Lucky Strikes package as empty as her heart. A handful of Advil, a swig of Jack Daniels and a \u00bd a cigarette she pulled from a full ashtray wasn\u2019t her normal breakfast, but it would do today.\n\u201cSo what do you want to do on our last night of freedom?\u201d Austin mulled over the question for a few minutes. \u201cI want to go to a luxurious restaurant for dinner. Then I want to hold your hand as we walk along the Potomac River and finally I want to make love to you until breakfast. Then I want to sleep all day.\u201d \u201cYou read my mind Agent Bluewater\u2026 you read my mind.\u201d\nAustin and Penny were running for their lives. The guards were like cockroaches that only came out at night. They shot at anything\u2026 mostly at Austin and Penny. They made it to the gate and started down the perimeter trying to get back to their prime hiding place when a machine gun burst let loose. Austin was hit, four bullets in the back. he buckled and fell; Penny dove to the ground, rolled over and emptied both Glocks. She took the men down. Penny came back after a few minutes with a ball peen hammer. She laid it on the table so Brad could see it. \u201cPick up the pen Brad and write down where you planted the bombs or Penny is going to hurt you. Do you see all that blood in her hair\u2026 she just had her hair done. If you knew anything about women, you would know that you never mess up their hair or makeup. You did both and I pity you.\u201d Penny picked up the hammer and smiled. \u201cAre you right handed or left handed Brad?\u201d\nPenny\u2019s 36 Double Ds were starting to droop a little, but a trip to the plastic surgeon would take care of everything if Penny ever decided it was the right time. Those breasts plus a keen mind had put many a gambling boss in the hoosegow. Men were easy, show some cleavage and a tight ass in leather and they would tell you anything. There was no need to sleep with these men; as soon as you did you were chattel. They thought they owned you for a little ass once in awhile. Penny wasn't a whore; being an undercover agent didn't mean she had to go under the covers.\nThese are the adventures in this memorable book.\nPenny Farthing and the Gambling Den of Iniquity ~ Penny Farthing and the Patriotic Terrorists ~ Penny Farthing and the Poisoned Poison\nAll three are masterpieces in their own right.

Tears streaming from your eyes, you dare to stop and get your bearings. In that brief moment, a bolt of energy flies past your face, nearly causing you to lose your footing and fall 1000 feet to the chasm below. You glance backwards to find your guide incinerated in the blast of Tek energy. It is not the battlefield you would have chosen, but you have enemies and they will track you to the very ends of Andronia. \n\nRoll Initiative.\n\nAndronia is a new Campaign World designed by Hydra Games. It is a world of high fantasy Magic mixed with technology called Tek. Using the pathfinder rules as its base this new world will be an intriguing place to set your new campaign. With novels and adventure modules planned and other campaign guides devoted to each region of the world you will have a vibrant and massive world at your finger tips.\nThe Region of Turmoil is a diverse area of Andronia that includes many cities, towns, and locations. The following is a description from the guidebook about one of the areas in the region.\nDraekyn Spears\nThe Draekyn Peaks are a treacherous mountain range that span along the southeastern coast of Eldaryn. Positioned north of Ishmarn and south of the Rubrein Mountains, the jagged peaks of the Draekyn Spears rise above the vast Haylwinn Sea to the east and The Follands to the west.\nBuffeted by storms that tear in from the Haylwinn and the naturally chaotic weather of the mountains, the Draekyn Spears are particularly dangerous to travel.\nWithin the guide is a number of new creatures, prestige classes, and races, along with detailed information about the locations in the Region of Turmoil. There is detailed information on deities for the setting and most importantly rules on Magic and Tek.\nHere is a little sample from the guide on the three powers:\nMagic\nUtilizing the planet's naturally occurring energy fields, known as The Gaze, the caster forms the energy to their will and then releases it in the form of a spell. During the process, the energy is neither created nor destroyed, it is simply utilized. Once expended, the energy returns to dynamic fields of The Gaze.\nTek\nTek forces the versatile fields of The Gaze into unnaturally powerful and concentrated forms. Although it is magic and for the most part behaves as magic, its delivery and utilization are quite different than conventional means. The tekonists manipulate and quantify magical potential into 'charges'. These charges are then used to power various weapons from laser-like guns, cannons, and tools to machines and even armor. Because of the high level of concentration and the fusion required to ignite it, the energy is dispersed upon discharge and does not return to The Gaze as most conventional magic does. Like alchemists, who use ordinary materials to create magnificent and magical compounds, tekonists use materials and formulas to create extraordinary devices with ordinary forces. However, the fields of The Gaze were not intended to be quantified, and once unraveled, like that of alchemicals, the energy is corrupted by the artificial chaos and disperses into various forms that fade into the natural world, as well as phase space.\nPrayers\nDivine magic is used by priests or holy warriors. Unlike arcane magic, it is generated by the power of the gods and is not related to the energy of the planet. However, it still must pass through The Gaze. Without The Gaze, divine assistance to mortals becomes limited - functioning at 50% normal potency. In some way, the spell's effectiveness is halved, whether it be healing, damage or duration, whatever is the most critical function of the spell.\nThe reason for this Kickstarter is to pay off the cover art and prepare the book for release. The content is done along with all the interior art. This is also our first release for Hydra Games. We have been releasing novels for two years but have recently started branching into the game side.\nWe have a number of projects in the works and several are included as stretch goals of this project. We also have a number of other guidebooks being designed for the Andronia Campaign world. We want to start off right with the gaming community and develop a nice campaign world their characters can live and play in.\nWe have a number of projects near completion and with a little help from you we can get them done and add some bonuses for your efforts.\nCrestview Module\nAt $400 we will add a digital copy of Crestview Module to all tiers Squire level and higher. Knight Level and above will be able to add a print copy for an added $10 to your pledge.\nPurge of Caudor Module\nCaudor is going up in flames, clerics are fleeing the city, and bodies are showing up half-eaten. This is not just politics as usual in this Lawful city, so why does the city guard refuse to investigate \u2013 again? Is this just a case of bureaucracy at its worst, or is something bigger afoot?\nThere are far more questions than answers here, and the Merchant Prince is a desperate man. Can your small band of mercenary adventurers save the city from an evil far greater than anyone comprehends? You must act quickly, for things are about to get strange in Caudor.\nAt $600 we will add a digital copy of Purge of Caudor Module to all tiers Squire level and higher. Knight Level and above will be able to add a print copy for an added $10 to your pledge.\nSpecial Hydra d6\nAt $750 we will add a special Hydra Logo d6 to every Knight Level order. This d6 will have our Hydra Logo on it on the 6 position.\nReaper Legacy: Hunt for the Lost Raven Novel\nSet in the colorful world of Andronia where technology is magic and landmasses float in the sky as well as on the water, one girl must fulfill her father\u2019s dying wish and protect a family heirloom from those seeking its secrets.\nLilianna Raven, daughter of the late Lord Kelwin Raven, lives her mundane life dreaming of the day she can sail away on one of the elegant skyships that stop periodically to trade with her remote isle. Before she gets the chance, however, her isle is attacked by Reapers\u2013a bloodthirsty nomadic people known for taking what they want and killing anyone who stands in their way. Her flight from the Reapers takes her across Andronia via an ancient system of gateways believed to have been destroyed in the last Shadow Age.\nHunting Lili is the relentless Captain Kyralynn Ranise, daughter of the Reaper Dragon Lord. But she\u2019s not alone. Kyralynn will do anything to win this race, especially if that means killing her fiercest rival and eldest brother, Captain Josen.\nAt $900 we will add a digital copy of Reaper Legacy to all tiers Squire level and higher. Knight Level and above will be able to add a print copy for an added $10 to your pledge.\nSpecial Hydra Dice Set\nAt $1200 instead of a special Hydra d6 we will send you a complete matching set of dice with a special d6 Hydra Logo. There will be a d4, d6 Hydra Logo version, d8, d10, d12 and d20.\nBook of Vile Villainy\nVenture into the pages of The Book of Vile Villainy and uncover the bizarre, the macabre, and the horrid evolution of villains who take pleasure in murder and thievery while sometimes wearing the shrouds of artificers who delve into creating creatures to do their bidding \u2013 similar to a puppeteer working the strings, giggling behind the curtain.\nUse this manual to insert enemies into your game, such as Exchangers, some of the ruthless ones who want no more than to cause horror for characters, tricking them and placing them inside the Gurgal Labyrinth.\nThis book will not disappoint, from the beginning gamer to the expert.\nAt $1500 we will add a digital copy of Book of Vile Villainy to all tiers Squire level and higher.

By opening a production brewery, I will share this passion and knowledge with my local community and bring fresh drinkable beer to the San Francisco Bay Area.\nAfter receiving my college degree I moved home and introduced my family to my new hobby! I kept brewing in their backyard and garage. Beer after beer just kept getting better and it wasn't too long before we all realized we loved this brewing stuff! We loved the different flavors that come from craft beer. We loved the fun and community you get in craft breweries and wanted to be a part of that!\nSo Eight Bridges Brewing was conceived.\nWe will be a production brewery self-distributing to local pubs and restaurants in the greater San Francisco Bay area. Our tasting room will be THE place to come taste new beer, enjoy a pint, buy a growler and just enjoy some awesome conversation (ok if you insist, we\u2019ll let you sweep the floors). Our plan is to open with a small tasting room in the middle of the brewery and grow to include local bands, support local businesses and host fundraisers for local charities. We are looking forward to being part of our local communities!\nWhile the craft beer revolution harkens to yesterday by bringing local breweries back to our neighborhoods, Eight Bridges Brewing wants to be part of bringing beer tradition back to the Tri-Valley area. Part of our local history includes the growing of hops from 1880 to the start of WWI.  At that time Pleasanton had the worlds largest hop farm. In fact, Pleasanton hops were shipped around the world and are reported to have been used at the Guinness Brewing Company in Dublin Ireland. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to once again grow hops here? That is a goal we hope to rally other local breweries to support!\nWhat Makes This Endeavor Different?\nOur team is diverse and unique. Although I have a degree in Zoology, which brings with it tons of chemistry and biology, I actually finished 3 years of school as a Mechanical Engineer before changing majors. Upon graduating college, I thought I\u2019d end up in medicine but at the time I didn\u2019t realize how hard I had been bitten by this brewing thing!  I have the skills and training to understand machinery and manufacturing flow along with the chemistry to know how things work together!  Add in my dad who has deep small business experience with more than 20 years running and advising small businesses, my mom\u2019s financial and bookkeeping background and my sister\u2019s ability to run a retail drink establishment . . .well with all this and amazing beer, how could we not succeed?\nIt\u2019s All About the Beer\nOur beer is traditional, but it\u2019s not. We use traditional malt grain, hops, and yeast from around the world to achieve beer that people enjoy drinking and talking about. Some are traditional styles and some are blends of styles all designed to be distinct in flavor balance, drinkability and freshness.\nCraft beer drinkers have a style of beer that is their favorite but also want variety. Eight Bridges Brewing will focus on always providing both the favorite and the variety. Our initial everyday beers will be my Pilsner, Red Ale, Brown Ale and an IPA all of which I have been brewing for the last several years.\nTo augment these offerings we will rotate many seasonal and special beers which will include a Kolsch, Russian Imperial Stout, Oatmeal Stout and Noble India Pale Lager. But we won\u2019t stop there! New beers will be introduced as I explore the magic of blending flavors that bring out all the complexities of yeast, malt and hop flavors that when married together develop those awesome flavors and drinkability my beers are known for.\nAren\u2019t There Too Many Craft Breweries in California?\nWe are beginning a journey back to a time when beer played a role in every community. While there has been dramatic growth in the number of breweries cropping up, we have a long way to go before there are too many breweries in the Bay Area. The Bay Area, and in particular the Tri-Valley area, needs more breweries to support the growing number of craft beer drinkers and the wonderful taverns, brew pubs and restaurants that want to provide the variety they demand. Warning, I\u2019m going to bore you with a few statistics now!  When compared to areas known to have quite a few craft breweries, like San Diego County and Portland Oregon, the 5 Bay Area counties have tons of room for more breweries! California ranks as the #1 most populous state in the union and only #21 in people per brewery while Oregon ranks #27 in population and #2 in the number of people per brewery. Dig a little deeper by comparing San Diego County with the 5 counties making up the San Francisco Bay Area and the Bay Area has almost 49,000 people per brewery to San Diego\u2019s 26,000 people per brewery. Yup, I\u2019d say there is room for growth!\nThe Nitty Gritty\nSo let\u2019s get down to the reason we\u2019re here, I\u2019m starting a production brewery with my family but we need money. Lots of money. This is a family endeavor and my family is behind this in a big way. I\u2019ll bring all my brewing, manufacturing and engineering experience to make some of the best beer out there, my father has dusted off his MBA and developed an amazing Business Plan, my uncle, the architect, is busy visiting breweries and tasting rooms (it\u2019s a tough job!) to design the best brewery and tasting room and together we have ponied up about half of the total capital we need to launch Eight Bridges Brewing.\nBut opening a brewery takes even more than this and that is why we need your help!\nBy donating to Eight Bridges Brewing, you will be an integral part in providing the necessary capital to purchase a Brewhouse, mill, fermenter, and storage tanks. With your generosity, Eight Bridges Brewing will come off the planning table (my mom will be happy to have the dinner table back!) and into our tasting room and homes of the greater San Francisco Bay Area.\nWe\u2019re So Excited You\u2019ve Decided to Jump In and Make a Pledge?

Free Shipping to: USA, Europe, Canada, Australia & New Zealand. Everywhere else please add 12.00GBP\nHow our Pro Studio brushes are made:\nStep 1: Hair Mixing Process.   The Kolinsky sable hair is weighed and split into units ready to be mixed in a special machine which runs for approximately twenty-five minutes per half kilo batch. Subsequently, the hair is prepared into bundles which are dressed in preparation for the craftsmanship of the brush maker. There is only a point on one end of each hair or fibre and it is critical to ensure that all hairs are pointing in the same direction! Any hair which is upside down is manually removed from the bundle using sticky tape.\nStep 2: Brush Making Process. \nThis is a very important stage in the production process.  The craftsman pinches a precise amount of hair from an opened bundle which has been laid out on a table with all points facing the same way.  The tuft of hair is inserted into a shaping cup, pointing downwards.  If the brush is to be round, the cup is concave on the inside and if the brush is to be flat, the cup is flat on the inside.The shaped heads are hung on a rack to be cemented.  Epoxy adhesive is injected into the open back of the ferrule.  The tufts of hair are now permanently fixed in the ferrule ready for assembly. he points of hair are tapped into shape then the shaped tufts of hair are withdrawn from the cup and inserted into a ferrule and pulled out to correct the length.  The shaped heads are then gently adjusted by trained craftsman\u2019s fingers. \nStep 3: Handle Dipping Process: Handle lacquering of plain wood is a continuous process; a base painting mixture is readied using thinners to obtain the correct viscosity in preparation for handle dipping. Pinning plainwood handles to dipping boards prior to lacquering. Inverted boards of dipped handles which are drying. Board of handles lifting from a dip tank where gold colour has been applied to the tip. If required, handles are cut to size and then arranged so that they face the same way prior to being pressed into pin-boards (for larger handles) or into rubber boards (for smaller handles). The board is held upside down so that the handles are dipped into the paint. They are then carefully removed before being loaded onto a trolley and left to dry. The paint for each layer is prepared while the previous coat dries for a couple of hours. Depending on the brush style, between four and ten layers may be required, at the end of the process each board is left to dry for one to two days. Pad printing of the lacquered handles is carried out prior to final assembly. A pad printing machine is set with the artwork and specified paint with the correct colour for stamping before the handle is positioned and stamped on both front and the back.\nStep 4: Assembling and Finishing Process: The assembly process consists of a second application of epoxy into the ferrule prior to the insertion of the lacquered and imprinted handle. The handles are subsequently straightened and allowed to partly cure. The ferrule is then crimped to the handle. Finishing consists of combing any twisted hair, fine trimming and or knifing of any stray hairs or fine fuzz. Finally, the brushes are dipped in gum Arabic solution and hand formed to shape. The finished products are then packaged ready for dispatch and distribution.\nOnce the project is a success. We can then start to make our Pro Studio Brushes and produce the first 300 sets to be sent within the first 3 weeks after the Kickstarter has been a success. We will continue to produce and make our brushes to fulfill our order via our Kickstarter Backers. The estimated delivery time will allow us to deliver on time and meet our promises to our backers. We can make 4000 sets every 30 days. So that will be 8000 sets within our estimated deliver time of April 2013. \nThank you for your time & support.

This series of adventure modules draws inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft's Dreamlands stories, the fairy tales of Oscar Wilde, the works of Romantic poets like Coleridge and Byron, and the myths and folktales of cultures the world over.\nThe vision behind the Slayers of the Great Serpent series is about creating a story about heroes and their great deeds, but also about making a world that is majestic and awe-inspiring. What I envisioned was a quest that requires the party to travel far beyond the lands known to them and cross half the world, witnessing many bizarre and spectacular sights and facing many dangers.\nThis adventure module is intended for characters of 1st-4th level. It has a projected page count of 90-100 pages, and will be published in softcover and PDF format.\nArt by Nathan Nelson\nI: To the Edge of the Map\nThe unlikely heroes learn of a terrible menace that is about to awaken when a messenger arrives at the royal court with a warning of apocalyptic magnitude. The adventurers learn that heroes are needed to cross the ocean and travel to the distant east in order to search for the lair of a gargantuan snake known as The Destroyer and The Eater of Worlds. These heroes must travel far from their homes and try to find the country where the Great Serpent lives. Very little is known about this land, save for rumors that it lies to the east of distant Xi, a strange and romantic kingdom on the other side of the ocean. Nothing will be certain on this journey, not the final destination of our heroes, or the incredible dangers that they are sure to face. If no one can find this monster and lay it low before it rises from its torpor then the world will fall into an age of darkness and become transformed into a nightmarish hellscape of misery and death.\nThe majority of this adventure takes place while the adventurers are traveling; they must contend with both the everyday hazards of life on the road as well as cowardly plots initiated by an agent of the Church of the Destroyer. Before they can think about crossing the ocean, the adventurers must first find and reach the coast of their own continent. The first task they will need to accomplish is to leave the borders of The Kingdom by the Sea and then cross the dangerous Iron Ridge Mountains. On the other side of these mountains the adventurers will encounter a violent and lawless region known as The Outlaw Kingdoms. Should they make it across this land and yet live, they must still face the unknown dangers of the enchanted Forest of Night. It is here that the adventurers will brave a final showdown with the mysterious agent that has impaired their progress from the start. During the confrontation, the cultist summons a horrific Nightmare Snake, a living fragment of one of the Great Serpent\u2019s dreams.\nArt by Daniel Wood\nThe Story of this Tale\nThe project had its conception as a campaign that I was planning to run with my long-time gaming group. I wanted to do something daring and unexpected, but also classic. It was an entire twenty-level campaign done as a single marathon quest: an effort to find and slay a terrible, world-shattering monster before it awakens. I wanted to make a story about humble would-be heroes taking on a daunting and seemingly impossible challenge, knowing only that they must set themselves to the task and find some way of accomplishing it. After splitting the campaign into five parts, I began to work on all of them simultaneously. At this point I was mostly worried about working the kinks out of the story, making sure that the obstacles that the party faced would have enough variety to fill twenty full levels. I also wanted the players to always feel as if they were making progress toward their long-term goal when they faced a short-term challenge. The idea wasn't to have a bunch of random encounters and strung-together incidents; the idea was to build a compelling narrative about people on a quest. It was at this stage that I realized that a larger-than-life storyline does not have to be complicated. Simple stories can be the most compelling of all. The Odyssey is about a man trying to get home to his wife. Star Wars is about a young knight who rescues a princess from the black knight's fortress. Tolkien wrote volumes about a group of people dropping a ring into a volcano. My story would be about killing a REALLY big snake.\nHowever, it was not until I began crafting the world of this campaign and writing the read aloud text for the different adventures that I really felt as if I was on to something special. I attempted to write read aloud text that captured the language of a classic novel or narrative poem without sounding cheesy. You know what, I think I did it. I still wanted to run the campaign for the guys in my group, but mostly to playtest the five modules and improve the product. I had decided at this point to share the campaign with the wider world. I started a kickstarter because I was determined to create the best possible campaign possible, one that would be breathtaking and memorable for the groups that played it.\nBUDGET\nThe money being raised to fund Slayers of the Great Serpent will go towards all of the nuts and bolts of publishing.\nEditing and Layout$150\nCartography$150\nInterior Art$300\nFees + Rewards$500*\n*Exact numbers on this will not be known until I know how many of each reward type to produce. Any leftover funds will be added to the art budget or used for promotion.\nPREVIEW\nA TALE OF TERRIBLE DANGER\nThe exhausted rider stumbles into the great hall and takes a cup of water, greedily washing it down. The water is quickly followed by a goblet of wine that disappears in like fashion. The stranger addresses the room and says, \"I apologize for interrupting your festivities and riding up to your gate in such a dramatic fashion. My men and I are on a mission, one I adopted from another knight, a woman from a distant land who was a stranger to me. She was the last of her party, and near death herself when we found her. I knew nothing of this woman. Nonetheless, by the conviction and fear I saw in that knight's eyes as she lay dying, I knew that I must carry on her mission, carrying the brave knight's message as far as my will can carry me.\"\n\"I will tell you of this valiant knight's herald, but first I must ask that children and the faint at heart be removed from the room at once, for I have come to tell you of an evil so powerful that merely to think of it is enough to invite it to haunt your nightmares. Speak its name in vain, and it will send plagues of vermin and dangerous creatures to torment you. If you should actively work against this evil, the very beasts of the world will assail you with shocking viciousness and unnatural creatures will seek you out.\"\nHe pauses to catch his breath, wearily the foreign knight continues, \"I have come seeking heroes. That was the lady knight's message. I have come to warn you of the evil that is known as the Destroyer, the Great Serpent, and the Eater of Worlds. From prehistoric times the serpent has come, yet even after untold millennia, its actions still scar the cultures of the Eastern tribes and among pagans snakes are still worshipped to this day. Indeed, there are those who claim that this foe is a dark and terrible god in its own right. Another legend that the knight told me spoke of an ordinary snake that happened upon a hidden vale where the gods were reveling, and stole from them the secrets of the universe. Being a simple creature, it used this knowledge to form a simple plan; eat and grow larger. It then consumed many creatures in blood sacrifice, a ritual meant to ensure that it would never stop growing in size and power. The legend said that it was not long before the snake was of such might that nothing could stop it from eating at will.\"\n\"Some legends claim that the terrible serpent consumed the lost city of Urx, others say that it was the cause of the great calamity that destroyed the Empire of the Sun Priests. In the eastern lands, many are such legends that speak of the great beast, and all note how it sleeps in an unknown country, one that lies far to the east of fabulous and mystical Xi, a legendary land that is said to be on the other side of the Quartz Ocean. These folktales never fail to mention the seven signs that are sure to arise to mark the awakening of the beast, a time when the Eater of Worlds should once again cause the very earth to tremble with its might.\"\nSolemnly, the road-worn knight bows his head and drops his voice to a mere whisper. \"When the signs of the Great Serpent's return began to appear, when reports from the east began to match the ancient prophesies, a party was assembled to seek out the Destroyer and strike it dead while it still slept. The knight whose burden I now bear told me how a prince of the Spice Islands brought together a band of warriors, including veterans of foreign wars who knew well the jungles surrounding distant Xi. Also with him were experienced hunters of dire beasts, along with many porters, craftsmen, and sailors. Over a century strong were they when they left port in three mighty ships, fully outfitted with rations and material for the journey.\"\nHis voice goes even deeper as he continues, \"She said the people waited over a year for their return. Finally, long after all hope had been lost, a merchantman flying the colors of Xi docked in the Spice Islands. There were only a handful of survivors. It is said that some of them took one look at the beast and went blind, and now they only speak of a endless desert waste that no life can tolerate. Others among their number have gone mad, and now rave ceaselessly about the end of the world.\"\nThe messenger stands up and thumps his mailed gauntlet against his breastplate. \"I come seeking heroes! After the failure of the Spice Island party, messengers were sent in every direction. Word is being spread by land and sea. Brave and hearty souls are needed to cross the vast ocean, travel to the distant and exotic east, and from there seek the location of the mysterious country where the Destroyer dwells. Heroes are needed to find this monster before it wakes and strike it dead!\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhenever you contract work out to other people there is a chance that something could go wrong.

I'm John Wick, and I'd like to introduce you to Wicked Fantasy.\nWicked Fantasy is a brand new setting book focusing on ten races. It has been a year-long project for myself and Gillian Fraser, re-creating the \"generic\" races found in most fantasy roleplaying games. We re-designed humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, and then turned our attention to orks, gnolls, ratmen, goblins and kobolds. Ten races, all with a wicked twist.\nOur re-envisioning effort met with much critical applause with reviews calling the new races \"brilliant,\" \"sometimes near genius,\" and containing \"lessons every gazetteer should look at.\"\nGillian and I have been working over a year on this project, releasing each race as a PDF download. Both of us are excited about the project for many reasons. First, we wanted to bring a fresh perspective to the races. Let's face it, some of the races (men, in particular) are a little boring, even cliche. We wanted to \"spice up\" the existing races. \nSecond, we wanted to show that the Pathfinder system is flexible enough to tell deep and moving stories, not just simulate skirmish level fighting. Gillian and I both felt too many new classes, archetypes, etc. focused on combat. We wanted to expand the races beyond just fighting, to show them in a wider context, and provide mechanics to make them \"real\" in gameplay. Not just a \"+1 to Diplomacy,\" but something as robust and real as the Cleave Feat. The phrase \"Social Cleave\" was a very popular joke while we were writing the races, but it summed up our goals nicely.\nOf course, Jill and I created a unique team for this project. I might even say \"uniquely qualified.\" I've spent years in the game design industry, turning expectations on their heads with games such as Legend of the Five Rings, 7th Sea and Houses of the Blooded. I made orks into heroes with Orkworld, and did the same with your household kitty with Cat: A Little Game about Little Heroes. My unorthodox approach to RPGs--not just thinking outside the box, but throwing the box out the window--has created what others have called some of the most innovative RPG designs in the last twenty years.\nWhen I teamed with Gillian, I found someone who not only loved Pathfinder, who not only wanted to put a distinctive twist on the races, but who also had a keen mind for mechanics and mathematics. Over the course of the year, we both taught each other a lot about game design, Pathfinder and storytelling.\nWe didn't want to make a \"better Pathfinder.\" We wanted to add our own voice and vision to an ever-expanding game system. We looked at each race and asked ourselves, \"Why are people fans of this race?\" We found that key element, then turned the volume up to 11. A game about culture. A game about dangerous choices. A game that asks the question, \"What does it really mean to be a hero?\"\nFor an example of what we did, here is the PDF for The Reign of Men. Check it out!\nThis is the Pathfinder we wanted to play. And we found out we weren't alone.\nWhen we released the first PDFs for Wicked Fantasy, the reactions were intense. We got a ton of good reviews and a few negative ones, but one thing was certain: everyone was passionate about what we were doing. That told Gillian and I we were headed in the right direction.\nDavid BS at RPGnow.com said of the Reign of Men: \n\"It's good to see the humans strut their stuff first, for a change! And they do it with style!\"\nAs for our look on halflings, Thilo G. wrote: \n\"Not only is the re-imagined halfling awesome... halfling secret agents rock!\"\nAt rpg.net, joewolz gave Orks: Children of Pain 4/5 Stars, saying: \n\"Mr. Wick has been doing this for a while, and of course he produces top-notch work. The implied setting for the orks is evocative and interesting.\"\nWe've got tons of rewards folks, and I mean tons.\nEveryone who pledges $25 or more gets THREE COINS FROM THE REIGN OF MEN. You get one copper, one silver and one gold coin. You can see pictures just below. Now, they aren't real copper, silver and gold, but they sure do look like it. And they're heavy. You drop these down on a tavern keeper's bar and they're gonna sound like you'd expect them to sound.\nAnd since one of the rewards is GETTING YOUR FACE ON A COIN, the ones below have placeholder faces.\nWe've got CUSTOM WICKED FANTASY DICE made exclusively by Chessex for this project. You get a set of dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20) in gemini blue steel! The d6 and the d10 both have the Wicked Fantasy logo on the 6 and 10, respectively.\nAnd, if you want additional dice (or if you want dice from a pledge level that doesn't include them), just add $20 to your order and we'll send you a set. In fact, for each $20 you add, we'll add another dice set! Get a set for everyone in your group!\nWe've got CHARACTER JOURNALS! These handy little books have your character sheet, a Wicked Fantasy quick reference rules guide plus a black and white map of the world of Wicked Fantasy! Plus, plenty of space for information about NPCs, locations, important plot poins and other notes.\nWe've got add ons! And it's the stuff gamers want! Dice, maps and a GM Screen!\nIf you add a map, the dice or GM screen to a PDF only order only, and you are ordering from overseas, please add $5 for shipping.\n$20 / $25 - Wicked Fate!\nA stand-alone B&W soft-cover book including information on all the races, the map and everything else, but translated into the Fate System by Mark Diaz Truman! $20 Domestic / $25 International\n$20 - Dice!\nJust add $20 to your order and you get a full set of Wicked Fantasy dice! In fact, if you want multiple sets, just throw in another $20 per set you want. A dice set includes one of each: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20.\n$20 - GM Screen! (Unsigned)\nDue to popular demand, we are releasing the GM Screen as an add on. The screen will be unsigned, however.\n$50/$60 - Additional Book\nIf you want another copy of Wicked Fantasy added to your order, just add $50 for domestic orders or $60 for international orders. We'll throw in another copy you can share at your gaming table!\n$25 / $30 - Wicked Fantasy Companion\nEveryone gets a PDF copy of the Wicked Fantasy Companion, but you can pick up a physical copy of the 8.5''x11'' softcover book by pledging an additional $25 Domestic / $30 International. The Companion has the Savage Worlds and Dungeon World conversion, fiction by Mike Stackpole and Matt Forbeck, and a Wicked Fantasy Adventure and GM Advice from John and Jill!\n$20 - Full Color Map!\nOur incredible graphic designer, Jessica Kauspedas (Blood & Honor, Big Book of Little Games) has designed a 24x36 map for Wicked Fantasy. It is gorgeous. Color coordinated, easy to read and accessible, hang it on your wall with pride! We're adding to the map all the time, but take a peek at this (unfinished) draft.\nWF Map\nIn addition to the book, every contributor also receives a digital CD of soundtrack music from the world of Wicked Fantasy. The soundtrack contains both \"race songs\" and \"tavern songs.\"\nRace songs are themed after the ten races. Each race has one. For example, below you can hear \"Goblin Caravan.\"\nOr, if you prefer, check out one of our \"tavern songs.\" These are tunes typically played in a tavern in the Reign of Men. For example, take a listen to \"The March of Dervin's Volunteers.\"\nOr, if you're looking for something dark and dangerous, here's a little a dark elf chanting \"A Prayer to the Darkness.\"\nFor our book, we've enlisted two fantastic artists: Aaron Acevedo and Mauro Mussi. Hopefully, we'll be able to add even more art to the book! (See stretch goals, below.)\nRoddun: Scourge of the City\nThe Reign of Men\nElves: Guardians of the Wood\nUvandir: The Pride of Craftsmen\nWe also made videos for each of the races, looking at our decisions, reflecting on the results. You can watch all the videos at my Youtube Wicked Fantasy playlist!\nWicked Fantasy Playlist on Youtube\nFor example, for dwarves, we picked the word \"stubborn\" and applied it to all the racial traits. We boosted their saving throws, we made them resistant to will-changing magics and we just made dwarves hard to kill.\nFor humans, we focused on \"self-determination.\" Men are not bound by fate nor destiny: they make their own way in the world. They believe in philosophy and reason and science. They are their own masters with no gods, only a deep belief that humans can be greater than they are. We created feats, archetypes and other mechanics to reflect this.\nWe did the same for all the races. We made elves romantically tragic, we made gnomes true spirits of the earth, and we made halflings James Bond. Yes, halflings are James friggin' Bond. (You should watch the video below. It'll make sense.)\n1) The Material is Awesome\nIf I do say so myself. But please, let me explain.\nAs a designer, I've always enjoyed collaborating with others, but I have to say working with Gillian has really brought out some of my best work. Our disagreements led to places we never thought we would go and created opportunities to do really fantastic work. That inspired our artists as well. Just take another look at the art up there. Mauro and Aaron worked hard to create art that matched the steam and fire Gillian and I were stirring up. This is a work of passion, and you can feel it in the words and pictures, steaming up from the pages.\nAlso, you can use Wicked Fantasy in just about any fantasy RPG. You don't need to use the Pathfinder rules. Many folks have told us, \"I'm using this for Dungeon World!\" or \"I'm using this for Burning Wheel!\" or just about any other fantasy RPG you can think of. So, if you aren't a fan of Pathfinder, don't feel like you can't use the book. You can!\n2) Expanding Pathfinder's Horizons\nGillian and I really wanted to see just how far Pathfinder could go. We bent, twisted, stretched and kicked the system hard. We wanted to expand it to show that the system could really take on all the elements of fantasy storytelling. At the same time, Gillian kept reminding me, \"What will this class do in combat?\" We never lost sight of the role that combat plays in Pathfinder games. Wicked Fantasy is a game about race, politics, clashing philosophies, mystery and discovery... but in the end, someone is going to draw a sword. So, we wanted to expand that element of Pathfinder as well. We thought outside the box, looking for new and different ways to incorporate different kinds of characters into combat.\n3) Breaking the Rules\nWe hope Wicked Fantasy will show other Pathfinder fans how diverse and powerful the system can be when you push the envelope. Wicked Fantasy isn't just a list of new classes, archetypes and feats: it's a whole different way to play the game. \nWe wanted rules that worked within the structure of the system, but looked like nothing else. We wanted to innovate. We wanted to create change. We wanted to inspire others to do the same: to look at the Pathfinder system with fresh eyes and do something different!\nGillian and I did that. We did it because we wanted to create a world and races that we wanted to play, but we also wanted to add some fresh ideas into the mix. To throw a brick through the window. To get the Pathfinder community to notice. And hopefully, to get people to think differently about what Pathfinder could do.\nNow, all ten races are collected for the first time in one book, and with your help, we can add a whole ton of new material as well. We're looking forward for an opportunity to make Wicked Fantasy a book you'll be proud to own. We want to add a \"wicked twist\" to your existing campaign. And here's how we're going to do it.\nOur last Kickstarter Project, \"Wilderness,\" was a huge success in large part due to Mark Diaz Truman. He's going to help us with this project as well, handling all the shipping and production, so Gillian and I can focus our creative energies on meeting our stretch goals. If you want to take a look at that project, you can do so here.\n$10,000 - UNLOCKED! MORE ART AND ARCHETYPES!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will double the art in the book. More full-color art from the amazing Mauro Mussi!\nAlso, Gillian and I will be creating TEN NEW ARCHETYPES: one for each race. Archetypes are specialized character classes, each filling a distinct niche in the adventuring party. Instead of a wizard, you play a witch! Instead of a fighter, you play a swordsman. For example, we could add an ork antipaladin, human inquisitor and a haffun burglar. You'll find out as we add them. \n$12,500 - UNLOCKED! HERO LAB!\nIf we reach this goal, Gillian makes a Wicked Fantasy add on for Hero Lab!\n$15,000 - UNLOCKED! SAVAGE WORLDS CONVERSION RULES BY JOEL SPARKS!\nIf we hit the $15,000 mark, Joel Sparks will write a SAVAGE WORLDS conversion for Wicked Fantasy!\n$17,500 - UNLOCKED! DUNGEON WORLD CONVERSION BY SAGE LATORRA AND ADAM KOEBEL!\nIf we hit this goal, the authors of Dungeon World -- Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel -- will write a DUNGEON WORLD conversion for Wicked Fantasy!\n$20,000 - UNLOCKED! THE DARKNESS & THE ENEMY\nIn all the PDF releases, we hinted at two evil powers in the world: \"the Darkness\" and \"the Enemy.\" If we hit this stretch goal, John and Jill will add these two new races to the book, further deepening the mysteries of the world of Wicked Fantasy.\n$22,000 - UNLOCKED!

In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others \u2013 or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.\nAlthough Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools and even favors \u2013 if there is truly honor among chemists!\nCompounded will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me Games titles, with high-quality components. Compounded will include five thick cardboard personal Work Benches where players manage their experiments and tools; thick punchboard player claim tokens, tools and the coveted lab key that marks the Lead Scientist; 100 plastic \"element\" crystals in six different elemental colors; a bag for storing and blindly pulling elements during the game; and 70 square compound cards, printed on high-quality cardstock. There's also a thick cardboard scoring track (it's the periodic table!) and we'll even throw in some plastic baggies to organize and store all your cardboard goodies!\nCompounded will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Rooster\"-sized box - halfway between a Monkey (Carnival, The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) and a Tiger (VivaJava). What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nCompounded is a game for 2 to 5 players, ages 12 and up, and designed by Darrell Louder. Compounded is a distinguished three-year alum of Cartrunk Entertainment's Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nIf you'd like to dig deeper into Compounded, you can download the rules here. Please bear in mind that the rules design is still a work in progress - we're working on editing, refining, and adding art and examples to make them as clear as possible before the game goes into production. Well, hopefully into production - that's where you all come in!\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish Compounded with the quality that we all have come to expect. However, the base game of Compounded is priced according to our initial funding goal; exceeding that funding goal will allow us to add more to the game, such as select component upgrades, an in-game expansion (or \"inspansion\"), and maybe another special goodie or two if the campaign does well. So spread the word, get your friends and family to pledge, and stay tuned for updates for more information on those special stretch goal rewards! Remember, backers who pledge for a copy of Compounded (CHEMISTRY 101 pledge level and above) receive ALL stretch goals - so pledge early and rest easy in knowing you'll never have to upgrade your pledge to get more goodies.\nOur first stretch goal has been reached - an upgrade to the Lab Key Lead Scientist token! This hefty wooden token will signify who gets to do all the cool stuff first in the turn. In other words - when you're holding the key, you're in charge! For more info. on the $35K stretch goal upgrade, check out Update #2.\nOur second stretch goal has been reached!. We will be adding the Lab Partners Inspansion! The Lab Partners Inspansion includes 20 large cards (standard \"tarot\" size) that represent much larger compounds available for completion in the lab. Each compound has two spots for Claim Tokens, meaning that two scientists can work on the compound together and, when completed, would each score the indicated points. Of course, if one scientist puts two of their own Claim Tokens on the big compound and completes it, that scientist will score double the indicated points! It's tough to do - and that scientist is likely to have a big target on their head - but it can mean a big payout if someone takes the risk! You can learn more about the Lab Partners stretch goal in Update #3.\nOur next two stretch goals are set for $75K and $85K, and they are component upgrades to the game. We have reached the $75K AND $85K stretch goals and now it is possible for us to bump up the number of games produced which will lower production costs enough for us to include wooden player discs and a custom sticker sheet with every game! You can see what the discs will look like close up and on a Lab Table below. For more information about the next two stretch goals, please check out Update #6.\nNow we've reached $85K in funding, we can upgrade the score board! Right now, the score board is thick punchboard and still rather nice, but we can make it better, we can make it bigger - and we can make it fold!\nAnd for our final trick, we'd like to give every Kickstarter backer a little something special. We want to include something that has been Darrell's wish from the very beginning, but it's not cheap, and it's something we only wanted to offer strictly to Kickstarter backers (because it will take the MSRP of the base game too high). And, so, we introduce the $95K stretch goal - test tubes to hold the player pieces! See update #11 for more details.\n.\n\"The game flow of Compounded is pretty simple but there is a lot of strategy to it\u2026 The simplicity of the core game means that it would be great for both children and adults, but then because there are modifiers and abilities that you can level up there is a depth that makes the game more accessible to anyone who enjoys strategy gaming.\" - Scott King, Writer. Photographer. Educator. (and non-tabletop gamer)\n\"I had a blast playing this game, and can't wait to play it again. The design is very solid, and seeing the graphic design work that they've started on this, I can't wait to see how nice the final product looks.\" \u2013 Jason Tagmire, Fruitless Pursuits\n\"I loved it... I'm a fan of \"draw X blindly\" mechanics. I know it introduces a lot of luck and randomness, but I personally think it increases tension and makes for a more dramatic game, so I loved drawing for elements. Honestly, I'm not a big trading game guy. But with Compounded, I actually loved the trading mechanic. The fact that you could barter items, element placement, and elements themselves really added a fun dimension to it... I would have bought it mid-game, if I could've. That's how much I liked it.\" \u2013 Chris Copac\n\u201cAfter finishing our initial demo, I wanted to play again and employ strategies that slowly became apparent. This game also gets major points for causing my wife\u2013a biology major\u2013to completely nerd out\u2026 it\u2019s something awesome when her eyes light up over a game. Because of this, and the overall enjoyment I had playing, Compounded will almost assuredly be an insta-back when the Kickstarter campaign drops.\u201d  \u2013 Eric Leath\nKickstarter provides a platform for direct consumers to get Compounded shipped directly to their door before it hits the store shelves.

Darrell has worked tirelessly on Compounded for years, and it has evolved and gotten better and better since we were exposed to it in late 2011. After the first play, Cherilyn's nerdy heart immediately fell in love, and the rest is history.

Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another. \n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with two of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects. \n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur.

Enjoy!\nThe Welcoming Chamber\nThe Temple Caretaker and Guardian\nJing Statues -  Each of these has a different function within the temple.\nMini Screen Inserts - These are works in progress and will probably have changes made to them before release.\nThe Grande Temple of Jing is the dungeoncrawl that rules them all.

If you choose these rewards, we will work with you to create something unique. Your work will appear in the book, right along with the celebrity contributors we mentioned above!\nThe grande temple is the dungeon home of a trickster god named Jing. The archetypal trickster, he is the first of his kind in any universe. He is the god of mischief, the god of thieves and scavengers, the god of fortune and misfortune.\nIt is said that Jing stole life from the creators, shadow from the darkness, and time from the universe itself. He tricked plants and animals into giving up their secrets - then he bestowed that knowledge upon men and beasts. He has made fools of kings and gods, and taken from them their weapons, their totems, and their finest treasures. Though sometimes caught, Jing has always escaped - and gotten the better of his captors in the process. Some say that Jing is only caught when he wishes to be.\nIt is also said that one day he settled down, having stolen everything in the world that he desired to possess. Jing built a home for himself, an incredible fortress fixed somewhere between fantasy and reality. The archetypal labyrinth, it acts as both home and temple, and between its walls he has stored all the wondrous things he has acquired over the eons. Of course he has guarded these treasures with horrific beasts, deadly traps, and devious puzzles. But that's not the point. The point is that Jing invites gods and men alike to visit at any time, take whatever treasure they can win, and leave with all that they can carry.\nSo long as they can find the door that leads out.\nThe GTOJ is a no-holds-barred good old fashioned dungeon crawl. It is written in the spirit of old school RPGs, but with modern rules and sensibilities. The grande temple consists of virtually endless levels, and is full of monsters, traps, and treasures for players to discover.\nAnd oh, what treasures. Players will rush to discover some of the most powerful items ever created. Magical weapons that level up when the players do. Rings that stack. Potions that combine. It may sound a bit unblanced, but players will need these items for the challenges that lie ahead of them.\nFor players, the GTOJ represents the ultimate dungeoncrawling experience. Magic permeates the temple, and being a trickster deity, Jing weaves it for his own purposes and merriment. He is a major god and wields supreme power in his home. As a result, a room or area can contain virtually anything - and often does.\nDo your players like caves full of orcs, and classic dungeons filled with mythological monsters? The Grande Temple's got that. Do they like labyrinths set in sewers, cornfields, and maybe even a coral reef? The Grande Temple's got that too. Do they like adventures set in taverns, towns, and deep dark forests? Got it. Do they like gauntlets filled with traps, an entire level based on puzzles, or an arena where they can fight to the death? Check. Maybe they like dragons sitting on huge hoardes, undead rising from their graves, and treasures that fill them with awe. The grande temple's got that and more.\nPlayers will be enthralled by the many wonders of the grande temple and challenged by its many clever tricks. Magical puzzles, devious riddles, and wondrous magical effects will keep them entertained for hours and allow them to experience the height of dungeoncrawling fun.\nPerhaps the best example of Jing's trickery is the resurrection mechanic. You see, Jing draws great amusement from the trials of his guests. So much so that if they entertain him\u2026but die in the process\u2026he will often resurrect them so that they can continue. What does this mean to the average player? It means they can seek and find incredible treasures and artifacts - things that they normally only see in their dreams. And if they die in the search - but amuse Jing in the process - he just might grant them a do-over.\nOn a final note, it is worth pointing out that The Grande Temple of Jing allows designers to explore their imaginative side and really push the boundaries of fantasy, magic, and dungeoncrawls. We LOVE trick filled dungeons, and so do our celebrity contributors. We've armed them with the tools they need to create some FANTASTIC dungeon levels, and we've set them loose in the grande temple. We've asked them to really push the limits and design something that they could never include in a \"normal\" megadungeon. We can't wait to see what they come up with and we're ready for anything! Are YOU? Are you ready for Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, Skip Williams and the rest of our contributors - UNLEASHED???\nFor the GM, the grande temple represents the ultimate expression in dungeon design. Levels are modular, so GMs can pull them apart, rearrange them, and add their own content easily. Despite it's size, linked quests keep players moving along so that the adventure is not just a series of endless rooms. The GTOJ can be run as an epic dungeon campaign, as a group of themed dungeon levels, or even as a series of one shots. And since it's the home of a trickster god, the GM is freed up to run the game any way they choose - and even add content that would not be appropriate in any other dungeon.\nPerhaps more importantly, GMs are free to tweak the rules to suit the play style of their group. For example, they can modify the dungeon to make it more or less deadly. If the resurrection mechanic is considered too broken, it can be ignored or altered. Also, the treasure level can be set to low, medium, or high. At the high level, the game can be run \"Monty Haul\" style, allowing groups to blow away rooms full of creatures with ease. At the low level it becomes a deadly grind that will challenge even the most experienced players.\nAnd finally, the GM can set the mood of the game simply by choosing to play levels of a certain theme. Some levels are filled with beasts, others with the undead. Some levels host villages and towns, and others are little more than a gauntlet filled with traps. Whatever the mood of the group and the GM, there is a world of adventure waiting for them in the Grande Temple of Jing.\nThe format of the book is another thing that sets it apart from the everyday megadungeon. We try hard to eliminate filler text and get right to the heart of a dungeon adventure. Detailed maps, concise writing, and informative icons allow us to pack a lot of information into a small space, without losing the details you need to run the game. Each room has it's own map near it's description, so the GM can see important details at a glance, including scale, terrain, hidden objects, and initial position of creatures.\nIn fact, the GTOJ has been specifically designed so that GMs can just pick a level and jump right into the game with little or no preparation. A lot of emphasis is put on the maps themselves, because with a good map and a few notes, any GM can weave a fantastic adventure with ease.\nAnd what notes we've got. Sidebars, icons, minimaps, pullouts, box text - these are just some of the tools that are used to let the GM jump right into the adventure with almost no preparation - and keep play going for hours and hours. When the grand temple was originally released, this format got a lot of praise from fans and critics alike. With your help we'll update and improve it, and bring dungeon presentation to the 21st century.\nThe book will be at least 144 pages in size and will grow with every stretch goal. It contains at least 20 dungeon levels, one for each character level 1 through 20. It contains multiple hooks for bringing characters into the adventure, and details several different ways that they can experience it. Rules are provided for playing a gritty, standard, or Monty Haul style game. Special rules for the Dice of Fortune and Misfortune are included, allowing the GM to resolve contentious issues quickly and keep the game flowing. A special section teaches the GM how to customize the adventure to fit their own game world, play style, and gaming group. Finally, it is jam packed with bits - new monsters, cool treasures, and more random tables than you can shake a +1 stick at.\nWe have a good number of backer rewards packaged in a variety of ways. We've tried hard to come up with rewards for every budget.\nThe Grande Temple of Jing is an adventure, and so is this kickstarter. Therefore, we've themed the main goal and stretch goals to add a little fun to this endeavor. We hope you enjoy it.\nThe world is caught in winter's grasp, and you find yourself sitting around the great fire pit of your guildhall. Drinks and stories flow freely and everyone seems in good spirits. In warmer seasons you would probably be off on a mission for your guildmasters. But not today. Today you can only talk of adventures that have come and gone. Today you can only dream of adventures yet to be.\nSoon, the tales grow as long as the night, and you find yourself nodding off. As the fire dims, you listen to the story being spun by a small cloaked man that you don't recognize. His voice is hypnotic, and as you listen to it, you drift in and out of sleep.\nThe man tells a story of a strange temple far away, a labyrinth filled with endless treasures. He speaks of a god so vain that he dared all brave hearted folk to come and plunder his home - for that is what the temple truly is. And then he begins to tell of a treasure so wonderful, so magical, that you force yourself to wake up. Only then do you see that your entire guild is asleep and the man is staring straight at YOU. The fire is pulsating, giving off strange shadows and making everything seem unreal. The man smiles and drops a scroll at your feet. As you reach to pick it up, he throws a pellet to the ground. There is a flash and a bang and he is gone. Your guildmates wake up, and you tell them what happened.\nThe scroll turns out to be a map that would seem to lead directly to the Grande Temple of Jing. Your guildmaster decides it is a sign, and vows to mount an expedition.\nStretch Goal #1\nCongratulations! The expedition is successfully funded and you are a part of it! You ride in the vanguard, helping guide the expedition with your mysterious map. You travel for weeks through hills and forests before coming to a large valley in an uncharted part of the wilderness.\nYou are surprised to discover campfires dotting the valley like fireflies. It would appear that you were not the only ones to follow a map left by a strange man. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of people throughout the valley. Each group bears a map like yours, and have taken to calling it Jing's \"invitation\" to plunder his home. Like your own guild, they are eager to take him up on his offer.\nThe problem seems to be a massive set of double doors that bar entrance to the temple. They are magically sealed, and nobody has yet determined how to open them. The doors are covered in strange flowing runes, but for some reason you - and everyone else - can read them. They say\nAn elderly warrior in ornate black mail stands before the door now, his helm tucked under his arm. His face is sharp but his speech is courteous and marks him as highborn. He says he is Lord Enforcer of the Empire of Kulaiya, a place you have never heard of. He seems uninterested in knowing who you are.\n\"We've tried everything\" he spits. \"No magician here can break the spell that guards these doors and no force will open them. We've tried to understand the hidden meaning behind the glyphs, sending first one man, then two, and then ten to try the doors. Thus far our every strategy has failed.\" He looks at you with sharp blue eyes. \"Do YOU know how to open these doors?\"\nStretch Goal #2\nThe scene in front of the doors is devolving as frustration begins to take hold. A group of huge, bearlike men pushes to the front and begins to muscle people out of the way. The Kulaiyan warrior stands up to the \"Chorak\" as he calls them, but it is clear that the situation is getting out of control. Something needs to happen, and soon, or else a battle is going to break out. You look again at the flowing runes, trying to decipher them.\nThe object in the riddle has a head and a tail, so it must be a coin. Yellow sunshine probably refers to the color, which would be gold. One by two by ten is twenty, and the sound must \"ring\" for gods and men so...\"The sound of twenty golden coins\" you shout. But nothing happens. Reaching into your belt pouch you count out 20 golden coins and toss them in the air. They fall to the ground and bounce, ringing off the stones of the entryway. The runes on the doors begin to glow with an inner blue light. The coins vanish, and with a groan, the doors open. Silence falls across the valley.\nFor solving the riddle you are given the honor of being the first to enter. Before you, a long coridoor stretches into darkness. The Kulaiyan warrior thrusts a burning torch into your hand and follows you in. You both gasp. The passageway appears to be made of pure gold. As you walk along it, you can hear the Chorak bellowing behind you, fighting to decide who will enter next. But soon the sound fades away and when you turn, the entryway has vanished. Only a few others are with you. You make introductions, decide to stick together, and carry on.\nInside the temple you discover a labyrinth of immeasurable proportions. Entire races live here, stuck in some kind of balance of power. Kobolds, orcs, goblinoids, and other humanoid creatures have lived in these levels for untold generations and often bump into each other as their tribes grow. Sometimes they trade, sometimes they fight, and sometimes they hunt each other to extinction. The entire area is like a powder keg. Your arrival is like a match.\nYou fight many fierce battles and hold your own against the vicious races and horrific beasts of the grande temple. Against all odds you befriend a tribe of Hobgoblins, who tell you of a secret library that might hold a key to escaping the temple. It lies beyond a series of cursed caverns, and with their help - and sacrifice - you find it. \nYou now stand in front of an ornate oak door. It does not seem to have a lock or even a handle. A closed book is painted on it, the cover towards you, it's spine unreadable. The face of a malevolent demon leers at you from the cover. You wave your hand over the book as if turning a page - and it opens, the paint flowing across the door as the image changes. With a click the door swings open.\nInside is a small circular library, it's shelves rising high out of sight. No more than half the shelves contain books. A set of scroll racks has fallen over, dumping papers and maps all over the floor. Huge columns of books are stacked in the center of the room. The entire library is festooned with loose papers - torn up books or scrolls perhaps. What a mess. Maybe if you organize it, you can find what you need.\nStretch Goal #3\nYou set to work cleaning up the library. First, you set up the scroll racks and then begin to clear some floorspace by putting books onto shelves. Some of your companions help you. Some stand guard.\nAs you move books off the floor, you notice that they were covering up a drawing on the floor. It seems to be a crude picture, a kind of pictogram. You show your companions. One of them, a winnow named Augie tells you that he knows what it is. Augie is small, and slight - what you might call a halfling in your world. But no halfling you've met can move like Augie. His race uses the magic of speed, and he bops around you like a hummingbird as he speaks.\n\"It's a jinx. My people invented them but almost anyone can use them. You draw a picture that shows what you want to happen. And then you draw a circle around your picture, see?\"\nYou look. The image shows a book, and what looks like a ship's wheel. There is an \"X\" through the ship's wheel. Augie continues. \"Anyways, you pour a bunch of magic into it - spells and stuff, you know? And then the jinx does whatever you want.\"\n\"Whatever you want? That seems pretty powerful.\"\n\"Well sure, it is, but it isn't - see? They're only as powerful as their maker. And they can be unmade really easy. Watch.\"\nHe leans over and rubs at the jinx. \"I unmake you.\" he says. Then twice again \"I unmake you. I unmake you.\" There is a *pop* and a wave of energy shimmers out of the pictogram and through the library. Then, something magical happens.\nThe books on the floor begin to float, and soon begin to sort themselves onto the proper shelves. The scrolls and maps roll themselves up tight and reorganize themselves. The scraps of paper reconnect as they float in the air, some of them finding their way onto the scroll rack, others into books. In moments the entire library is organized.\n\"Wowee\" whistles Augie. He looks down at the Jinx. \"I get it. See the book? That means this place, this library. And that wheel thing\u2026see the X? That means to break something. So this Jinx was to break this library.\"\nHe whistles again. \"I've never seen a Jinx this powerful before. Maybe it's got extra power because we're in this temple.\"\nThe library turns out to be everything you hoped for. You find an ancient tome that tells the tales of many Honored Guests who had been trapped within the Grande Temple of Jing. In only one tale, the hero escapes, using a magic compass that always points the way home. The story ends when the hero returns, hoping to plunder the temple a second time. This time he is slain by a cursed slingstone, and buried with his treasures in the Hero's Graveyard. His name, \"Kee\" is etched upon the door of his tomb.\nIn a margin of the book, someone has written a series of numbers: 03-04-09. Your group finds a map with that number written in the top right corner. The map has strange writing in it that you translate to \"Central Gravecaves.\" The map is dotted with buildings and burial mounds. You find many other strange things in the library, including maps of lands you've never heard of, a menu from a tavern, and even a recipe for orc stew. The magic of the library does not allow you to remove any books from it, so you stay long and learn all you can. When you are ready, you head out in search of the Hero's Graveyard, in a place called the Central Gravecaves.\nOn the journey you meet a ghostly merchant that trades for goods and information. He tells you the best, and safest, route to the Gravecaves. First, you follow \"The Old Man\" an underground river that shelters a race of strange aquatic monsters. Then you run the Golden Gauntlet, a series of deathtraps that connect the Upper Levels to the Middle Levels. Before you know it, you are within a mile of the Gravecaves. A shift in the air blows a breeze through the tunnel and past your face. Even from this far away you can smell death.\nThe tunnel you have been traveling in empties into a massive cavern. It is illuminated by an unearthly green glow that seems to emanate from the stalactites high above you. The light displays a disturbing scene - a graveyard that stretches as far as the eye can see. Burial mounds and gravestones dominate the landscape, but here and there, stone sarcophagi and huge tombs break up the monotony. The dead of all the races of the upper levels have been buried here over countless generations. And somewhere, in one of these final resting places, is the Hero's Graveyard and the Tomb of Kee.\nYou begin to search. The mounds and graves are endless, but as you move through them, you begin to see patterns. There are graveyards within graveyards here, with huge areas dedicated to the different races that you have met along your journeys. Flags and banners sprout from some graves, tattered and aged, yet still showing the tribal symbols of the Lickspit Kobolds, the Gnashteeth Orcs, the Wolfbrother Goblins, and others. But nothing that would suggest the graveyard of heroes.\nYou come across an ornate fountain. Once it flowed with water but now it is bone dry and choked with dead black vines. You recall it from the map in the secret library and are able to orient your group in the direction of the Heroes Graveyard. You soon find it and it is huge. And packed. And amazing. A hodgepodge of mounds and barrows, graves and cairns, and here and there, a mausoleum. You have found the haystack. Now it's time to find the needle.\nOne of your group, a lizard person named Zaraza begins to chant and stamp her feet. Her bone shirt rattles as she casts a spell. She thrusts an arm toward a grave and the body within is instantly disentombed. It lands on its feet and stands there, a thrall waiting for instruction. Zaraza reaches inside her long lizardine mouth and breaks off one of her own teeth. As blood oozes from her mouth she steps forward and pushes the tooth into the mouth of her thrall. \u201cWe seek the tomb of Kee\u201d she hisses. \u201cYou will lead us to it.\u201d The zombie does as it\u2019s master commands. Soon you stand before a small tomb. It is a simple affair, a stone box with little to distinguish it. There is a ward carved on the door to keep out intruders. The following words are written in strange glyphs that you somehow understand.\n\"Know ye that whoever enters this tomb is doomed to eternal restlessness, and shall wander this cursed temple ever after.\"\nZaraza cackles and turns to her undead servant. \u201cEnter the tomb and bring me whatever lies within.\u201d The zombie pushes through the door and can be heard rummaging around. Before long it emerges with something in a rotted leather satchel. Zaraza takes it out and gives it to you. It is an ancient compass, tarnished but still working. Your group erupts in cheer.\nZaraza hisses \u201cSilence. Don\u2019t you feel that? Something has changed.\u201d You look around. The green light coming from the stalactites high above has subtly changed to a darker green. And some of them are starting to change to a dull purple hue. \u201cLook there\u201d Zaraza spits. Skeletal hands are beginning to erupt from the graves around you. They are everywhere.\nStretch Goal #4\nThe Story  \nDue to limits set by Kickstarter, the story cannot be completed in this space.

Plot and story have been worked out collaboratively in the private Open Design forum. The dwarves are a hard-working group, whose mining of adamantine lured them ever-deeper and whose pursuit of ore led them into dangerous territory. The vertical dungeon goes from the depths of the earth through the great halls and works of a vanished clan, up to a snowy mountaintop spire and an (optional) airship dock.\nEstimated delivery: September 2013.\nStretch Goal #2 - Successful!\nOnce $110,000 is raised, all backers at the Pack Hunter pledge level and higher will receive access to the Blood Drive Trilogy for Deadlands (Savage Worlds) from Pinnacle.\nThe Blood Drive series is a complete campaign. Each adventure starts and ends in such a fashion that if you want to use it by itself without the others in the series, you can easily do so. In fact, they\u2019re perfect for getting a posse from one part of the Weird West to another if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, Marshal. Used together, the three combine to take the heroes from greenhorn cowpunchers to hardened trail hands fighting for their cattle, their land, and even their lives!\nEstimated delivery: August 2013.\nStretch Goal #3 - Successful!\nOnce $130,000 is raised, all backers at the Timber Wolf pledge level and higher will receive access to The Blight, an upcoming Adventure Path for Pathfinder from Frog God Games. Richard Pett\u2019s Twisted City - The Blight, is planned to be 12 districts of a city with 12 adventures, providing an Adventure Path with 12 meaty installments.\nBetween is a temptation too great for some; a land of plenty (and danger) on the doorstep, rich in possible wealth and with the draw of Between Vessels\u2014curious objects that retain memories, feelings and even souls\u2014the reasons for venturing into the land are numerous, and have drawn many. The Illuminati, using the funds of the royal family, have struck again and again into this new empire, and those very incursions threaten to undo the Blight. Constant incursions into Between from the Blight have weakened the fabric of the wall that separates the two places. There are those who wish the levee to break, who would revel in the chaos and madness of life and souls that would happen should a fracture burst and a tidal wave of Between pour into the city. There are also those who have a conscience, who oppose the Illuminati and the royal family as much as they safely can in the face of such power. They know nothing about the levee, but they have their suspicions. And into this world come the PCs\u2026\nEstimated delivery: October 2013 and ongoing for 12 months.\nStretch Goal #4 - Successful!\nOnce $145,000 is raised, all backers at the Pack Hunter pledge level and higher will receive access to the Pirate's Guide to Freeport from Green Ronin Publishing.\nFreeport is Green Ronin's signature city setting and has been home to thousands of RPG campaigns since its launch in 2000. Classic fantasy elements, cruel-hearted pirates, and Lovecraftian horror come together in the rum-fueled metropolis known as the City of Adventure. Now a new era is beginning. The Pirate's Guide to Freeport is the definitive new sourcebook for the City of Adventure, set 5 years after the events of the original Freeport Trilogy. This is a pure setting book, focusing entirely on the people, places, politics, and perils of Freeport and containing no game statistics of any kind. The Pirate's Guide to Freeport can thus be used with any fantasy RPG.\nThe Freeport Companion for FATE and at least one other game system will also be included, detailing cultists, pirates, serpent people, and much more.\nEstimated delivery: September 2013.\nStretch Goal #5 - Successful!\nOnce $165,000 is raised, all backers at the Timber Wolf pledge level and higher will receive fully integrated access to the Razor Coast, an upcoming campaign for Pathfinder from Frog God Games. Razor Coast is the long anticipated Caribe-Polynesian flavored, Age of Sail swashbuckling RPG campaign envisioned and designed by Nicolas Logue. It has been praised for its ambitious and original design, its epic flavor and its lurid, full-color art \u2013 including a cover by the award winning Wayne Reynolds. Logue tapped a team of veteran designers to help develop and write Razor Coast, including Lou Agresta, Adam Daigle, Tim Hitchcock, and John Ling. Razor Coast isn\u2019t just an adventure, it\u2019s part setting, part adventure path, and part toolkit to build your own unique campaign. It\u2019s non-linear and will never play the same way twice.\n\nEstimated delivery: September 2013.\nSpecial Stretch Goal - The Pursuit of 2,000\nThis stretch goal is completely independent of the dollar-based objectives above and instead tied to the total number of backers we achieve. If we hit 2,000 backers or more, regardless of the dollars raised, every backer at the Timber Wolf level and higher will receive a free Hero Lab gift license! This is a license you can give to someone else in your gaming group, or you're welcome to be greedy and use it for yourself. :)\nWhy are we doing this? We've received numerous requests to offer Hero Lab licenses in conjunction with the Kickstarter. We didn't want to do that originally because Realm Works is game system neutral, while Hero Lab only supports specific games. But we're now in stretch goal territory and we want everyone to know we've been listening! So we're going out on a limb and offering something big if we can hit an admittedly big target. The Hero Lab license itself is a $30 value, and combined with all the other great stuff at the Tiimber Wolf level, this will be a steal for everyone who backs at that level or higher.\nFor those of you who don't play games that Hero Lab supports, we're providing you with a gift license. This means you can freely give the license to a friend (or an enemy, if you prefer) that does play those games. And if you can get a little quid pro quo in return for the license, we're cool with that. At the present time, the list of games that Hero Lab supports includes: Pathfinder, Shadowrun, D&D 3.5, D&D 4E, Savage Worlds, Mutants & Masterminds (2E & 3E), Call of Cthulhu, and World of Darkness.\nFor backers who have selected the $100 optional extra that includes a Hero Lab license, we will add a new $70 option once we eclipse the 2,000 backer threshold. This will allow you to lower your pledge and use the free license for yourself if you wish. However, that new option won't be made available until we actually reach 2,000 backers. You are also welcome to give away the additional license as a gift.\nEstimated delivery: March 2013\nSummary of Rewards\nBelow is a summary of all additional rewards provided to each of the various pledge levels. See the \"Additional Details on Rewards and Extras\" section further below for more information.\nCheck Out These Additional Videos!\nBasic Content via Topics. Topics encompass the people, places, things, and events of your world. This video shows how easy it is to establish a Topic and flesh out its details. We build an NPC as an example, and demonstrate how information about the NPC can be established in multiple ways. The video highlights the ability to incorporate external elements, like images or Hero Lab portfolios, into the Topics you\u2019re creating. The functionality around establishing tags for your content and Realm Works\u2019 sophistication at automatically creating links are also on display. Finally, we show how you can disclose individual elements of your topics to your players.\n\nStory-Driven Content. Realm Works offers unique capabilities to weave your story and content together as you evolve your world. Your ability to manage plots and storylines in a visual manner to accomplish this is highlighted in the video. We demonstrate the ease with which you can create a plot and establish its content. We also highlight how links are created and the use of plots while you\u2019re playing the game to quickly move to relevant content.\n\nLeveraging Maps. Maps in Realm Works provide powerful functionality for navigating through your world and can be revealed incrementally to your players as they journey across it. This video focuses on how you can use maps as a navigation tool and instantly access needed content. We show how easy it is to place pins on maps to represent places of interest, like a location or an encounter, and associate them with the relevant content. Finally, we show the power of our Fog of World\u2122 technology and incrementally revealing content to your players using maps as an example.\n\n\nRead a review from the award-winning GMs at Gnome Stew.\nPowerful Image Functionality\nWhat Makes Realm Works Unique\nUnlike many software Kickstarters, initial Realm Works development is nearly complete. We've been evolving Realm Works for over three years and will be releasing it in July, 2013. Numerous features are already in place, as we demonstrate in the video, but there are many more we want to include in the initial release.  Your support of this Kickstarter will allow us to accelerate our current development efforts so we can pack more features into the product in time for its public release. \nOur mission with Realm Works is to streamline and improve the tabletop role-playing experience for both GMs and players by empowering GMs to create, manage, and share any world they can imagine. We're doing this in four ways:\nFirst, provide tools for GMs to efficiently create and assemble materials for their games in a way that's simple to manage, organize, and search.\nSecond, let GMs reveal content to players as it's uncovered during play, without introducing extra work for the GM.\nThird, enable GMs to share their creations and smoothly integrate the work of others into their own material, weaving it all together into their campaign.\nFinally, provide a community repository where additional material can be obtained and easily integrated with any other content you have, including the GM's own creations, letting GMs build their games from whatever sources they find compelling or interesting.\nFlexible Topic Organization\nKey Realm Works Features\nAs we demonstrate in our video, Realm Works lets you manage your RPG content in one unified environment. This includes all the people, places, things, and events of your world. Beyond just text, it encompasses pictures and maps, custom calendars, dates tied to those calendars, statblocks, Hero Lab portfolios, audio and video files, and a wealth of other material. Realm Works weaves all this content together through a simple, intuitive interface.\nRealm Works provides many powerful features and capabilities which are shown in the video, in images on this page, and on our web site.  Everything shown is from the current version of Realm Works, which is in the hands of our Beta team right now.  Here's a summary of the most important features:\nQuickly develop new content and revise existing ideas for any genre (e.g. fantasy, sci-fi, modern) and any play style.\nEffortlessly manage diverse content, including images, maps, Hero Lab portfolios, statblocks, audio, video, and virtually anything else.\nIntuitively organize content for on-demand access and review during play, placing everything at your fingertips for quick and easy retrieval. No more leafing through pages of notes to find the information you need!\nDetermine exactly what information is known by the players and what remains hidden at a glance.\nWith our patent-pending Fog of World\u2122 technology, Realm Works makes it a breeze to incrementally reveal and display every aspect of your world to players, requiring only a single mouse click.  Revolutionize how you share your world with your players, easily showing them only what they learn during the game.\nThe incremental reveal of maps makes it trivial to illustrate to players what has or has not been explored or discovered.\nConnections between your content are automatically detected and created, allowing instant access to all the interconnected elements of your world.\nFlexible navigation tools let you instantly view any aspect of your world as easily as browsing the internet.\nTrack and visualize all the relationships that exist between selected content in your world.  Realm Works makes it easy to manage secret identities, view relationship diagrams like family trees, and even track attitudes between or among NPCs or characters.  Keeping track of hidden schemes, subterfuge, and actual motivations behind the scenes has never been easier.\nImmediately see what the players learned during a particular span of time.  You can find exactly what was learned during the last game session, making recaps before the next session fast and accurate.  You can even view a summary of everything the players have learned during the entire campaign, even if it spans many real-life years, and instantly access the details associated with that content.\nFull text search instantly locates what you need, and you can tag any content you wish and leverage the tag for filtering your content.  This is extremely powerful in conjunction with Realm Works\u2019 cross-linking capabilities, allowing instant access to the content you seek.\nPlace pins on maps to indicate significant locations, events or encounters. Use these maps for navigation to immediately access the information associated with individual pins.\nFully customizable templates get you started building your world immediately and let you smoothly organize diverse information about all the people, places, things, and events in your world.\nEnter your own original content just like a word processor or efficiently cut-and-paste from source material you already possess.\nAt a glance, see all the connections for whatever you\u2019re viewing, both to and from other content. Instantly see everything that references an important NPC or item.\nWeave the critical story elements of your world together and visually outline your plots, whether they are epic quests or minor story arcs.\nCreate custom calendars for your world. Link multiple calendars together and see how all the dates translate to your master calendar.  Calendars can reflect different in-game cultures, lunar calendars, and worlds.\nConveniently manage game notes and preparation tasks with full linking to game content.\nEasily show material to players during and after play without having to create additional, separate materials for them.\nVisualize Your Plots\nRealm Works also includes \u201cIsle of Kandril\u201d, a complete setting created by Super Genius Games and available only with Realm Works.  This fantasy-based setting is compatible with Pathfinder and other fantasy game systems.  Use it \u201cas-is\u201d, easily customize it to fit your world, or simply leverage it as a guide to create your own dynamic settings.\nWhat We Will Do With Your Support\nAs we indicated above, initial Realm Works development is nearly complete, with release slated for July, 2013.  This Kickstarter will allow us to accelerate our current development efforts and pack more features into the product for its public release. \nThe key capabilities to benefit most from this Kickstarter are the cloud server and community repository components. Critical features of these two components include:\nFull player access to revealed aspects of the world and the ability to download or review anything they\u2019ve learned about the world.  Our Fog of World technology governs the information that players can access, limiting them to only what they\u2019ve learned through play.\nGMs can share their creations through the cloud for use by others.\nGMs can browse the work of others and integrate it into their own worlds. Imagine being able to find a pre-made encounter, or a tavern, or an entire region with adventures and NPCs. Drop it into your own world, change a few names, hook it into locations in your world, and it\u2019s fully integrated for use. No scribbled notes.  No Post-Its.  No juggling between PDFs, books, and your own files. Realm Works is built from the ground up for exactly this purpose.\nSecure cloud backup of all material for GMs.\nSynchronization of different computers to the cloud, with automatic change detection and resolution.\nWe\u2019ll also leverage your support to further refine the overall user experience and enhance the feature set offered by Realm Works.  \n\nOf course, if we exceed our funding goal, we'll be able to accomplish even more through stretch goals to be announced. There are many additional major features we want to add that will make Realm Works invaluable to virtually all GMs.\nAs you can imagine, we won't be able to achieve all this without your help, so please tell your friends about Realm Works and have them check out this Kickstarter as well!\nManage Your Story's Relationships\nMore Information\nWe've provided additional information on several podcasts.  In these interviews, you can hear more about how Realm Works will enhance game preparation, how it can be used during your games, and some of the pain points we'll solve for GMs.  You can also hear how we envision the cloud and community repository being leveraged.  These interviews feature our very own Colen McAlister (the Scots Wolf):\nThe D6 Generation (Colen's interview starts at around the 2:05 mark.)\nGeekerati Radio.  (The first part of the interview focuses on Hero Lab, and the Realm Works discussions starts about halfway through the conversation.)\nThe Demiplane of Gaming #15: Realm Works - Streamlined RPG Campaign Tools\nChronicles Live Episode #2\nOptions and Extras\nYou can add to your rewards, or pick up something for a friend!  There are a number of options available:\nHow it works! \nSimply increase your pledge to include whichever extras you desire. When you change your pledge, make sure you add the total for the extras (plus any international shipping as noted) to your original pledge value. At the end of the Kickstarter, we'll prepare a survey that lets you indicate what option(s) you'd like for the additional pledge.\nAdditional Details on Rewards and Extras\nRealm Works Developer Blog - You'll receive a monthly update around the middle of the month with developer updates on Realm Works.  These updates will be more detailed than our general newsletter updates, and you'll get the information before we announce it to the public!  A true insider's view of Realm Works and its march to public release.\nPersonal Avatar Icon - You'll be able to personalize your Realm Works account!  If you choose this additional reward, you'll be able to provide us with your own icon that can be used in conjunction with your Realm Works account rather than selecting one of the standard avatars.  Dimensions required for your Avatar will be specified prior to the release of Realm Works.  Artwork is subject to review and approval by Lone Wolf Development.\nRealm Works T-shirt - You'll receive the official Realm Works supporter t-shirt if you choose this additional reward.  Shipping to any address in the U.S. is included; international backers please add $10 for shipping.\nNew Pathfinder Add-ons for Hero Lab - If you choose this additional reward, all the new data package add-ons for Pathfinder we release in 2013 will be added to your existing Hero Lab license.  If you don't already own Hero Lab, you can select the reward that entitles you to these new add-ons, as well as to a copy of Hero Lab and our add-on for the \"Advanced Player's Guide\" for Pathfinder. (Please Note: The add-ons provided through this reward do not include those released on behalf of third-party publishers. It is limited to add-ons for Paizo products only.)\nNever Unprepared: The Complete Game Master\u2019s Guide to Prep. From award-winning author Phil Vecchione of Gnome Stew, this guide will help you prepare for games faster, avoid common pitfalls, and have more fun in the process. Described as \u201cPhil Vechionne\u2019s epic rock ballad to game prep\u201d, we\u2019ll be weaving this meaty treatise into Realm Works, allowing you to leverage the wisdom therein like never before.\nAll Backers who choose the Pack Member ($35 pledge) or higher reward tier will receive the material from Never Unprepared (a $9.95 value) fully integrated into Realm Works and absolutely free!\nMasks: 1,000 Memorable NPCs for Any Roleplaying Game. This is the ultimate NPC resource written by the award-winning authors of Gnome Stew. In fact, Masks won the 2012 Gold ENnie Award for Best Aid/Accessory, and was also nominated for Product of the Year. Within this weighty tome, you\u2019ll find NPCs for fantasy, science fiction and modern games, all easily adaptable to any genre and any RPG, just like Realm Works! Every one of these NPCs will be re-created within Realm Works and available for instant use within your campaigns. Each NPC has a role and specific traits, so you\u2019ll be able to quickly locate exactly what you need through Realm Works' powerful search capabilities.\nAll Backers who choose the Pack Hunter ($50 pledge) or higher reward tier will receive all 1,000 NPCs from Masks (a $16.95 value) fully integrated into Realm Works at no charge!\nEureka: 501 Adventure Plots to Inspire Game Masters. Written by nine veteran game masters, all authors on Gnome Stew, Eureka is more than simple adventure seeds. As you know, adventure hooks alone don\u2019t give you much to work with, but fully developed adventures can be hard to personalize and fit into an on-going game. Eureka strikes a great middle ground, providing the main ingredients and letting you decide how to prepare them. This highly regarded material includes plot hooks to draw your players into the adventure, as well as encounters to flesh them out.\nEureka contains plots for fantasy, science fiction and horror games and they are easily adaptable to multiple genres. We\u2019re building these plots into Realm Works for you so you can quickly tailor them to your purposes and seamlessly weave them into your campaign. Each plot will be tagged with suitable keywords, such as \u201cintrigue\u201d, \u201cexploration\u201d, \u201ccombat-heavy\u201d, and many more. Consequently, it will be easy to find what you need and leverage it within Realm Works.\nAll Backers who choose the Timber Wolf ($65 pledge) or higher reward tier will receive all 501 plots from Eureka (a $16.95 value) fully integrated into Realm Works for free!\nThe Grande Temple of Jing.  It is said that Jing, the trickster god, stole life from the creators, shadow from the darkness, and time from the universe itself. He tricked plants and animals into giving up their secrets - then he bestowed that knowledge upon men and beasts. He has made fools of kings and gods, and taken from them their weapons, their totems, and their finest treasures. \nIt is also said that one day he settled down, having stolen everything in the world that he desired to possess. Jing built a home for himself, an incredible fortress fixed somewhere between fantasy and reality. The archetypal labyrinth, it acts as both home and temple, and between its walls he has stored all the wondrous things he has acquired over the eons. Of course, he has guarded these treasures with horrific beasts, deadly traps, and devious puzzles. But that's not the point. The point is that Jing invites gods and men alike to visit at any time, take whatever treasure they can win, and leave with all that they can carry. So long as they can find the door that leads out!\nCheck out the incredible line-up of talent behind this dungeon: Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, Ed Greenwood, Dave Gross, Chris Pramas, Skip Williams, Matt Mayfield, Jim Ward, Larry Wilhelm, and Stan! have all contributed to this amazing project. Even Grimtooth the Troll has a role.\nAll Backers who choose the Timber Wolf ($65 pledge) or higher reward tier will receive this challenging temple fully integrated into Realm Works at no charge!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has risks, and software projects are notorious for delays. The key difference for Realm Works is that most of the work on Realm Works has already been completed, so there\u2019s virtually no risk to product delivery.\n\nLone Wolf Development has been at the forefront of developing tabletop gaming software for over a decade. Our first product, Army Builder, had a profound impact on the tabletop miniatures arena and still reigns as the industry standard against which all other roster construction tools are compared. For RPGs, our Hero Lab product has won two ENnie Awards for Best Game Aid and is the most complete and powerful character management software for game systems including Pathfinder, Shadowrun, and many more. With Realm Works, we're simply taking things up another notch, and, as you can see in our video, we're already close to completion.\n\nAs with any software project, there is a chance that the release of Realm Works could be delayed, either due to problems on our part (a delay in hiring additional staff, for example) or because additional functionality is needed before the product is ready. This could impact the release of Realm Works to the public.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that we could face unexpected challenges in building Realm Works\u2019 cloud capabilities. Building a multi-user server system is a lot of work and involves a lot of complexity. However, we've spent a lot of time coming up with a solid design for this, and have good tools to build it, so we\u2019re confident that we can make this happen.\n\nWith your support, we can put the last building blocks in place and bring Realm Works to gamers everywhere!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #104", "update_userinfo": "Blight Replacements", "update_content": "It's time to check your Realm Works accounts for new goodies! \nEveryone at the Wolflair has been hard at work ensuring the many kinks and bugs are worked through to bring you the Content Market and we\u2019re happy to say we\u2019re finally reaching the end.

It has been praised for its ambitious and original design, its epic flavor and its lurid, full-color art \u2013 including a cover by the award winning Wayne Reynolds.\nLogue tapped a team of veteran designers to help develop and write Razor Coast, including Lou Agresta, Adam Daigle, Tim Hitchcock, and John Ling. Razor Coast isn\u2019t just an adventure, it\u2019s part setting, part adventure path, and part toolkit to build your own unique campaign. It\u2019s non-linear and will never play the same way twice.\nWe filled it with corrupt municipal Dragoons, dastardly smuggling rings, weresharks \u2013 lots of weresharks - desperate naval battles, oppressed tribes craving heroes, witches, cursed islands, legendary treasure troves, an impending apocalypse or two, demon pirates, retired assassins, undead worms, gator men, failed heroes waiting to be redeemed, dark conspiracies brewing in the oceans depths, vengeful ghosts\u2026oh \u2013 and mutating cannibal pygmies. Who doesn\u2019t like those?\nThe final book will be delivered in 100% full color, tightly bound with our infamous stitched-bound hardcovers -- or secured by genuine leather covers for our serious collector. Our goal is to raise $75,000 for the additional costs to authors, artists, the printing it takes to finish the project, and similar costs -- and lastly, to create the Player's Guide. We have grander plans for Razor Coast and will reveal them with Bonus Goals.\nVisit our website for all the sneak peeks, inside looks, and interviews\nRead More About Fire As She Bears\nFire As She Bears is available in Pathfinder Roleplaying System and Swords & Wizardry. You may add it on to any pledge level for $15 Print & PDF or $7 for PDF Only. (Shipping may apply to $5 pledges or PDF only pledges for print copies.)\nFrog God Games is pleased to announce that we will be adding an adventure to the book written by one of the giants of the industry (as a bonus to all of you who buy the main book or back the project here on Kickstarter).\nMore content!\nFrank Mentzer, long a part of the game industry has offered to help us with Razor Coast. This is particularly inspiring to all of us here in Frog Land, as it merges the old and the new into one great package. Frank is near and dear to us old folks as he was one of the originals that created the game, and thus spawned our Swords & Wizardry line. For all the Pathfinder fans out there, Frank is one of the named developers working with Paizo and Goblinworks as part of their superstar lineup for the Emerald Spire MMO . Frank has been one of the writers to connect the two worlds of OSR work and Pathfinder, and we are glad to have him writing for us!\nFrank Mentzer is an Old School gamer best known for writing five D&D rule sets (Basic, Expert, Companion, Masters, and Immortals) and other D&D products with his friend and co-author Gary Gygax. Frank was at TSR from 1980 to 1986 and is one of the best-selling authors in the history of the industry, with tens of millions of copies of his works published during that era. His other creations include the legendary Temple of Elemental Evil (with Gygax) and the game version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. He won the title of #1 Dungeon Master (1980) and an Origins Award for GameMaster Secrets II (1993). Frank has been a game auctioneeer at the world's largest game auction (at GenCon, the world's largest game convention, of course) for almost 30 years. He responds to Q&A message boards on multiple sites. Frank spent the last two decades in other business but, now that he's 'retired' (over 60), recently started this new publishing company, \"Eldritch Enterprises\", with Tim Kask and Jim Ward (both 'founding fathers' of the game industry in the 1970s) and Chris Clark (of Inner City Games).\nIndulgences\nSecond, we are converting all 8 of the original Razor Coast Indulgence expansions to Pathfinder and Swords and Wizardry.

This Necromancer Games product (eidition 3.5) runs 200 pages and is a treasury of nautical lore. No place offers more adventure than the ocean. No dungeon is as deep, no jungle as full of exotic and dangerous life. Most folk spend their entire lives on dry ground, unaware that entire civilizations thrive beneath the waves, sometimes far more ancient and steeped in mystery than any on the world's upper surface. Though player characters (PCs) have long grown familiar with the air-breathing world above, seldom do they venture into the depths, and when they do, they discover wonders they never dreamed existed. The ocean offers a venue for adventure that is at once alien and appealing. Strange things exist down there, as perilous as they are compelling.\n\nDead Man's Chest lays bare the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. Within these pages are detailed rules for ship movement, as well as guidelines for underwater exploration, and three complete maritime adventures. This comprehensive source for sailing is sea-packed with over 100 new magic items, monsters, feats, prestige classes, and spells. Plus get a bonus NOW to accompany Dead Man's Chest\u2122.

Maybe you've heard of this beautiful, awesome game that's making the rounds.  Maybe you just followed a link that somebody retweeted and you have no idea what I'm talking about.  Well!\nFirst there was The Vicious Crucible of Verdigris Valley, a free, full-color game full of pretty art, that anyone could download and play.  Folks took the disgraced guardsman Alistair and the half-breed guide Anise through the tumultuous events of Kamraan's invasion and siege of Fort Verdigris. Then there was The Vicious Crucible of the Eburnean Tower, which was kickstarted by folks who wanted to see more.  Once funded, that also became a free download for everyone to enjoy.  Players took up the roles of the fledgling wizards Beulah and Carles, as well as the rest of the fractious, powerful sorcerers of the Eburnean Tower, and saw the place valiantly defended or burned to the ground.\nNow it's time to venture into The Vicious Crucible of Villa Argentate, and the question is: which side of the Silver City will we see?\nYou Decide\nWhen you back this project, you get a vote on the character and flavor of Villa Argentate, a prosperous trading city between Verdigris Valley and the Eburnean Tower.  Is it full of scheming manipulators striking deals and betraying each other's trust?  Or is it plagued by cut-throats and thieves, themselves embroiled in a war for the underworld?  Or is it a city of artisans and craftsmen, creating the finest works\u2026 and competing over the best designs and the most precious materials?\nThe character of the Silver City will determine which rulesheet gets used with it.  If the vote goes to the scheming and dealing, the Influence rulesheet will be included.  If the backers want the underworld, the Theivery rulesheet will ship.  And if you fine folk want to see artisans, well then, you'll be served up a hot cup of Crafting rulesheet.\nAnd of course, no matter which rulesheet gets added in Villa Argentate, the Sorcery and Combat rulesheets from Verdigris Valley and Eburnean Tower will also work with the explosive situation brewing in the Silver City.\nIf you'd like to see what sort of thing we're talking about, here, take a look at Verdigris Valley or Eburnean Tower right now.  They're free for the taking.\nWhat Is Vicious Crucible?\nVicious Crucible games are a line of situation-first roleplaying games that put the player characters into a brutal web of relationships, obligations, and events. The only way out is through, and the only way through requires a painful transformation into something new. You might start the game as a half-breed wilderness guide trying to find a place to call home and come out the other end as a conquering warrior princess. Your retiring changeling historian might become an inhuman monster wreaking havoc in the name of vengeance. Or your travelling merchant might\u2026 well, you get the picture!\n\u2026And It's Free\nAll Vicious Crucible games are released as a free download under Creative Commons licensing. I use a \"ransom model\" for funding the project: once generous backers help us meet our Kickstarter threshold, I publish the game for everyone to enjoy.\nI've added one little twist to the basic ransom model: the Franchise.  Backers like you tell me which way to go in developing the game line by voting for which game \u2014 and which new rulesheet \u2014 you want to see most. Whichever game gets the most votes is the one I publish next.\nSo the question is: which game do you want to see next?\nPost Actual Play, Get Stuff!\nWhen you post an Actual Play report\u2014describing your experience playing any of the Vicious Crucibles\u2014on a blog or forum or what-have-you and shoot me a link here in comments, I'll bump you a backer tier for free!\nKicking It Forward\nThis project participates in the \"Kicking It Forward\" initiative.

All the charts needed to run the setting, along with stunning art that forms a 3-panel front. (Est Date: June 2013)\nAt this goal, the GM Screen Inserts are unlocked for Living Dead Hunter and above.\n$8,000:  A 30,000 word novella for World of the Dead authored by BEN MONROE (One of the Living, for AFMBE from Eden Studios). (Est Date: June 2013)\nAt this goal, both the Novella and GM Screen Inserts are unlocked for Living Dead Bait and above.\n$10,000:  Custom World of the Dead Bennies designed by Aaron Acevedo! These are 10 gram, fully designed poker chips from completely blank manufacturing templates. Each set will contain 12 Bennies! (Est Date: July 2013)\nAt this goal, the World of the Dead Bennies are unlocked for Bounty Hunter and above.\nAdditionally, everyone Living Dead Food and above gets the GM Screen Inserts, and all pledge levels get the Novella.\n$13,000:  A set of dice with a custom World of the Dead d6. The dice are unlocked for Bounty Hunter and above. (Est Date: July 2013)\nAdditionally, the Custom Bennies are unlocked for Living Dead Hunter and above.\n$16,000:  Daring Entertainment will release the Hellbrood Plot Point Campaign Setting, detailing the super-heroic event as alien invaders determined to eradicate all life in the universe turn Earth into a zombie apocalypse.\nHellbrood uses both the Savage Worlds RPG and the Super Powers Companion from Pinnacle Entertainment, and comes complete with new Edges, new Hindrances, Setting Rules, full details on Hellbrood New York, Super-Villains and Heroes, and details on the Necroleans and their universal conquest. The Plot Point campaign and Savage Tales will take the player-heroes from Novice rank all the way to Legendary, at which time they'll face the ancient power behind the Hellbrood in a final battle to save the universe and restore the Earth (see the FAQ for more information).\nAt this level, the Hellbrood campaign setting is unlocked for Bounty Hunter and above in an exclusive hardcover format. (Est Date: October 2013)\nAdditionally, the World of the Dead dice become unlocked for Living Dead Hunter and above.\nWe have more Stretch Goals waiting as well, with further unlocks for various pledge levels. We'll reveal more as the time comes!\nFAQ\nHow much of World of the Dead is already done?\nCurrently, some of the book has been written by Lee F. Szczepanik, Jr., and the campaign has completed play test. The Kickstarter will allow us to get the writers moving on their parts, get the artists to work, and get the book released.\nWhen will production start on the book?\nThe freelance staff will be given the green light to begin the same day the funding goal is reached. Even if the Kickstarter still has time remaining to achieve its Stretch Goals, the very day the total reaches $5,000 is the same day the remaining production begins.\nWhen will World of the Dead release?\nBarring any significant delays, below are the expected dates for the World of the Dead and rewards.\nAs soon as payment is transfered to us: War of the Dead Chapter set PDFs, The Paper Dead, Hellbrood: Countdown to Invasion PDF\nMarch 2013: War of the Dead hardcover editions, Hellbrood: Countdown to Invasion softcover edition.\nJune 2013: World of the Dead PDF, Exclusive adventure PDFs, War of the Dead Alternate beginning PDF.\nJuly 2013: World of the Dead hardcover, World of the Dead adventure trilogy softcover, War of the Dead alternate beginning softcover. This gives us time to get them printed and shipped to us, and then packaged and shipped to you.\nKeep in mind with the above dates that it is also quite possible the books could be released early, it just isn't anything we can promise at this stage.\nWhat are the exclusive World of the Dead adventures about?\nNaturally, we aren't about to give away spoilers. The adventures are self-contained, but also have an overall theme that connects them into a trilogy. As a trilogy, they reveal a secret about the setting and some other facets of what is going on.\nWe understand that not everyone can back a Kickstarter, however, and want to assure all you folks that while the adventures provide an extra layer to the setting, those that can't back the project and get the exclusives will not be at a disadvantage.\nWhat can you tell us about the playable Living Dead?\nThe playable Living Dead are an evolution of Evelyn and Johnnie, two experimental Living Dead introduced in War of the Dead: Chapter Four. As can be expected, something went horribly wrong between then and now, and their version of the infection was able to spread.\nMuch like the GMs can do with the NPCs, players will be given options to further customize their playable Living Dead.\nOf course, how these Living Dead fit into survivor society is an entirely different matter covered in the book and at your table.\nAre the Savage Tales for the Living Dead General pledge level in place of the Savage Tales you guys would be writing?\nNot at all. We will still be doing the Plot Point Campaign and the near 30 Savage Tales traditionally associated with a Savage Worlds setting. The Savage Tales we work with you to create will contain a By Line, clearly displaying that not only did you write the tale, but that it is in addition to the expected amount of content from us.\nThe Create a Savage Tale bonus is to allow you to add your own mark on the setting for everyone to enjoy, not do our work for us.\nWhat is the section in the hardcover on War of the Dead's design evolution?\nLee F. Szczepanik, Jr. has spoken often that War of the Dead went through different permutations before the version everyone has come to know was released. But what were those changes, and what might War of the Dead (and World of the Dead) have been instead?\nIn the Kickstarter Exclusive section of World the Dead, Lee F. Szczepanik, Jr. goes through each chapter of War of the Dead, focusing on those adventures that were originally intended to go a different way, and explains what changed before release and why.\nFor example, did you know that War of the Dead was originally to include vampires? Where were the vampires originally to appear in the campaign? What influence on the overall story and the origin of the Living Dead would they have played? How would the chapters and adventures have gone had the vampires made it into the final version?\nWhat is the War of the Dead alternate beginning?\nWar of the Dead currently starts on the Pinnacle cruise ship, and was a great way to bring the players together by hitting them with the outbreak in a confined space and in the middle of the ocean.\nHowever, Lee F. Szczepanik, Jr., has also mentioned a different beginning to the saga that started in a major city. This version is a 6-part miniseries that starts the characters off in a very different situation, involving mass panic and confusion, military quarantine, and introduces Hell Fuerrie and his gang in a different way. The alternate beginning links with the established Chapter One (Week 7) Adventure, with GM notes on how to adjust a couple of NPC reactions in Week 7 to account for the new back story of the player-characters.\nIf I don't back the Kickstarter, can I still get the book?\nWorld of the Dead will be released in PDF through OneBookShelf, and in softcover through our partnership with Chronicle City (providing, of course, the funding goal is reached), after the Kickstarter backers get their copies. The retail version will not contain the essay on the evolution of War of the Dead's design.\nIs Hellbrood part of the same setting?\nHellbrood is not part of the War/World of the Dead setting. Hellbrood is Daring Entertainment's super-hero/zombie style apocalypse setting for Savage Worlds, and uses the Super Powers Companion. It's included in the Kickstarter because it fits with the general zombie theme, and is something we would love to get out to you.\nHellbrood is inspired by things like DC Comics' Blackest Night, Peter Clines' Ex-Heroes and Ex-Patriots, and similar works. It is a super-hero setting at its core, where Earth has become the target of an alien race determined to eradicated all life in the universe. Using advanced biotechnology, they create the dreaded Hellbrood\u2014 a form of Living Dead. Not even the super-powered community is completely immune.\nThe heroes not only have to save Earth from the invaders and the Hellbrood, but must also contend with the super-villains moving to take advantage of the apocalypse.\nBy the end of the plot point campaign, the heroes will have a chance to battle the powerful evil behind the invasion and the Hellbrood, and restore the Earth. But the setting doesn't end there. The super-heroic line for Savage Worlds will then branch off into new and different plot point campaigns, including alternate dimensions, time travel, and more. Several of those future campaigns have their seeds planted in Hellbrood: Countdown to Invasion and the Hellbrood setting book.\nHellbrood has already launched in PDF with the six-adventure miniseries book, Hellbrood: Countdown to Invasion (with material by Clint Black), and the free adventure, Hellbrood Ultimate Agenda. There have also been two 1,500 word stories published for Hellbrood in the FREE Savage Insider #4 (Datafile 5.07.3, Subject: Mimeo) and Savage Insider #5 (Flesh Games) that give a look into the setting.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're raising funds to finish work on the book and get it into your hands. Although stand-alone, it also combines with War of the Dead to form a massive storyline that takes the group from the first days of the Outbreak, and to humanity's last hope several years later.\n\nWe've published close to 60 RPG products over the past six years (including hitting every release date for all 52 parts of War of the Dead), and remain dedicated to getting World of the Dead and the pledge rewards to you on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "New Emails", "update_content": "Please be aware that due to the sheer amount of SPAM some email boxes were receiving, we have changed some of them to slightly new email addresses.

We are showing the videogame industry that there's a place for a fantasy sandbox MMO, FUNDED BY ITS PLAYERS.\nThis is history-making stuff here, people.  And you are a part of it.\nThe Last Daily Deal!\nThis is the Daily Deal for today.  Everyone who backed the project from 10:00am today on will receive a copy of this item!\nHere is the complete list of Daily Deals.  If you're curious how to get access to the items you missed, read the \"Adventurer and Crowdforger Reward Bonus - Invite A Friend: Shieldmate\" info under the Kickstarter Reward Level header.\n@Andius on the Pathfinder Forums, complied this awesome list of what makes the game different from other MMOs you may have played in the past. \nPathfinder Online is a fantasy sandbox MMO by Goblinworks based on the Pathfinder tabletop game. It uses a unique process called \"Crowdforging\" to determine what features are implemented in the game, in what order.\nHere is a brief list of some of the highlights of this game: \n1. No Grinding- Pathfinder Online uses a skill training system like that of EVE Online. You train skills by choosing what skill you want to train and allowing the time required to elapse. You don't train any faster by farming mobs or spamming your abilities than you do exploring the world, role playing with your friends, or even being offline. You will need to complete certain achievements to complete a skill and open up new avenues of training.\n2. No Classes- Unlike other games that give you a narrow range of abilities as you train your class, in Pathfinder you gain levels in different Roles based off what you have trained.\n3. Player Structures- Build your own homes, taverns, farms, and even cities! The Pathfinder Online world will be filled with places players can use to build and customize their own homes, businesses and communities.\n4. More Than A Gankfest- Unlike other Open World PVP MMO's currently on the market, Pathfinder Online actively discourages meaningless PVP. A meaningful alignment system that actually offers mechanical advantages to lawful and good aligned organizations, and a functional bounty system that allows the player to choose which players and organizations can collect the bounties they set discourages random and meaningless killing. Beyond this, the admins are taking a hard stance against 'griefing', in which players specifically seek to ruin the experience of other players, often through using game mechanics in ways that weren't intended. Griefing in PFO can be a bannable offence.\n5. All Players are Useful- This won't be like games where a new player has 49 health and a veteran has 49,000. The attacks from that new player won't automatically miss the veteran. A new player will be weaker, but still able to make a meaningful contribution to combat. As a sandbox where group sizes aren't limited, this means all players are useful, and don't have to segregate themselves by level.\n6. Trade is Meaningful- In Pathfinder Online players must manually transport items to their intended destination. Most shops are player-run, and there will be goods more abundant in or even exclusive to certain regions. Merchants, traders, and even auctioneers are all viable professions.\nEvery 2 weeks we publish a Development Blog about Pathfinder Online on the Goblinworks website.  Those blogs contain a wealth of information about the design and the ideas we have for the game.\n@Valkenr on the message boards assembled links to \"the blog posts everyone should read\".\nThe Emerald Spire Superdungeon includes 32 pages of source material detailing the area around Fort Inevitable, one of the starter towns in the Pathfinder Online game.  This book replaces the Fort Indomitable sourcebook listed in the Loremaster reward description. The PDF Superdungeon will be accompanied by the PDF Emerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multi-Pack, a set of Pathfinder Flip-Mats presenting each dungeon level in tabletop miniatures scale.Emerald Spire Superdungeon Co-Designers\nWe are also pleased to announce that new WizKids Pathfinder Battles Miniatures are being added to the rewards for all Crowdforger Pioneer levels and above!  Crowdforger Buddies will get 2 of each miniature, and Crowdforger Guilds will get 6 of each miniature.\nBecause you can only select one Reward, the Add-On system was evolved by the Kickstarter community as a way to include additional benefits for backing a project.  To use Add-Ons, increase the total amount of your pledge by the specified sum.  Leave your Reward selection unchanged.  In the post-Project Kickstarter Backer Survey process you'll be able to tell us how you want to allocate the Add-On pledge money!\nPlease direct questions about Add-Ons directly to Goblinworks via email.\nChanging your Pledge amount will NOT affect your Daily Deal start date.\nCrowdforger Buddy and Crowdforger Guild Rewards produce 2 and 6 Pathfinder Online Accounts respectively.  You will be able to assign these accounts in the post-campaign survey process and there is no rush.\n\n$10 - Class Pack\nWhen characters arrive in the River Kingdoms in Pathfinder Online, they do so with little wealth or equipment to their name.  A Class Pack will provide the character with a selection of items appropriate to a lower level character\nof the class selected when the class pack is used.  Each pack will include a weapon, a suit of armor (torso, legs, and helmet if applicable), and three or four other items of such as thieves tools, shields, boots, gloves, belts, hats,\netc.  One Class Pack is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$10 - Honorable Title\nPrior to arriving in the River Kingdoms, your character served with distinction elsewhere and was recognized for that service.  You'll be able to choose a formal title for your character of Sir, Dame, Master, Brother, Sister, Father\nor Mother.  You will be able to control when this title is displayed to others in-game.  One Honorable Title is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$10 - Secret Salute\nYou will have access to a special title that commemorates your participation in the Kickstarter.  Titles are selectable in game and you can determine when this title is displayed to other characters.  You will be able to trigger an\non-command \"emote\" animation available only to Kickstarter backers!  A fun way to commemorate the Kickstarter and to show solidarity with other Backers in-game!  All characters on your account will have these\nbenefits.\n$15 - Additional Player Pack\nYou packed with foresight before arriving in the River Kingdoms!  You'll get an extra Player Pack that you can assign to any character you create, or sell on the in-game market to players who didn't plan as well for their journey along the Crusader Road!  One Player Pack is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$15 - Regional Trait Pack\nPlayers can purchase Regional Traits Packs for their characters that give them background elements of coming from a specific country or region in Golarion.  A Region Trait Pack will provide the character with an achievement\nstating the country they hail from, a title, and a small mechanical effect, all based on the country of origin selected when the pack is used.  Select one from: Absalom, Andoran, Cheliax, Five King\u2019s Mountain, Galt, Katapesh,\nKyonin, Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Mwangi Expanse, Osirion, Qadira, Rahadoum, The Shackles, Taldor, Ustalav, and Varisia.  One Regional Trait Pack is required per character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$20 - Additional Alliance Pack\nYour network of contacts is exceptional.  As you arrive in the River Kingdoms you are able to make friends faster than your peers.  You'll get an extra Alliance Pack that you can assign to any character you create, or sell on the\nin-game market to players who didn't make a great first impression. You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n(Note that each character can only gain the benefit of one Alliance Pack at a time)\n\n$20 - The Memorial of Honor\nIn the middle of the Crusader Road is a mysterious structure that calls to nearby travelers.  Characters who approach and are recognized elicit a display of eldritch power from the construct.  Activating the structure removes unwanted disabilities that may have been inflicted in battle or by the acts of other characters.  In addition, you may opt to have your real name inscribed on the monument, visible to any who choose to pause for deeper inspection.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times, once for each Character you wish to honor.\n$20 - Twice-Marked of Pharasma\nAll characters in Pathfinder Online are marked by Pharasma and are thus able to return from the dead at the soulbinding points.  You bear the same mark as all other characters but you have a second, distinctive mark\nas well.  None know why you bear this mark, nor what it may portend in the future, but be sure that Fate has many surprises in store for those who are Twice-Chosen by the Lady of Graves.  The bearer of this second Mark\nwill have access to content and mechanical benefits distinct to those who are Twice Marked!  One Twice-Marked of Pharasma Add-On is required for each character.  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$30 - Three Months of Game Time\nExtend the subscription time included with your Reward by +3 additional months! (Limit 3 per Pathfinder Online account)\n$35 - Adventurer Reward Tier\nYou can Add-On as many Adventurer Rewards as you wish.  They will not be able to play the game until the Adventurers are invited to join.  They will be eligible for Daily Deals as of the date you increase your pledge by $35 increments, not the date of your first eligibility.\n$50 - Miniature Multiplier\nGet an additional set of all the WizKids Pathfinder Battles prepainted plastic miniatures from the Crowdforger levels!  You may purchase this Add-On multiple times.  Available only to $100 Crowdforger Pioneer Backers (and higher).  There is no shipping charge for this Add-On.\n$100 - 1 Year of Game Time\nExtend the subscription time included with your Reward by +12 additional months!  (Limit 1 per Pathfinder Online account)\n$100 - RPG Print Pack Add-On\nFor Backers who want to get the Emerald Spire Superdungeon and Flip-Mat Multi-Pack in print as well as PDF.  The RPG Print Pack includes a hardcover print edition of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon, featuring an exclusive\ncover available only to Kickstarter backers; a print edition of the Emerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multi-Pack; a print edition of the Pathfinder Tales novel The Crusader Road; and an Emerald Spire Campaign Cards game\naccessory.  Also includes 2 bonus Reaper metal miniatures!\n\nAdd $15 for shipping to non-US addresses.  Canada and Mexico are not US addresses.\n\nYou may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\n$500 - Hellknights Most Wanted\nYou get all of the physical RPG products in this Kickstarter including the Emerald Spire Superdungeon hardback, the Emerald Spire Dungeon Flip-Mat Multipack, all of the Crowdforger-level Pathfinder Battles miniatures, 2 bonus\nReaper metal minis a print copy of the Pathfinder Tales novel \"The Crusader Road\", and the Emerald Spire Campaign Cards game accessory.  As an added bonus, you will get PDFs of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon, the\nEmerald Spire Dungeons Flip-Mat Multipack, and the Pathfinder Tales novel The Crusader Road.\nIn addition, you will provide Goblinworks with a proper name for a character and a 300-word description of that character for use on a wanted poster from the Hellknights in Fort Inevitable.  You will even be able to tell us what\nyour character is wanted for in the 300-word description.  We will then use Paizo's Pathfinder artists to render a full-color head-shot of that character and then use that head-shot to create a wanted poster of your character. A\nPDF of all the wanted posters created with this reward add-on will be included along with the Emerald Spire Superdungeon PDF, and the wanted fugitives will appear on the random encounter charts for the Echo Wood area around Fort Inevitable and the Emerald Spire. \nTo top it all off, you will have the opportunity to use that head-shot as a unique avatar on the paizo.com messageboards!  \nAdd $15 for shipping to non-US addresses.  Canada and Mexico are not US addresses.\n\nYou may purchase this Add-On multiple times.\nPlease direct questions about Add-Ons directly to Goblinworks via email.\nWe have added numerous updates, upgrades and bonus content to the Reward Tiers.  There is a link at the top of the page to a complete Pledge Guide showing all these changes.  The following describe some of these updates in more detail.\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - Character Name Reservation:\nYou'll be able to reserve the name of your first Pathfinder Online character!  As as part of the post-Kickstarter survey process you'll be able to give us your first, second and third choices for your first character name.  They'll be assigned in the order you first backed the project at the $35 Adventurer level or higher.  (If all three of your choices are taken by earlier backers, we'll contact you to arrange for more options!)  We reserve the right to limit the use of certain names for legal, marketing and community management reasons.\n\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - The Pathfinder Tabletop RPG Experience:\nYou'll receive a PDF of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, and the Guide to the River Kingdoms sourcebook.  Together these two books are a $23.98 value.  The heart and soul of the Pathfinder Online game comes from its tabletop roots, and we're pleased to be able to bring you this benefit thanks to our friends at Paizo Publishing!  We also encourage you to join the Pathfinder Society and find a regular gaming group in your area so you can start adventuring in the world of Golarion TODAY!\n\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - Destiny's Twin:\nAs a special feature of Adventurer accounts, you'll be able to have two characters training skills at the same time!  While one character is learning how to master the martial arts and gain renown as a warrior, your other character can be learning the intricacies of the crafting system and earning a name as an industrial powerhouse!  As long as your primary character is earning skill points, so will its counterpart - FOREVER!  The value of this benefit could easily reach hundreds of dollars if you became a long-term player of Pathfinder Online. (You will not be able to log in and play both of these characters at the same time)\nAdventurer Reward Bonus - Head Start:\nYou will be invited to the last month of Early Enrollment so you'll get a jump start on all players joining on Release.  This benefit will be added to the $35 Adventurer Reward Tier.\n\nAdventurer and Crowdforger Reward Bonus - Invite A Friend: Shieldmate\nInvite a friend to the Kickstarter, get a synergy bonus!  After the Kickstarter ends you'll be able to either invite or accept a Friendship link with another Pathfinder Online account.  Once an invitation is accepted, both accounts will unlock a special bonus:  All characters on both accounts will have the Shieldmate Mark.  Any time two or more characters with the Shieldmate Mark are in a group (regardless of if the account holders are Friends or not), all the characters with the Shieldmate Mark in that group will get a synergy bonus.\n\n(Buddy and Guild Rewards provide 2 and 6 Pathfinder Online accounts, respectively.  You can allocate these accounts as you see fit and there will be plenty of time to allocate them - there is no rush.  Buddy and Guild accounts are not automatically Friends, and you can opt to friend other players instead of the other Buddy or Guild accounts in your Reward.)\nYou can only offer or accept one Friendship invite, so you cannot round-robin the Friendship links.  A-B-C-A is not OK.  Only A-B.\n\nIn addition, the two Friends will get access to the Daily Deals as of the earliest pledge date of the two backers.  This is a way for you to enable a Friend to get Daily Deals back to the date of your first eligibility!\nCrowdforger Reward Bonus - $1 Million Early Enrollment Upgrade\nWe've heard a lot of concern from people who want to switch reward levels, but don't want to lose their place in line. We want to make sure everyone has a chance to get into the best reward level for them. We looked at the numbers pretty carefully, and we believe it will only stretch our enrollment slots by about 1000 people to offer this benefit to the Crowdforger pledges up to $1 million.\nWe're going to allow all Crowdforger pledges received before the $1 million milestone into the first month of Early Access. So go ahead and switch levels around however you wish over the next day or so, and don't worry about losing your place in line. Once we hit $1 million, the normal system will be back in effect.\n\nCrowdforger Reward Bonus - Reaper MIniatures\nOur friends at Reaper have provided us with a great addition to the Crowdforger Rewards!  Baron Tervin Blackshield, ruler of Thornkeep, and goblin commander of the Accursed Halls, Murgmo, come from the pages of the Pathfinder Online: Thornkeep book.  These unpainted metal miniatures will be included free for all Crowdforger Rewards AND to the RPG Print Pack Add-On and the Hellknights Most Wanted Add-On!  We've already got a sneak peek at Murgmo!\nPDF Superpack Available to ALL CROWDFORGER LEVELS!\nPaizo's community is very strong, and that includes friends at many excellent third-party publishers that make roleplaying products for use with the Pathfinder RPG. Paizo reached out to those publishers and asked them if they would be willing to donate a PDF or two (or sometimes even more) that we could bundle up and offer as part of the Crowdforger Kickstarter backers, and the response has been absolutely amazing\u2014including Paizo's own contribution, it currently includes 59  products from 37 different publishers, with a total retail value of $318.50!

One of the largest costs for a computer game project of this scope is the costs for people. If there are significant delays that prevent us from releasing the game to paying customers on time, we would need an influx of capital to make it to the later release. If we couldn\u2019t get that capital, then the release of the game could be in jeopardy. Also, if we were to lose a key member of our staff, it could impact our ability to produce the game. Thankfully, we have contracts in place for all of our key staff, so it would take an extraordinary situation for us to lose one of them. \n\nThe key Goblinworks staff has started and grown many successful companies. They have seen MMO games through to completion. In any project of this scope, there will be unseen challenges that will spring up, but the depth of experience of our staff makes us confident that we will be able to meet those challenges head on and defeat them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #115", "update_userinfo": "Opening Up the Echo Woods", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #114", "update_userinfo": "Kingmaker: Rule Your World!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #113", "update_userinfo": "The Nhur Athemon Sequence", "update_content": "From deep within the Emerald Spire, the Azlanti lich Nhur Athemon spent centuries setting his plans in motion, intricate schemes that played out in the world above over hundreds of mortal lifetimes.

As those heroes have tamed the lands and established new settlements to help them grow in power, they've thwarted Nhur Athemon's plans time and again. To deal with these nuisances once and for all, he's triggered a series of events repeated throughout the Echo Woods, a sequence of escalating invasions designed to crush each new settlement in turn. Familiar creatures, increasing in strength and power, have started appearing in all the most dangerous places across the map, but what new monstrous threat awaits when these attacks reach their peak?

I like to be modest about this whole process, and not include everything I've planned to paint for each stretch goal, but here are some of them, to give you an idea. Reaching the minimum goal of $5000 breaks open the $7K seal, to reveal what will be in the Tavern/Inn themed kit.\nAs each stretch goal is reached, the seal of the next scroll is broken, unfolding the parchment to reveal what is in the list.\n$5500 - Minimap kit(reached!) - containing tiles, symbols and various parchments for the purpose of creating maps to hand out to the players during a fantasy rpg campaign. Using the contents of this kit, along with some of your own artistic skills to draw roads, rivers, lakes etc, you are able to create detailed minimaps for use with your game. And best of all, this kit now comes free of charge with the base Fantasy art kit! Examples shown below:\n$7000 Stretch goal (reached!) - Tavern/Inn addon art kit - containing tiles & tokens of everything you'd halfway expect or expect to find inside a fantasy tavern or inn, including tiles, tokens, structure, objects, characters, items and more. Possibly even contain some fantasy nudity :)\n$9000 stretch goal(reached!) - Castles, siege engines & torture chambers addon art kit - construct castles, add  siege engines that tear them down again + fill the lower levels with devices of pain..\n$12.000 - Holy places addon art kit(reached!) - containing tiles & tokens of everything you'd need to rig up burial grounds, ancient and new, temples, shrines and places of nature worshipping, plus a bunch of items, objects, creatures & monster and fantasy characters related to the theme. Including ghosts, priests, clerics, druids and more.\n$ 15.000 - Nautical addon art kit(reached!) - Sea, ocean, seaside/beach, lake & river terrains. Construct ships, boats, sailboats, other types of fantasy water vessels, build seaside constructions, docks, ruins in or near water,  & underwater cities! Also included in this addon kit are a number of sea/ocean type creatures & monsters, ocean dwelling fantasy characters, nautical themed items & objects, statues..and maybe the Kraken! :)\n$ 18.000 - Wizards & the mages guild(reached!) - Crazy and not so crazy spellcasters of many races, fantastic items and objects, magical creatures, potions, torn apart spellbooks, tomes everywhere and more! including other mysterious locations such as fantasy stargazing observatories, and alchemyst labs! You don't want to miss this one :)\n$ 22.000 - The Monsters, Creatures & Items master kit  - more monsters, more creatures + variations of the new ones and variations of current ones.- more items & objects + item & object condition variations (broken, damaged, rusty, enchanted, cursed etc.\n$ 26.000 - 2 addon kits: The Elves master kit & The Dwarves master kit. - More characters/NPCs of \"all\" elvish races and dwarven races. More terrains, more tokens, creatures typical of all of those races,  more tiles, more decals, everything styled to look like it was crafted by elves or dwarves. These kits will enable you to construct buildings and housings in the style of elven or dwarven craftsmanship, create large forests, mines beneath the mountains and much more.\n$ ??? - to be revealed..\n$ ??? - to be revealed..\n$ ??? - to be revealed..\n$ ??? - to be revealed...\n$ ??? - to be revealed..\n$ ??? - to be revealed..\nBeyond these initial stretch goals, lies more themed addon kits that will be added to the fantasy art kit, these will be added as new stretch goals if or when by any chance should the first stretch goals be reached... \nAny amount helps, and I'm gratefull for all the support I can get towards this project.

Shoppers crammed stores and walkways hoping to get some great deals and finish their Christmas shopping early. Kids walked along eating tasty treats that their parents bought them. Heavy laden shoppers toting colorful bags strode along staring at spectacular storefront windows. Jacob just smiled and shook his head as he saw two women in a toy store engaged in a heated discussion while holding what appeared to be a large yellow and red doll of some sort.\nIt was then that the floor began to shake. A split second later, Jacob heard a deafening boom and then another. A gray dust cloud raced from the corridor to his left like a freight train. Without thinking, Jacob drew both ASP pistols from underneath his jacket and charged towards the explosion.\nWhere do you go from here? To the map of course!\nThis kickstarter is for a .PDF of a map of a 100 store, two-story mall that is over 750,000 square feet. The map will have three anchor stores, multiple shops of various sizes and a small, five vendor food court. One of the anchor stores will be detailed while the remaining two have been left to the GM to customize using a sheet of fixture icons, which can be printed and placed in a blank anchor store or shop to create a custom space.\nSince many mall stores are designed in a similar fashion, four different store floor plans will be provided in order to flesh out the mall where needed. The entire map of the mall will be provided in 1\"=5' scale and stretch goals will expand and flesh out the mall to help create a bigger and better map for players and GMs alike.\nIn addition, this map will have all of the features that you have come to know and love from Fabled Environments:\nWant to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5\" x 11\" map as a guide.\nWant to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use the 36\" x 48\"  full scale map sections (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble it yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1\" equals 5'.\nIn addition, labels and furniture can be turned on or off using the layers feature.\nThis flooplan will also take advantage of the \"tile large page\" function of Adobe Acrobat X\nAll of our floorplans are rendered in black and white and are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.\nFor some examples of our previous maps, feel free to watch the YouTube video above or go to our store on DriveThruRPG.com\nStretch Goals\nIf we exceed our target funding, we will add the following:\n$1450-Children's Indoor Play Area\n$1950-Parking Lot Around The Mall\n$2450-Floor Plans For Two Additional Shops\n$2950-Add Another Anchor Store\n$3450-The Map Will Be Available In 6\u2019 = 1\u201d Hex And 6\u2019=1\u201d Grid As Well As The Standard 5\u201d=1\u2019 Grid\n$3950-A \"Sit Down\" Restaurant\n$4450-Expand The Food Court To 10 Vendors\n$4950-Another \"Sit Down\" Restaurant\n$5450-Outdoor Expansion With 10 Stores And A Large Plaza", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "New Kickstarter From Fabled Environments", "update_content": "Hi All,\nFirst off I want to say Thank You for your support of the Two-Story Mall campaign.\nI also wanted to let you know that we have launched our newest Kickstarter: An Average Modern High School.

(or, New Stretch Goal)\nUPDATE #3: Just when I think you guys couldn't stun me any more, you continue to blow me away! (My poor exclamation mark button is so abused lately, but I don't even care.)\nThe new stretch goal is set for $10,500, which will go toward better promotional material, reviews, and marketing. Ok, I know, that's a big leap. However, getting the attention of booksellers on a national level isn't cheap when you are publishing on your own. You all have shown that, like me, you think this book is really something special. Now I want the world to know it, and sadly, that comes with a hefty price tag.\nEven if we can't make this last goal in the time left, I thank everyone who've given their support so far. This book is your baby as much as it is mine, and I hope you all feel as proud as I do. \n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nUPDATE #2:  Look at that! All you brave folks helped us reach our initial stretch in a matter of days. Let's keep reaching for the stars! Our new goal of $7,000 will help pay for recipe testing ingredients, a professional food photographer, and a food stylist. At this point, it's go pro or go home! \n(Ok not really, but it would be awesome to have pictures done by people with something better than a point-and-shoot. ^_^)\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\nUpdate #1- We did it! In a full 10 days our goal was reached thanks to generous folks from all over the world; thank you, you're all amazing and deserving of virtual high-fives.\nBut we don't have to stop here! I'm setting a stretch goal of $5,000 in order to include full color art /and/ photographs. There is something about colorful pictures of food that turns the drool factor up to the max. \nAlso, if you popped by here via reddit, I will be doing an AMA next week to answer any and all questions you might have.\nPlease, continue to spread the word so we can take this book to the next level!\nOnce Upon A Social Media Page...\nBack in late March of this year, I put up a thread on Google Plus asking if people ever used food to add an extra dimension to their games. This sparked a wonderful conversation between several different members of the gaming community from both people who loved to cook and people who wanted to bring something different to the gaming table, but weren't sure exactly how to execute it.\nThe responses really got me thinking, and I realized that there wasn't a viable cookbook specifically aimed to gamers. Having nutritious food at your gaming session can not only keep players from getting distracted due to hunger, but engaging the sense of taste can do wonders to really draw people deeper into the world you set out to create.\nWhat is your quest?\nMy goal is to collect recipes, carefully judge them based on how well they can feed a crowd, the level of ease it takes to make, budget-friendliness, and how well they hold up in the danger zone of character sheets, maps, and miniatures. I will also include recipes and menu suggestions for special occasions, like in-character feasts, LARPS, birthday parties, or even DM appreciation day!\nGamers are an imaginative group by nature, therefore I want to foster that creativity with a few simple recipes that lay down a groundwork, like say, homemade pizza dough, and then spark the cooking muse with things like a random table of toppings. (For extra fun, dare yourself to roll and stick with what you got!) \nNeed more XP for that...\nMoney from this Kickstarter will go towards publishing, paying the artist for graphic work, and promotional materials. I do believe that there is a neglected market for this kind of book, and honestly, there is nothing quite as social as having a meal with friends or tabletop role-playing, so why not try to combine both and create something truly special?\nGiving Back!\nI'm going to pledge 5% of the finished product profits back into other Kickstarter projects through Kicking It Foward; this has become such a community project that giving back to others trying to bring their dreams to light seems like the only sensible thing to do.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Refund folks", "update_content": "I am backtracking through all the emails today and double checking repayment preferences.

The application allows you to play pen & paper roleplaying games as well as strategy/board games online with other players from around the world. \nWith a host of useful features, we hope to support as many game types as possible:\nRobust dice rolling\nBattle maps with grid overlays\nTokens with editable fields\nMacros for storing frequently used commands\nCustom tables so you can roll from user created lists or card decks\nThese features, combined with the integrated video conferencing already included in Google+ Hangouts, provides what we feel is an experience that closely matches face-to-face tabletop gaming.\nWhy are you doing a Kickstarter?\n\nTabletop Forge started as a hobby project. While it is perfectly usable in its current form, we want to take it to a professional level. The primary use of the Kickstarter funds will be to purchase art assets to use directly in the application. Instead of hunting for an encounter map for that surprise tavern fight, we want you to be able to just choose a tavern map you like and load it directly in the app. We want tokens for all the generic fantasy creatures (like goblins), as well as modern/sci-fi tokens like guards and ships.\n\nBesides empowering players, we believe in supporting indie artists, writers and game designers. A large chunk of our KickStarter money will go back into the community, to people like Jonathan Roberts and Devin Night, so we can secure the rights to use their creations in Tabletop Forge.\n\nWe will also bring more programmers and designers on board to polish the features and user experience of Tabletop Forge and make sure it works smoothly and intuitively. Again, wherever possible we will hire from within, finding artists, designers, and programmers from within the RPG community.  \nSo what do I get for supporting Tabletop Forge?\nWe have a ton of excellent Kickstarter rewards including some fun maps, tokens, and other assets that will be available to backers only. If we hit our goal, we have plans to bring in new content like maps, tokens, and more as stretch goals.\nAfter months of adventuring you have reached the fabled Tabletop Forge and slain the blacksmiths who guarded it. As your reward, you may now take one item from their enchanted armory.\nWhy Tabletop Forge versus other virtual tabletops?\n\nWe admit there are other cool virtual tabletops out there but the primary reason we started developing Tabletop Forge was because of the awesome RPG community that exists on Google+. Even before the first line of code was written for our app, there were a steady stream of people playing pickup games on Google+ Hangouts using separate dice rollers. We wanted to give those gamers a tool so they could have the whole package in one place and solve the issues they were having. Now instead of seeing a handful of games a week we are seeing dozens, and that number is continuing to grow.\n\nThe main advantage of an online virtual tabletop is that it allows for games to be started quickly with no installation and port forwarding necessary. We also feel that our feature set matches up to some of the other popular virtual tabletops and we are improving the application daily.\n\nWe also have a lot of support from indie game designers evidenced by all the cool Kickstarer rewards they are offering. Our goal is to enable a wide range of gaming styles, and not tie Tabletop Forge to one specific system.\nFor example, although we have great map features (and more on the way), we do not want the app to revolve solely around gridded maps. We want to support features common to indie games like atmosphere, index cards, token/chit mechanics, and more.\nWe already have commitments that once we have an in-game store up and running, you will be able to purchase games, adventures, maps, tokens, and more from the game designers and artists for use directly in the app.\n\nNo matter what, Tabletop Forge itself is going to remain free because this is a product we feel that the community deserves and we want to encourage new gamers in the hobby.\nStretch Goals\nStretch Goal #1\nStretch Goal #2\nStretch Goal #3\nStretch Goal #4\nFinal Stretch Goal\nThe first part of this stretch goal is going to be a complete fantasy setting for use with Tabletop Forge along with 4 adventures. The fine folks at White Haired Man they are taking their system neutral setting Kith\u2019takharos and packaging it in a PDF for reference directly in the app. They are also taking 4 adventures (previously design for both 3.5 and Savage Worlds) and providing these for everyone who uses Tabletop Forge. As I have personally playtested a couple of these adventures I think they will be a great addition to our line up of great assets.\n\nThe second part of the stretch goal is going to be 20 issues of Toys for the Sandbox by Occult Moon. Toys for the Sandbox is an ongoing series providing system agnostic story hooks, locations, and NPCs in a framework designed to help a GM insert them easily into any game system. We will be getting a mix of fantasy and sci-fi issues and they will be available directly in the application for everyone.\nThe last part of this stretch goal is something we are personally excited about and if it happens will be bringing aboard a new member to the Tabletop Forge team. If we can hit this final stretch goal we will be including 3D dice that you can roll with the mouse complete with a physics engine. We think web technology is far enough along that we can attempt this and that this feature will help the application feel more like playing at a real tabletop. This kind of feature has been relegated to the desktop space in other virtual tabletops and we hope to bring it to the masses online.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 159, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshuha/tabletop-forge-the-virtual-tabletop-for-google-han", "project_name": "Tabletop Forge: The Virtual Tabletop for Google+ Hangouts"}}, {"backer": "David Berkompas", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "If you are new to this Project, keep reading from here; if you are already a Backer, scroll down to NEWS.\nMarc Miller's Far Future Enterprises is raising funds for the legendary Fifth Edition of Traveller on Kickstarter! Traveller was born July 22, 1977 as a now-iconic Little Black Box with three Little Black Books. No one knew it was coming when the first copies showed up at the Origins Game Convention in Staten Island. In fact, D&D was itself just getting off the ground; there were no [significant] science-fiction role-playing games to speak of. And Traveller (it\u2019s now called Classic Traveller to distinguish it from the various editions that followed) had its own quirks: for example, your character could die during character generation, for example.\nThe Original Little Black Books\nThis is Traveller\u2019s 35th year, and Marc has worked for several years on what he calls the Ultimate Edition: Traveller5. It includes so many things that players have asked for, or that have been imperfectly handled previously. In fact, Marc recently said there are now systems and chapters that he didn\u2019t know how to design way back then. But he does now, and they are included. T5 has technology beyond TL 15, clones, robots, computers, artificial intelligence, QREBS (!), alien senses, Flux. It has a whole series of easy-to-use Makers: GunMaker, VehicleMaker, ArmorMaker, RobotMaker, SophontMaker, ThingMaker. It includes mapping of star systems and worlds; there's ever the MOARN caveat: Map Only As Really Necessary, or referees would spend all their time just making maps of worlds and systems. There's a rationalized section on Psionics, and more, much more.\nThe New Big Black Book\nWe have a series of Rewards at support levels that fully engage players and characters in the system: nobility and land grants; characters or personal ships in examples in the text, even illustrations. And for almost everyone, there is the Wall of Heroes. \nThis Project is a labor of love, and we invite you to be part of it. Help us make this next edition of Traveller the best it can be. You are reading this now; share it with your friends\u2026 those guys you played Traveller with once upon a time. Let them know so they can reserve a copy too. Spread the word!\nThank you. It means a lot to me to be able to do this, and with your help, I can.\n- Marc Miller\nNEWS\nChanges to the Rewards:\nPledge $10 (or more). The Number of Wallpapers in Swag Bronze has increased to FOUR. There\u2019s the iconic Scout in Water, and we have added Scout in Wilds, Scout in Space, and my personal favorite (it\u2019s on my iPhone): the Solomani Fleet Courier.\nPledge $25 (or more). Did we tell you that we'll have a video (Swag Silver) of your name being carved on the Alabaster Cliffs?\nPledge $50 (or more). We have changed (increased) the number of Traveller Dice in Swag Gold from two Black to one each of Red, Black, and White. Remember that this Swag is included in every Pledge at this level or higher.\nPledge $51 (or more). At this level, you will receive the Traveller5 CDROM. The CDROM includes an electronic version of the Imperial Scout and the Free Trader Beowulf. Accompanying the CDROM is a credit-card-size membership card in the Travellers' Aid Society with a special supporting rule, your personal or character name, and the UWP for a world of the Imperium. We also include an Imperial Cr25 coin.\nPledge $100 (or more). At this level you receive the Traveller5 Hardcover Rules Book. Every Book includes the CDROM, and also includes: A printed deck plan (23 x 35 inch) of an Imperial Scout/ Courier. A printed deck plan (also 23 x 25 inch) of the Free Trader Beowulf. A set of 12 color ship images by Traveller artist Jesse Degraff. Printed (one color-black) end leaves (those are the inside front and back covers) for the book: useful charts and tables. Finally, this book includes two Imperial Cr25 coins (one for the book and one because the CDROM is also included at this level).\nThe Player's Book\nBy popular demand, we have committed to producing the Traveller5 Player's Book: a handy digest-size rules reference tailored for use by Players but without the (primarily) Referee\u2019s rules. We expect to produce a printed version in Spring 2013, but every Backer who orders a Book will receive a link to an Ebook version when it is complete.\nOur Final Stretch Goal- $250,000\nWhen we reach $250,000, we will be able to add a Knighthood every Book. There are 9074 worlds in the Imperium and each Knighthood will be randomly associated with a world. Since a Baron or a Marquis or a Count should also be a Knight, the Knighthood will also be added to the Noble editions.\nOPTIONS\nWe have some nice items that some of you (but not all of you) want. We call them Options. You edit your Pledge to cover them, and we include them in your shipment.\nIn most cases, the options you select will fit into the Priority Mail Medium Carton we plan to use, so there is no additional shipping charge. If we need to, we will bump you up to the Priority Mail Large Carton (at no extra cost); we apply this to Canada and International as well. If the options you select mean we have to add a second carton, you will need to increase your Pledge by the International Shipping Charge (again), but that is going to be a huge order.\nIf you have a small package (basically it doesn\u2019t have a book) then there is no additional shipping charge. If you Pledged at the $1 level (or any of the levels that don\u2019t ship ordinarily anything), the same applies; we\u2019ll cover shipping. If the shipment is International, you will need to increase your Pledge by $7 (we\u2019ll cover the rest).\nThe Options we have available are:\nSecond Book. We can include a Second Book.The Second Book includes all the Swag of a $100 Pledge Book: the CDROM, the Cr25 coins, the three Traveller Dice, and the Scout and Beowulf Deck Plans.  If we meet the Knighthood Stretch Goal, it will include a Knighthood. Add $75. For example, your current Pledge is the Imperial Space Noble edition; you can add a Second Book for $75. You can add a Third Book for $75 also.\nDouble Order. We can include TWO of everything (assuming it isn\u2019t a Limited Availability item). We double everything that you have selected as a reward. Add 75% of the base pledge amount. For example, TWO Imperial Space Noble Editions: The first is a Pledge of $150; the second adds $112.5. You can add any of the (non-limited) Editions below your current Pledge level.\nJump Drive Instead of CDROM. We substitute it for the CDROM. Add $10. Caution: do not use this Jump Drive within 100 diameters of a gravity source.\nSecond CDROM. Add $35. We include it with your shipment.\nClassic Traveller Black T Shirt. Carefully crafted by an expert T-Shirt maker. Silk Screened on Black. You will need to tell us a size. Add $22.\nNEW Traveller UPP Black T Shirt. Carefully crafted by an expert T-Shirt maker. Silk Screened on Black. You will need to tell us a size. Add $22.\n4518th Lift Infantry Red T-Shirt. Based on a limited edition of 5 that was produced in 1981 (that one was a golden yellow; this one will be red). Add $22.\nTraveller Dice. The new Traveller dice set. Includes 10 Black, 1 Red, and 1 White (twelve dice total). You also still get the three dice Swag you are already eligible for. Add $15.\nBulk Dice. \"IF\" you order the Dice Option, you can add additional dice at $1 each. Specify color (red, black, white, and [if we reach the stretch goal, yellow]).\nAdditional Cr25 Coins.

In fact, there's an entire dungeon to explore and your support will reveal it.\nBloody and battered, we begin to ascend the stairs. The sliver of light emerging from the crack in the door beckons us. We're so close to the end, now. Opening the door, our eyes are flooded with light before we hear the menacing laugh of a familiar voice. \"You won't get away that easy, puny adventurers!\" he chortles, brandishing a wicked axe. The Druid gasps in terror at the sight of her fallen foe\u2014The Barbarian has returned!\nWe can get out of this dungeon alive if we can muster $75,000 we'll be able to best the Barbarian. Having earned his respect in one last battle, he'll join our party for the long trip back to civilization. We'll release the Barbarian once all the Kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled as an exclusive backer-only PDF supplement sometime before the close of 2012.

This should make having Dungeon World at your local shop a much easier option. (We'd love to update the reward descriptions, but since some people have already chosen them we can't!)\nWhat Is Dungeon World?\nDungeon World is a fantasy roleplaying game about exploring dungeons, fighting monsters and looting treasure. In Dungeon World you and your friends take up the role of classic character classes and undertake exciting adventures together. Through your triumphs and travails the world changes around you.\nThe Dungeon World rules are simple and elegant. They exist to help you create unpredictable adventures and fluid action - to move from battles to exploration to moments of magic and mystery with ease. Dungeon World's rules all tell you when to use them: every rule comes into effect just when it's needed and stays out of the way the rest of the time.\nDungeon World emerged from our love of two things\u2014modern game design and old-school RPG action.  We wanted to create a game with the wide-eyed excitement and wonder of your first time playing a fantasy RPG and rules that draw on a long history of innovation and creativity. The best of both worlds!\nThe text of the game is complete and we're working with an editor to polish and perfect it right now. The text of Dungeon World is available under a creative commons license and will remain that way whether we meet our Kickstarter goal or not (we wanted to make sure that everyone got a chance to play Dungeon World).  \nIf the game is done and the rules are ready to go, what do we need your help with? We want to make Dungeon World the best game it can be, and to do that, we need your support. We'll offer the game to our contributors as a fully-featured PDF (with art, professional layout, hyperlinks and indexing) and, if you contribute at any level above the first, a softcover or hardcover version of the rules. As well, we've got a whole bunch of fun rewards at various tiers including t-shirts, pins, custom dice, and one-of-a-kind art from our artists.\nCommunity\nDungeon World was developed out in the open\u2014documentation and feedback has always been a huge priority for us. You can see the open development taking place here at our GitHub site. As a result of this model we've had over 250 playtesters over the two years that DW has been in development! Hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay have gone into the game. Here's a few nice things our players had to say\u2026\n\"Dungeon World is a slice of fried gold and I adore it!\"\n- Jason Morningstar, Designer: Fiasco\n\"Dungeon World is my go to game for a quick to setup one-shot fantasy adventure. Every game I've played of Dungeon World invokes the feeling of exploration, danger, and wonder that I had when I first started playing RPGs.\"\n- Jeremy Friesen, Adventurer's Guild Member\n\"Dungeon World is fun and innovative take on the oldest kind of roleplaying experiences. It's a wonderful blend of old and new that should make practically any gamer happy.\" \n- Monte Cook, Co-Designer: Dungeons & Dragons (3rd Edition)\nEvery contributor will receive a copy of the game in PDF form, with all the bells and whistles. Additionally, we'll be providing PDF copies of two Kickstarter-only supplements: one filled with exciting new monsters and the other with compendium classes (special themed mini-classes you can use in your Dungeon World game). All contributor levels also include special DW wallpaper for your PC, Mac, or mobile device. Your name will appear in the Thanks chapter as a backer.\nLevels including the softcover version of the rules will receive a printed copy of the game rulebook. We're big fans of games as physical artifacts\u2014you can be sure we'll provide the best quality book we can put in your hands.\nContributors who choose a level including the hardcover reward will receive a limited edition premium signed copy of the game rules in hardcover. We're only planning one run of hardcovers, so get one while you can.\nIn Dungeon World, \"Bonds\" are what tie the characters together, forming their shared history and giving them relationships to build on even before play starts. A Bond might say \"Avon has trusted me with a secret.\" Contributors who choose a level including this reward will get to work with us to write their own Bonds with Dungeon World, to be included in the PDF and printed books.\nThis reward replaces \"Thanks\" and is included free-of-charge in all reward levels where it appears.\nBreak out the soda and clear off the old ping-pong table. This package is a trip back to the basement that includes two custom Dungeon World dice and a Dungeon World notebook and pen set for keeping track of who owes you gold pieces and where you hid that magic ring.\nLet all the other kids at DW High know how you roll with this backpack customization kit. Including a full set of eight Dungeon World Glyph pins and a special Kickstarter-only Dungeon World sew-on patch. You will be the coolest kid within 3d6 x 10\". \nAny contributor whose reward includes this level will receive a Dungeon World logo t-shirt in classic white-on-black style.\nIt may not give you an armor bonus, but you'll always take +1 forward to impress. We promise.\nThis reward entitles the contributor to work with us to design a \"Compendium Class\" for inclusion in the Backer Supplement. You give us a theme and we'll design some moves for you and distribute them to the whole DW Backer group when the game is released.\nHave a favorite beast, creature or abomination you want to see in Dungeon World? Contribute at a level including this reward and we'll work with you to create and stat out a monster (with description, statistics, and special moves) that will be included in the Backer Supplement once the game is released.\nLove the Bard? Admire the Ranger? Want to create a signature character of your own? With this contribution reward, you'll work with our character artist, Emily DeLisle to create a full-color digital portrait of a character of your own design in the style you see on the class pages in Dungeon World. You'll receive high-resolution print-ready images as well as custom character sheets with your character in them.\nWith this reward, you'll work with famed dungeon cartographer Tony Dowler to create a special dungeon map for use in your next Dungeon World game. We'll also create a Front to use with your map so that you can just throw it in to your game. You'll receive a high-quality print-ready image as well as a PDF presenting your dungeon along with the Front that festers inside it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Inglorious Is Text and Layout Complete!", "update_content": "We're back from our latest dungeon delve, and found a village craftsman to pretty things up a bit.

Are you serious?\nVampire: The Masquerade had its 20th anniversary last year.\nWait, you want to make a card game where you have to create your deck by buying booster packs of random trading cards? Nobody would buy that.\nMagic: The Gathering is by far the most successful game ever in the history of tabletop gaming, and will celebrate 20 years in 2013.\nYou want to do WHAT? Make the Dungeons & Dragons game mechanics open source? That\u2019ll kill the entire industry!\nThe Open Game License (OGL) revolutionized the RPG market in 2000, leading to hundreds of companies producing products compatible with the Third Edition of D&D.\nHold on\u2014you\u2019re going to create your own game to compete with Dungeons & Dragons? You\u2019re wasting your time!\nThe Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is now the world\u2019s best-selling tabletop RPG.\nSo when we told people we wanted to create a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMO) for a fraction of the cost and development time of the big MMOs, you can imagine some of the responses we got.\nIt\u2019s a pipe dream! Nobody can do that. It\u2019s impossible.\nWell, we\u2019re the team that laughs in the face of impossible. Pathfinder Online is the project that will slay this dragon. And Goblinworks is the company that will make it happen. Impossible? We say nay!\nPathfinder Online is a hybrid sandbox/theme park-style MMO where characters explore, develop, find adventure and dominate a wilderness frontier in a land of sword and sorcery. The Pathfinder world is high fantasy in the tradition of epics like The Lord of the Rings, Conan, The Wheel of Time and Game of Thrones.\nThe Pathfinder setting includes many different classic and modern fantasy elements, from lost cities shrouded in misty jungles to decaying pyramids amidst deserts of burning sands to a fantastic island metropolis where folk from across the world live side by side with all manner of fantastic creatures. The Pathfinder world has a place for any story a player wants to tell. (For more information on the world of Pathfinder and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, please visit http://paizo.com/pathfinder.)\nPathfinder Online\u2019s robust trading system puts players in control of the world\u2019s economy with player-created items, consumables, fortifications, and settlements. Character-controlled settlements can grow into full-fledged kingdoms that compete for resources as they seek to become the dominant force in the land, raising vast armies to hold their territory against the depredations of monstrous creatures, NPC factions, and other player characters.\nSocial organizations scale from small parties of a few adventurers to player nations inhabited by thousands. As settlements develop, the surrounding wilderness develops more complex and challenging features, including randomly generated encounters and resources as well as exciting scripted adventures.\nFor the past several months, the Goblinworks team has been working on three major projects.  We\u2019ve been recruiting talent to fill out our art and design teams.  We\u2019ve been working to make a final selection of the middleware that will drive Pathfinder Online. And we\u2019ve been talking to investors to raise the capital we need to go into active production.\nWe announced Goblinworks and Pathfinder Online this past November because we wanted you, our community supporters, to hear about it first from us rather than getting hints from the grapevine that something was up at Paizo.  Since that announcement, we\u2019ve had amazing meetings with MMO publishers and developers, game designers, and potential investors.\nWe\u2019ve had to do all three of these things in parallel because there are a couple of intersecting \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problems here. Investing at this stage of a project is very much about having faith in the people working on the project\u2014and we have some amazing folks who want to work with us, but they have careers and family obligations, so they can\u2019t just pick up and relocate to Redmond on the hope that we\u2019ll get the funding we need.  We\u2019ll also need to show our investors specific details about our financials, which are affected tremendously by the deal we can secure for our middleware\u2014the engine that runs the game. Our business experience and social networks have provided us access to some awesome middleware deals that aren\u2019t readily available to outsiders, but sealing those deals is tied to the staff and funding issues as well. In short, we need to move forward before we can move forward.\nAnd then the Internet Changed Everything. And the harbinger of this change is Kickstarter!\nSeeing the Kickstarter success stories of Double Fine, The Order of the Stick, Wasteland 2, and Shadowrun Returns (to name just a few), we realized that Kickstarter could be just what we need to break through our roadblocks. \nFrom the very beginning of Pathfinder Online, we\u2019ve had a firm goal: we want a very close symbiosis with our customers, getting their feedback on our design ideas and, once the game is launched, iteratively adding content to the game based on their feedback. To provide transparency on our plans, we\u2019ve been doing bi-weekly design blogs at https://goblinworks.com/blog, and we\u2019ve been getting your feedback on the Goblinworks messageboards at http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/licensees/pathfinderOnline. We\u2019ll continue to update the blogs and interact with our community throughout the Kickstarter process\u2014and on into the future.\nBut right now, we need you to help us in a new way. We need you to help us PROVE to the world that our impossible dream is possible. \nThis Kickstarter will fund the Technology Demo of the Pathfinder Online Massively Multiplayer Online RPG.  The Technology Demo will be fully playable, integrating account management, character creation, a virtual world server, multiple simultaneously connected clients, middleware used for rendering landscapes and characters, basic game mechanics, and player communications.  The demo will only support a few simultaneous users exploring a couple of small locations, so the general public won't be able to play it, but we will produce a short video of the demo that everyone will be able to experience, and a special longer video exclusively for backers of this Kickstarter.\nYour support of the Technology Demo will help us raise awareness of Pathfinder Online and will show potential investors what the game is really about.  Funding this demo will also signal to potential partners that Pathfinder Online has an audience that's large enough and dedicated enough to allow the long-term success of the MMO. Nothing speaks louder than a ton of people putting up money to show their support of a new concept\u2014that\u2019s the genius element of Kickstarter!\nSince this Kickstarter isn\u2019t meant to fund the final video game, we had to think outside the box a little bit. Pathfinder Online is based on the world created by Paizo Publishing for their tabletop Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, so we thought it would be pretty cool to work with Paizo to create an RPG book that details one of the locations that Pathfinder Online characters will start in. We settled on the town of Thornkeep\u2014that\u2019s the very same \u201chive of scum and villainy\u201d that the Pathfinder Online community named in our first online poll back in January! To make Thornkeep come alive, we\u2019ve enlisted the talents of veteran game designer Rich Baker. Rich is going to give you everything you need to run a Pathfinder RPG game in Thornkeep, including the surrounding woods and a detailed dungeon below the ruins upon which Thornkeep was built. This very same dungeon will also be built as part of our technology demo, providing a great window into how tabletop design will make the transition to the digital medium. \nAnd that\u2019s just the first half of a 64-page book! The remaining sections will be written by our Pathfinder Online design team, letting you into Goblinworks\u2019 design philosophy and giving you inside information gleaned from the development of our technology preview. The Thornkeep book will be produced to Paizo\u2019s usual quality standards\u2014perfectbound, printed in full color, with lots of all-new original artwork, including a brand new beautiful cover painting by fan-favorite Pathfinder artist Wayne Reynolds (the cover you see here is a mock-up).\nWe didn\u2019t stop there either! We\u2019ve built up a wide range of Goblinworks-themed merchandise, from posters and T-shirts to an entire day spent playing Pathfinder and dining out with the Goblinworks staff at one of the world\u2019s finest restaurants! We have a reward level for every pocketbook, so give them a look and tell us what you think!\nIt\u2019s very important that our technology preview keeps to a specific schedule, scope, and budget\u2014we\u2019re not looking to raise millions of dollars here\u2014so we\u2019ve deliberately limited the number of rewards available at most higher levels. If you miss some of these opportunities on this Kickstarter, don\u2019t worry too much\u2014we hope to offer other opportunities in the future!  Note that any images are approximations; finished products may vary.\n$5: You'll be able to see an exclusive long video of the final Technology Demo. Additionally, in thanks for your backing, you\u2019ll be listed in a Special Thanks section of the Goblinworks website as well as in the release of the Pathfinder Online game.\n$15: You\u2019ll get access to the 64-page PDF of the Thornkeep book. In addition, you\u2019ll get the $5 reward level. Update: Because we've reached 2000 backers and $150,000, the Thornkeep PDF has been expanded to include four extra levels of the Thornkeep dungeon, designed by Paizo's own Jason Bulmahn, James Jacobs, and Erik Mona, plus the legendary Ed Greenwood, and backers will be able to participate in a survey to determine the theme of Jason, James, and Erik's dungeon levels. \n$30: You\u2019ll become a member of the Goblin Squad.

Since then, she has been involved in all facets of game production, starting with design and editing credits for the critically acclaimed Ars Magica and Vampire: The Masquerade roleplaying games. Lisa has been an art director, graphic designer, typesetter, licensing manager, and a marketing and sales director. She was also instrumental in the merger between Lion Rampant and White Wolf in 1990.\nIn 1991, she left White Wolf to help Peter Adkison start Wizards of the Coast. Her first job encompassed sales, marketing, and production. When Magic: The Gathering spurred the rapid growth of the company, Lisa settled into managing new business and licensing.

In 2009, the Pathfinder RPG jumped out of the gates with record sales and has since eclipsed Dungeons & Dragons as the top selling RPG.\nLisa received her MBA from the University of Washington. She has won numerous awards, including Origins Awards for the design of Ars Magica and Vampire: The Masquerade, as the Assistant Editor of White Wolf Magazine, and for the graphic design of Magic: The Gathering.

We greatly appreciate the support!\nWe have been running the sequel to that campaign, this time to fund the acceleration of development of the game proper.  Today is the last day for that second Kickstarter.\n\nWe are in the final hours, and we need your help to take us over the funding goal.  We're very close; we've raised 90% of the project goal of $1,000,000.  But the rules of Kickstarter state that if we do not exceed our funding goal, we'll get none of those pledges.  It's all or nothing.\n\nWe have two favors to ask from you today.  First, we'd like you to please speak with at least one friend and explain how cool the Pathfinder Online project is and ask them to back the project.  Each person who pledges will help convince others that the project has momentum and lots of support and that will snowball.\n\nSecond, we'd like you to make a post on Facebook, Google+ or Twitter about the Kickstarter, including the URL to the project so that people who follow you on-line will be able to find and back the project as well.\n\nThe URL is:\n\n\n\nHistory has been made with this Kickstarter.  We have already raised enough pledges to rank as the 10th most funded videogame project in Kickstarter's history.  Now we need to close the deal, hit the funding goal, and then accelerate production of the game.\n\nIn closing, I wanted to describe the benefits you get for supporting the second Kickstarter.  Pledging at the $35 Adventurer level gets you a number of benefits that have been added since the project began, including the PDF of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon (at least 144 pages of Pathfinder tabletop RPG awesomeness from an All-Star team of designers), PDFs of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook itself and the Guide to the River Kingdoms, 2 months of game time, the game itself, an invitation to join Early Enrollment in the last month so that you'll have a jump on retail buyers on Release, and in-game benefits like reserving a character name, Destiny's Twin that lets two characters train skills at the same time, and the Adventurer's Pack of consumables and a bag of holding.\n\nFrom everyone here at Goblinworks, we thank you again for your support, and look forward to Crowdforging Pathfinder Online with you!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRyan S. Dancey\nCEO Goblinworks"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "All physical Kickstarter rewards shipping next week!", "update_content": "We released a neat tool today that allows you to download the wilderness and dungeon environment from the Technology Demo and walk around in it via a Unity Web Application.
