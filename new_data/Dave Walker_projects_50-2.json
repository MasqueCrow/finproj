(We also use them to prevent the camera getting scratched on things like our iPads and phones.)\nCyber security is a big deal these days. We've all heard the stories that range from companies being hacked and vast amounts of data being stolen, to mass surveillance recording and gathering data on everything we do. Along with protecting the files on your devices, protecting yourselves (and others) is just as important!\nHeld securely in place with 3M adhesive backing, the CarbonCovers will fit to a vast range of devices - be it laptops, all-in-one desktops, tablets or even smartphones. A quick swipe of the finger will slide the cap to either reveal, or cover the camera lens. Fitted in seconds and easy to remove without causing any damage. They're made from the same premium materials as our last campaign, which really helps set them apart from the rest. Why use plastic when you can use carbon fibre?\nSuper easy to install \nOpen or close the cover whenever you need with one finger\n2 part carbon fibre construction\n3M adhesive backing\nAt 1mm thick you're able to close your laptop lid on it no problem\nOur aim was not to create 'the thinnest webcam cover in the world', but rather, the best. (And the most carbon-y.)\nWe're fully aware that there is nothing new with the concept of covering up your webcam. Many people (famously including Mark Zuckerberg and former FBI head James Comey) use a little square of tape - as do many people that are interested in cyber-privacy. \nThe problem with tape - as we've discovered for the last year or so of using it - is that it's not very practical. It needs to be removed when you want the camera and leaves a residue when you peel it off. They also ruin the look of your devices...\nAlready use tape? Go for a practicality and style upgrade with the CarbonCover! \nThe CarbonCover fully blocks the webcam when closed, but a handy feature (tested on Apple devices) is that the LED indication light remains exposed - so whether a program you're using, a dodgy website or a hacker activates the webcam, you'll be aware of this even though they're not recording any image. \nBut why do I need to cover my webcam?\nPrograms often sold as 'spy on your ex-girlfriend software' are available on the internet and allow people to spy on you using the webcam or front-facing cameras built into your devices. Simply put, if someone can control your webcam and record anything they want - isn\u2019t this something you\u2019d like to prevent? With access to a webcam, people can capture everything and privacy no longer exists. Closed door meetings at work, your children playing in the living room or even things far more intimate can all be targets for users of this type of software. (more on this at the bottom!)\nDoing things differently. \nThere have been several campaigns for webcam covers that have come and gone on Kickstarter before ours, with many of you probably having backed them! Unfortunately, it seems that there have been numerous issues with them. Everything from flimsy construction and unfeasibly small/thin components, through to supply chain issues, rewards simply not turning up and no communication from the creators.\nWe hope our simple approach to the design, and great track record of delivering a large volume of high quality carbon parts to backers all over the world will inspire a bit more confidence and keep as many of you safe from webcam hackers as possible!\nDesign & Prototyping.\nWith dimensions of 16.5 x 11 x 1mm, the CarbonCover is tiny. It's small enough to be completely unobtrusive, and yet its rounded edges and glossy carbon twill compliment the design of your device and really set itself apart from other webcam covers on the market. The best selling covers on sites like Amazon are also 1mm thick and in all the testing we've been doing we're yet to find an issue with closing a laptop lid on it.\nThose rulers look familiar...\nTo develop these covers we began by speaking to our fantastic manufacturing partners. With their advice on board, we made sure the design wouldn't be an issue for the manufacturing tolerances we've come to expect from them - a key area we feel many other campaigns have failed on due to designs that are unrealistic for accurate and consistent machining in large quantities. \nA few 3d printed prototypes later we were able to order our first batch of CarbonCovers to carry on testing. The comparatively large surface area for the 3M adhesive backing ensures the CarbonCover stays firmly in place on all your devices. The sliding lens cap is really easy to open and close with a single flick of the finger. No messy glue or magnets involved here! While the adhesive will remain sticky if you choose to remove the cover and apply to another device, we include a spare adhesive ring for just this eventuality! \nRewards and Incentives.\nThey say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so it's in that spirit that we're 'imitating' the superb incentive we've recently seen on the Universal Lens Cap campaign. If you like the CarbonCover, back it at whatever quantity takes your fancy - then share it with your friends and followers on social media to receive 1 FREE ADDITIONAL COVER! (Don't forget to post the link in the comment section above!)\n Will the CarbonCovers fit my devices?\nCarbonCovers can be secured to any device with a camera of up to 4.6mm in diameter. We have come across some larger webcams on old laptops, but the CarbonCover still works just fine. In these instances the edges of the cover may be just visible when you're using the webcam, but it will still be perfectly usable for skype/etc. When in the closed position, the lens is fully covered. \nA few of the comments from happy backers last time around!\n Tell me more about webcam spying!\nAt just over a minute in length this video perfectly demonstrates why you want to have your webcam covered. It is now common knowledge that intelligence organisations around the world can access a webcam without the user ever knowing. However, the bigger privacy threat is actually from hackers, blackmailers and cyber stalkers - thanks mostly to the software being so easy to get hold of and install. If the CarbonCover isn't for you, and you don't fancy buying any of the alternatives, at least grab a bit of tape and get those cameras covered! \nA webcam cover gives peace of mind during intimate and private moments.

But, the problem we face is that those tiny button cell batteries that generally power our flashlight are to be replaced frequently. In some instances, it takes very longer for us to replace the old button cell batteries as they are too small.\nTough job for your big hand to work on such tiny battery.\n    Can you imagine carrying a keychain flashlight that is just equivalent to the size of a paper clip that comes with rechargeable battery? Yes, such a light called as PISA light in attractive colors is launched by us at RHEEA Tech. Welcome to our Kickstarter Campaign for this small colorful rechargeable EDC flashlight. This practical, trendy and minimal light is not just a light. It is in fact, a stylish and the most useful modern accessory for carrying along every day. \n What is Pisa Light\n        At RHEEA Tech, we have meticulously crafted this small light. This miniature light is most elegantly designed. The small size will make it your best companion besides ensuring your safety during darkness. We are happy to share that we have taken your convenience to the next level by creating this light as a rechargeable light. So, you can save your money on frequently changing the battery. As it comes with a keychain, you can\njust attach your keys that you should carry along with you.\nPISA LIGHT is designed  both a trendy accessory and a practical EDC item.\n    At RHEEA Tech, we have meticulously crafted this small light.

So, you can save your money on frequently changing the battery. As it comes with a keychain, you can just attach your keys that you should carry along with you.     You can recharge this gadget on your mobile phone using a USB cable. Even, you can charge it on a power socket using your mobile adapter or on your computer. The colorful designs will make it the best companion if you are highly particular about your style.\nUser Friendly, Stylish Design, It's PISA Light\n Excellent and Attractive Set of Features:  \n   This key chain light will turn out to be special as against other such lights available in the market because of its excellent set of features. Here, let us introduce the features:  \nIt's A Light For Night Time, And Is A Decoration In Day Time. \nPowerful Brightness:   \n    You can compare the brightness provided by other such tiny lights that come with 4 button cell batteries. Yes, our light will bring you 5 lm additional brightness without requiring you to change the button cell batteries that cost you more. Yes, when normal flash lights bring you 10 lm as the utmost brightness, you will get 15 lm brightness from PISA. \n15 lm is powerful for such a small light.\nWater Resistance:  \nIn some instances, you might get caught in the rain when you carry the light. To make sure that the rain does not affect the brightness of the light, we at RHEEA Tech have designed this light as a water resistant flash light. So, you can stay confident about having a companion even in rainy season when power outages are common to happen.\nWater Resistance Is Necessary For Outdoor Using.\nSmall Size and Light Weight:  \nIn addition to being smaller in appearance, the light is also designed as a lightweight model. Most people do not want to carry a heavy and large flashlight. We have rightly understood this requirement and so we have managed the technical limitation of size of rechargeable flashlight. Yes, this is the world\u2019s smallest rechargeable flashlight at the present situation. Even though you carry it along with you wherever you go, you will never feel it.\nPISA Is The World's Smallest Flashlight Now.\nCharging Indicator:  \nThis small flash light comes with a charging indicator. This will ensure that the light is not over charged or undercharged. Yes, charging indicator is attractively designed in such a small body by our technicians. Once charged, the indicator light will switch off automatically.\nRed Light Indicator Built In. \nRechargeable: \n    This is a feature that is highly worthy.

Many thanks again to everyone who has supported us so far!\nWelcome to the world of John T. Draper, better known as Captain Crunch, the original \"Phone Phreak\". From his early days of facing off against Ma Bell to his current role in public speaking and privacy advocacy, it\u2019s hard to overstate his impact on the world of technology. Along the way, he developed some of the most influential tools of the computer revolution, from the first working word processor in the seventies to the first effective firewall in the nineties. The road hasn\u2019t always been smooth, however, and for every success there have been setbacks and hurdles of literary proportion. Let\u2019s just call it Draperism. \nThis \"warts and all\" biography features Draper's own telling of stories from the past fifty years, as well as commentary and other memories from his long-time friend and collaborator. It is the story of an eccentric genius who went from being a penniless hacker to a millionaire and back again, a man so consumed by his vision that the real world around him has always played second fiddle. Featuring a foreword by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and cameos by the who\u2019s who of early computing, this Kerouacian journey gives us an inside look at the birth of modern computing through the eyes of one of its most influential pioneers.\nNow we are in the full campaign, and after the first week of Early Bird support, the 2600 Club Bronze level is still available, and we've unlocked all the other levels. Add-ons can be added at checkout at the end of the campaign.\n2600 CLUB\nEarly bird backer level carried forward to the full campaign\n2600 Bronze: Ebook; Vector of book artwork; VIP website access\n   \nEASYWRITER CLUB\nSigned, soft-cover copy of the book; Vector image of book artwork\n  \nHOMEBREW CLUB\nSigned, hard-cover copy of the book; Vector image of book artwork\n  \nCRUNCHBOX CLUB\nVIP will include access to downloadable book art, deleted sections and more.\n  Exclusive Blue Box styled Collector box with a signed soft-cover copy of book; Vector image of book artwork; Exclusive replica of the infamous whistle; Mouthpiece Bookmark; VIP website membership\n    HACKERS, HEROES AND DRAPERISM\nThis level is a replacement for our \u2018Old School Hackers\u2019 level. It contains an exclusive, limited edition (50) \u2018DRAPERISM\u2019 T-Shirt, signed by Crunchman and numbered (e.g. 4 of 50).

You get TEN of each item found in the Blue Box Club, plus a 1 on 1 with The Crunchman himself. This is also absolutely transferrable. The 1 on 1 can either be, you coming to meet Crunch, or Crunch coming to you. So, you can band together with a bunch of your buddies, or if your philanthropy hat is on, you can purchase this tier for an underfunded group or project.\nYOU CAN CHOOSE how to use this tier.\nSome ideas from us:\n(1) You and some buddies pitch in and get this reward level. Each of you gets schwag, and Crunch can come to you for a meet and greet.\n(2) You back this level and donate it to the local community college IT department, or local non profit, and they can set up a Crunch related event. Sell tickets! Have a Party!\n(3) You back this level yourself, go to Vegas, have dinner with Crunch, maybe see a show, etc. Then give away/sell/donate all extra items to local groups you think need to know about Crunch. (or you keep it all for yourself!)\nAnd there's more! For our Kickstarter we've created some additional goodies that will not be found anywhere else. T-shirts, posters and our extra little exclusives are available as add ons.  As we are using BackerKit, you can add these items, and manage your add-ons after the Kickstarter is finished.\n*Disclaimer: Actual items may vary slightly based on stocks and supplies from manufacturers.\nT-Shirts\nT-Shirts: 'Phreak', 2600 and Old School 'HACKERS' - $25 each\nPrints\n18\" x 24\" Book art prints, printed on premium semigloss (170gsm): Book cover and 2600 - $20 each | Bookmarks - $1\n Book bags\nJute book bags: 'Phreak' and 2600 - $18 each\nExtras\nBlack Anonabox Pro - $85 | VIP Membership - $10 | Exclusive replica of the infamous whistle - $8\n   Level Specific Stretch Goals\nIf we sell out of the Blue Box level we have a one on one zoom conference.\nFinancial Stretch Goals\n$26,000: Everyone gets a signed thank you letter from Mr Draper.\n$52,000: Everyone gets interactive pdf that links parts of the book to corresponding anecdotes, photographs and materials on the VIP section of the website.\n$78,000: Unlocks a 'udemy' style seminar with Mr Draper.\n$104,000: Unlocks a book signing event in Las Vegas with Mr Draper and special guests.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know who Mr Draper is: John Thomas Draper (aka Captain Crunch) was an early pioneering developer at Apple Computer, in the mid to late 1970s. Among other things he developed the 'Charlie Board', an early version of a PC modem predating the DC Hayes modem. He also wrote the first word processing program, EasyWriter, for the Apple II and beat Bill Gates to the punch when it was bundled with the first IBM PC.\nIn the decades that followed Mr Draper worked with various notable people. In the 1980's he worked on Advanced 3-D Graphic Design Systems at Autodesk. In the 1990's he developed a revolutionary computer security system, considered un-hackable at the time.\nBefore all of that, he was an outlaw. In the early 1970's he was one of the 'Phone Phreaks', a group of enthusiasts who found various ways to hack the phone company and get free calls. Mr Draper became the most infamous member, and taught a lot of other people what he knew. He introduced Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs to the \u2018Blue Box\u2019, the device he used to perform some of his crimes. Steve Jobs is quoted as saying that without the Blue Box, there would be no Apple Computer. Mr Draper was hunted by the FBI for years, and went to prison three times.\nIn the last decade he has toured the world, telling his story, and speaking publicly about security flaws in telecommunications, online privacy, and encryption.\nThe Narrative\nThis book recounts stories from my years of knowing John T. Draper personally, interspersed with collected memories from his friends and relatives, and John\u2019s personal history in his own words. It spans his 74 years on the planet, and my 22 years of knowing him.\nI have been John's roommate several times, business partner, and close friend over the years. I have always considered him a very interesting case for character study, and an unfathomable wealth of complexities and paradoxes.\nI hope to have portrayed him in an honest but affectionate light. A balanced portrait of the incredible story that is his life.\n- Craig Wilson Fraser\nJohn T. Draper & Craig Wilson Fraser, Spain, 2015\n  The Foreword\nThe foreword to the biography was written by renowned inventor, electronics engineer and programmer Steve Wozniak. Mr Wozniak, along with Steve Jobs, co-founded Apple Computer. Mr Wozniak has worked with Mr Draper a few times over the years, and has remained a long standing friend and ally.\nJohn T. Draper & Steve Wozniak, 2004\n   The Excerpts\nChildhood anecdote by brother, Ron Draper\nThere was this \u2018mom and pop\u2019 super market at the end of Edith St. in Petaluma, called 'The A & B market'. It had light bulbs and licorice. John wanted bulbs. PR-2\u2019s, PR-4 flashlight bulbs, and batteries, but as usual we had no money. Our mom would not concede to John\u2019s wishes this time (these 'wishes' turned into outright demands when he became a teen), so we resorted to theft.\nI can honestly say it wasn\u2019t my idea. We had never stolen anything up to this point. I think I was blackmailed actually, but my dim memories don\u2019t have the details. We thought we would use my calm demeanor and appointed me to actually steal most of the stuff. So, I was the one caught by the store manager as we were walking out.\nWe were asked to empty our pockets. I don\u2019t remember what John had, but my pockets were loaded. I mean really loaded. 110v light bulbs, Christmas tree light bulbs, flashlight bulbs, AA batteries for my pen light (well, I thought, while I\u2019m at it). I remember the store clerk adding up all the charges and it came to quite an amount.\nJohn and the Phone Phreaks\nI got a phone call from someone calling himself Denny San Jose, who told me he knew about various methods of making free phone calls. He also said there was this whistle that blew the magic tone that disconnects long distance calls, and that he had a spare. He asked me if I could drive him to San Francisco so he could show me how it worked.\n---\nI began to realise there was more to these guys than I first thought. They were a connected and organized group, and seemed to be inviting me to join. When the discussion got around to our trip to Burlingame, we talked about what my \u2018handle\u2019 should be. Most people had just chosen their first name and city, like \u2018Denny San Jose\u2019 or \u2018Bill from New York\u2019. Well, \u2018John San Jose\u2019 was already taken, so I said \u2018how about Captain Crunch?\u2019\nThe first bust\nI suspected the FBI knew about me even before the Esquire article was released, but I had no idea how much they wanted to collar me. Up to that point all they had was the name Captain Crunch, but no way of finding out who I actually was. Most of the blind kids didn't know my phone number, and those who did had no need to write it down, but of course eventually I made the mistake of giving my number to the wrong person.\n---\nI made sure that I had removed all of my 'forbidden equipment' from my car, and stashed it in my gym locker. I took a non-working Blue Box out of my locker to take home and fix, put it in the back of my car then started the drive home. I stopped at a 7-11 to get a soda. I parked in a small parking lot next to a middle school, and just as I got out of the car, four FBI agents swooped down on me, handcuffed me, and read me my rights.\nLompoc Prison\nIn the 70's and 80's, they called Lompoc a Country Club. It was even home to Nixon's sleazy Watergate lawyer for a while, as well as many other celebrity prisoners. Contrary to popular lore however, it did not have a swimming pool, but it did have a nice gym, tennis courts, and Volleyball courts. I\u2019m not sure that it still has those facilities these days. Apparently the whole place was turned into a medium security prison in the 90s, with proper fences and razor wire.\n---\nAfter a few weeks I was promoted to landscaping. It mainly consisted of cleaning. My supervisor was a guy named Easton. I used to watch this guy while I was outside cleaning his windows. He had this habit of sucking on his walkie-talkie 'rubber duck' antenna. I'd giggle as I imagined him as a suckling baby pig, wiggling his ears in pure bliss. One day I was in his office emptying his trash bin, and he got called out of his office. I couldn't believe he left me in there. I went looking through his files, but didn't find anything of much worth, then I checked out his phone to see if I could access anything outside of the prison.\nJohn Thomas Draper - Co-author\nMr Draper is a computer pioneer, privacy advocate, and public speaker. He rose to prominence in the early phone phreaking movement of the 1970's before working on some of the most ground-breaking projects of the emerging computer era. He has lived in several US states and travelled extensively, often for months at a time. He currently lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is involved with various projects concerning privacy, piracy, and security.\nCraig Wilson Fraser - Co-author and editor\nMr Wilson is an author, artist and graphic designer. He has been close friends with Mr Draper for over twenty years, and they have enjoyed many adventures together. Originally from the United Kingdom, he spent several years in the United States and currently lives with his family in southern Spain.\nWe are keeping this as simple as possible. Six tiers of backer support with six simple reward packages. There is a support level for every budget.\nFor early bird backers there are Ebooks, pre-released ahead of our publishing date. If you pledge the second tier of $20, you\u2019re basically pre-ordering a first-edition signed paperback copy of the book. At the other end of the spectrum for the most devoted Crunch fans, there are some very special rewards, including some 1-on-1 time with Mr Draper himself.\nThe funds raised in the Kickstarter will be used towards printing and shipping your book. The books will be printed by Friesen Press in Victoria, Canada, shipped to our authors to be signed, and then sent for distribution to our US base.\nThe funds will also be used to pay for the costs incurred in producing the rest of the backer support level items. Every time we exceed one of our goals, we've added stretch goals in order to provide each backer with more and more value to their backer kit.\n    Reward Fulfilment, Project Timeline, & Shipping\nWhen this campaign ends on December 5, all backers will get a final check out survey sent via email. We'll collect your shipping/fulfillment information. Here you'll be able to choose from available add-ons, such as T-Shirts, Book Bags, Extra Copies of Books and other items. Until then just sit back and relax and thank you for your support! We have every intention of producing and shipping our rewards starting shortly after our funding campaign ends.\n***Please note:  Shipping costs are fully calculated at final checkout.  You are responsible for shipping and any applicable taxes, if applicable.  Book-only orders may be shipped via media mail within the continental US.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING:\nWe will use either USPS or UPS and each order will have insurance and a tracking number.\nThe books are already written and just in final editing phase.  On the last day of the campaign, we'll have a pretty good idea of how many copies we're ordering for print and we'll order them as soon as our final check out surveys are completed.  We estimate lead time and manufacture time on our rewards at 6-12 weeks, which puts us at about February/March for fulfillment. \nWwe plan to have rewards shipped no later than March 31, 2018 and you will most likely receive yours no more than 8 business days later.  \nDigital items, aside from PDF books will be fulfilled just as soon as backer funding is cleared and delivery addresses are finalized.  PDF books will be delivered 2-4 weeks prior to printed materials, depending on whether stretch goals are unlocked, which would increase production time on ebooks.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\nAll rewards will be shipped using USPS as the carrier, sent Priority Mail, will arrive within 6-10 business days, no tracking number or insurance provided.\nThe books are already written and just in final editing phase.

This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. There is a possibility that international backers may receive their rewards at a later date depending on the customs, sorting, and shipping procedures of their destination country.\nREFUNDS, RETURNS, WARRANTY\nWe do not offer refunds or returns on any items that are received as a Kickstarter reward.  However, we will address concerns on a case by case basis, as your satisfaction is important to us.  We know you understand.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell, in all honesty, we are novices at Kickstarter. But please don't let that worry you! We have conferred and consulted with the best of the best. Experienced crowd funders and people at the top of their fields. Because this has been a labour of love for the whole team and nobody's taken a salary, we've done the best we can with what we have. That said - we think we've planned it out pretty good along the way.\n\nPossible obstacles:\n\nGetting the book done. \n\nTo address this, we decided not to even start the Kickstarter campaign until we were on the last step before actual publishing/printing. We chose to wait until all the writing was done, and nearly all the editing. By the time the KS launches, the last editing process will be nearly complete (if not already complete) so the only thing left will be the logistics of printing set up and detail. Then, when the KS is finished, we will have numbers and can print pretty much immediately, which greatly shortens the process for you - our backers. Of course, there could be some unforeseables in there, but we've built some padding into our timeline.\n\nBacker reward fulfillment delays:\n\nLet's face it, sometimes things happen that are out of our control. We've done everything in our power to identify reliable vendors where we have to rely on outside vendors to produce items for us. We've mapped out lead times, and kept fulfillment to digital formats and within our control as much as possible. \n\nWe've finalized our designs, mocked up our rewards and completed every process aside from pulling the trigger on order amounts. \n\nOf course we'll keep you all apprised if anything beyond our control occurs, but we think we've darn near thought of everything and anticipate being right on track.\n\nWhat if you don't get funded?\n\nWe think we've set a pretty reasonable funding goal, so we don't think that this will happen. But, if it does, then we'll still publish the book - you just won't be able to get all these awesome extras. You'll be able to buy copies on the publisher's website, when it is published and available to the public. \n\nWe hope this does not happen, of course. We worked hard to bring you an awesome campaign and we hope you take advantage of it and encourage all your peeps to do the same thing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Go Team Crunch!", "descp": "This is a support level that allows you to just throw a bit of money at us to show your support.

People have done farm to table for years, as have chocolateers done bean to bar. We intend to follow this tradition with something new, taking sugar cane and making candy from it.\nLofty Pursuits has been making hard candy for some time. We had another Kickstarter several years back where we raised money to buy a collection of hard candy making equipment that was from a candy store in Cincinnati called Mullanes. We have used this equipment made between the 1860's and 1900 making candy using standard sugar.\nNow we want to make candy not just using equipment from the late 1800's. But starting with sugar grown on a farm from the 1800's. Tallahassee has a historical farm that is maintained and worked as if it was in the 1800's. They still make cane syrup here, and they still cook the syrup over a wood fire.\nWe've worked with them since last year, and we're about to go through a second harvest and cooking to make a video about it. That's where you come in. We need your support to make this video.\nThis is one of a series of videos we want to make that has little to do with the candy we make. In this case we are making a video about a candy that we don't think can become a regular product. What we make will be the rewards for here. Our stretch goals are for videos that are of other folks making candy. We call this series \"Travels with Greg\" and not only don't they generate sales to offset the videos, but they are expensive to make. They are also the videos I enjoy making the most because I get to get out and learn or discover things. You can see the three I made here.\nThis project will produce one long video (expected 1/2 hour) or possibly three to four shorter videos. We need to see the footage to decide what we will be doing with this video. This does not include the stretch videos that will be additional videos. \nPart one: Harvesting sugar cane, making cane syrup.\nPart two: Working with that sugar to make hard candy.\nI want to Include in this video a lot of history on the machines from the 1800's we use, this will include a trip to where the equipment was used in Cincinnati, a trip to the remains of a large plantation where they have what's left of a steam powered cane juicer.\nThere is a lot of experimentation here that we hope to get into the video, and of course we will make some unique candy using ingredients grown here in the Tallahassee area.\nIf you know of us, you know of our YouTube channel, if not check it out. http://www.Youtube.com/LoftyPursuits\nWe have a lot of candy experience, and a lot of candy making video experience. You can check our our candy store here: http://www.pd.net\nYou can of course buy our regular candy here even if you don't want to pledge this campaign.\nWe hope you will support this investigation into the past and future of candy making\nAmazing! It took about 2 hours to become fully funded, and we\u2019re still going.\nSince we have you here, and we\u2019d love to do more, here is what we will do with extra funding. Keep in mind this is a plan, some of these things might not work out, but I really want to try. (new rewards coming soon) These goals are divided into three things, things I can't normally afford to do. \nCool travels with greg videos, where I go around the country to find old or other cool candy makers and make candy with them\nWe already donate a bunch of candy every year to good causes, but I'd like to have myself and my staff make candy to donate around the country this holiday season. With this one we are looking for your suggestions where to donate the candy canes we will make, and when we have a list we approve, the backers will have a chance to vote to where we will send them.\nWe've traveled in 2015 to the Makers Fair in Orlando. There is no cost effective way for us to do go on the road, there events like this just can't buy enough candy to make it worth while for us to go.  Since we get regular requests to come and make candy where you are (that we can't do), we thought we'd add this as a reward. I want to ideally do four of these in the USA. Central south, Central north, North East, West coast. We are currently working out plans to be in the Austin makers fair (food permission always makes this tricky due to food contracts with the halls they have the event.) We are open to suggestions of other places to go as long as the public can come. \nNow on to the stretch goals\nWe will make another video in 2018, where we modify a whiskey still to become a steam distiller to distill flavors for candy making from plants. We will probably only be able to make a few ML\u2019s of the essential oils, but I want to try and make some. If we can make enough we will make some candy out of it, if not it should still be cool going from local plants to flavor oils (I hope to do grapefruit oil from a tree in my back yard.) This uses the same techniques I described as being used in the video where we make lavender candy. If we can make enough we will try and throw in a few pieces of candy with your pledge (1 or 2 small pieces, it won\u2019t make much oil) ave some water in it.)\nDONE! $8,000\nWe will travel sometime in 2018 to the Hercules Candy Company featured in the No Egg Craig videos to shoot a video with them at their shop. I hope to learn about gummies and corn starch molded candy, but I will shoot whatever they are making then.\nHercules Candy and Chocolate Shop\nDONE! $23,000  \n    We are known for our candy canes, and every year we make candy canes for giveaways and charities. This year you can help us make and give away even more of them. We will make a four of our standard batches of candy canes (approximately 400 hand made candy canes) that we will distribute to a charity to bring some cheer this holiday season. We are researching charities that can effectively distribute these (if you know of some, let us know) we will get an \u201capproved\u201d list together and have our backers vote to select the one (or ones) to donate to.\nDONE! $26,000\n  Uncle Wiggly Wings\nI will go and interview Uncle Wiggly Wings AKA the Berlin Candy Bomber at his home. I've gotten in touch with him through his daughter and arranged a shooting time early next year if we reach this goal. Colonel Gail Halvorsen was a C-54 pilot for the Berlin air lift during WWII, he was one of the first to land with supplies in Berlin after the Soviet Union started the siege on the city. He went to the fence of the air field and found kids watching the planes land, some of whom may never have tasted chocolate because they were born during the war. He passed out the candy bars he had, and the kids divided it up, but there was not nearly enough. When the chocolate ran out, they tore little pieces of the foil off and passed them around, so the kids who did not get any could just smell the candy. He agreed to drop more candy from his plane the next day. The kids asked what is plane number was, and as he did not have an assigned plane (he flew whatever they gave him for the day) he drew on his barn storming experience and would \u201cwiggle\u201d his wings. That night back in his barracks, he got candy bars, tied them to handkerchiefs to use as parachutes (to keep the candy from hitting the kids at 200mph), and for the next week he dropped candy daily to the kids. He was about to stop dropping the candy but his commander got wind of this, and insisted he continue because of the great moral boost it was. He dropped 23 tons of candy during project \u201clittle vittles\u201d with the other pilots that worked with him, much of the candy donated by members of the National Confectioner's Association. One of the candy companies that supplied candy was Mullanes, that originally owned much of the hard candy equipment we use. We will to visit him, interview him, and make some candy for him, inspired by his story. His story has been documented many times, but has never covered how he got candy companies to participate and how the candy was organized. This will be documenting something new. He is currently 97, so we want to do this soon as possible.\n$31,000\n   We are known for our candy canes, and every year we make candy canes for giveaways and charities. This year you can help us make and give away even more of them. We will make a four of our standard batches of candy canes (approximately 400 hand made candy canes) that we will distribute to a charity to bring some cheer this holiday season. We are researching charities that can effectively distribute these (if you know of some, let us know) we will get an \u201capproved\u201d list together and have our backers vote to select the one (or ones) to donate to.\n$34,000\nWe will travel to another event to make candy hopefully closer to you. We are open to suggestions for events, we just want them big enough so lots of people can come. We are currently working on the Austin Makers Fair in 2018, but we are open to other locations if you have suggestions. We hope to raise enough money to do three of these in 2018.\n$39,000\n  Robert Hillary King was wrongly convicted and spent 32 years in Angola prison in Louisiana, 29 of them in solitary confinement. He learned how to make pralines when it solitary confinement, by burning paper in soda cans to cook the candies and he gathered ingredients from other prisoners and guards. This is the ultimate candy hacking to figure out how to do this. Since the charges have been dropped he has been released and now makes candy that he sells on-line under the name Freelines. His autobiography is a must read (but sadly covers little in the way of candy making.) We hope to document his story, and how he discovered how to make candy in prison, and we'd like to make candy with Mr. King. \n$44,000\n   We are known for our candy canes, and every year we make candy canes for giveaways and charities. This year you can help us make and give away even more of them. We will make a four of our standard batches of candy canes (approximately 400 hand made candy canes) that we will distribute to a charity to bring some cheer this holiday season. We are researching charities that can effectively distribute these (if you know of some, let us know) we will get an \u201capproved\u201d list together and have our backers vote to select the one (or ones) to donate to.\n$47,000\nWe will travel to another event to make candy hopefully closer to you. We are open to suggestions for events, we just want them big enough so lots of people can come. We hope to raise enough money to do three of these in 2018. Charity events are a great start. We have some requirements.\n$52,000\nWe want to visit a candy factory in Salem MA, we are still trying to get up with them to arrange this, so this goal may change before we hit this level if we even come close. This shop makes the oldest commercially manufactured candy in the USA. We want to make candy with them. We will flesh this out if it comes together.\n$Unknown\n(more to come)\nI\u2019ve been outlining this, researching this and finding people to work with for about two years. We want to trace the sugar trade to the development of the candy trade, from Haiti and the slave trade to sugar, to the Indo-Guyanese indentured workers in guyana. I want to visit both countries and shoot footage starting there, and tracing the sugar\u2019s path up into the north east to Philadelphia, where it was processed not only into Rum to ship to England, but also to create Americas candy trade. This is why companies like Hershey\u2019s, Wilber\u2019s chocolates, Quaker City Chocolate, Jordon Almonds, Peeps, Mike and Ikes, Hot Tamales, Mallo Cups, and others were based there. This is also why Thomas Mills and Brothers, the company that made most of our equipment (they made it back in the late 1800\u2019s) was based there too. It will follow the sugar up and through the great lakes to Chicago, were candy making took off, and one company was founded to fund a religious cult (The cult is gone, but his candy is still around.) Then, if I can, I want to stretch project this project to see how sugar and more specifically candy making in the modern day has still shaped culture, race relations, and candy makers. This topic has been covered in many places, but it\u2019s role in the development of candy making has not. This will not be as cheery as most of my videos. This project should take about 2-3 years to make if funded. It is a big one folks and will require a crew, international travel, possibly another round of funding. I already have two candy historians on board to help beyond me. The final video will be released to all backers at any level free, but may be released commercially or free. I have been working on an outline for this project for two years, and I hope you find it as interesting as I do. If I don't get full funding for this, we get funding over time from other fundraising efforts.\n$150,000\nReward Photos\nWe have been asked to show some photos of our rewards. \nOld Glory Candy\n  A unicorn dropping. This is a particular nice tutti frutti one. Yours will be of a random flavor.\n  Candy Canes", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are some risks with this, but few with the video production. We have lots of experience making candy videos, and the video is the main product. The risks are with the outcome of the candy, and we hope you all want to be part of this experiment. Like many experiments we are not 100% sure of what the outcome will be.\n\nCane sugar by its nature has particles in it. It could crystallize, it could burn; this is fairly unexplored territory in candy making. This is science more than an art in many ways, so we don't expect any issues. But here are the ones we can foresee and what we will do if they happen.\n\nThere will be testing time needed with this candy. And by testing, I mean making a small batch and seeing what the candy will do in a week or two. We need to test of crystallization, that we want to avoid, as well as if the candy breaks down in other ways. This will be lots of hurry up and wait. We have budgeted for that time in the dates for the rewards, but it could take longer than those dates if this happens. If this problem occurs we will keep you informed, and we will just get you your candy a bit late.\n\nThe cane sugar may crystallize in tests because it won't invert with an acid. \nSolution: We will add some invert sugar to prevent crystallization (probably a small amount of corn syrup) so your candy will be great, but it will not be only made entirely from cane syrup. Just mostly from cane syrup.\n\nThe cane sugar might not harden completely since cane syrup is more of a hydrophile than granulated sugar. This would mean the candy will be sticky. Solution: You will get a bag of sticky but yummy candy.\n\nThere is always the possibility that everything could got wrong and we have no cane syrup candy to ship. Solution: The real goal of this kickstarter is to make the video, and a video of failure is an interesting video as well. To make it up to you we will make some cool hand made candy (possibly with the word \u201coops\u201d in the middle of it) so that you end up with some delicious candy. \n\nWe will get you candy, and we expect to get you the candy you want, but we will deliver something in any event.\n\nRisk for some of the stretch goal videos:\nWe want to interview a man who is 97 years old. Enough said.\n\nWe are still arranging to make sure these videos can be made.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard", "descp": "A thank you post card with a photo of us making this candy.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Lofty Stickers", "descp": "Get a strip of three of our Lofty Pursuits candy stickers and a post card as a thank you for the level of sponsorship.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card\nThree Lofty Pursuits Stickers\nDownloadable copy of the video", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Lost Flavors Taster Assortment", "descp": "A selection of rare candy drops from Lofty Pursuits.

Each one is different.\nThey\u2019re being launched exclusively on Kickstarter. If we meet our target we can put them into production - giving you beautiful one-of-a-kind tableware and us the opportunity to expand and continue investing in our neighbourhood.\nWho we are\nGranby Workshop is a Liverpool based manufacturer of architectural ceramics, founded by Turner Prize winning design collective Assemble. The Workshop was set up as part of an effort to rebuild Granby, a Liverpool neighbourhood that was nearly made derelict by decades of poorly-planned regeneration initiatives.\nA resourceful, creative group of residents started to bring the neighbourhood back to life by clearing, planting, painting, and campaigning. And in 2011 they entered into an innovative form of community land ownership to secure empty houses, and renovate them as affordable homes \u2013 bringing in Assemble to help. \nThe project won the Turner Prize in 2015. It received a lot of press attention and you can read more about it in The New York Times, The Guardian, The BBC, Creative Review and more\nThe first range of products by Granby Workshop were designed for the houses being renovated: bathroom tiles, door handles and fireplaces. They reflected the care, value and creativity invested in these homes, and are now even held in the permanent collections of the V&A and the Crafts Council.\nNow we want to introduce new products to help grow the workshop and expand the team. You\u2019ll get beautiful one-of-a-kind tableware, and we\u2019ll be able to keep producing exciting new products, and investing in Granby.  \nThe Products\nWe\u2019re beginning a foray into an exciting new manufacturing process with a pair of products: a plate and cup. This is our very first range of tableware and it\u2019s a nod to the social side of the community that we\u2019re in.\nIt\u2019s also part of an effort to scale up our approach \u2013 one that began by researching and tracking down RAMBO, our 60 tonne RAM Press. With this new tool, we want to combine our craft mentality with more industrial processes, in order to really push the limits of what we can create.\nThese are plates and cups for eating and drinking together, produced in sets, with each set showing the variety of patterns produced through the SPLATWARE process.\nThey are playful & celebratory, perfect for special occasions but durable enough for everyday use!\nSPLATWARE #1 : Cup\nSuitable for hot and cold drinks. This isn\u2019t a teacup, a mug, a goblet or a chalice. It is a cup, as simple as it comes. Just about the right size for most things you\u2019d like to drink. It comes in one size (8oz) but many different patterns and colours. Cheers !\nSPLATWARE #2 : Plate \nA circular, 25cm diameter glazed ceramic plate. Suitable for all kinds of tasty meals. \nThe Finish \nThe effect created by combining these multi-coloured clays is reminiscent of Agateware or Nerikomi ceramics. Like these traditional craft techniques, the patterning is not a glaze effect or transfer \u2013 the clay itself is coloured through the body, giving a unique depth of colour and finish.\nThe pieces are glazed and fired to vitrification temperature at 1250 celsius, meaning they are completely food, dishwasher & microwave safe. They are durable enough to be kept as family heirlooms for generations to come.\nThe first edition of splatware is exclusive to Kickstarter and all products will be stamped. As well as being functional objects, you could see them as affordable art pieces - perfect as a gift or a keepsake, and who knows, one day they might even be collectible.\nSplatware is made using a process that captures an element of chance in the act of making, so they\u2019re all unique. Exact colours and patterns will be something of a surprise. \n How they're made\nTo stoneware clay, we add varying amounts of ceramic pigments. Separate pieces of the colorful clays are placed together in a mould and compressed with 60 tonnes of pressure. This mixes and bonds the different colours together and forces the excess moisture out of the clay. \nThe pieces are stamped, de-moulded, dried, carefully trimmed and cleaned before their first kiln firing to 1000 degrees. They\u2019re then sanded, glazed and re-fired to 1250 to reach full hardness. It\u2019s a blend of precision craft and backyard science that has taken a great deal of trial and error to perfect.\nWhy do these products matter?\nCeramics has been integral to the development of our cultures. From tools for cooking and eating to the production of durable building materials, its history interweaves the functioning of our daily lives with the development of industry.\nThe potters wheel was one of the first man-made machines, and in the 18th & 19th Century, ceramics became one of the first highly industrialized processes. In Stoke on Trent, Wedgewood and others pioneered factory-line models of production, based around singular, highly repetitive tasks. Speed, repetition and consistency. Every product produced exactly the same. This is more or less how most mass-produced ceramics are still made, except that with the globalization of manufacturing it largely happens in other parts of the world.\nWe\u2019re interested in a different model of production, one in which chance and creativity are introduced to the production line, so that products remain enjoyable and challenging to make, and the outcomes are always different. We also believe that our business should be community-orientated - about developing and sharing skills and facilities in our neighbourhood.\nGranby Workshop Wares\nImportantly, this model is not just about how things work behind the scenes \u2013 it\u2019s about creating products which have a diversity and beauty which isn\u2019t possible using conventional manufacturing techniques. Every product is different.\nWhat have we done so far?\nSplatware began by researching and tracking down RAMBO, our 60 tonne RAM Press. It is no spring chicken - we bought it from a ceramics factory in Stoke-on-trent, where in a past life it was producing fine bone china sweet and biscuit trays. Weighing in at 5000kgs it\u2019s a beast, so much so that it broke the floor of the factory that it was removed from.\nMilan Mini Living - Test plates\nBefore arriving in Granby, Rambo went on a test run journey to Milan to be part of Milan Design Week where, with the support of A/D/O we first began developing the techniques that have evolved into Splatware.\nBack in Granby, we extended the workshop to make room for RAMBO, and have undertaken countless tests and experiments with different clays, stains and techniques to develop a method for making SPLATWARE that retains its coherance as a set of tableware but allows for variety and experimentation in each individual piece. With our first set of moulds made we\u2019ve produced a full batch of prototypes, allowing us to test our initial designs and run through the full production cycle. Having done this, we\u2019ve adjusted and improved the designs to work better with the physics of the ram-pressing process and now we\u2019re ready to get production moulds made. \nWhy are we on Kickstarter?\nYour support will mean that we can make you beautiful products and we can continue to invest in our neighbourhood.\nWe\u2019ve already invested a lot in this new process, and we need a large order to be able to go into production and to be able to sell the products at a reasonable price. We\u2019ll be able to buy materials in bulk, commission high quality production moulds and continue to invest in the workshop to expand our capacity for the future. This will include allowing us to install a larger kiln, drying racks and most importantly, to train new staff.\nWe\u2019re a creative, community-orientated business. By supporting our campaign you are helping to launch an exclusive range of products that have been developed and made in Granby.\nEach set will be made to order, by us, for you and they\u2019ll all be different. We hope they serve you well for many meals to come !\nThank you !\nGranby Workshop & Assemble\nTimeline\nWe won\u2019t compromise on quality, and since we won\u2019t know the level of demand until the campaign ends, we\u2019ve set realistic dates to avoid disappointment. We know some of these dates seem long, but quality comes first and we would rather surprise you with early delivery then risk not meeting your expectations.\n9th September \u2013 5th October \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign\nOctober: Order materials, manufacture production moulds \nNovember: Fit production moulds, Batch-mix clay with pigments.

We have come to realize that setbacks can happen, but having produced a full prototype batch of products from start to finish, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve ironed out the lions share of these issues. Anything that we encounter along the way, well that\u2019s always part of the journey but we have a great team and we\u2019re in no doubt that we\u2019ll be able to deal with it. It\u2019s a step up in our production methods but that\u2019s part of the challenge and why its worthwhile.\n\nIf the campaign really takes off, some of you may have to wait a little longer for your products since we have to make each of them individually and we have a limited production capacity. We\u2019ve tried to be conservative with our timeline and we\u2019ll keep you fully updated along the way and promise that your unique, one-of-a-kind splatware cups and plates will be well worth the wait.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Splatware Print", "descp": "A beautiful limited edition print by Granby Workshop's own Sumuyya Khader.

The cutlery cluster of Wazirabad is recognized all over the world for its traditional designs, unique products, high quality, hand-made products such as hunting knives, pocket knives, daggers, swords, axes, military knives, utensils, table cutlery, household and light industrial products.\nWairabad - The City Of Cutlery\n In Pakistan the cutlery industry has not experienced technological evolution and thus has not benefited from the economies of scale. The industry comprises of small and medium scale industries. This sector has been facing great challenges particularly from China, India and Taiwan which have grabbed a large chunk of Pakistan\u2019s export market. The declining trend in cutlery export has been due to a rise in petroleum and diesel prices. The rise in prices of oil has further increased the input cost of the industry and made it difficult for them to survive in the international market\n  Damascus\nTraditional Damascus steel, also known as Pattern Weld, Damascene, or Damast, was first produced over two thousand years ago. Damascus swords and knives dominated the weapon industry from the Iron Age to the Viking age. Alexander the Great was said to have had a Damascus sword, and even Aristotle commented on the high quality of the Damascus steel blade. Damascus steel was the name that the Crusaders gave to the steel that they had witnessed slicing through their own, lesser quality swords, cutting the sword in half in a single swipe without ever losing its edge. The next swipe would do the same to the body of that less fortunate Crusader.\nKHANJAR\nProject by :\n  YOUR CONTRIBUTION\nI am introducing finest piece of arts from our family business back in Pakistan (Wazirabad) DK-Cutlery.

You turn the inner dial to the set number and start deciphering his message letter by letter until it comes together! Once decoded, you can ponder Wilbur's mysterious words and interpret them on your own. These secret messages will be at the end of each blog post.\nThe Official Membership Card is signed and approved by Wilbur Wonder to signify that you are a part of the elite Futurist Co. Society. Attached to the membership card is the The Futurist Co. Lapel Pin. Wear your pin proud on a jacket, backpack, or bag and it will catch someone's eye.\nThe Official Golden Certificate. This certificate can be hung or displayed to show that you are a true Futurist! If you want to keep your membership a secret, then storing it away as a keepsake in a nice hiding spot will do as well.\nThe Futurist Co. introduces The Wilbur Wonder Almanac 2018-2023! Take a peak into the future with the Almanac that many would love to get their hands on! This Almanac will only be issued to members of The Futurist Co. Secret Society! DO NOT SHOW OR GIVE THIS TO ANYONE WHO IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE FUTURIST CO. That is all I can say about this book. Aren't you curious?\nWho Is Wilbur Wonder?  \nThe mystery which surrounds The Futurist Co. is stirred up by Wilbur Wonder. He is a time traveler who visits the future from time to time (yes they are out there). You think I'm joking, don't you? I assure you this isn't some kind of stunt, and to prove it, he will speak of his travels. This type of behavior, however, is quite dangerous. You see, a fundamental rule of a futurist is to keep the memories of your travels to yourself. If the future is altered due to pre-obtained knowledge, then there will be a price to pay. As a member of The Futurist Co. you will be able to learn all of Wilbur's secrets of the future through his blog and podcast which will broadcast on www.thefuturistco.com. It is your responsibility to stay loyal to Wilbur and to all the rest of the futurists out there and keep the secrets within the society. They will be watching!\n\"Curiosity of the future lies deep within all of us. What a wonderful gift it would be to discover it before anyone else. I welcome you into my world to do just that.\"\n The Official Futurist Co. Lapel Pin and Membership Card\nThe Only One Of Its Kind! The \"Silver\" Futurist Co. Secret Decoder used by Wilbur Wonder himself!\nThe Futurist Co. Secret Society Decoder uses an old Roman encryption method. All members will receive a copper decoder.\n Go to www.thefuturistco.com to follow Wilbur Wonder!\nYou have reached the end of this campaign, you think it's a cute idea and decide to leave without joining The Futurist Co. Secret Society, but wait...\nRead below:  \nTime Travel Is Possible But Only To The Future  \nWe may be able to book our ticket to the future someday \u2014 it\u2019ll just be a one-way trip.  \nIn a presentation at the British Science Festival, particle physicist Brian Cox said that time travel is possible but only in one direction.  \n\u201cThe central question is, can you build a time machine? The answer is yes, you can go into the future,\u201d the University of Manchester professor told the audience during his hour-long speech on Tuesday, according to The Telegraph. \u201cYou\u2019ve got almost total freedom of movement in the future.\u201d  \nCox detailed how time travel to the future is possible under Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. Traveling hundreds, or even thousands of years into the future, could be accomplished if someone was traveling at an incredibly fast pace, close to the speed of light.  \nDiscovery News equated the theory to the so-called \u201cTwin Paradox:  \n\u201dImagine twins, one stays on Earth (Twin A) while the other (Twin B) boards a spaceship and flies off at relativistic speeds. Compared with Twin A\u2019s timeframe, Twin B\u2019s timeframe will slow. If time is running slower for Twin B, then he/she will return to Earth where a lot more time has passed and Twin A has aged significantly more than Twin B. The mechanism behind this is \u201ctime dilation\u201d and it has a stronger effect as you travel closer and closer to the speed of light. \"  \nComing back from the future or traveling to another point in the past is much less likely, according to Cox.  \nRelating his theory to the popular British science fiction show \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d Cox explained that the time-traveling Doctor would need to find a wormhole in order to return to the past. The theoretical bridge, or shortcut through space-time, proposed under Einstein\u2019s general-relativity theory has never been proven to exist. And, even if a wormhole were discovered or created, there\u2019s no telling whether humans could actually use it to travel through time.  \nCox isn\u2019t the only one to theorize that a wormhole could allow time-travelers to travel backward in time. Earlier this year, astrophysicist Eric W. Davis of the EarthTech International Institute for Advanced Studies said that a wormhole would be the best option for back-in-time travel. But, Davis acknowledged, it would \u201ctake a Herculean effort to turn a wormhole into a time machine.\u201d  \n-Sara Gates, The Huffington Post", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have all prototypes approved and ready to run as soon as we hit our goal.

They're always very happy and curious, and should you find one, it will be your friend for life. However, Chaffies do have a tendency to get themselves lost, so the aim of this Kickstarter campaign is to make finding one that little bit easier.\n'FIND CHAFFY' began over ten years ago as a spoof 'lost pet' campaign. We handmade some Chaffies out of fabric and sent them across the world, asking anyone who found one to show us where they ended up. We received hundreds of sightings from countries as far and wide as:\nWe then collected all these sightings together on the Find Chaffy Website!\nOur campaign took a new direction with 'Find Chaffy - The Book', a highly-illustrated picture book published by Scholastic (UK) and translated into a number of different languages. Since then, our ongoing search for Chaffies has grown and grown, through a variety of different mediums. From real-life treasure hunts across London, to iOS Messenger stickers, to Find Chaffy cartoons and animations such as this one...\n(Animated by Birdbox Studios, Produced by Mind Candy)\nNow, with your help, we're hoping to relaunch Chaffies in vinyl, and take our worldwide search to the next level!\nThe aim of this Kickstarter is to raise enough money to produce at least 500 Chaffy vinyl figures. Vinyl is lightweight and durable, making this new series of Chaffy perfect for taking on adventures.\nOnce you find a Chaffy, we hope you'll share your Chaffy photos with us across Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and we'll regularly gather together some of the best to show on our website. There you'll be able to see all the amazing places Chaffies have been found, along with loads of fun Chaffy artwork, animations, and updates.\nWe've planned our Kickstarter target so, as well as the Chaffy itself, we can also offer you a load of extra Find Chaffy goodies. Later tiers include reprints of the book, a print set of the best Find Chaffy cartoons, and original artwork. We've also been careful to make sure a Chaffy is the same price for everyone, wherever in the world you are, with no hidden shipping costs (although we can't be liable for any import duties which may apply in your country).\nWhen you find a Chaffy, this is what you get:\n(All the model Chaffies shown in this Kickstarter campaign originally made by Kerry Dyer. Final versions may vary slightly. PLEASE NOTE: Chaffies are sold as vinyl figures rather than toys, and as such may not be suitable for very young children)\nIf you'd like to find your own Chaffy, we've prepared a number of different options for you to choose from. EVERY Chaffy comes with the extras listed in the first tier, and all prices include worldwide delivery! \n** DIGITAL SPECIAL! All tiers come with a free PDF of 'Find Chaffy - The Book', but if you want the PDF on its own you can choose this option for only \u00a33!**\nINCLUDES:\n\u2022 One CHAFFY VINYL FIGURE (with sketch card, mini booklet, certificate and set of four art cards) \n\u2022 A PDF of 'Find Chaffy - The Book'.\n (Want to see which prints are in the set?

I\u2019ll create an exclusive A4 comic page just for you. It can be about whatever you want, and, if you like, feature any of my characters. Want me to draw an exclusive Chaffy comic for you? Want me to draw you IN a comic with Looshkin? Want me to draw your kids running around with Bunny Vs Monkey? Want me to just draw a comic about a sad banana? Hey, you\u2019re the boss!\nI\u2019ll discuss with you what you want me to do, if you have any ideas for a script, and any requests for what should appear. Then I\u2019ll go away and write a rough script for your approval. Once approved, I\u2019ll turn this script into a finished, colour, single-page comic (approx 9 \u2013 12 panels).\nOnce complete, I\u2019ll send you a digital version of the finished artwork, as well as an A4 colour print, and the original black and white inkwork! \nMy only restrictions are that the comic must be within the bounds of taste and decency, and if it features one of my original characters or a copyrighted character then it can\u2019t be reprinted in a publication \u2013 this is only for personal use.\nI very rarely do commissions, so this is a great chance to get an exclusive, unique comic! To see more examples of my comic work, check out my site at www.fumboo.com\n\u2022  Also includes 3 Chaffies (I\u2019ll most likely hide one in your comic too), and everything else from the TREATS tier.\n(Want to see a sample of the picture search? Click HERE!)\n\u2022 COMMISSION YOUR OWN FIND CHAFFY PICTURE SEARCH! I'll create an exclusive Find Chaffy picture search puzzle for you. You and I can discuss what animal/creature you want to be the theme, and also any other things you might want to hide in there - perhaps yourself, your children, your pets. Anything you like (within the bounds of taste and decency)! \n\u2022 Once complete, I'll send you a digital version of the finished full colour artwork, as well as an A3 colour print, and the A2 original black and white lineart.\n\u2022 Also includes ten Chaffies (real life versions of the Chaffies hidden in your picture!) and everything else from Tier 4.\nThis is a very rare chance to commission such a unique and personal piece of art!\nWhichever tier you choose, as long as your tier includes a physical item (such as the Chaffy figure, the paperback book, or the print set), then you can always order ADDITIONAL copies of those things. Want a load of Chaffies to hand out to your friends? Want extra books to pass onto your school? Well just add the following amounts to your total, and when our Kickstarter campaign is over we'll send out a survey asking you to confirm which extras you've ordered.\n(By the way, if you've already pledged and later decide you want to add extras, you can do this at any time during the campaign by clicking 'manage your pledge' and adding the extra amount!)\nNot only does every extra Chaffy you order come with its own sketch card, mini booklet, certificate and set of four art cards, we'll also include an exclusive set of FIND CHAFFY FRIENDSHIP STICKERS!\n(Any tiers involving multiple Chaffy vinyl figures will also receive these stickers)\nReaching the target would be utterly incredible, and really enable Find Chaffy to become something special. However, just in case the campaign goes even better than expected, we've prepared a few stretch goals. Once unlocked, these bonus items will ship to everyone who funds at certain tiers (to be announced).\nWhile it can be tricky with a Kickstarter campaign to work out the exact costings, we've done our best to estimate what we'll need to make this work. In fact we've slightly over-estimated, so there's enough of a buffer to cover any problems.\nThe \u00a38,500 target breaks down like this:\n(Please note: All amounts are estimates, and pie chart isn't to exact scale)\nWe'll be working with Madebycooper to produce the Chaffy vinyl figures, Comic Printing UK for the Find Chaffy books, and Awesome Merchandise for the extras - all of whom come very highly recommended in their respective industries!\nI have run two crowdfunding campaigns before: The first was to self-publish a comic book, the second to raise money and send comics to Readathon. Both beat their targets, and were successfully fulfilled.\nFor this campaign, we're hoping to have everything ready and shipped out by the end of November this year, just in time for Christmas. Unforeseen circumstances may of course arise, but we've checked and triple-checked our schedule, our accounting, everything we can. In short: I want Find Chaffy to be appreciated by as many people as possible, so I'll be working hard to try and make sure everything happens as planned.\nHello! My name is Jamie Smart, and I've been working full-time as an illustrator for nearly 20 years. For most of that time I have been lucky enough to write and draw my own comics, including titles such as Bear, Bunny Vs Monkey, Space Raoul, Whubble and Fish-Head Steve. I created and edited the children's anthology Moose Kid Comics, released a number of childrens books, created a number of long-running webcomics, and worked extensively in TV development.\nNot only that, but I've been allowed to work on other people's well-known properties too, including illustrating my own Doctor Who book (eek!), and writing and drawing such classic characters as Desperate Dan and Roger The Dodger for The Dandy and The Beano.\nMy full client list includes: The Phoenix, The Beano, The Dandy, Toxic, Scholastic, OUP, DFB, Random House, Cartoon Network and Disney.

(I'm sure the only cure is more pin badges...). My first Kickstarter campaign saw two of my illustrations successful brought to life in enamel pin badge form - and now I am hooked!!\nI was playing around with 'spooky' ideas and sketched a little potion bottle which instantly seemed right to be made into an enamel pin.  Starting this campaign now means that the pins will be (if funded!) produced and shipped in plenty of time to be this years most wanted Halloween accessory!! \nTHE PIN DESIGN\nGlow in the Dark Hard Enamel Pin Badge\nThe first pin will be something along the lines of the above image - with the special added feature that the skull and cross-bones GLOW IN THE DARK!!!\nGlow in the dark poison potion bottle - spookily good!\nThis will be the first time I have used a Glow in the Dark feature on a pin - have to say I am a tiny little bit excited to say the least!\nDetails of the pin:\nApprox. 30mm high \nHard Enamel \nGlow in the dark fill on the Skull and Cross-bones\nColoured Rubber Clutch \nWill come affixed to an illustrated backing card\nPLEDGES / EARLY BIRD REWARD LEVELS\nBy backing this project you will help me raise the funds to get these pins manufactured.  The majority of the goal amount covers the production of the pins, the amount that remains relates to postage and packaging costs in shipping the pins out to backers. \nFor those 'Early Birds' to the campaign - there are special pledge amounts for those who support this campaign early on.  Look for the 'Early Bird pledge amount - and grab yourself 1, 3 or 5 pins at a sweet, sweet deal!\nSTRETCH GOALS\nStretch Goal - Luck Potion - UNLOCKED!\n  I have other potion designs - that if the funding exceeds the stretch goal amounts listed above - will be 'unlocked'.  At the end of the campaign - backers will be able to choose which pins they would like from those 'unlocked' pins. The image above gives a hint as to what they will be - the design will be revealed as the campaign progresses / we get nearer to the goals!\nPoison - Goal - \u00a3250 **Met in 12 hours!**\nLove - Stretch Goal - \u00a3450 **UNLOCKED**\nFame - Stretch Goal - \u00a3650 **UNLOCKED**\nHappiness - Stretch Goal - \u00a3900  **UNLOCKED**\nLuck - Stretch Goal - \u00a31300 **UNLOCKED**\nThe original two stretch goals were reached within 7 days (THANK YOU!) - so a 4th pin has now been added to the line up.  UPDATE! - The 4th stretch goal has been reached - so the 'Happiness' pin design has now been unlocked! A 5th and final stretch goal of \u00a31300 has been set - which will unlock a 'Luck' pin.  Since this started with a 'Glow in the Dark' pin - it seemed fitting to end on one too!  **UPDATE** - this goal too has been reached - so all 5 pins designs will be availble to backers to choose from!\nOnce the campaign ends - backers will be able to chose from any of the unlocked pins (within the number they have pledged for).\nPOSTAGE\nOnce i have received the pins all post will be sent out UK standard class or standard international shipping for around the world. This means no tracking numbers will be available with standard shipping (although I always obtain proof of postage). \nIf you would like a tracked delivery service then please don't hesitate to get in touch and I can let you know how much extra this would cost.\nWant to know more about me and Bird House Press?\nI'm on Facebook, and Twitter - but being a visual person my home is on instagram!!

Secret Society, but wait... \nRead below:\nTime Travel Is Possible But Only To The Future\nWe may be able to book our ticket to the future someday \u2014 it\u2019ll just be a one-way trip.  \nIn a presentation at the British Science Festival, particle physicist Brian Cox said that time travel is possible but only in one direction.  \n\u201cThe central question is, can you build a time machine? The answer is yes, you can go into the future,\u201d the University of Manchester professor told the audience during his hour-long speech on Tuesday, according to The Telegraph. \u201cYou\u2019ve got almost total freedom of movement in the future.\u201d  \nCox detailed how time travel to the future is possible under Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. Traveling hundreds, or even thousands of years into the future, could be accomplished if someone was traveling at an incredibly fast pace, close to the speed of light.  \nDiscovery News equated the theory to the so-called \u201cTwin Paradox:\n\u201d Imagine twins, one stays on Earth (Twin A) while the other (Twin B) boards a spaceship and flies off at relativistic speeds. Compared with Twin A\u2019s timeframe, Twin B\u2019s timeframe will slow. If time is running slower for Twin B, then he/she will return to Earth where a lot more time has passed and Twin A has aged significantly more than Twin B. The mechanism behind this is \u201ctime dilation\u201d and it has a stronger effect as you travel closer and closer to the speed of light. \"\nComing back from the future or traveling to another point in the past is much less likely, according to Cox.  \nRelating his theory to the popular British science fiction show \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d Cox explained that the time-traveling Doctor would need to find a wormhole in order to return to the past. The theoretical bridge, or shortcut through space-time, proposed under Einstein\u2019s general-relativity theory has never been proven to exist. And, even if a wormhole were discovered or created, there\u2019s no telling whether humans could actually use it to travel through time.  \nCox isn\u2019t the only one to theorize that a wormhole could allow time-travelers to travel backward in time. Earlier this year, astrophysicist Eric W. Davis of the EarthTech International Institute for Advanced Studies said that a wormhole would be the best option for back-in-time travel. But, Davis acknowledged, it would \u201ctake a Herculean effort to turn a wormhole into a time machine.\u201d\n-Sara Gates, The Huffington Post", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have all prototypes approved and ready to run as soon as we hit our goal.

The Selectively Social sticker will be approximately 7cm high and the Can't People Today sticker will be approximately 8cm wide.\nEnamel pins:\n- hard enamel\n- dark metal structure \n- rubber clutch\n- exclusively designed backing cards\n- Selectively Social pin: 35mm high\n- Can't People Today pin: 45mm wide\nMy name is Barbara and I am the owner and designer behind Box Monster.

This is my 6th Kickstarter Project, taking design ephemera and re-imagining them as blown-up fine art. My work has been shown across the UK as well as Berlin and Moscow.\nThe ProjectLike my previous five successful projects, Go Pop recognises the striking graphic narrative of the 20th Century and explores the often-overlooked relationship between art and graphic design. The Go Pop! series will bring to life my collection of vintage bottle caps, blown up in size and hand printed to produce a series of high-quality fine art.\n\nThe collection consists of 6 iconic soda brands; Coca-Cola, Pepsi, 7up, Cherry Coke, NEHI and Mello Yello.

That's why I want to change the context in which graphic design is viewed \u2013 by blowing them up into much bigger versions of themselves so that every tiny detail can be admired. From the use of typography to colour and form, design becomes art and begins to create an emotional reaction.\n__\nThe Collection of 500mm x 500mm Fine Art Screenprints\nDesign inspired pop art printsI want more people to value the role design has in our lives and I want more people to have access to affordable, quality art that can inspire and delight them. Refreshing homes into designer pads. To do this each detail of the original bottle cap is meticulously and painstakingly reproduced for print. \nThe result: a blown up bottle cap that captures the mood of an era and the beauty of graphic design. The bottle caps will be screenprinted at 500mm x 500mm, using 8 colours (including metallic inks) to form an exclusive limited edition. Each one printed on the highest quality archival paper, hand signed by the artist (Tom love) alongside the edition number, making sure each one is a collectable and covetable piece of affordable fine art. \n__\n  Styled by The Pink House\n  The Rewards: \n*sizes not to scale\n7 Posters; 1 Giclee, 6 Fine Art Screenprints\nEarlybird offer saves you over \u00a3100!\nThis project can't happen without a community of people who are as passionate about design as I am.

Stamps opened up a new world to me, with these tiny little pieces of paper telling stories from a world I hadn't yet explored. Through bright, colourful illustrations, photographs and typography in languages I'd never seen before, these stamps ignited my passion and love for graphic design, travel and popular culture.\nFrom the humble beginnings of a single stamp book, I've now amassed an eclectic collection of 20th century design from cigarettes packets, stamps and matchbox labels to luggage tags and bottle caps. The beauty and balance of design at such a small, functional scale fascinates me and has led me to my art projects today.\nJoin me on a screenprinting adventure as I bring these fantastic examples of 20th century branding to life and into homes across the world.\n__\nPress\nIf you'd like to feature this project on your blog or news page please click below for the full Press Kit.\nDownloadable Press Kit\nSupport Team\nLara Tuboku-Metzger \nLeo Zoghaib (Videography and photography)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince 2013 I have been designing and printing limited edition screenprints of my personal collection of 20th century branding and packaging design.

I love the hunt and finding cool vintage or nostalgic things, and I know plenty of other people do too.  I also collect enamel pins, and wanted to combine those passions.  \nMy idea is to make a series of enamel pins called Thrift Score!  A celebration of treasures found and collected by so many.  In the first set of hopefully many, I've focused on 3 things that are a staple of any good secondhand treasure hunt, Records, Artwork, and Toys!  \nThe idea of which is that the pin itself is a conversation starter, say you're at a flea market and you're wearing a pin of the Ghostbusters firehouse, and a someone sees it.  Next thing you know they're asking about the pin, and saying, \"You know, I collect and sell vintage toys too! Why don't I show you what I have for sale \"  OR you're wearing a pin with the cover of your \"holy grail\" record that you can't seem to find anywhere, and someone sees it and says, \" Great pin! I actually have that album!\"  Strike up a conversation, maybe make a new collector friend, or maybe even use it to pick up that elusive item you didn't even know they had!\n\nThe 3 pins in the initial series are as follows:\n\nA milkcrate full of records. 1.75 in. in size available in 4 different color crates (50 of each color for 200 pcs total )  Not only do you get this great looking pin, it comes with a free sticker sheet of 8 valuable / collectible albums for you to apply to it, so the world knows what kind of music you're into / looking for.  Plus if you back at the $20.00 level, I'll make you stickers of 5 custom album covers!\nHere's the 4 different colors and the 8 stickers to place on the record sleeve\n\nA thrift store painting with a surprise, in the style of Keane.  Also limited to 200 and 1.75\" tall.  These paintings are a staple of second hand and antique shops, usually of large eyed children holding pets.  But this pin contains a secret!  A paper back that can be cut open / removed to reveal a secret inside!  Maybe you get an original copy of the Declaration of Independance, an early animation cel, an antique comic book, or a stack of cash! Every pin's contents is random.  To my knowledge this is a first of it's kind, and I'm very excited to get these made!   \nHere's the dimensions for the painting, and how the hollow center will work.\nThe special items inside will be mostly paper items, printed and placed inside.  They will be random, but I'll include a sheet of possibilities so you know how rare the one you got is.  They include, a valuable animation cel, a copy of the Declaration of Independance, A valuable old comic book, and probably a few other surprises.  All items will be miniaturized to the scale of the painting and placed inside the hollow of the pin, covered by the brown paper on the back.  \n\n\nAnd the last pin is of The Real Ghostbusters Firehouse Playset, a staple of my childhood and a must have for any vintage toy collector!  This pin is also 1.75\" and limited to 200.\nFirehouse pin, the x's are the areas that will be punched out of the pin.\nThe pins will be manufactured by PinGameStrong.com, I've already priced out the production cost, and the turn around time is roughly 4 weeks from when the order is placed. After that 4 weeks, when I recieve the pins, it would probably take me about a week to get all of the surprises made and placed inside the paintings, and have all the stickers printed and custom ones designed and printed. Then another week to get them shipped out to everyone who pledged. There's always the chance for production delays, but I doubt it would be for more than a week or 2 tops, if any. This is my first kickstarter project, although I have had one pin / sticker manufactured in the past, so I am a little aware of all the steps involved. \nAny pins left over after all the preorders would be sold on my etsy store for varying prices, to be determined, but this is the only time to get all 3 for $25!  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHonestly the only real risk here is the time it takes to be manufactured, There could be a slight delay if something goes wrong, or there's any issues with the production. Also, The hollow in the painting pin may not be up to spec the first time, the pin company says it may be a first of it's kind, so that means anything could happen, and it may add to the production time.

These exclusive badges will only be available from this Kickstarter and if in stock from our trade stand at conventions. We won't be making them available in our online store after this Kickstarter ends!\nNecronomicon Book Badge\nArguably the most damnable document ever penned in the history of humanity, the Necronomicon concerns matters and entities beyond the understanding of sane men. It speaks of elder gods and spaces between reality, of insidious words that can drive men to madness, of lost cities inhabited by creatures that defy the laws of nature, and of a time before time when terrible things walked upon the earth and swam in the sea. It is a book from which a magician might acquire great power, if he is prepared to pay the terrible price.\nUnaussprechlichen Kulten Book Badge\nWritten by Friedrich Wilhelm von Junzt (1795-1840) and published in 1839, the text (also known as the Black Book) details a number of vile cults. Some appear fictional, their existence being placed at a date before the accepted creation of the first civilizations. Others concern more recent, yet no less barbaric cults.\nKing in Yellow Book Badge\nThe King in Yellow is a forbidden play. Its name is well known to actors through hearsay and gossip, yet few have ever seen a copy. Even so, it is greatly feared among thespians. Written in two acts for three characters, Cassilda, Camilla, and the King in Yellow (a malevolent supernatural figure of mysterious origin), merely the act of reading the play can cause madness or despair.\nCultes des Goules Book Badge\nDenounced by the Church on its publication, this text graphically exposes the vile arts of necromancy, necrophagy, and necrophilia practiced by a cult in France.\nCthulhu Cultist Badge\nThe cult of dread Cthulhu has existed since the dawn of mankind and continues to plot the ascension of its master to this day. In order that cultists might recognize each other, they sport pins or tattoos of the abominable Great Old One.\nWe understand that you may wish to get 2,3 or even 4 sets of badges!

These pins combine a black soft enamel with a shining nickel finish to make stylish and subtle accessories to any ensemble. They will be shipped to you on a backing card bearing the Strix Publishing logo, appropriate for gift giving.\nDrawn from Strix Publishing's upcoming art book, APOCRYPHA: The Art of Jason Soles, this set of symbols is the work of talented designer Iphigenia, of Foie Gras. This Kickstarter campaign's graphic design is the work of longtime Strix Publishing contributor, Ed Bourelle, of SkeletonKey Games.\nAll 7 additional pin stretch goals have been unlocked. Thank you!\nIf you would like to back for multiples of a single pin design please send a PM and you'll be given your choice after the campaign ends. \nDifferent monitors may present these mockup pins in differing sizes. Actual production size is 1.5\" x 1.3\"\n  Called \u201cquicksilver\u201d by the ancients, mercury is one of the three primes of alchemy and one of the seven planetary metals. Associated with spirit, mercury represents the transcendence of states. Mercury is both solid and liquid, heaven and earth.\nSulfur is also one of the tria prima, the fundamental aspects of human identity as defined by the alchemist Paracelsus. Sulfur was believed to embody the emotions and desires of humanity, separate from the higher faculties of the spirit. This variant of the sulfur symbol is also known as the Leviathan Cross. \nWhether in terms of practical chymistry or as a metaphorical journey of personal transformation, the ultimate application of alchemy is the transmutation of base materials into gold. Gold represents the perfection of all matter, all states. Mind, spirit, and soul, when refined will become this superlative metal. The symbol for gold is also used in astrology to represent the sun.\nEarth is one of the four Hellenic elements of ancient Greek ghilosophy, one of the founding bodies of knowledge upon which classical alchemy was based. It is associated with concepts of solidity, immovability, and the physical world. Its associations with ancient mystery cults and cthonic deities has also lent it significance in matters of sensuality and death.\nInvert the symbol of earth to use it as the symbol of air. This symbol is linked with the atmosphere and its resultant weather, and is associated with intelligence as one of the Hellenic elements. More recent occult traditions have linked the element of air with elemental entities known as sylphs. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn associates air with the eastern cardinal point in ritual, guarded by the First Watchtower.\nAntimony is an unusual element known to mankind since the most distant times when pre-dynastic Egyptians used it to create kohl eyeliner. To the alchemist, antimony is a cooperative metal, best used in combination with another metal such as lead to produce complex reactions. In alchemical terms it is a protective metal\u2014though scientifically classified as a metalloid\u2014and associated with concepts of adaptability and cooperation. It represents the wisdom and strength gained by the sharing of strength and unique talent. Antimony further represents the balance of animal nature within the human spirit and when worn as a sigil is a potent reminder of inner strength.\nOne of the most abundant elements in the universe, and another of the seven metals of alchemy, iron is associated with concepts of aggression and power. This symbol is also used in astrology to signify the planet Mars. As a sigil, use it to manifest emotions of confidence, physicality, strength, and lust. Iron is the metal most closely associated with the \"human\" state and is therefore anathema to spirits and disincarnate entities.\nArsenic is a notorious metalloid that was utilized in many alchemical processes and today it is a common element used in the production of pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and many industrial alloys. Traditionally, the alchemists treated arsenic with a wary respect. Despite its toxicity it was a necessary element in many medicinal and magickal cures. Indeed, it is said that a compound of arsenic and sulfur could induce enlightening trances...Wear the symbol of arsenic when you wish to wield the strength of poison and ward off unwanted advances.\nLead is the the prima matera, the primal matter. The basest element, it represents the putrefaction and decay necessary for new life. Alchemy is concerned with the transformation from base to pure and therefore lead is as important to the alchemist as gold. In astrology, the alchemical metal of lead is associated with the god Saturn and therefore concepts of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, periodic renewal and liberation. This symbol mimics the scythe of Saturn, and bears a shape in parts derived from the old Hebrew letter Taw, and the ancient Greek Tau.\nThe strix was a flesh eating bird of ill-omen, walking on four taloned legs, and bearing a razor-sharp beak, in the myths of the ancient Greeks. The earliest known tale of the strix is from Metamorphoses in which Polyphonte and her sons Agrios and Oreios were punished for acts of cannibalism. Polyphone was cursed to becom a creature \"that cries by night, without food or drink, with head below and tips of feet above, a harbinger of war and civil strife to men.\" References to the strix are found throughout the surviving works of antiquity through the days of the Roman Empire and survived into the middle ages, where its name became entangled with the Romanian word for vampire, strigoi, and creatures that scream in the night like the Strig\u0103t barn owl.\nAdd-ons\nIf you'd like to order more pins than alloted in the rewards simply click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project page.

These simple human forms have been the basis of much of my work for a few years now.\nI'm often asked what they are, and what they mean to me.\nTo me they are humanity broken down to its most basic form. Ego-less, Race-less, Gender-less, without bias or hatred and live to love each other and the earth.\nEvery aspect of these sculpts are hand made. They are created using a polymer clay, baked, then roto cast by my friend Ewan (Hollow Planet Designs). The finish is very much that of the original model, all bumps and dents included, they are by no means a perfect manufactured toy, on purpose!\nAnother aspect of this campaign is your chance to own one of the previously sold out sculpt No.1.

A limited edition photo book with only 100 printed copies.\nAs part of Kickstarters MAKE/100 project we are limiting our campaign to 100 backers. \nPie and Mash London is a documentary of London\u2019s historic pie and mash tradition. Pie and mash is a traditional London working-class food, originating in London. Pie, mash and eel shops have been in London since the 19th century, and are still common in East and South East London and in many parts of Kent and Essex.\nThe aim of this project is to fund the printing of 100 limited edition A5 landscape books. We will make 100 signed copies available to backers of this kickstarter campaign. When it has been successfully funded we will print an extra 30 unsigned and unnumbered editions and donate them to each of the pie and mash shops as reference copies.\nWhy this? Why now? \nIn 2015 Jake Green and Simon Poon Tip decided to collaborate to produce Pie and Mash a film as part of the 32LDN creative project. During that documentary project Jake took stills at each shop, documenting each exterior. The result is a limited edition collection of photography that serves as a directory of pie and mash shops in London and a printed accompaniment to the film they produced.\nAs life-long inhabitants of London, Simon Poon Tip and Jake Green have witnessed the continued development of the city over the years, something that inspired them to capture this freeze frame in pie and mash history. Since shooting the film between 2014 and 2015, four of the featured pie and mash shops have closed down. They have been included in this printed edition as a reference to the changing face of London\u2019s pie and mash culture. \nA mock-up of the letter pressed cover\nThis limited edition photobook designed by the Bread Collective will have an editorial contribution from John Rogers and hand printed letter press editions by Russell Frost of Hooksmith Press.\nThe book itself will be digitally printed and saddle stitched by Park Communications with a GF Smith cover in Lockwood Green Colourplan and a title hand letterpressed in black ink on the cover. \nA mock-up of the gold foiled cover\nThe book will consist of 40 pages including 30 B+W images of the exterior of every single remaining pie and mash shop in London.\nJohn Rogers is a writer, film-maker and author of This Other London - Adventures in the Overlooked City.\nBread Collective are an award-winning design collective based in East London.\nRussell Frost is a letterpress artist running Hooksmith Press, a small letter press shop based in East London.\nJake Green is freelance photographer based in London, author of The Bookmaker\u2019s Studio\nSimon Poon Tip is a D&AD and BRIT award winning creative producer.\n32LDN is a project directed by Simon Poon Tip that aims to collectively build a picture of today's London, through the participation of people from all walks of life.\nWe would also like to thank www.pie-n-mash.com a great resource for us while we were planning our documentary.\nTower Bridge pie and mash shop.

Thank you for your support!\nThe Goal\nTo design and create a high performance, multifunctional, customizable, and affordable fidget toy spinner. I had used several different fidget toys and all of them work great but none of them checked all the boxes on my wish list. So, I created Spinpal which was fully funded on Kickstarter in December of 2016.\nWhile finalizing Spinpal's design I received a lot of great feedback from family and friends. Kids absolutely loved Spinpal, but I soon realized a smaller version of Spinpal would be even more useful for kids and everyone who loves fidget spinners. My wife, a teacher, has seen the benefits that fidget toys can have in the classroom.  She had the great idea of turning Spinpal into the first pencil topper fidget spinner and Spinpal Mini was born. Spinpal Mini has all the same functionality as Spinpal but in a smaller package which also allows it to become a pencil topper. Spinpal Mini is portable, durable, and easy to use.\nFunds are needed to scale manufacturing which will reduce production time and increase part quality. Every Spinpaler (Spinpal-Backer) is important to us and the key to Spinpal\u2019s success. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us and share your questions or concerns.\nMeet Spinpal Mini\nPrototype Top\nPrototype Bottom\n\nSpinning Mini\nInterchangeable Blades\n3D Printed ABS blades can be changed by pressing the center bearing out of the assembly.

So I thought, why not use my skills for product design, to produce something that other people will get to enjoy as well as myself? I went through numerous objects deciding what to design, and eventually arrived at dice. They are relatively unchanged, with the only considerable changes being color, so I thought there was perfect room for design, which is where X-DICE began.\n The Project\nAs a tabletop gamer and dice collector myself, I know that you can never have too many dice, someone always loses or forgets their set on game night, so having spares is useful. Not only that but having a wide variety of styles and designs makes the game that much more enjoyable.\n  When I began working on the dice I wanted to create a sharp and futuristic design, while still holding true to the original form. Which spawned \"X-DICE\". The dice have the same impact corners as normal dice would, making sure that the dice are as mathematically accurate as possible. But also have interesting engravings and exciting color schemes to bring them to life. \nX-DICE will be available in pairs; from a single pair, to a large amount for retail.\nModels\nHave made 3D models for the dice that have been used for prototyping. Below you can view the model of the D6 yourself --> here <--\nD6: X-DICE - Kouzex Design by kouzex on Sketchfab\nThe dice went through multiple physics simulations, and when they passed they were made into 3D printed prototypes. Here you can see them being rolled to ensure that they are correctly proportioned and made even to be as accurate as possible.\nPLAY\n\nColors\nX-DICE will be available in Green at launch, then more colors are to be made available when the stretch goals are met. These colors are; White, Red, Blue, as seen below\nStretch Goals\nIn order to make more colors available, we need more funding to pay for the extra cost of having these colors. And you can help reach these by sharing the campaign with your friends!\nBlack and Green (Launch): UNLOCKED\nBlack and White ($13,000): LOCKED\nBlack and Yellow ($16,000): LOCKED\nBlack and Blue ($19,000): LOCKED\nBlack and Red ($22,000): LOCKED\nBackers Color Request ($25,000): LOCKED\nALUMINIUM: ($35,000): LOCKED\nMore Colors, Aluminium: ($50,000): LOCKED\nProduction\nIn order for the design to be produced effectively and efficiently, a two-color injection molding process will be used. This costs a fair amount more than the usual injection molding procedure, but is worth it to get the color scheme that is wanted; and is much cheaper than painting.\n\nThe Future\nIf X-DICE is successful, after the campaign is over, and the products are shipped, I will be starting work on a polyhedral 7-set of X-DICE. These will all follow the same aesthetic design, but in a traditional full set of RPG dice.\nShipping\nPostage for the dice will be free in the USA, and +$2 for international.\nThank You!\nThank you for supporting the campaign for X-DICE! With more support more dice and other items will be designed and produced in the future! So keep an eye out! And share it around!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have taken every step possible in order to ensure that the production stage goes as smoothly as possible, and have allocated more than the planned time to ensure that the dice will be shipped when said.\n\nThe manufactory process could cause complications with molds, but that is easily fixed with a prototype mould made to check, and then a manufactory mould made after it is proven to be correct.\n\nAnd at any point there are events that do not go to plan, backers will be notified instantly, and reassured that everything is being done to get past the issue, and back on track.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kouzex Design\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI design practical objects, with futuristic and different designs.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thanks For Contributing!", "descp": "Choose this reward if you would just like to help out with the campaign without having to purchase anything.

Story, Art, Colors, Letters, all done. Just need to finish up some of the art for a couple rewards, and send it all to the printer. I am using print on demand companies for printing the book and most rewards. This allows me to keep the funding goal low on this, my initial Kickstarter project. All funds are going to the printing of books and rewards. More funds equals more books.\n  Sample\n  The Team\nExceptional interior colors were handled by the always professional Evan Evans.

A loose screw, a non-twist bottle, a package to open. Often, the tool you need is buried in a drawer or lost in the garage, turning a 20 second job into 5-10 minutes.\nOr worse, you find yourself in a tricky tool situation away from home.\nTalon is the tool you keep with you. It's lightweight, compact, versatile and just might be your new best friend.\nBREAKTHROUGH IN DESIGN & TECH\nDesigned by Chijoff+Co, an internationally award-winning industrial design firm, the Talon is the perfect balance of design and function. Not only does the unique composite material make it ultra lightweight and strong, it's the secret to Talon's patent pending design.\n  Holds 2 interchangeable hex bits\nThe unibody Talon features a compartment that holds two hex bits. This is a design feature that is only possible with the advanced composite material.\nTalon is truly unique. 40% lighter than titanium yet as strong as die cast metal and does not scratch your phone.\n STRETCH GOALS\nWe are happy to announce that all stretch goals have been reached and available and most importantly FREE. \nStretch goal #1 - All hex bits for Talons and toolpacks come with a titanium coating for extra wear resistance. Its also makes them bling worthy with the gold finish.\nStretch goal #2 - Everyone who orders a toolpack receives a free elastomer holder for their bits.\n  The Talon adapts to your needs and ensures you have the tools to tackle any challenges. The internal storage compartment allows you to pick and choose the tools you might need for your next outing. Maybe it's snowboarding, cycling or about town. It's your choice and the Talons got your back.\n  The Talon is a world first patent pending design with a number of unique features:\n All the tools you need    The Talon comes with 17 tools featuring metric and imperial wrenches and rulers, box cutter, bottle opener and comes standard with phillips and flat head hex drives. \nAdaptable\nSwap out the hex drives for your next adventure. Whether you need allen head through to torx, the Talon holds any standard 1/4\u201d hex drive to ensure it moves with you.\nIntegrated socket\nThe Talon makes using the screwdriver a pleasure by putting you in control. The original socket design allows your hand to be positioned similar as you would with a regular screwdriver. A feature that many pocket tools can't do.  \nInternal storage\nThe Talon lets you store 2 standard hex drives within its body. A flexible elastomer keeps the tools locked in place and ready when you need them.  \nLightweight  40% lighter than titanium the Talon is perfect to go where ever you do. Compact Packing over 20 tools in a pocket sized carry.   \nUnibody design\nThe main body of the talon is made from a single material resulting in increased strength , stiffness and badassness\nTechnology friendly\nThe advanced composite material allows you to carry your talon without fear of scratching your latest phone or tablet (unlike other multitools)\nTSA compliant\nThe Talon complies to current TSA requirements for air travel.\nThe Talon pushes the limits of material technology and functionality. The patent pending design is only possible through the use of the advanced composite material. This super strong material enables the dual purpose storage compartment to function as a socket.\n  The Talon is made in Melbourne, Australia. We will be using the same factory that produces our current One bottle opener and have worked closely over the last few months on perfecting the design for manufacture. This collaboration ensures that everyone involved has a deep understanding of the project and the standards we expect. Having a local manufacturer means that that we have reduced the risks normally associated with overseas manufacture. No waiting on shipments, faulty products and delivery delays. We will be right there in front of the machine as they come off the line. It doesn't get any more personal than that.\nTooling commenced! Yes that's right. Normally campaigns wait till the funds are received but we made the decision to launch into the production process. As a result we are already a number of weeks into tooling the molds needed for production and expect them to be ready in the next few weeks. As a result we will be delivering the Talons in time for Christmas.\n          1. Pick your reward\n2. Choose your adds-ons (optional)\n3.

It has monsters, action, adventure, scares, creepy bad guys, a good dose of Lovecraftian cosmic horror, and a lot of twisted Scottish mythology.  \nI wanted to give the UK its very own giant monster (Japan has Godzilla, America has Cloverfield and, er, sometimes Godzilla...) because giant monsters are endlessly fascinating to me. Where better to set the story than the home of everyone's favourite cryptozoological creature, the Loch Ness Monster?  \nLoch Ness is one of the most inspiring places I've ever been. It's an excellent location and I'm excited to set a story there. Real-world buildings and areas will show up in the story, though most of it his invented/adapted.\nThis is the THIRD 'NESS'-related Kickstarter we've run. \nTake a look at the Issue One launch campaign here. \nAnd go here to see the campaign for Issue Two! \nBoth went incredibly well. Now, all of the rewards for the second campaign have been posted out, lots have already landed with people, and we're coming up to our last comic convention of the year... so I figured now was as good a time as any to launch the new campaign! We're doing two books in one this time, and hope to get both out to you before the end of the year. This rounds out the story, all finished. End of a rather short era.\nHere are the two new main covers!\nThe Rob Carey cover for Issue Three\n  The Rob Carey cover for Issue Four\nThey're designed to be placed next to each other to create a big wide piece of gore! This will be available a print, without the text. See further down the page for info...\nAlso, as always we have VARIANT COVERS! I print only as many of these as I need to fulfill the Kickstarter rewards, so if you want them, now is the time to get them. They won't be available at cons.\nOn Issue 3 Variant Cover duties is CONOR BOYLE. Stunningly handsome chap, one half of indie comic legends Disconnected Press, and artist on Titan Comics' new shark book HOOKJAW (written by Si Spurrier). Digitally tinkered with by me, Chris.\nIssue Four's Variant Cover is by the friggin' excellent LUKE PARKER. He's the artist on MERRICK: THE SENSATIONAL ELEPHANT MAN written by my con-buddy/co-idiot Tom Ward, and has also worked with industry giant Joe Casey on an issue of his series 'Sex'. Luke is great, his work is great, everything is great.\n  NESS is the story of CEIT and her friends on a trip to the Loch to scatter the ashes of Ceit's late mother. They just so happen to arrive the morning after the Loch's final protector is killed by one of the many beasts he and his small tribe have been warding off. He was the last member of a local cult dedicated to keeping the monsters in check, and with him and his kind now gone, the things that lurk in the deep, dark waters, and hide in the surrounding hills, are free to run riot...  \nThe series has garnered some nice reviews so far:  \n\"One issue down and I\u2019m already clambering for the next three.\" - Gary Watson, Comics Anonymous  \n\"Having grown up in the region where this comic is set I am thrilled to say that, while Chris might have exercised some creative license in regards to the quantity of tentacles present, Robert Carey\u2018s art and the gorgeous heathery colours from Dee Cunniffe do bring the Highland glens to life brilliantly \u2013 especially the panels at the ruined castle/church on the banks of the Loch. \" - Clare's Comics Catalogue, Fandemonium\n\"NESS is still a fast-paced, energetic monster tale with some truly impressive visual moments.\" - Ceej, Big Comic Page   \n\"Ness is a comic worth checking out for fans of Fantasy, Horror or Adventure stories, but not for the feint-hearted. It\u2019s gruesome and gory, and all things wonderful.\" - Comix Ireland\nISSUE THREE picks up right where the second ends, following the group further into the nightmare of real monsters lurking in the Loch... and beyond. ISSUE FOUR brings the series to a crazy, frantic end. Who will survive? Will anyone?\nNOTE: The final product will be coloured in the same lovely way as the first two books, again by arty maestro Dee Cunniffe. Here are a few uncoloured, not-too-spoilery pages from Issue Three to whet your appetite.\nIf you want to go in cold, scroll past. If this is your first encounter with Ness, click HERE to download a 7 page preview of Issue One as a PDF.\n       Now we skip forward a couple of pages...\nThat's about all I can show without ruining things!  And I really, really don't want to ruin things... I'm exceptionally proud of these books and I think they get better with each one. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprises along the way!\n   Now, a closer look at those Art Cards... \n  We've also got some ORIGINAL ART on offer!\nHere's ANDY BLOOR's work - check out the Rewards on the right for more info:\n Next up, CONOR BOYLE's art work!\n And finally the CHRIS IMBER original artwork!\n  All prints come on high-quality A4 Heavyweight card - printed on 300gsm white recycled board - for a premium recycled finish with a textured look. \nFirst up is this delicious beauty from the equally delicious Jez Cummings, @Hedninger on Twitter. Jez is a Graphic Design drop-out now pursuing a lifelong love of pin-ups & sequential art. He's done work for @MerrickComic #4 and his first proper comic, 'Battery', should be out early next year. His website is: http://magnumimago.deviantart.com/\nThis landscape print (our first one!) which stitches together both of the new covers; issue 3 and 4. Art all by Rob Carey! @Mansloth on Twitter - more in his Bio at the foot of the page.\nPLUS the Variant Cover by Conor Boyle, which was too good to not do as a print.\nPlus fan-favourite Caspar Wijngaard's cover from Issue 2. A lot of people loved it, so now we're offering it as a print. Caspar co-created/drew/coloured LIMBO (Image Comics) along with Dan Watters, and is currently working on the ASSASSIN'S CREED comic series from Titan Comics.\nAnd, finally, the Issue #4 alt cover by Luke Parker, of Merrick: The Sensational Elephant Man, in pin-up form!\n    Here's how the ADD-ONS work. Essentially they help you create your own, custom reward level... just in case none of them on the right float your boat. Postage could be a factor (if you live outside of the UK) but I'll keep it as low as I can and get back to you with the final cost as quickly as I can.\nPhysical Books: All of them are priced at \u00a34 each. Original covers and (if I have any left) the Variants too. Decide which ones you want, add up the cost, and let me know in a message.\nDigital Books: \u00a32 each, as above.\nPrints: \u00a34 each. Want more than one, but less than 5? (Like the Reward tiers offer...) then pick your favourites, add the cost up, and let me know in a message.\nArt Cards: \u00a33. Designed by Tom Mortimer and featuring an extra Ness story written by me.\nTee: \u00a310. We have Male and Female fits - S, M, L and XL in each.\nThe T-Shirt design, by Ammar Al-Chalabi!\nMore to come as I think of them...\nChris Welsh - Chris is a comic/screenplay writer who co-created WART, DOC DINO and is now responsible for NESS. No one has produced any of his screenplays. YET. He lives in Liverpool, England with his beloved laptop and too many books. He drinks rum. @C_W_Writes  \nRob Carey - Rob is an illustrator from Dublin, Ireland and has worked on a variety of projects, including comics published in Lightning Strike anthology, North Bend, The Life and Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and Afterworld. @Mansloth  \nDee Cunniffe - Dee has worked for nearly every publisher as a flatter/colour assistant to some of the world\u2019s top colour artists. Recent credits include The Wicked + The Divine and ODY-C. @Deezoid  \nRobin Jones - Rob is a British comic writer, part of the publishing misfits Madius Comics, and letterer. He is always the nominee, never the winner, and the proud owner of both of his kneecaps. You can find him on Facebook at his lettering page RobJonesLetters, or harass him on Twitter at: @RobJonesWrites\nBig thanks to James McCulloch for going over the script and making sure I didn't mess up too much of the Scottish dialect.\nStretch Goals, eh? Well we'll deal with these when the time comes, but we've had a novel idea... You've seen the art cards, up there in the reward section? Well on the back of those will be a short written piece by me, giving some history on the story and the Loch itself. Some insight into the situation.\nSo what we're planning for the Stretch Goals is more of this. More snippets of story in strange formats, building and building for each one we hit. They could be telegrams, notebook entries, strange recordings...basically Tom Mortimer is helping me turn this into a fun little art project that bolsters the Ness story and plays with the medium.\nIt'll be interesting, and I really hope we get up to hit some of these. As soon as we hit the target I'll announce the Stretch Goal Targets - they'll be small, so we can hit them thick and fast with any luck.\nNaturally, everything we produce will ONLY be available through Kickstarter, because we like to spoil our lovely backers.\nSpeaking of, here are some comments from a few awesome people who backed the first books:  \n(I hope you don't mind being quoted... if you do, let me know and I'll edit you out.)  \n\"Just took my delivery of some quality #comics. NESS by @Mansloth & @C_W_Writes. Looks like a really pretty thing.\" - Dirk F\n\"Just sat down and read @C_W_Writes's Ness #2. It's a Great horror series...creepy as hell.\" - Matt G\n\"I'm so happy to have backed this project. I will be backing all the issues. Great work, gents.\" - Nicholas B  \n\"Got my copy today, great looks, story, monster. Look forward to backing the next three issues.\" - Jon B  \n\"No spoilers, but the story is great - pacey and dark with a nice tension throughout. Looking forward to the other books!\" - Kevin C  \n\"I just finished reading Ness and what can I say only WELL DONE! It's a fantastically put together comic. I will be raving about it.\" - Ciaran M\n\"This is fine but have you considered replacing the main character with a guy named Wart?\" - Ammar Al-C  \n\"Chris is so much better than me in every way that counts.\" - Tom W\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first Kickstarter rodeo, but I know from experience how things can get a bit hectic.\n\nSo far I've successfully run (and delivered on) two campaigns for my other series WART, one for the dinosaur-buddy-cop-surgical-drama DOC DINO, and obviously the first two NESS campaigns.\n\nI've also been involved in the campaign for the horror anthology THE GRIME Issue One and Issue Two.\n\nWith Ness #1 we hit a couple of small stumbling blocks that delayed the book's release by a month, but this time we've streamlined and learnt from previous mistakes, so there shouldn't be any such issues this time around.\n\nNess #2 was actually out two months ahead of schedule thanks to the art team smashing it. That's what made it possible to launch 3 and 4 this year!\n\nWith that experience, I'm confident I can deliver Ness Issues Three and Four in a timely fashion, as promised, with my usual high-standards in place.\n\nThe scripts are completed for each issue in the four-part series and Rob Carey has near-as-damnit finished the last pages of inks for the whole darn series. Your money will go to colours, finishing the inks, lettering, printing, producing the Kickstarter prints and extras, Kickstarter's fees, and postage. Any extra cash raised will go back into the series, hopefully lowering the already-low goal for future issues.\n\nI've already put up my own cash to fund the preview (and beyond), as well as the production of pin ups and extra artwork. I don't anticipate getting this back, but I strongly believe the investment in this book was worth it.\n\nIf there are any hiccups along the way to production, I promise to take responsibility, keep everyone in the loop, and work hard to get this book finished and out there. Having said that, I don't foresee any, unless one of the team is eaten by a giant sinister water-dwelling creature (or drowns whilst hunting one).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "DIGITAL TASTER - Issue #1 only", "descp": "You'll find the comic in your emails the same day the campaign ends.\nThis is for you if you like the look of Ness, but don't want to dive in too deep just yet. 22 pages of monster comic, see where the story starts!

Find new friends who are plant-based and compassionate!\nIt's hard to believe, but there isn't a simple, minimal pin for vegans yet. Based off of the \"V\" found on vegan Lush products, this soft enamel pin is about 1.5\", with white enamel surrounding semi-matte black metal plating with a rubber backing. It's intended to serve functionally, no frills; simple, fresh, and empowering!\nI've been vegan for about 4 months now, and haven't really told anyone (it's my own thang) because of the stigma against it. I know, I know, call me a weenie vegan- but when something means a lot to me I find myself nervous to speak about it! \nHowever, I love using pins to speak for me- I've been all over the Internet searching for pins that resonate with me to put on my backpack and walk around with proudly. Feelin' like a Boy Scout with a new badge.\nSo, with this weenie spirit in hand, I decided to design a pin using one of the most popular vegan symbols, hoping to take care of a few things:\nCreate a more subtle, aesthetic approach to being proud of who u are (keep it subtle, folks. but not always, i just like saying that phrase. there are no rules.)\nFellow vegans can see your pin and turn u around and give u great hugs because wow another soulmate in this life!! All because the pin led them to you. (Prizes may vary from person to person)\nYou can be a walking beacon of light spreading awareness for the earthy cause without \"being in anyone's face\"- a double whammy of increased & individualistic choice of exposure that makes the cause even more appealing and familiar! Have you ever seen a lighthouse walk on two legs to bring ships ashore all over the earth? Exactly. U can be the first of a new wave.\nBe yourself, loud n proud. It can be hard sometimes, especially in a culture where one size does not fit all. This pin can help you express yourself in a subtle, empowering way- trust me, you'll forget it's on your backpack after awhile, yet people will still always see the pin! Pins can be worn as subtly or as loudly as you want- that's the beauty of them.\n10% of all proceeds are going to Mercy for Animals, one of the leading and most effective organizations helping to turn around how farm animals are treated and perceived today.\nI'm a youngin' in college, so I do not have the funds to throw these babies into production to sell myself. And that's why I'm here- to raise the funds necessary to put in the minimum production order of 100 pins and get them out there into the world...and hopefully bring some people together in the process!\nI intend to make more pins related and unrelated to plant-based causes that generally encourage people to find self-love and to create their own paths in this world. If this is successful, this will become the first of many.\nThe goal of this Kickstarter for The Vegan Pin is to sell at least 40 pins, or raise $400, by November 13th; this is enough to put them in production and ship them! However, at that point, I will have at least 60 pins left over due to the minimum requirement for production (100 pins), so the rest will be posted on my site for purchase- in time for Christmas!\nFunding Breakdown:\n$300: Pin Production\n$100: Shipping, packaging, donation to MFA, and Kickstarter fees/processing\nProduction Timeline:\nAnnounce Kickstarter on Sunday, October 30th\nCampaign available until Sunday, November 13th at 10pm\nIf Kickstarter met, put production order in Monday, November 14th\nReceive pins in 3-4 weeks\nShip pins out immediately for pledgers and pre-orders for Christmas\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You Note", "descp": "Sending a handwritten thank you note your way- every bit counts.

Based on a fictional version of the life of Joseph Merrick, it steps between historical facts and turn of the century folklore juxtaposed with the American superhero comic conventions of super powers, masks, secret identities and fantastic adventures.\nThanks to the amazing Kickstarter community, we were able to create and release the first 4 issues story arc of Merrick. Then we finished a one-shot spin-off, Treves: A Restless Night. Now it's time to continue Joseph Merrick's story so we have returned to Kickstarter to hopefully fund the second arc, The Gambler's Cards, with issues #5 and #6. \n  Many years ago a businessman sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for luck and riches. As he became an old man his fear grew and he became obsessed with escaping his eternal fate. He used his vast fortune to commission his greatest achievement, a magical deck of cards which he still clutches in death.\nNow Treves needs the cards to further his own schemes, only every agent he has sent to retrieve them has ended up as a patient in Bedlam Mental Asylum. Can The Elephantman succeed where others have failed? And can he survive his first encounter with Spring Heeled Jack?!\n  If you've encountered any of our physical issues of Merrick I'm sure you have noticed the print quality and the nice distinctive feel they have, it's something we feel really passionate about. This is the standard we will be sticking with as we move forward, all our single issues are printed on 120GSM uncoated bond with 300GSM matt laminated covers. We're striving to make every issue of Merrick something special, an item that you will want to keep, these are not disposable comics.   \nBoth issues are beautifully presented, full colour, standard US size comics. Issue #5 is 32 pages, Issue #6 approximately similar length.\nAs with all single issues of Merrick, issue's #5 and #6 will be limited numbered runs of 500 never to be reprinted with the same cover. \nA maximum of 2 print runs for each issue.\nAll single issues are shipped bagged and boarded to ensure they reach you looking as great as they went out. \nWe'll also send you digital versions of each issue in .pdf and .cbr formats so you can enjoy issues of Merrick on the move on your tablet, smartphone or PC.\n    Although issue #1 of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman is completely sold out, there is still a chance to build an impressive collection of single issues by picking up copies of the first run of #2 - #4. Limited edition, numbered to 500 copies with less than 80 copies of Merrick #2 left!  \nDon't worry about missing any story, you can download issue #01 in .PDF/.CBR absolutely FREE here.\nThe Merrick Vol.1 Trade Paperback\nJoseph Merrick is The Elephantman, the most remarkable human being ever to draw the breath of life! Cursed with hideous physical deformities which grant him enhanced strength and toughness, his skin as thick as his namesake.\nBetrayed robbed and left for dead by his tour manager, Merrick drags himself back to London and once again finds himself in the care of Dr Frederick Treves, one of the most well respected surgeons in the country. But is the doctor all that he seems? And will the city's dark underbelly envelop him?\nTreves: A Restless Night\nBefore he met The Elephantman, before he came to be one of the most talented surgeons at the London Hospital, a young Frederick Treves travelled throughout India with a fellow doctor. One night as they set camp in a barren wasteland Treves' travelling companion recounts the tale of a previous encounter with a local who put his faith in a witchdoctor over modern medicine...\nSet before the events in Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman, A Restless Night is loosely based upon a true story taken from Treves' journals of his experience travelling through India.

Give me more of this please\u2026.MORE, MORE, MORE!!!\"\nComicsAnonymous\n\"Brutality and poetry co-exist simultaneously on the same page. It has that sad quality that David Lynch\u2019s movie features, but tackles it in a completely different way. Merrick steps up to the hatred of the city, powerful instead of weak and infatuated. He rails against the injustice of the times and sets out like a pulp novel character cutting a swathe of bloody broken bones through the Hellboy level weirdness of the times.\"\nwww.downthetubes.net\n\"In a way, we all identify with the Elephant Man. How many of us truly enjoy seeing their own reflection? We all have doubts and insecurities about our own abilities and appearance, but what if someone were to come along and show you how to turn those things that you don't like about yourself into your greatest advantage? It's this inversion of the negative that I find empowering about this comic.\"\nYou May be Dead and Dreaming \n\"Tom Ward and Luke Parker have in four issues created a world richer and more interesting than many books can attain in years, if ever. Ward mixes the real, surreal and downright weird perfectly, without any visible seams. Parker\u2019s art is reminiscent of Mike Mignola\u2019s and he would fit in filling in on any of the Mignolaverse books easily. Parker\u2019s coloring, particularly his use of oranges and blues gives this book its own visual identity. These guys are on their way to bigger things, so get in on the ground floor with Merrick, it is a truly unique read in today\u2019s glut of boring superhero books.\"  \nwww.popcultureuncovered.com\n  Tom Ward: That's me, I'm the writer and creator of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman.

What we will say is that the story is our take on a classical horror genre and touches upon issues such as loss, morality, illness and even a touch of romance. While it is primarily a horror tale we focus as much upon the drama and experiences of our protagonist as we attempt to portray the human side to characters which may not be. \nIn our work we are very much interested in creating strong, complex and diverse characters that express and inspire a broad range of emotions. It is something that we believe that we have accomplished with this book.  \n\nRewards\nAs with all our work this is a passion project of ours and as such we are only asking for funding for the cost of the initial print run of the book, any extra money we make will go towards stretch goal rewards for our backers: \nAs with last time we are offering badge packs and posters to all our physical backers at the \u00a31000 stretch goal tier. Here is an example of what our backers received for our last project: \nGoody bags from our last campaign\nYea re aiming to produce even cooler rewards this time round at a similarly high quality!\nAs with our last Kickstarter we are offering A5 commissions in watercolour and inks by Katie of whatever you like! Here is an example of some of the commissions produced last time and the quality to expect:\nWe are offering a limited number of 15 of commissions for this Kickstarter. \n\n\nThe Art\nThe art will be hand drawn throughout the comic using a semi brush and dip pen then treated digitally. We do this to give the work a unique, organic visual style that reflects the story and gives the reader a more tactile experience.\nPage in Process\n    We aim to finish the project with a high quality 80 page one-shot Graphic Novel, if by some good fortune we reach our \u00a32000 pound stretch goal we will give the extra option of upgrading your book to a luxurious hardback edition. If we are successfully funded we will be debuting this book at Thought Bubble Festival 2016 as well as taking it to future conventions to sell while we work on our next book 'The Circus is in Town' by Thomas Kelly. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter after our first graphic novel was successfully funded earlier this year. The risk potential for this project is fairly low, as the only costs we need to cover is the cost of an initial print run of 150 copies of the book (possibly more if we reach stretch goals). At of the time of the Kickstarter launch the story is 100% written and pencilled and almost 50% inked and lettered by Katie. Then all we need to do is digitally clean up the pages and then we are ready to go!\n\nThe only potential setbacks that we can foresee are the unlikely events of either personal or family emergencies, which at worst, we believe, would only temporarily delay rather than cancel the release of the book. \n\nWe will keep everyone thoroughly informed of our via Kickstarter updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a32 or more", "title": "Digital Backer", "descp": "Get a full PDF copy of 'The Trade' + Eternal Gratitude!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2016"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "Digital Backer +", "descp": "Get both 'The Trade' and 'Take Only Photographs, Leave Only Footprints' in PDF + our eternal gratitude!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2016"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "The Trade Novel", "descp": "Get a physical copy of 'The Trade' in all it's glory, PLUS both The Trade and Take Only Photographs, Leave Only footprints in PDF format, plus any stretch goal rewards, plus our eternal gratitude!\nSTRETCH GOALS:\n\u00a31000- Badge set and poster\n\u00a31500- Fabric patch and temporary Tattoos\n\u00a32000- Option to upgrade pledge to hardback edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Double Goodness", "descp": "Get both 'the Trade' and our previous book 'Take Only Photographs, Leave Only Footprints' in physical form!

What were the things that were important to you? For some of us, it was video games. If you enjoy the escape to the electronic world, the thrill of the hunt like going to yard sales and flea markets; Reality TV shows like 'American Pickers'- then we\u2019ve got a FILM FOR YOU!\n'The Bits of Yesterday'\nAmong the ever expanding growth of the digital age, where the tangible is becoming less and less everyday, there lives a small niche group of people out there that strive to keep the tactile memories of a bygone era alive.\nThese are the retro video game collectors! This rather unique mishmash of people relive the past, today, through pieces of plastic and metal. These are their stories and adventures.\nSo, grab your Power Glove, a juice box and let\u2019s travel through the decades of discarded video games as we delve into flea markets, yard sales and personal collections and meet up with video game junkies. From everyday folks, to Internet personalities to hardcore game collectors, we will trek across the country and show the broad spectrum of this rather unique hobby.\nWho are you AND why is this important? \nMy name is Darrin Peloquin and this will be my first feature film and I am excited to tell you the untold story of the video game collector. Video games have been an integral part of my life since I first picked up an NES controller at my cousin\u2019s house way back in 1987. Little to my amazement, did I realize that over 25 years later, I would still be playing video games. Collecting merely became the obvious outcome of being a gamer. On top of that conclusion, I found out, through my enthusiasm as a collector, I was not the only one out there pursuing the games of my past. There was a completely unknown subculture of people doing what I was doing. There are many like me preserving the past. Reliving memories and making new ones.\nThe games of our youth: how we played them, how we acquired games and with whom we play games says a boundless amount about us as a society. We live in a digital age where information is constantly available, whether we like it or not. Behind the curtain of instant gratification, we\u2019ve lost our connection with the outside world. Society has become various media platforms and technology has dulled us to what it was like to interact in-person and to physically engage. We have become many- all with a voice but no one is really listening.\nWe have forgotten the newsstand, and how that was our means for news and upcoming information; we have abandoned the plethora of knowledge known as the library for a Wiki and we no longer rush to the video stores on Friday nights. We have become an institution that doesn\u2019t socialize in shared experiences first hand anymore.\nNew gamers do not understand what it was like to be immersed in the time when video games were emerging as an everyday facet of life. They will never know the camaraderie of sharing in what video games were. Sure, the internet brings us all together but never has it separated us more. Just because you may play a video game online with someone, that distance is just merely the fragmented remains of a bygone era. The couch has become another fixture of the home rather than a meeting place.\nFor me, it\u2019s relieving to be part of a very focused nexus which carries on the past through collecting the games and systems that we grew up with. Along with other enthusiasts, collectors and fans, I\u2019d like to tell you the story of what it was like to trade games, play with others and talk to one another face to face. I want to show you the micro-generation that have become retro game collectors.\nThis film will offer a glimpse into the paradigm of collecting, the mindset of collectors and show that their ambition and passion still lives on in their hearts. Whether it be for nostalgia or curiosity reasons or other, it\u2019s still out there and going strong today among the horrors of this strange world in which we live. Game collecting today has harnessed what was and what is and the adventures in the film will demonstrate that.\nHow's the production going, so far?\nWe are (about) 75% done with the film in terms of shooting and editing. We have met and interviewed a large majority of the people we feel best speak and represent the culture of video game collecting and our core message. From the everyday, casual collector to the Internet personality- we've met a lot but there are still more wonderful people out there we need for the film. These are the \"Game Junkies\".\nWe expect the film to be released within the first quarter of 2017. Please read the Risks and Challenges section for more information.\nWhat are \"Game Junkies\"? \nIt's difficult to look at oneself and slap on a label. The collectors and people in the film are just that. They are addicted to game collecting and the journey of trying to collect for their favorite system, whether it be the Sega Genesis or Master System; the Atari 2600 or the unsurpassed Nintendo Entertainment System: the NES. Of course, there are leveling degrees of this fascinating hobby: to collect, play and trade video games. It's their personal recollections and perspectives that The Bits of Yesterday will capture.\nWho is involved?\nBelow is a list of current participants which includes YouTube and Internet personalities, authors, gaming enthusiasts, fans, collectors of the past and more! We are positive more participants will join in on the project as we progress. As stated, our campaign is geared around acquiring more people who speak to the core message of our film concerning collecting; the more we get funded, the more we can include in the film: \nJames Rolfe, Filmmaker/Personality (Creator of the ANGRY VIDEO GAME NERD web series)\nReggie Williams, Collector/ Personality (Radical Reggie)\nJoe Witter, Collector/ Personality (Crazy Joe)\nPat Contri, Collector/ Personality (Pat, The NES Punk; The Unnecessary Podcast)\nKinsey Burke, Collector/ Personality\nToby Wickwire, Co-founder of the Portland Retro Gaming Expo/Collector\nRick Weis, Co-founder of the Portland Retro Gaming Expo/Collector\nDain Anderson, Founder of NintendoAge/Collector\nScott Zientek, Collector/ Personality (Grimsie42)\nBilly and Jay, YouTube Personalities/ Collectors (The Game Chasers)\nJohn Hancock, Collector Extraordinaire\nWood Hawker, Collector/ Personality (Beat \u2018Em Ups)\nBrett Weiss, Author/ Collector\nJeffery Wittenhagen, Author/ Collector\nMichael Thomasson, former Guinness World Record holder for largest video game collection.\nJohn Lester, Game Developer/ Personality/ Collector (Gamester81) \u2026and many more!\nHow your support helps us!\nOur base goal is $10,000 and this will allow us to bring you a documentary film that's over 90 minutes long and very polished, from beginning to end.\nEvery contribution counts when it comes to producing something of quality. For an independent film like this one, a substantial amount of cost will be put toward travel expenses. This will grant us the ability to interview collectors from around the country that we feel best represent the core message of the film. We have interviewed many key figures in the video game collecting culture but we feel the story isn't complete without a select few.\nOn the plus side, this film is largely complete! A great deal of the project has already been filmed. We've made it this far along, so there no turning back now!\nOther factors and expenses that play into our campaign include perks and fees as well as legal (should anything occur beyond our own capabilities). Furthermore, no film would be complete without a soundtrack. The Bits of Yesterday will also have an amazing music score, so acquiring the right artist/composer has to be accounted for as well designer(s) for promotional t-shirts, posters and cover art, etc.\nWhat's in it for me?\nSpeaking of perks, we\u2019ve got some pretty good ones lined up to reward you for your support! We will have your usual swag like stickers, posters and T-shirts but we will also have some exclusive rewards including, but not limited to, an Executive Producer film credit all the way up to actually being in the film! Sure, why not! Show us your collection. Bring us to your favorite hunting spots where you find those forgotten, obsolete treasures. Possibly the ultimate experience: being a star!\nRemember this: If we get funded beyond our set goal, things can only get better. We could have the option of an International BluRay instead of DVD or even a limited run on VHS! Wouldn't that be something? We could even take the film on the road and showcase it around the country. The possibilities become almost infinite the more we are funded!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks & Challenges There are many risks and challenges that this project could run into. The unknowns of people, and places; the weather and the dangers of traveling could put this production in jeopardy. Also, there is participation or lack thereof concerning interviewees, business owners, the general public as well as legal matters that may arise from us and the finished product.\n\nFor us, I believe that the bar has not been placed so high as we cannot achieve what we have set out to do. I am positive that we will be successful in our documentary. \n\nI have chosen this project because it is near and dear to me. My intentions are to share with you a class of people whom have admiration for games, and who are reliving the past through collecting what some consider useless pieces of junk. \n\nI am eager and ready to battle any and all obstacles concerning the development of this film\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital copy of the Film", "descp": "Not enough room on your shelves?

I immediately set to designing a cost effective version which was still high quality and high performance but at a more affordable price. While researching this project, I discovered a number of other 3d printed versions, but I thought they were too big to fit comfortably in the hand or pocket. \nI have spent countless hours developing the P6-Spinner using different combinations of weight and size until I was happy with the combination of spin time and spin speed while maintaining a comfortable size.

You don\u2019t have to be a skilled chef to improve your steak life.\n       It takes only Less Than 10 Seconds for one side!\n  The niXaX light features an ergonomic design and intuitive functionality. Simply:  \nLay your steak on the cutting board  \nWorking left to right, stamp the niXaX across the steak  \nThe precious tenderizing blades push through the fibrous, connective tissue\nCook, serve, and enjoy!   \nUnlike other meat tenderizers, the niXaX does not focus on pounding, pressure, or mashing the meat like a tenderizing mallet. Hammering away at your steak flattens the meat, interferes with even cooking, and compresses the tasty, delicious meat like a pancake!\nTenderizing your steak with niXaX breaks up the tough, fibrous tissue that causes chewiness. The gentle piercing of the meat allows for more flavor to enter the steak during marinating which leads to tastier, juicier steaks! Tenderizing also leads to quicker, more even cooking so you\u2019ll never have to suffer a poorly cooked steak again!  \n       The unique shape pattern of our blades works uniformly across the meat with ease witch makes \"Crisscross\" holes.\nMost tenderizing blades are pointed like a knife, focusing on cutting through the meat, Our \u201cU\u201d shaped blades are designed to gently pierce and break up the fibrous tissues that cause that unwanted chewy consistency. \nAll of this makes for a quick, efficient, and uniform tenderizing experience that leaves your steak tender, delicious, and ready for marinating or cooking.  \nOur design also features protective guide pins that line the edges of the surface. These pins stick out a little further than the blades, ensuring you do not pierce too deep or stick to the surface of your cutting board. This allows the blades to remain even and sharp.  \n     Our blades are hand-finished by skilled JAPANESE wood-carving knife craftsmen. \nEach blade is precisely built, one by one, to ensure the high quality you expect from Japanese artisans.\n  With niXaX light, cleaning is easier than ever. Simply remove the blade cartridge from the apparatus and clean normally or place in the top rack of the dishwasher for even easier cleaning. \n  Combining over 100 years of skilled Japanese craftsmanship with our patent-pending design, the niXaX light features:\n10 hand-crafted tenderizing blades  \nCrisscross pattern tenderizing  \n \u201cU\u201d shaped blades for breaking up tissue without compromising the meat  \nProtective guide pins to prevent the blades from sticking into the cutting board  \nDishwasher safe, easy to clean design  \n Our blades are hand-finished by skilled JAPANESE wood-carving knife craftsmen.

My partner and I set up the Muju Studio here 7 years ago to focus on our own creative journey.  \nMr Muju produces drawings, paintings and prints of an imaginary dimension - Mujuworld.  I take inspiration from this world and bring the characters to life through limited edition sculptures.\nWe both work full time on a variety of creative projects, and have been exhibiting and selling artwork to a worldwide audience for over 10 years. You can check out more of our work at www.mujuworld.co.uk\nMiss Muju sculpting the Cosmic Night Owl\nAbout this project...\nSince I was young I have always loved owls.  They feature significantly in ancient mythology and folklore, and are often associated with wisdom and good fortune.  \nAlthough owls are mostly nocturnal, I have been lucky enough to see them in the wild, which inspired me to create some owls of my own.  \n5 Muju mini Cosmic Owl Sculptures\nThe phenomenon of the Northern Lights captured my imagination from an early age.  This kickstarted a life long fascination with glowing lights, natural and man made... from fireflies to bioluminescent plankton, and fairy lights to candles.\nI have tried to illuminate the darkness with all sorts of different glowing lights over the years, hoping to recreate some of the magic of the Aurora Borealis in my own home.  \nThis project brings together these too passions to create the Cosmic Night Owl.  By illuminating a clear resin sculpture with a colour changing LED light, I hope to bring the glowing Cosmic Night Owl to life.  \nHaving lived in many different places in my adult life, I have often found the sense of home can be created anywhere, as long as when the night closes in, you can bring a feeling of coziness with the right lighting.  \nSo I wanted to create a piece of art which could be enjoyed not only for how it looks, but also for the atmosphere it can create.\nWhy I need your help...\nThe costs involved in self-producing a new sculpture are high.  \n I choose to cast my sculptures in bio-resin, which is a non-toxic and more sustainable material than traditional resin (derived from sunflower seed oil instead of petroleum).  \nHowever it's significantly more expensive than polyurethane epoxy resin. \nBioresin also has a much slower setting time (12-24hrs), so I'll need to make multiple silicone moulds to increase my production rate.  This takes more time and financial investment.\nFor this project to be successful I also need to invest in some larger casting equipment to ensure each sculpture is flawless.\nProject Cost breakdown:\nBulk buying bio-resin to cover production run = \u00a3700 \nSilicone for multiple sculpture moulds = \u00a3250 \nLarge pressure pot for casting = \u00a3450\nCompressor for casting = \u00a3250\nLED tea lights = \u00a3100\nKickstarter fees and bank charges (~10% of pledges) = \u00a3250 \npackaging and shipping costs = \u00a3500\nTotal needed = \u00a32500\nI need your help to raise funds in order to bring this project to life.\nPre-order sales through this Kickstarter campaign will enable me to fund a production run of this handmade light sculpture.\n*     *     *     *     *     *    *     *     *    *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\nREWARDS...\nCOSMIC NIGHT OWL - PURPLE MOON EDITION\nPurple Moon Edition - light on / light off\n  Cosmic Night Owl - Purple Moon Edition\nThe Cosmic Night Owl - Purple Moon edition - is cast in a purple bioresin, with purple and silver sparkles and stars encased in the resin.  \nThis version is not only an illuminated sculpture, but it also glows in the dark...  so once the light is turned off, the blue ghost of an owl will glow through the night.\nThe sculpture stands 9cm tall (3.5\") and has a hollow in the base which sits over a purple LED tea light.

If you make and / or sell things online then this mini pop up photo studio will give you amazing photos using just your smart phone.\n It\u2019s all about the images. Now that Facebook owns Instagram you can already see its going to be the next big retail marketing platform. If you\u2019re an online seller you know you need to make your goods look as sweet as possible. Lightcase gives you professional looking images without complicated lighting setups or expensive equipment.\nHow? The diffusion of light. The light hitting the sides of the translucent polypropelene Lightcase diffuses the light that comes to rest on your objects. Professionals strive for this sort of evenly lit result. Using just the available ambient light, Lightcase nails it every time.\n Lightcase takes less than 30 seconds to assemble. Depending on how long you take to shoot and add your tags, your image could be live on Instagram in less than a minute. Whoah! Detailed #Flatlay set ups takes a little longer than that of course.\n In response to the feedback from the worldwide maker community about our first two Lightcases this version has no base. You can take it anywhere and pop it over any surface so the result is only limited by what you can find or what you can make to put Lightcase over. You can add an infinite backdrop for front angle shooting. \nWe like making things.\nWe like making things better even better.\n\nThis is our third Lightcase and our third Kickstarter campaign. \nLightcase (Released 2014) \nOur first Lightcase was made for people who wanted to be able to get professional photographic results using a smart phone and an inexpensive flat-pack, pop-up photo booth. We ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and sent 1,341 Lightcases out into the big wide world. Then we were inundated with so much positive feedback from the global maker community so we started thinking about how we could make Lightcase better. \nLightcase Pro (Released 2015)\nUsing really diverse feedback from our customers who were using the original Lightcase we decided to make it 175% bigger and expandable. After another successful Kickstarter campaign we sent 1,060 Lightcase Pro to crafty, arty, photo peeps all over the globe. \nLightcase #Flatlay (To be released 2016)\nLightcase #Flatlay is what this Kickstarter campaign is for. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s better than our earlier versions (we have no favourites in our family!), it\u2019s just different. It allows for square format photos so suits Instagrammers perfectly. And with no base it can be placed over anything for infinite background options.\nDom Crinson \u2014 father, artist, designer, inventor \nDom has always been thinking, tinkering, designing, making and, well, dreaming. Commercially he has made a name for himself in the UK interior design world with his range of ceramic tiles for high end luxury residential and commercial spaces. This has been able to fund his true passions of art and ceramics where he has also gained significant worldwide praise. \nThough at the moment he is focused on making Lightcase better. It all started because his maker partner was looking for a way to photograph her wares to sell online in places like Etsy. Lightcase grew out of trial, error, feedback and success via working with his local maker community.\nThere are now over 3500 Lightcases worldwide. \nYou are supporting a great product that is going to revolutionize your product photography!\nPlease share our Kickstarter campaign and help us bring this to market by clicking on the share buttons below the video or going to www.photolightcase.com\nJoin us: www.facebook.com/photolightcase\nInstagram: @photolightcase\nTumblr: www.photolightcase.tumblr.com\nFor more images and information as well as photography tips and tricks please visit the Lightcase website www.phototolightcase.com\nThank you for making this happen!\nDom and the Lightcase Creative Team\n\nCredits\nVideo: https://vimeo.com/leonievaneyk\nInstagrammers: @woollykins_organics, @domcrinson, @tribecastlemaine, @chopsforteakitchen, @casdavey_glass, @mimosa_botanicals, @chopsfortea, @clayann2, @kristiankingfurniture, @king_secret_sharer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Lightcase we have designed and our third successful Kickstarter campaign.\n\nFrom previous experience we have learnt where the hurdles can be.

We use them to clip our keys, our camera, our water bottle, or a myriad of other products to our backpacks, to shelves, to fences, to belt loops or to whatever we need at the moment. You want your carabiner to be strong, lightweight and maybe have some other functionality like a bottle opener.\nWe agree. The Firebiner is all that PLUS it has the ability to make fire easily with our patent-pending EverSpark technology. It has a titanium-coated stainless steel body construction rated for up to 50 pounds of gear (not for climbing or hanging anything with a beating heart). And, don't forget the small utility blade.

The Kodiak has the following features compared to other knock-off varieties:\nCustom-made-in-USA survival paracord which contains braided fishing line, tinder and nylon strands inside the paracord.\n#8 Bait fish hook braided in the bracelet\nMuch more durable buckle made from Delrin, a high-strength POM plastic.\nThicker, more durable ferro rod that will last a lot longer.\nShiny striker plate that doubles as a reflector.\nIf you don't have the yellow label at the center of the paracord, then it is not the real deal. Choose quality. Choose The Kodiak.\nAccessory Kit ($100k Stretch Goal)\nThe Accessory Kit was unveiled the last day when we met our $100k stretch goal. It contains the Vial which was unlocked at our $74k stretch goal and will be added on free for anyone pledging for at least 3 Firebiners. So, here is what is included in the Accessory Kit:\n1 Vial\n1 Reflector/Screwdriver Tool\n3 Tinder Quik fire-starters\nThe Vial color will be chosen by backers via a survey a little later. The Reflector has a small Screwdriver tip to make replacing the ferro rod easy and convenient. The Tinder Quiks are one of our favorite fire starters that we wanted to include and share.

The majority of our goods are machined so why are we having a coin minted?  My original concept was to manually machine a brass or copper coin and then have the original art laser etched into the coin.  I attempted this but wasn't happy.  I thought I would like the modern look of the laser etching with the manually machined feel of the coin but what you would end up with is an expensive, not so cool looking coin.  That was concept was vetoed over a year ago and I shelved the project.  A few months ago I stumbled across a campaign from Shire Post Mint and thought to myself \"hmmm...I wonder if they would be interested in minting my coin idea?\".  I thought long and hard before contacting Woody over at Shire Post.  Should I have the coin minted?  After many days of deliberation (without a Decision Maker coin), I decided to shoot him an email.  He was so cool and did such amazing work that I couldn't pass up the project.\nDo you know how a coin is made?  It's pretty neat.  First the art is engraved into high grade die steel, then the dies are heat treated and fitted for the press.  Blanks that are cut from sheet metal are centered between the dies in the press and WHAMMO...a coin is pressed.  Shire Post Mint already has our dies made and is ready to crank out production.\n         Thanks...\nLisa (always first to thank), Mike for the perfect art and Woody for all of the hard work on minting a perfect coin.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe dies have been made and samples have been minted.

Even if we don't meet the minimum order quantity for them, the worst that can happen is i have a bunch of clips floating around my shop. I've added the details towards the bottom of the page.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA True Go-Anywhere Compact Pen\nWhether I'm in the shop, a meeting, the car, at the store, on a golf course, it seems like I can never find anything to write with. The QDC 2.2 is the perfect size for a keychain, a purse, and even as a zipper pull.\nThe original QDC was discontinued in 2015 when they stopped making the G2 mini pens. Since then, I began a new design that would use a bolt action mechanism based on my first project. The bolt mechanism requires a lot of space and using a standard size refill made it way too long to be a mini-pen.\nImage from refillfinder.com\n Using the Lamy M22 refill allows the pen to be more compact.\nA More Robust QDC Mechanism\nThe complexity of the previous QDC mechanism caused some issues in some extreme cases. Originally trying to stick with the same form factor, I tried using an o-ring to hold the cap on.\nFailed Prototype\nThis did not work out well. I lost every prototype I made. The brass cap was also very heavy on my carabiner keychain.\nCanted Coil Spring\nPatented in the early 1990's as an attachment device, this was a new and innovative way to connect and disconnect a cylinder in a tube. It has also been used in the connector industry, combining a shielding and latching mechanism in one simple design.\nCanted Coil Spring Latching Mechanism\n  QDC Latching Mechanism  \nSince the first cap was so heavy, I moved the cap to the back and reversed the genders to cut down on the heavy brass material.\nThis Quick DisConnect is a much more robust mechanism that is simpler than the previous design, using a single Canted Coil spring to latch onto the keyring.\nWith a quick tug, the pen comes free from the keyring. It takes over 10 lbs for a straight pull to disconnect from the keyring, but snaps off easily when pulled off axis.\nThese are the main reason for the Kickstarter Project. These are special springs that are very expensive at low volumes.\nRewards\nStandard Materials:\nThere will be 2 standard offerings: Anodized Aluminum and Raw Brass. Each of these will come with a wide-lined grip.\n Anodized Aluminum:\nAnodized Aluminum\n Machined Brass:\nMachined Brass\nCustom QDC Materials and Grips\nI will also manually machine a limited amount of personalized pens as well. Materials will be aluminum, brass, and copper. Grips will also be customizable with options like: wide lines, thin lines, knurling, or no grip at all.\nPen Specifications:\nOverall Size:\n Refill:\nLamy M22 in Black or Blue\nPocket Clips \nStamped from spring steel and powdercoated black, the pocket clips snap onto the body of the pen.\nThe cost for the pocket clip is $2 each, and that can be added onto your pledge now, or when you do the survey through Backerkit. They will not come on the pens, but are simple to snap on.\nTimeline\nStretch Goals \n$12,000 - Pocket Clip - A pocket clip that will snap onto the back of the pen.\n$20,000 - Copper Material as a Standard - With the wide lined grip, copper QDCs will be offered as a non-custom pen.\n                                       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest risk is timing.

Akaushi(Red Cow) is one of the four breeds of cattle that were from this region of Japan.  Akaushi is specifically known for its intense marbling and delicious flavor.  Our vendors have secured us availability of meat for this project and we need your help to make it a reality!\nOf the four Japanese breeds of cattle, Akaushi is the one known in its native Japan as the \u201cEmperor\u2019s Breed.\u201d  The faster marbling is a signature trait of Akaushi genetics, which means the cattle place fat inside the muscle not on the outside. That means less waste. The Japanese Association of Akaushi has kept detailed data on every Akaushi for the last nine decades even.\nThis is what our Vendor has to say about the benefits of this breed...\nAkaushi Beef's extraordinary health benefits stem from two features:\nHigher concentration of monounsaturated fat relative to saturated fat.  The American Heart Association notes this can lead to lower cholesterol, the prevention of coronary heart disease and weight loss.\nNatural source of oleic acid, the compound found in olive oil that the USDA touts as good for the heart.  Oleic acid is what gives this beef its unique buttery taste.\nWe realize that other campaigns have attempted similar in the past and failed.  They are not us and if you can help us reach our goal, we can show You and the World what's so special about this Beef, this Brand and our Business!\nSpicy Sample Label\n  Samples Drying\nWe believe in ourselves and we hope you do too.  Anyone who is willing to back this campaign will receive a free packaged sampler(0.3 oz), either Mild or Spicy, while supplies last.

Thank you!\nWhere it began  \nMy Grandfather Philip Hemingway was an engineer and draftsman in his early career. Later he retired to become an Horologist (Clockmaker). Pencils like this one were not around when he was a draftsman, but neither were pencils seen as disposable, valueless tools. \nThe disposable culture we live in today encourages a valueless attitude to cheap material things. It is these cheap products that really cause a lot of the world's pollution. Because of their large scale production they cost next to nothing. This not only makes them attractive to buy to the masses, but also produces a disposable and valueless mindset towards them and so many are thrown away without consideration for their real value and cost to the environment. \nI have a box that belonged to my grandfather of all of his tools and some of the pencils inside it have been sharpened all the way down to the rubber, in fact, I have a box of drafting tools from his grandfather William Hemingway too in which lies another almost fully sharpened down pencil which must be well over 100 years old. \nHow often nowadays do you see the design life of a pencil lasting over 1 year? Of course they can last many years, but the point is, do we see a value in the pencil any more?\nMy Great Great Grandfather's drafting set.\n     This led to the Everlasting Mechanical Pencil Mark I\n...This ultimately then led to the Mark II Everlasting Mechanical Pencil below...\nThe Mark II Handmade Everlasting Mechanical Pencil\nWe thought what better way to launch our new pencil, than on the platform that created us. Those of you who made us what we are today through Kickstarter have the chance to own our new and latest mechanical pencil.\n        With a diameter of only 8mm, they are beautifully slim.\n  Unscrewing of the nib reveals its brass mechanism\n  Our Pledge Rewards mean you not only get your hands on these pencils first, but you also get a considerable discount too!\nReward 1 (pledging \u00a349): Gives you 30% off the future RRP. \nReward 2 (pledging \u00a354): Gives you 22% off the future RRP. \nRewards 3, 4 & 5 (pledging \u00a359): Gives you 15% off the future RRP. \nReward 6 (pledging \u00a3100): Gives you 28% off the future RRP. \nReward 7 (pledging \u00a3140): Gives you 33% off the future RRP.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course there is a small chance that there may be delays in the process, but I hope to absolutely meet my deadlines and fulfillment agendas once the pledge target is met. Realistically, there are no real obstacles to overcome as I am machining all the units myself and have estimated that I can produce a maximum of 20 pencils per day absolutely all on my own. That's the great thing about a self producing production line, I am not relying on any other companies or manufacturers to meet my demands. \nIf I get an order for 40 of my precision pencils then I make 40 pencils and distribute them myself with no one else to depend upon. This bespoke made to order service is the way small business used to run before industrialisation. It's a straightforward service much like a tailors.

Thank you!!!\nA Backpack created for the modern everyday life - With hidden zippers, to outsmart the thieves. Designed to support your back. Easy to access pockets and a revolutionary material.\nWe are a team who are passionate about creating great products. One day, we realized that the bags we were using everyday, had a lot of problems. So we decided to to something about it, simply to get a better bag for our everyday life. A year later, we had an amazing design for, what we think is an amazing bag.\nOver 400.000 Thefts are comitted every day around the world, so we designed the Berg Backpack to solve this. \nWe designed a hidden zipper, that is located up against you back. So no thieves will have access to your valuable stuff.\nThe Berg Backpack hugs your back, making it feel very naturally on your back. This design will distribute the weight evenly and reduce back pains. \nWe placed the laptop compartment up against your back, so it feels dramatically lighter. It also improves your posture when walking and running.\nOne back pocket for the passport, cash or wallet.\n Side pocket for the phone, wallet or metrocard.\n Strap pocket for creditcard, metro card or a smaller smartphone. (Only available after we reach the stretch goal)!\n The revolutionary material on the Berg backpack is amazingly durable and strong. We have tried with super sharp knives and really put some weight in, but have not been able to cut through the material. \n The oxford material is water repellent, and we have tested this ourselves. \nWSRS Waterproof rating system, we have found that it is Class 2. \n We are a small but very dedicated team, trying to create the best product that we can. For many many months now, we have been working on this and we hope that you will like it. \nOur design mantra is simplicity, and this is very visible in the Berg Backpack. Nothing other than what needs to be there, is included in the design. \nWe went through a lot of prototyping to come up with the right design. We started with the drawing and thinking process - then we contacted the manufacturer, to produce the first prototypes. We got the first ones, but they was not working, as we wanted. So we went back to the drawing board and took some more time before ordering more prototypes. We then went back after a few weeks, and now with a clear idea of how it should be.

Because we offer worldwide shipping, we can have some delays to people living in places where the shipment infrastructure is not easy. But we will get it to you!

I am super excited to be launching a CNC machined pen I call the SQ1. Machined from 6061 Anodized Aluminum, with Brass and Copper Options. Please take a moment  and read about the SQ1 EDC PEN, if you like what you see be sure to check out the different reward packages I have created. -Ryan\nWhich is your favorite? I can't decide either :) Pick A few!\nDesign:\nFunny how when you use an everyday item like a pen, you really don't take much notice to it. Think about it? When was the last time you really picked up a pen and gave it a thorough inspection? Most of us just grab anything write something down then throw it back down on the table. After designing and manufacturing my first pen project, I have a tremendous amount of respect for this every day item.\nI wanted to create a pen that stood out from the crowd, which doesn't mean it needed to be the craziest out of this world design using some un-obtanium material. Trust me I love exotic materials like titanium just as much as the next guy. Unfortunately titanium is crazy expensive, which in the end drives the price up for the consumer. I personally feel that a pen should be something simplistic and functional with a certain cool factor. \nInspiration and Influences:\nAs a young man, I can recall watching my dad spend hours in his shop building the coolest cars. We would take them to car shows and people would always ask \"Hey Who Built that Car\" and I could always see the sense of pride on my dads face when he replied \"I did\". One thing that always stuck out to me. Everything my dad did was complicated, but if you sat back and looked at it, you couldn't really tell. That was his secret, keep it simple. My style and designs are greatly influenced by all the imagery I was exposed to growing up and I feel the SQ1 represents that. \nThe SQ1 Features and Construction:\nDeconstructed SQ1\nMain Body: \n6061 T6 Aluminum Anodized in Various Colors, With a Dimple Pattern Milled onto the writing end for the perfect grip.\nThe Main Pen Body is CNC Machined using a 60* Single Point Threading Tool. Once the threading operation is complete, the pen tube is transferred over to the CNC Milling Machine and loaded into a 4th Axis Machine. This is where I machine the dimples into the pen tube. I experimented with different size dimples and various depths. The final version is a perfect combination of the two. You can grip the pen comfortably without any discomfort. This is by far my favorite feature of this pen.\n                               PLAY\n\n Fisher Space Pen Fine Refill\nFisher Space Pen Refill\nAgain keeping things simple, I chose one of the most popular and affordable pen refills on the market. One thing I disliked about allot of custom pens was the annoying O-Rings and Spacers needed. I machined the SQ1 Pen Tip specifically around the Space Pen Refill. This pen will not need a spacer on the back end or those tiny obscure sized o-rings which always get lost. Instead I have a Machined tip that matches the Space Pen Tip Profile. You will also notice I created a Set Screw Setup. Simply drop the Space Pen Refill inside the pen tube, then insert the 1/8 set screw and snug it up against the pen. No loose rattling refill as well AWESOME!\n1/8\" Set Screw Secures Pen Refill. No Spacers Required, No Loose Refills.\n  Insert Space Pen, Insert 1/8 Allen, Insert Stylus - No Spacers - No O-Rings\n                            CAP OPTIONS:\nPolished Copper\nPolished Brass\nForced Copper Patina ($10.00 ADD ON)\nBrushed Patina ($10.00  ADD ON)\nDark Patina, Polished Brass, Polished Copper, Forced Copper Patina\n  Copper Forced Patina on Satin Black\n  Brushed Copper Patina on Satin Red\n  Polished Brass / Polished Copper\nSTYLUS:\nI have to be honest here, when I first designed this pen, my wife said \"You should put a stylus on the pen\". Like most men I just said \"No\" without really even thinking about it and went back to looking on my phone and that's when I realized how many hours of the day we spend on our smart phones. I did a little research and ordered some various tips and began testing and prototyping. I finally found a replaceable stylus in the size, shape and color which appealed to me. After prototyping and testing I absolutely fell in love with the stylus tip, and can't thank my wife enough for her brilliant idea. I am fortunate enough to live in Sunny Southern California. So for those who live through cold winters and often times find themselves wearing gloves, now you can break out the SQ1 and use any smart phone or tablet without having to take you gloves off!\nMachined/Threaded Stylus Adapter with Replaceable Tips\n FeedBack:\nAs I mentioned before this is my 2nd Kickstarter Project.

This pen project truly would not have come to life without some encouraging words and solid advice from Brad. Since this was my first venture into the world of pens, I wanted to create a pen that was simple, affordable, worked well and most of all, STOOD OUT FROM THE CROWD! you can definitely see some of my design inspiration in the SQ1. Thanks again for the help Brad, I am really proud of this pen. This pen turned out just as I had pictured it in my head 4 months ago!\nGeorge Steinheimer\nSometimes it's easy to forget where you came from. I always try to stay humble in everything I do. I am a very competitive person and passionate about the things I do. Lucky for me, I met George when I purchased my first CNC lathe. George has been in the machining industry for over 30 years and has been an invaluable resource, mentor and friend of mine. Pressing the green button on the CNC machine is the easy part, it's the path we take to get there that most don't see. I just wanted to say thank you George for all the help you have given me, I wouldn't be making the things I create in my head without your help!\nSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRNG Products LLC Is an Owner Operator Start-Up.\n* I 100% Design and Manufacture all of my products.\n* I eliminate the middle man and lengthy delays from machine shops that tend to over charge and overpromise.\n* I control Quality Control - and Strive to ship rewards On-Time or Early when possible.\n* I have successfully created, funded and shipped a product on Kickstarter.\n\nMy KickStarter Projects Begin well before you see it offered.

All Made in USA\nCutting Tool: single edge razor blade (secondary striker for fire starter). Made in USA\n Fishing Kit: 12 feet 8lb. test fishing line, #6 and #4 bait hooks, cork (pre drilled), 2 re-usable fishing line weights. All Made in USA\n Waterproof Instructions: Printed instructions on a coffee filter, all waterproof ink. Provides directions for fire starting and kit uses. Made in USA\n  Cordage and Wire: 12 feet 7 strand 550 paracord (wrapping for kit), 2 feet 22 gauge stainless steel wire (for hanging cup, trapping, general use). All Made in USA\nColors Available:\nBlack AEGIS Survival Kit\n  Desert Camo AEGIS\nDigital Camo AEGIS\nOur Story \nIn 2013 I developed an idea for a small pocket sized survival kit. Originally my thought was to go down the same path as many and do the altoid tin survival kit. I didn\u2019t agree with the entire concept and hated the idea of having a kit that had water purification tablets that would expire in a few years. After searching and seeing some impressive kits I decided it would be best to keep things simple and just purify water the best way I know, boil it! I have developed a few different kits over the past two years comparable to the AEGIS.  During that time period I sought all advise I could from my customers. It took time and testing to get all the components and pieces dialed in to provide the best quality survival kit I could create.\nTesting one of our stainless collapsible cups, boiling water repeatedly over a fire.\nPLAY\n\nOur kits are made in my home shop, with continued support from family and friends.  This has become a true family adventure which we have embraced and enjoyed the experience thus far.  Our intention is to continue creating handcrafted survival kits and always provide our supporters with the best possible product we can. \nMagnesium Ferrocerium fire starters after being machined and drilled.\nAEGIS Concept and Process  \nThe AEGIS will never expire and will always perform properly.  I have taken exhaustive efforts to find the best possible components for this kit. All of the tools (components) are US made material with the exception of the collapsible cup. The fire-starter (Magnesium & Ferro) is purchased stock from a US manufacture that has military contracts and a proven track record. All cordage, fishing equipment, razor, hacksaw blade, stainless steel wire and even the coffee filter are US made products. I have tested this kit over and over and it will always get the job done. The cup will work for repeated use to boil water as needed. The fire starter will operate over the course of several fires and will operate for hundreds of strikes. Once the materials are purchased all of the machine work and handcrafting is performed from my home shop in Monroe Georgia. My family assists with some of the coordination and tasks of getting all the equipment ready to be loaded into the cup. Once the fire-starters are machined and pressed into the magnesium handle, we move onto loading the kits themselves. All these items are placed into the cup in a certain order so they fit appropriately and do not come flying out when you need these tools to work for you! After the initial load a quality check is performed to ensure that all needed equipment is in the cup prior to sealing the cup with tape. After the equipment is loaded I wrap each individual kit in the seven strand para-cord. Each kit takes around twelve feet of cord to wrap. Once it is wrapped the kit is ready for use, if the kit is unwrapped it is not possible to re-wrap with the same cord due to the length needed to start the knot. This is important so you will always know that if the kit is still wrapped it is in proper working order and will provide the needed equipment if you ever need it.

Please continue to enjoy the great outdoors, remember to take the time to teach our children, family and friends the importance of respecting Mother Nature.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk or challenge that I have started to prepare for would be quantity of orders.

All pages have been completed! But I need your help! This Kickstarter is to help print the first issue.\nUpdate!!! - Just posted more stretch goals to unlock - see bottom of campaign page.\nUpdate!!! - I'll have some Issue #0 sample pages to show before this Issue #1 Kickstarter is over. Woohoo!\nCover by Joe Nash\nLove this page! -- Bonus page I promised from the next issue: The Chasing Arrows Issue #0.\nThe Chasing Arrows story explores a future where earth has flooded and floating garbage patches, known as middens, cover the seas. The story will follow two main characters, Inara and Onas.\nBoth Inara and Onas are Chasing Arrows, people who scavenge the middens and lead lives of thrift. To be a Chasing Arrow is to follow the Old Codes and The Way of the Arrow. To be a Chasing Arrow is to find use for the useless, to readdress the value of things, and to indeed find trash to be treasure.\nInara and Onas are orphans who live on Kaisei Atoll, a floating island of scrap located in the Trash Belt Doldrums. Onas spends his days diving for scrap on the middens while Inara works as an engineer in the Underbelly of the atoll.\nOnas\nInara\nI started writing The Chasing Arrows in prose. As I was writing it I realized I was spending huge amounts of time world building and writing long winded descriptions (two things that can get a novel writer in trouble). I wanted the story to have really cool magic system too. What I came up with was a system based on color. With all this in mind I realized a graphic novel would work great for this story and give me an excuse to do all the really fun novelty things behind making a story world (writing these long descriptions now as a script for my illustrator [I'm pretty sure I drive him crazy], making maps, drawing character sheets, seeing my characters come to life on the page, actually seeing the color of the magic system, and just in general being able to address the novelty book aspect with the story). I'm the kind of person who thinks the backmatter in a comic book is so frikkin' awesome.\nI also think the health of our planet is important! As should we all! My characters fight for this, as I do, and as all the real Chasing Arrows of this world do!\nThe Chasing Arrows is an ongoing story. The first story arc will most likely be 8 issues.\nThe Trash Belt: Made up of floating islands of trash known as middens. The middens circle the Tear in never ending drift. The Trash Belt is modeled after real life trash gyres.\nThe Tear: Asteroid-like landmass jutting from the sea. The Tear flooded the world long ago (this time was known as The Weeping). The Tear is about twice the size of Mount Everest to give an idea of scale. The Tear is at the center of the Inner Circle. The Inner Circle is the densest area of the Trash Belt. Earthquake-like atmosphere (midden-mass constantly shifting). Electrical storms. Serpents. Untraveled by humans.\nThe Himalayan Islands: Some of the last remaining area of dry land. Also known as the Mainland or Roof of the World. The Crescent Empire and other rich noble houses reside here.\nKaisei Atoll: Floating island made up of scrap and old boats from the Time Before. Located in the Trash Belt Doldrums. Inara and Onas live here. The Underbelly is the underwater area of the atoll.\nThe Kelp Islands: Islands consisting entirely of mutated kelp. Ever shifting tides here. Rumored to be slave islands controlled by the Crescent Empire.\nThe Coral City: Mutated Great Barrier Reef. Now jutting five hundred feet above sea surface. Inhabited by humans?\nEarly concept of the middens\nEarly concept of the Water Reclamation Facility, Kaisei Atoll\nEarly concept of The Tear\nConcept work (Old Codes and other logo design)\nTommy Miller-Donnelly: Writer\nNeal Anderson: Illustrator - He can also be reached here.\nOther concept work done by:\nNathan Anderson\nJoe Nash\nJohn Miller\nMoko R.\nEmiliano H.

The piece will focus on the magic system of the story. The magic system is based on aether, color and synesthesia. - UNLOCKED\n$3000: Extra logo design created for the fictional products, businesses and Noble Houses within the story. (see sample below) - UNLOCKED\n$3500: Every backer that receives a physical copy will get an extra sticker! The sticker will be printed by an Eco-friendly company!

Investigate what you could get by pledging... \nBy pledging the respectable sum of $5, you will receive a charmingly high-tech PDF of the book. PDFs are truly the modern-day equivalent of scooby snacks for the discerning Spunky Pet of a Meddling Kid.\nMeddling Kids who pledge $15 will receive a PDF of the book as well as a physical copy of the book. Real books are excellent for reading while wearing something stylish in public, as well as for storing folded-up pages of handwritten lyrics, polaroid photographs, and clearly forged wills.\nUPDATE: The Meddling Kid level is now available in a 2 and 3 book version! Now you can receive multiple copies of the book\u2014perfect for giving to a suspect to distract them while you rifle through their handbag.\nJunior Detectives pledging $20 will not only receive a PDF and physical copy of the book, but a set of 5 of postcards illustrated with scenes from The Secrets of the Starbucks Lovers as well. \nThese postcards are most ideal for covertly taking down license plate numbers, or dropping a line to your gentleman friend who is always off at college when you are having adventures.\nUPDATE: The Junior Detective level is now available in a 2 and 3 book reward version! Receive the postcards, plus multiple copies of the book to send to your gentleman friend so he doesn't get too lonely while you are off solving mysteries.\nBackers at the Gumshoe level will enjoy a PDF and physical copy of the book, set of postcards, and three limited-edition stickers featuring intrigue, pop stardom, and the stiffest of skinny caramel lattes. \nThese vinyl stickers are tough enough to take on anything life throws at them\u2014just like you.\nUPDATE: The Gumshoe level is now available in a 2 and 3 book reward version! Receive the postcards, stickers, plus multiple copies of the book. Feel free to leave a copy on the desk of the local grizzled police chief, with a wry note about how they could do with some pointers now you've cracked the case.\nTop Sleuths need something attractive to pin to their evidence boards to offset all their hard-won clues and hunches. Backers at this level will find just the ticket: a full-color art print of The Secrets of the Starbucks Lovers cover. \nEasy, Top Sleuth! You\u2019ll also receive your PDF, physical copy of the book, sticker set, and postcards. You have a hard time keeping your passion in line, maverick\u2014but that passion is just what this job needs.\nUPDATE: The Top Sleuth level is now available in a 2 and 3 book reward version! Receive the postcards, stickers, print, plus multiple copies of the book. Keep a copy for yourself, and then give one to your estranged sister as a conciliatory gift. You know it's been a long time, and you parted on bad terms... but they are the only one you can trust.\nYou\u2019re not a cop.\nYou\u2019re an Ace Detective. \nThrow your PDF, physical copy of the book, postcards, stickers, and art print in your limited-edition Taylor Swift: Girl Detective crest tote. \nGreat for hauling around evidence and clues, it also accessorizes perfectly with your haunted, world-weary air.*\n*Sexual tension with brooding, chip-on-his-shoulder partner not included.\nUPDATE: The Ace Detective level is now available in a 2 and 3 book reward version!

I work a full time job and run a small home based CNC shop. For this project I went with the K.I.S.S. (Keep it simple stupid) method. I have multiple projects I will be launching in the future and chose this as the first project. Although it's simple, this was quite a difficult piece to create, this is a 2 part component which utilizes a high tolerance press fit. For my first project I will be offering these high quality Bullet Lanyard Beads for a very affordable intro price, once the Kickstarter campaign is over, these will only be available from my website www.rngproducts.com \nWhat is a Lanyard Bead?\nA lanyard bead is a decorative bead constructed from many different materials, and used for a variety of applications. There is no specific use for a lanyard bead and your imagination will be your only limitation.

The key is to plan accordingly, and always be looking one step ahead.I design and manufacture all my products in my own CNC shop located in my backyard. This allows me full quality control over my products and no middle man, which in turn means I can pass those savings on to you guys. Everything is ready to go, all the hours of design and prototyping are over, its now time to begin full scale production. This is a low risk project and will be delivered shortly after campaign completion. \n\nFunding for this project will be $100.00 \n\n1. I currently have 50 completed BLB (Bullet Lanyard Beads) and am prepared to produce many more once the Kickstarter project goes live.\n\n2. My prototypes have already been tested and my machines have the codes loaded and are ready for production once the campaign ends. \n\n3. A low funding price will allow me to start production before the project ends, which means quick shipping time lines. My shop is capable of making 10 to 10,000 of these products. \n\n4. My background involved working on public works projects as a project manager and coordinator. I am used to working under stress and impossible timelines, that experience has allowed me to be very well prepared for any obstacles which will pop up from time to time. Trust me nobody is perfect and no plan is perfect, you have to adapt and overcome.\n\n5. Keep in mind, this is my first Kickstarter Project and I designed the Lanyard Bullet Bead to build a base for my future projects. I currently own all of my own CNC equipment and will not be using any of the kickstarter funds to purchase equipment for this project. I simply enjoy creating unique high quality products and delivering them to the end user for a great price. I have a strong work ethic and take pride in my work.\n\n6.

While keeping away from some designs, others inspired us (like the Platypus hydration pack, Bubi, and S'well). We wanted to create a bottle that stood for nothing more than the essentials in its design, and we feel we've done just that. The bottle's durable body bends and fits pretty much anywhere, while the rugged firestarter gets the flame going. The 8ft of strong paracord let the MWB meet all your nature needs. \nPLAY\n\nHandling it all. Only skimming the possibilities of what the MWB can do!\nWe saw a gap in water bottles while searching for the right one. We can\u2019t stand not having water around... I\u2019m sure you feel the same, you little fish you. We didn\u2019t like the bulky plastic water bottles because, well, they were too darn bulky and in the way, plus they'd crack if they had a good tumble. We didn\u2019t like the metals because they make so much noise when in contact with keys or zippers from your bag, plus they stay dented forever. We did not like the water bladder bags because handling them with water feels odd and unstable\u2026 Finally, we didn't like that the water bottle was only about water; why not add something more? We were just unsatisfied with what was available. So, we took to the white boards and came to the MWB. \n We travel a lot and are outdoors at every chance we get. Packing for such things should be an easy task, but often can turn into a complicated and indecisive one. We feel things now-a-days are made too complicated and/or with too many pieces to complete them. We love to see things made thoughtfully and tactfully. \nAttaching it to yourself or gear is as easy as skipping on one foot while spinning two basketballs on your pointer finger while barking like a seal ...Jk, it's really, really easy.\nSpark up your flames.\nWhile designing the MWB, we wanted a feature piece that would make our bottle distinguishable from anything out there. So, we put our efforts into the attachment piece. We wanted it to compliment the person holding the bottle, its environment, and of course the bottle itself. We have three Words for you: Paracord & Flint (Yes were considering the ampersand a word\u2026 debatable indeed!). All together creating the most foundational elements known and needed for humans everywhere; water and fire. \nLETS TALK WASTE: In the U.S alone, more than 60 million plastic bottles end up in landfills and incinerators every day. Just last year, plastic bottles total'd to 22 billion! And even though a lot of us do our very best by standing in front of the waste units deciding on what darn color and shape of hole correlates to recycling (yeah it gets confusing), it\u2019s still not enough. At least 80% of these plastics end up in our landfills, streets, parks and beaches.  \nWe can help decrease this number considerably. We have created a useful and handy water bottle better than anything out there that empowers you to go anywhere and do anything. So please join us in making our goal a reality. Lets try changing this for the better.\nClick above to check out the MTC, our first Kickstarter campaign!\n       We want to thank you for checking out our campaign, and hope you consider supporting our project!

Pledge for the regular poster at the $25 level (or any other level) and get the orange Helvetica \"Mad Men\" poster free. More details here.\nTen years ago this month, I began filming what I called \"my geeky side project\": a documentary about typography and graphic design called Helvetica. I'd never made a film before, but I really wanted to watch a documentary about fonts and the people who make and use them. I couldn't find one, so I decided to make that film myself. What I discovered was there were a lot of people out there who also wanted to watch that kind of movie!\nJust before the film was released in 2007, I asked Dutch design team Experimental Jetset, who were featured in the film, to design a poster for it. They came up with the iconic \"Meet the Cast\" design.\nThe original Helvetica poster at the 2007 World Premiere at SxSW\nWe sold the original run of posters from the film's website and on the road at screenings. But by 2009, when my second film, Objectified, was released, we'd run out of stock, and since our attention was on the new film (and its lovely poster designed by Build) we never reprinted it. For the past seven years people have been asking when we'd bring the Helvetica poster back. So that's the beauty of Kickstarter, if enough of you want one of these posters, we'll do the reprint!\nThe full-sized poster, and A2 letterpress print\nThe poster is 27\" x 39\" and will be offset printed here in New York, in black and vibrant Pantone 032 red ink on nice thick poster stock with a matte coating. We're also going to make a really nice letterpressed version of the design, in a slightly smaller A2 size (16.5\" x 23\"). These will be a numbered limited-edition of 200 prints, printed on Cranes Lettra 300gsm art paper by our friends at Coeur Noir Letterpress in Brooklyn.\nVintage Helvetica metal type!\nAs an extra reward with the letterpress print, you'll get an actual piece of vintage Helvetica metal type. We've got about 100 pieces of 1960's era type in various lower case letters and numbers. We can't take requests for specific letters on these, ya get what ya get. \nAnd as a special thanks for all the support, we've added two bonus gifts for all our backers at the $20 level and up. You'll get a set of love/hate Helvetica buttons, and one of the Helvetica \"Mad Men\" posters free!\nJoin us and help bring this cool and rare poster back into print.\nCheers! \nP.S. - The song in the video is from our old friends El Ten Eleven, it's called \"Thinking Loudly\".

We had simply too much comedy to fit into one movie! This will be released via Creative Commons, exactly the same way as the \"real\" movie, about 2 weeks after the initial movie's release. This will also be included on the DVD/BluRay discs, as the greatest special feature we could possibly include! It's TWO movies released to the entire world in only a matter of weeks.\nHELP US CHANGE THE DISTRIBUTION GAME\nWe made a film. It\u2019s a feature. It\u2019s funny. And it\u2019s finished. Please watch our official trailer below:\nAgain, \"Tex Montana Will Survive!\" is finished... And now we want to release it. As soon as this campaign ends. To everyone. Everywhere. All over the world.\nAll on the same day. All at the same time. For free. Forever and ever and ever, amen.\nBUT\u2014We need your help\u2026\nABOUT THE FILM\nWhen his reputation as the most famous and trusted TV survival host in the world is tarnished following allegations that his show is staged, Tex Montana attempts to clear his name by documenting himself surviving in the remote wilderness for thirty days, completely alone.\n\n82 minutes  |  unrated (contains graphic language)\n\n OUR GOAL\nIf our campaign is successful, we will erase the slow, staggered process typically necessary to bring a film to a worldwide audience, by releasing Tex Montana digitally (YouTube, Vimeo, download, torrent, etc.) via a creative commons license, in every territory, for free, almost immediately.\n\nThat means anyone, anywhere in the world, will be able to do just about anything they want with the movie. Examples include:  \n\nWatch it! \nRe-watch it! \nStubbornly refuse to watch it! \nShare it! \nScreen it at a quinceanera! (Or any other milestone celebration!)  \nRe-edit it into an even better film! \nBurn it onto DVDs and BluRays (we\u2019ll even supply printable artwork!) and give them to people who don\u2019t know how to play videos on the interwebs! \nALL KIDDING ASIDE\nThis campaign is in part an effort to address the countless messages we received from amazing film fans across the globe, who were understandably frustrated with how long it took for our previous film, The Battery, to be made available in their countries.\n\nIt is also a reaction, to a very sobering\u2014and demoralizing\u2014reality we were made painfully aware of by the end of The Battery\u2019s incredible journey:\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to make a living as an independent filmmaker.\n\nA dramatic influx of films on the market\u2014coupled with the rise of peer-to-peer sharing through torrent sites\u2014has resulted in a drastic decrease in compensation for filmmakers across the board. Minimum Guarantees (MGs) are small and residuals trickle in over the course of years.\n\nOur hope is that by taking a risk and eschewing the conventional distribution process, the result for both filmmaker and film fan will be mutually beneficial. Contributors will receive an immediate return on their generosity; and by cutting out the middlemen, we will see a higher return on our film in a much shorter time frame.\n\nBecause the film will be released without any restrictions, your contributions today will unlock the film for all to enjoy for all of eternity.\n\nAs a result of this campaign, we would be afforded something we were never able to achieve throughout the long release of our first film: Stability. Even a small window of which would allow us to step away from our day jobs long enough to get back to doing what we truly love. Making movies.\n\nThere\u2019s no way around it, asking for your direct support is uncomfortable and intensely humbling.\n\nThe decision to try and release a film on our own is daunting, and frankly quite frightening. But it\u2019s also exciting. We\u2019re anxious to start a new journey, and we hope you\u2019ll consider coming along with us.\n\nIt would be a glorious symbiotic relationship!\n\nLike the goofy yet protective clownfish, and the loyal and supportive sea anemone! We won\u2019t let anything eat you, if you let us hide in your weird, stinging, tentacle-tube-type things when the big fish come round to eat us.\nWhen all is said and done, if we make it through the month, you will have a pretty damn funny little film to watch.\n\nYou will also have gotten us so much closer than anyone else to finally answering the question we\u2019ve been asked over and over, by so many wonderful people all over the world:\n\n\u201cWhen are you going to make another movie?\u201d\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nO. HANNAH FILMS is the three-headed troll responsible for the independent zombie film, The Battery. Made on a micro-budget of six thousand dollars, in fourteen days, with a crew of six; the film went on to play at over fifty festivals, winning more than a dozen jury and audience awards, and was featured on countless best-of horror lists. To date, the movie has been distributed in twenty-plus countries worldwide, and was released on DVD and BluRay in the U.S. by Scream Factory.\n\nDownload our press kit at http://www.thebatterymovie.com/texpress.zip\nFor specific press inquiries, please email Tex@ohannahfilms.com\n\nJEREMY GARDNER is a writer, director, actor, unemployed waiter, and answer to the question: \u201cWho is that fat, bearded guy in that hipster zombie movie?\u201d He co-directed and plays the titular idiot in TEX MONTANA WILL SURVIVE! Outside of his own films, he recently appeared in Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead\u2019s (Resolution) SPRING, and Joe Begos\u2019 (Almost Human) THE MIND\u2019S EYE, and is hard at work waiting for any other amazing filmmakers to call and offer him work. \n\n\nCHRISTIAN STELLA is a director, cinematographer, cookbook author and food photographer by trade. By necessity, force\u2014and on occasion\u2014threat of violence, he is also a colorist, editor, sound designer, mixer, producer, and reticent-but-bound-by-the-bonds-of-friendship roommate of Jeremy Gardner. He is the sole reason both THE BATTERY, and TEX MONTANA, look as though they had a hundred times their actual budgets.\n\nADAM CRONHEIM is an actor, producer, and real estate agent from New York City. Most notably in THE BATTERY, he somehow imbued the thankless role of Mickey with a relatable humanity before being saddled with an even more thankless role off-screen: Taking charge of the constant barrage of paperwork, releases, insurance, legal mumbo-jumbo and business affairs that most first-time filmmakers never think about while living their dream on set.

Rather than clashing with your phone\u2019s style, this simple and effective solution accents both its look and your personality.\nWhen designing Ungrip, we didn't add tons of features that are seldom used. Instead, we focused on two features that are highly visible and functional\u2014 how it would look on your device and how it would help you hold your device. We like it simple. And we think it's effective. We hope you think so, too.  \nUngrip is a simple solution that comprises of two parts: The Bumper and the Strap.\nUngrip is beautiful. It\u2019s designed to look good on any modern day phone, not clash with it.\nUngrip is a joy to use. Because it\u2019s made of fabric and not metal. Your fingers will love you for it!\nUngrip is convenient and flexible. There are over a dozen ways to hold your phone with it.\nUngrip is strong. An average phablet weighs around 0.3 pounds (170 grams), but Ungrip can hold a device of up to 4 pounds (1,800 grams), strong enough for a laptop (but not recommended)!\nUngrip uses 3M's VHB (Very High Bond) tapes. They are industrial strength, easily removable and WON'T leave any residues.\nUngrip can be used on phones with or without casing!\nNOTE: Ungrip adheres to most flat, non-porous surfaces. It will not stick to rubber, soft-touch silicone, TPU, fabric, and those with waterproof coating.\nUngrip is unintrusive. It\u2019s thin, small and light, and can stay flat when needed.\nUngrip is easy to use. With a snap-on feature, changing the Strap is easier than changing your clothes!\nUngrip's got you covered if you're color-crazy. With tons of different colors (and more to come in the future), you'll go color blind!\nUngrip is designed for everyone. With a lot of pattern designs (and more to come), there\u2019s no excuse to not like one!\nBig is now small. You can now buy that large phone which you always wanted but couldn\u2019t use! Because it makes large phones feel a lot smaller.\nEffortlessly secured. Your phone would immediately feel secure in your hand, even if you\u2019re not gripping it at all!\nSlippery no longer. Those beautiful aluminum bodies are as pretty as they are slippery. But not anymore! Say goodbye to accidental slippage and drops. You won\u2019t miss them.\nB*tch-slapped by a phone. Tell the truth... this has happened to you before. It\u2019s embarrasing and it hurts. Ungrip will protect you from your phone!\nJust like the good ol\u2019 days. You can now use your phone with one hand again... oh, joy!\n Having Ungrip on your phone allows you to use your phone with one-handed ease.\nPLAY\n\n There are many ways to hold your phone when using Ungrip. Check out some of them here...\nPLAY\n\nMobile Reviews Eh! Check out their site here! Thanks, Aaron! :D\n-------------------\nWe're lucky to get another awesome review from the Murphy Report. It's just an article this time... but just as awesome! :)\nAttaching Ungrip\nPLAY\n\nDetaching Ungrip\nPLAY\n\n Detaching the Strap\nPLAY\n\nFor those who love changing their cases or phones frequently, extra adhesives are a must to ensure continued enjoyment of Ungrip. Since Kickstarter doesn't allow more than one pledge, you may add $5 to your chosen pledge to enjoy an Add On pack.\nFor example: If you're getting a 'Singles - Patterns Collection Pledge' ($16), just add $5 so your total pledge would now be $21. We would then include an Add On to your order. If you want two Add Ons, just add $10 to your pledge... and so on.\nHello! My name is Johann and I\u2019m the designer of Ungrip. Ungrip started a few weeks after I got a new phone. I always used my phone with one hand because I\u2019m lazy, and getting that brand-spanking new large phone was exciting... for the first few weeks. I soon found myself struggling to hold it comfortably, and to hold and use it at the same time! It came to a point that I was about to buy a smaller phone, but I realized I couldn\u2019t live with a small screen again.\nSo being like MacGyver, I took a lanyard strap and stitched it together, then glued it to the back of my case. It looked stupid, but I didn\u2019t care \u2014 I was that frustrated with my phone.\nAlpha 1.0.\nOne day, after using it for about 2 weeks, I realized I wasn\u2019t complaining about how big my phone was anymore. In fact, I didn\u2019t even notice that I had a big phone! That\u2019s when I knew it actually worked! I then thought of developing and marketing this helpful trick. I proceeded to do research on similar solutions in the market, and was surprised to learn that there were many of them available. I liked a solution or two, but in general, none of them really appealed to me. That\u2019s when I decided to develop Ungrip as a better and simpler solution.\nProduct Development Evolution.\nTooling for Ungrip.\nIt\u2019s been more than a year of hard work, but all of it was worth it! I\u2019ve been using Ungrip since Alpha 1.0 and couldn\u2019t be happier.

It\u2019s made with polyester fibers that are arranged in different sized filaments and intertwined, mimicking down\u2019s lofty clusters. These ultrafine fibers trap warmth in air pockets, providing truly great warmth. Synthetic insulation also tends to be hypoallergenic.\nLycra trimmings around legholes prevent from draughts and warm air escape from inside the vest. Standing collar and longer back provide better protection.\nAiryVest is multi-seasonal. Excellent for cold springs, chilly autumns and mild winters.\nThis dog vest is designed for athletic dogs that are going to be running, jumping and adventuring in inclement weather. Therefore, it is a more fitted apparel, allowing your pup to move freely.\nIt does not cover the entire length of most dogs and is designed to keep a dog warm and dry.\nAiryVest \u0441onstruction allows to easily access your pup's collar to attach a leash.\nWe want our pets to be with us all the time and having pet clothing that matches our own style.\nAiryVest apparel provides a great combination of style and function so your pup will look fashionable while keeping warm.\nThe basic collection is comprised of two colorways.

Measure from the base of your dog\u2019s neck (at the collar) to the back of their tail. Just where the back ends and the tail starts.\nB (Chest / Girth). Measure the widest part of your dog\u2019s chest, normally behind the front legs. Make sure to give a little slack. A good rule of thumb is to allow 2 fingers to fit inside of the measuring tape.\nC (Neck). Measure where a collar would be. Again, make sure to give a little slack.\nWe are offering AiryVest at wholesale. No retail markups. No distribution markups. By selling to you directly we can offer a fair price.\nIf you were to buy our apparel at a fancy pet store, it would cost more than $40+ per item (smallest sizes).\nHowever, in order to offer this value, we do have to meet a large minimum order from our factory partners.

With the successful delivery of thousands of Third Hands, Mini Hand will be no exception. Many challenges such as design, sourcing, and assembly have been overcome with our previous products and design iterations. All that remains is to produce Mini Hand in quantities that allow us to keep it as affordable as possible.\n\nOne challenge we foresee is the possibility of an exceptionally large demand. Super large quantities may take longer to procure, but not impossible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Nearly finished with shipping!", "update_content": "Over 400 orders have been shipped!\nWe hope that everyone who has already received their Mini Hands are enjoying them!

The angled connector positions the cable in such a way that allows it for easy access to your device in both portrait and landscape mode, protecting the core of your cable and also offering a comfortable experience to use your device while it is juicing up.\nIts angled tip protects the plug and alleviates strain on your cable.\nYour life and work can not wait until your phone completes a full charge. It is completely fine if you can't stay away from your phone and need to use it while it is charging beside your bed, office, living room or any charging station you create. If you lean your phone against a pillow when you are in bed or if you seat on a armchair or sofa and you position the phone against your body, in most of the cases with time you might experience your straight casing cable needing a bit of twist or plug and unplug it several times until it starts charging. It is result of continuos usage that can cause cable deformation and the core to break out or loosen up so the cable starts to fail. \nRewards are very much to incentive you to get as many cable and colours you want, please check our reward list.\nYour pledge is based on the reward layer you have chosen or managed to get! The project starts with only one cable type 1.5m/4.9ft and the colour pattern will be voted by backers as soon as the project reaches its first goal. From there you can add as many cable as you want (limited by Kickstarter to 10 units max) and any extra goal added we will have different prices for each reward layer! \nDesign chosen.\nDesigns to choose from \nDesigns to be voted, the casing represented on the drawing doesn't reflect the final product.\nParticipate by voting on your favourite colour. The voting will last 5 to7 days or less, depending on the speed we reach our goal, and you can chose as many option as you want. The survey and results will be posted on the project updates only available to backers only. \n We will always inform all the colour winner in the end of each survey but also in the end of the campaign we will post an update mentioning everything that will be produced to avoid confusion or deception with colours availability.\nShare to win!\nTo motivate people to share the campaign and give us a final boost (thank you to all the ones that have done it btw!) I will send 1 unit (not 1 package) per pledge based on social media share. It must be shared on social media and you can either message me or post the link on the comments page. I can send 1 cable clip per different social media you share, just don't forget to message me the link so we can keep count. This offer is for backers only so if a non backer share the project they must join the campaign to be able to claim their \"prize\".\nIf you are not into sharing to win \"prizes\" please fell free to just add the value to your pledge.\nCable clip in development!\n  Reversible USB\nThe reversible USB is a dual-orientation connector that can be plugged into any standard computer USB port to \u201creduce time and any potential USB connector damage and user frustration\". \nWhy not use USB-C?\nBecause Apple Inc. hasn't released the specification for Mfi certification. As soon as the information is available we will work on it and if released while the project is online we will update it to the benefit of our supporters.\nWhy not magnetic?\nBecause again Apple Inc. doesn't approve the MagSafe technology to Lightning cables.\nPLAY\n\n MFi Apple Certified\nProtect Lightning connector.\nC48 Lightning protection\n90 degree casing\nCable and Casing design\nVogue UK\nBritish GQ\nCosmopolitan Germany\n        Other Ways You Can Help\nIf you can not contribute financially, sharing our campaign would be a massive help.
