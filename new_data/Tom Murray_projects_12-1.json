[{"backer": "Tom Murray", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "CRAVING MORE FERRIS FOOTAGE? Watch this video below: it goes over the whole Ferris System in more detail and with more clarity\u2013 and shake testing\u2013 than our campaign video! \n\nIf you're like us, you try keeping things tidy\u2013 but you still waste time every day looking for your wallet, phone, keys and sunglasses. To create a better out-the-door experience, we've reimagined a way to organize and carry these everyday essentials. \nFerris KeyLoop, KeyFolio, and ModWallet in action\u2013 all powered by MagLock\nOur mission at Distil Union is to create products that solve life's little frustrations in a way that makes you smile. We're an independent design studio that's fueled entirely by crowd-funding since 2012 (this is our 9th Kickstarter\u2013 all successful and delivered on time \ud83d\ude4c)! \nFor years we've heard what hundreds of you struggle with when it comes to the stuff you walk out the door with every day\u2013 so we've distilled the problem into an elegant solution which, of course, involves magnets... \nAs it turns out, the best key ring isn't a ring at all.\nKeys rotate freely, and attach to any magnetic surface. (Shown: KeyLoop)\nBuilt for those of us always on the go, Ferris makes life a little bit easier by improving the things you carry and how you store them.  \nShown: Ferris KeyLoop, ModWallet and ModStation\nIt\u2019s time to retire the keyring for something more fun and flexible. \nFerris is a series of secure magnetic components that easily come together and quickly reconfigure as needed. Powered by MagLock, you can slim down and carry only what you need in an instant\u2013 no more, no less, and no tools required.   \nThere are many solutions that have tried to tackle the problem of organization, but they come with their own problems or create other issues... We've grown accustomed to compromises and trade-offs, but these little frustrations really add up! We wanted to reclaim that time, and our sanity... A simple solution is long overdue:\nWe're passionate about designing products that simplify your life in clever ways, and after years of exploration and development, we've created a simple modular system named Ferris. \nStreamline your routine. Walk out the door with lighter pockets, and leave the rest neatly organized on the Ferris ModStation\u2013 a modern catch-all for your most common out-the-door items.  \nThis is Ferris, a hassle-free system of everyday essentials.    \nFerris lets your wallet and keychain adapt to what you need to carry\u2013 eliminating clutter and increasing peace of mind.\nWe set out to create a better key organizer, and arrived at a system that's more than simply functional\u2013 Ferris saves you time and space, and adapts to your life in a fun and meaningful way. That's why Ferris is all about customization\u2013 there's no longer a need to carry different solutions. Instead, make what you carry work for you:     \nThe Ferris leather-goods include KeyLoop, KeyFolio, and ModWallet\n\n\nFerris KeyLoop\nKeyLoop: Carry up to 6 keys + included FobRing holds your car fob, tracker, etc.\n\n\nFerris KeyFolio\nKeyFolio: Carry up to 10 keys + included FobRing holds your car fob, tracker, etc.\n\nFerris ModWallet\nModWallet: Comes with one CardSleeve to carry up to 12 cards, and a MoneyClip for your cash. Also carries add-ons like additional CardSleeves, KeyMods, USB and MultiTool.\nGrab a cover that suits your style and accommodates your carry, or pick a combination that adapts to meet your specific needs from day to day (this is the ideal solution for those of you who have multiple sets of keys, but you don't need to have them all on you all the time).\nImagine the possibilities! Ferris comes together to suit your needs on a daily basis.\nYou can easily stack and rearrange\u2013 even combine your keys and wallet into one consolidated carry so you have one less thing to remember. \nScale up or down. Carry only what you need\u2013 no more, no less, and no tools required! \nFerris is powered by our patent-pending MagLock. This magnetic locking mechanism gives you the perfect balance of security and access that so many key-organizing solutions fail to provide.  \nFree a key instantly to easily swap out + share as needed.  \nFerris leathergoods work with KeyMods\u2013 the heart of the Ferris family. They are made with neodymium magnets and a TPU-backed nylon, well-known for its durability and abrasion resistance. Behind these small mechanisms are years of development and testing to achieve a connection that is:\n SECURE  In your pocket, your bag, dropped on the ground, taking a tumble down the stairs... Your keys will remain securely snapped together.\n FLEXIBLE  Magnets join together quickly and easily. They rotate smoothly for key access without removal, and allow for sharing without the need for a tool.\nKeyMods shown with USB, FobRing, MultiTool, MoneyClip and a ModWallet cover.\nThe KeyMods work like double-sided magnetic snaps: Nesting magnets with a male/female construction make a magnet-to-magnet connection that's incredibly strong and allows for rotation. This new MagLock works differently than our MagLock Sunglasses, redesigned and optimized for keys to snap together and rotate. \nIn order to accommodate the majority of keys that people carry, we created two types: KeyMod Clicks and KeyMod Sticks. View the Key Guide and video to learn how they work with your keys in our first Update.\nAny larger keychain items (like a car fob, Tile tracker, or sentimental boondoggles) can be kept on the custom-designed FobRing included with the KeyLoop and the KeyFolio. \n                                                                \u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\u02da\n\nMade to last, with durable materials that feel great in your hand\u2013 and look great in your home. \n\nIt all comes together with the Ferris ModStation: A sleek and modern catch-all that gives everything a proper place. Cutting visual clutter not only saves your sanity:\nModStation helps you stay organized\nreduces the likelihood of lost items\nmakes your out-the-door routine quicker and easier \nModStation is an easy way keep your desk organized and tidy. Shown here with a KeyLoop used to hold headphones, and ModWallet.\nFerris ModStation is so much more than a mail-catch. We call it a \"catch-all\" because the slim steel tray is designed to accommodate your phone, a Kindle, a notebook, and other similarly sized items \nModStation will even hold onto your phone's charging cable so it's always there when you need it\u2013 instead of falling behind your desk or getting lost entirely...\nShown here: ModStation with KeyFolio and MagLock Sunglasses (our successful 2017 Kickstarter!)\nModStation is made of steel with a smooth powder-coat finish. Easy to mount where you need it, all ModStations include a set of screws as well as a panel of 3M removable adhesive that's also magnetic (so you can mount ModStation to any magnetic surface, like a fridge or steel door). \nShown here: ModStation with ModWallet. BONUS: Ferris leathergoods instantly hold anything magnetic, like AirPods.\nStop searching for your stuff. \nStreamline your routine. \nAnd take back your time.\nEveryone's needs are different, and we're excited to hear how Ferris adapts to meet yours :) \nAny surface that could use tidying up, could use a ModStation.\n\nKeyMod MultiTool (including bottle-opener) and KeyMod USB (16GB) are available as Add-Ons to any Pledge Level.\nMagLock Sunglasses are available as Add-Ons to any Pledge Level (choose style after the campaign).\nDIY: How to Customize Your Ferris \n Ferris is modular. Each element of the Ferris System has its own pledge level: KeyLoop, KeyFolio, ModWallet and ModStation. Each is a complete product that stands alone, or can be added to for custom solutions (see Ferris Recommendation Matrix below).\n Want additional items? We want you to have the best Ferris experience, so all Add-Ons are at Early Bird prices! It's a great deal for all who pledge\u2013 so they're only available as Add-Ons in addition to one of the Pledge Levels. 1. Select a Pledge Level. 2. Grab a calculator and check the Add-Ons Menu . 3. Enter the total amount as your pledge.\n The Easy Button = Pick one of the KITS (assortments at a discount). It's the perfectly easy way to get started with Ferris. You can pick a KIT from the blue menu above and call it a day, or add additional items to your KIT by doing the math and entering the total amount for your pledge.\nOur Best Advice: Pledge at the level that looks good to you, and relax knowing that you'll have the ability after the campaign to adjust your pledge and select colors. You can also message us with what you carry, we're happy to make recommendations!

We've delivered on every single Kickstarter, so you can feel confident backing this project.   \nOur small, independent business is powered by crowd-funding since our first Kickstarter in 2012!\nFor the past two+ years, we've gone through countless prototypes to refine our ideas and work through all the details. We've listened to what frustrates you about your daily items, and we're excited to share our hard work with you\u2013 and for Ferris to make a difference in your everyday. \nThe Ferris Collection is our biggest undertaking to date, and we're back on Kickstarter because we need your help. We're seeking the funding that we need for materials and manufacturing for the first Ferris production run.    \nWe're working with trusted manufacturing partners whom we've worked with before\u2013 and in January we relocated to Asia so we can be close to the factory to ensure everything runs smoothly. As production progresses we'll keep you informed along the way, and let our Backers in behind the scenes with updates while we work to bring Ferris to life.  \nWe bounce between Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Tokyo to make Ferris the best he can be. #digitalnomads\nLast but not least: We need your help to get the word out about Ferris\u2013 every share helps! \nWe're super excited to be back on Kickstarter with you, and we truly hope Ferris makes your life a little easier :)  \nDistil Union Co-Founders\nPress coverage for Distil Union product designs *toots own horn*\n\n\n~ cheers! ~\nNate and Lindsay would like to thank our friends and family while they've been on this tireless product-development adventure across the globe!

This allows us to make big changes and little tweaks along the way; the latest set of samples (what you see in the video) is incredibly close to what Ferris will be in production. To get these samples and stay on schedule, we were down to the wire, but our fantastic team made it happen (including a dash around Tokyo to locate the right FedEx)! Here's a basic schedule so you can see what our projected delivery date will be:\n MAY = Kickstarter campaign begins!  \n JUNE = We can initiate tooling during the campaign, giving us a head start on elements of production which take more time, like ordering materials and making the tools needed to create components. \n JULY = The first in-production samples will be approved; we will inspect at the factory.\n AUGUST = Production is completed; we will inspect at the factory. Products in packaging will ship to our US warehouse.\n SEPTEMBER = Delivery to Backers begins!\nSubject to change\u2013 of course, we'll let you know of any unexpected surprises (good or bad!)\nThis round of samples we photographed for the Kickstarter look great, and they're only going to get better as we move closer to production\u2013 with your help!\nThanks to all who have shared your thoughts and experiences with us over the years\u2013 this one's for you!\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\n.\n.\n.  \n.\n.\n.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're confident we can see this new family of products through to a level that will make US proud and YOU a happy Backer.

Past solutions to this problem left you with two choices:\nClutter your expensive glasses with uncomfortable and unflattering \"sunglass straps\" \nResort to the endless cycles of cheaply made \"disposable\" sunglasses that risk not providing your eyes with the true benefits of protection \nAfter he lost his most expensive pair of sunglasses, our co-founder Nate Justiss was fed up and finally had an a-ha moment. And with that, we set out to design an elegant solution made to satisfy the picky minimalist. We've spent 6 years in development to get it right, and now we want to share it with you. \n  Falling-Sunglasses Fail vs. Secure with MagLock\nHow did we solve dropped and lost sunglasses? Magnets hidden in the arms secure your glasses to your shirt, bag, and any magnetic surface. And with flexible, unbreakable shape-memory frames, and our super strong, anti-scratch lenses, you don't have to worry about breaking your MagLock Sunglasses. Finally you can feel as carefree not wearing your sunglasses as you do wearing them.  \nIf MagLock Sunglasses stay put in our tests, you know they're good to go\u2013 from your daily commute, to your next outdoor adventure. \nAmerican Ninja Warrior Tested!\n    =^._.^= \u222b Kitten Approved! \u0e05/\u1420\uff61\u11bd\uff61\u141f \\\n    Actual hammer test\n             MagLock\u2122 is our all new patent-pending design with neodymium magnets incorporated into the arms of the frame. The magnets are completely integrated so that no surface meets your skin (safe for those with nickel allergies), and the magnets themselves will be free of surface wear, scratching or corrosion. \nFrame Features: \nMagLock\u2122 secures your glasses to your shirt or bag, and will stay in place any magnetic surface\nFace friendly soft-touch materials for comfort and non-slip fit\nLightweight, flexible frame comfortably hugs your head \nDurable high-performance material with shape memory: MagLock Sunglasses are made to last \nComfortable, durable frame with shape memory flexes to fit your face\n  FDA approved impact-resistant lenses are lightweight, polarized, 100% UV protected and scratch resistant. Gray lenses ease eye strain and allow for truest color perception.\nLens Features: \n100% UVA and UVB protection \nPolarized core reduces glare and eye strain \nAnti-reflective interior \nScratch-resistant exterior and interior\nLightweight lenses provide optimal visual clarity, with polarized core to improve contrast and reduce glare and eyestrain\n  PSA: Sunglasses are good for you! The American Academy of Ophthalmology has designated July as \"UV Safety Awareness Month.\" Protecting your eyes isn\u2019t just for the summer months\u2013 UV light contributes to macular degeneration, cataracts and other eye complications. Cheap sunglasses falsely claiming to protect against UV let even more of the harmful UV rays into your dilated pupils, potentially causing more damage than not wearing sunglasses at all.\nWe've sourced premium UV400 lenses, which block 100% of UVA and UVB rays, plus a polarized core and anti-reflective coating to further reduce glare and eye strain. \n  Sunnies are notoriously difficult to keep track of, and the best pair really are the ones you have with you. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve designed these sunglasses to be the most comfortable sunglasses to wear and the most difficult to lose. \n   ON THE LIGHT SWITCH | Grab-and-go convenience\n  ON THE FRIDGE | Always know where your sunglasses are\n  ON THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR | Polarized glasses protect against road glare. Fun fact: Don't keep any sunglasses in the car during the summer, as the heat will damage the lenses.\n  ON YOUR BAG | Scratch-free storage on the go (instead of on your head)\n                                      Folly: The Laidback Seafarer in a classic wayfarer-style with keyhole bridge. Named after Folly Beach, Charleston\u2019s surf-haven at the \u201cEdge of America.\u201d After the Kickstarter, you can choose from 4 matte colors: Black, Gray, Kelp and Surf. \n        Sullivan: The Modern Aviator in a lightweight with iconic double bridge. Named after Sullivan\u2019s Island, home of Charleston\u2019s surprisingly modern lighthouse. After the Kickstarter, you can choose from 4 matte colors: Black, Gray, Marine and Sand.\n  Sunglasses are an essential part of your everyday carry, and MagLock Sunglasses are ready for any adventure!\n    See fine-print details in the FAQ. Bottom line: We've got your eyes covered.\n  We've considered the entire package, down to... well, the package! \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af We designed a collapsible hard case and soft lens-cleaning cloth sleeve, included with every pair to help keep your Distil Sunglasses protected and scratch-free.\nIncluded hardshell case folds flat for easy storage - so your glasses stay protected in your bag\nInstead of a box that will just be thrown away, Distil Sunglasses are packaged in an innovative hardshell case that folds completely flat. Based on the original design by Tom Davies (British bespoke-glasses creator and all-around swell guy), our take is inspired by the Apple iPad Cover: Durable fabric case with soft-touch lining, finished with heat-sealed edges for a clean, modern look. \nThese cases are so useful and unique, we've made them available as a separate pledge level to use with any glasses up to 142mm x 55mm. Keep your other sunglasses or prescription glasses scratch-free and protected in your bag. \n       In 2011, Nate lost the most expensive pair of sunglasses he\u2019d ever bought. He was determined never to lose a pair of glasses again. It was the year we founded Distil Union, and Nate disappeared into the workshop and hacked together a simple fix using a pair of shades he didn\u2019t really care about messing up.... and guess what? He hasn't lost that DIY pair, 6 years later. The tweak worked. His determination paid off. \nA huge perk about having a workshop is that we can create hacks that make a difference in our own lives #makersgonnamake. Beyond making and hacking, we have over a decade of experience in actual large scale mass-market manufacturing. So for years we've been working hard to develop a manufacturing technique to produce these problem-solving shades on a larger scale. And the best thing about Kickstarter is the chance to bring those life-simplifying products to other people\u2019s lives! \nHow does this simple, integrated solution not already exist?! We've asked ourselves the same question\u2013 and one reason they haven\u2019t been made yet is because it\u2019s not easy (as we've learned). Other attempts have been made to solve this problem, of course, but for us they all miss the mark. Each and every one requires that you use something in addition to the glasses, which goes against one of our fundamental beliefs:\nThe Distil Union mission is to simplify your life and distil your everyday. Our products are simply functional, and made to satisfy the picky minimalist. Only an elegant, integrated solution will do\u2013 so we\u2019ve spent years in development to get it right:\nMANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES We learned different methods of how glasses are manufactured by going straight to the sources. Then, because we\u2019re designing for a new functionality in sunglasses, we took a completely fresh approach to the materials and construction. We asked ourselves: What materials or construction methods might not be considered \"standard\" but actually work better to solve the problem? \nMATERIAL SELECTION It was important to us that we understand the material properties best suited not just for functionality, but also for ideal comfort and fit. Lightweight and durable, made of face-friendly soft touch materials for comfort and non-slip wearing. Instead of hard frames that hurt your head or slide off your nose, we've designed them to be the most comfy frames to grace your face. \nFUNCTION + FIT FOR ALL Rather than producing a bunch of seasonal frames, we are focused on the optimum fit in two shapes: The wayfarer-style and the aviator are timeless, unisex styles that suit all faces. \nXiexie \u8c22\u8c22 and mhgoi \u5514\u8a72 to our Asia team! From Hong Kong to Shenzhen\u2013 Anson, Tracy, Karen, Tim, Eunice, Simon, Fong, Sandy and Leon!\n \nOur manufacturing partners know their craft. Lindsay and Nate toured their facilities earlier this year and worked with them face-to-face to develop our unique frames. They produce eyeglasses for premium brands and are one of the world's largest manufacturers of high-end acetate frames. We wish we could take you on a tour of their place (so large it takes a golf cart to get around). It is one of the most pristine and highest-tech, vertically integrated factories we've ever been to. With their backing, we're confident we can deliver an on-time and quality product. \n    Wearing 3D-printed glasses makes you feel like you're in the future\n    PROTOTYPE GALLERY: 3D-prints in various materials to test size, fit and function of our designs\n  PLAY\n\nTimelapse of Nate assembling an early 3D-printed prototype. The lenses are from our manufacturing partner, and fit perfectly into the models. After finding the right sized screws, we were able to wear and test these like normal sunglasses. \nUniversally flattering frame shapes, and they flex to comfortably fit heads of nearly every size\n  Delivery in time for Christmas\u2013 and summer Down Under :) To be honest, you should be wearing shades 365 days a year for good eye health!\n  Seeing how people react when they try our prototypes has been oh so satisfying, and we\u2019re ready to go from prototype into production. Our goal is to deliver the most comfortable, long-lasting sunglasses you\u2019ve ever owned. And with your help, we can finally get our patent-pending design out into the world. \nPlease keep in mind that Kickstarter is not a traditional store. Backing us means you're pledging your support because you believe in our design and our ability to deliver (as we have on all our previous 6 Kickstarters). As a way to say thank you! for believing in us, you get a massive discount and first access to the new product, as well as updates along the way as our production journey continues beyond this campaign. \n      Distil Union is a micro-collective of designers and design-lovers in Charleston, SC who are having fun (and working hard) creating solutions to real-life problems. Our incentive to innovate comes from a deep desire to create helpful objects that people love. \nIn 2011, we joined together (Union, get it?) to create the products we want to see on the shelves. Selfish? Perhaps. Exciting? You bet your pants it is! Entirely self-funded on a bootstrap budget, we launched our first product on Kickstarter in 2012. After working in the \u201cbig-box retail\u201d industry for so long, it was a rush being part of the dynamic crowdfunding community that allowed us as designers to connect directly with customers, users, backers \u2013 you. And that was it, we were hooked. \n...plus our 1st Kickstarter for Snooze Dock that started it all in 2012!\n  Since our first Kickstarter in 2012, thousands of Distil Union goods have been shipped to 101 countries, including 5,141 on-time Kickstarter pledges to 3,150 Backers. We\u2019re lucky to have been on our life-simplifying mission now for six years, and with six successful campaigns under our belt, this will be our 7th Kickstarter. Our company and products have been featured in:\n  To bring these sunglasses to life, we're seeking the funding needed to pay for tooling. We\u2019ve come so far, but we can\u2019t do this alone\u2013 will you pledge your support, or help us spread the word?

This time, we set out to design a stand that would function well and look great not just on a bedside table or desk, but also in an entry way, by the couch, in the kitchen \u2013 anywhere in your home. We also didn't want to limit its use to iPhones, so we scrapped Snooze and started from scratch. Working with some of our favorite materials, we developed something entirely new... something more flexible \u2013 literally!\nWe started out with some really great and adaptable forms, but quickly realized they didn't have the most stable geometry or all the flexibility we needed. After experimenting with some bendable metal samples we had around the office, we quickly made some proof-of-concept models; there was something there, but it needed a lot of refinement. After a few iterations, we developed a simple construction that focused the bending in just three points which gave us enough freedom of motion to adapt to any useful viewing angle.\nMaterials: We explored wood, rubber and various metals before landing on steel, leather and felt\nIf left up to our intern, Pemba, all Stanleys would be the turquoise felt...\nEndless flexibility in one small footprint\n  Bonus: The included 6-foot USB extension cable works with your existing USB charging cable and wall plug, making it easier to connect to those hard-to-reach outlets. The cable is covered in a woven fabric and is tangle resistant.\nAnd if you need to take your charging cable with you, we love these 4\" cables from InCase and the Native Union JUMP cable/battery for the ultimate in grab-and-go portability.\n\nThe Kickstarter community has been the driving force behind our development \u2013 not just of products, but of our small business. Nothing compares to the feedback and community involvement here on Kickstarter, so we're back to raise the funds we need to produce Stanley. Thank you for your support! Please consider sharing the word about Stanley:\nDistil Union is a micro-collective of designers in Charleston, SC who are having fun (and working hard) creating solutions to real-life problems. Our incentive to innovate comes from a deep desire to create objects that people love. \nFor Stanley, we're seeking the funding needed to cover the cost of materials and tooling (the leather-cutting dies), to manufacture our first production run to meet minimum quantities, and also cover Kickstarter / credit-card processing fees (up to 10%).

(Note - changed from switch to placement for switch due to requests of not integrating a physical switch)\nTimeline", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing\n\nThis is everyone's biggest fear - capability to manufacture. We have a dedicated team located within an hour drive from the manufacturer so that we can deal with issues that may arise in person and in real time. Our team is staffed with experienced professionals in the sourcing and hardware manufacturing industries. Our expertise and proximity to the factory should be able to mitigate any of the manufacturing issues that may occur. TL Lim has successfully launched multiple media boxes called the Popcorn Hour shipping over half a million units to date while Johnson Jeng has been through the entire manufacturing process multiple times with his other consumer electronics companies. Our combined experiences and issues we have faced in the past allows us to maneuver around problems that may happen during production.\n\nSupport\n\nPINE64 will be released as an open platform project allowing others from all around the world contribute and build upon. We have a dedicated forum (http://forum.pine64.org) built to address questions and concerns. We currently have tons of beta testers that are willing to share ideas and help solve problems as a community. \n\nWe have asked industry specialists such as Daniel Kottke, #12 employee of Apple, and Kai Kreuzer, Founder of OpenHAB to help with contributing to our forums. Our experienced technical staff is always available via email at support@pine64.com to assist you with any questions or concerns.\n\n\nGlobal Logistics\n\nWe are working with highly experienced logistic partners to help us mitigate any issues that may arise with our fulfillment. If shipping issues come up, their expert knowledge will help us navigate through difficulties and help us get PINE64 into your hands. We will be fulfilling from multiple distribution warehouses to reach global coverage and currently plan to ship to every country in the world. TL's previous company Syabas Technologies behind the Popcorn Hour media box has shipped more than half a million units globally.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 5148, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pine64/pine-a64-first-15-64-bit-single-board-super-comput", "project_name": "PINE A64, First $15 64-Bit Single Board Super Computer"}}, {"backer": "Tom Murray", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "** UPDATE: Stickers Added! **\nEvery pledge will now come with a ProtoZero GPIO sticker, as a little thanks for all the support.\nHere's an image of what the sticker will look like - great for your laptop lid, toolbox, notebook, Pi case and other places:\nThe sticker design with GPIO pinout - handy!\nWhat is the ProtoZero?\nThe ProtoZero is a breadboard-style prototyping board for the new Raspberry Pi Zero (and possibly the first ever Pi Zero based Kickstarter campaign?).\nProtoZero Front & Rear\nTell me more!\nThe ProtoZero is designed to make it easy to move your messy Raspberry Pi breadboard projects to a PCB.\nSimply add your components to the prototyping area, connect GPIO, power and GND as required - solder it all up and away you go!\nLet's show you the key features:\n- Full breakout of the PiZero's 40-Pin GPIO header, ready to connect to your project\n- 154 holes of prototyping area - set in lanes of 3+ to make it even easier to connect your components to the Pi\n- Labelled GPIO numbers and printed lanes on both sides on the board\n- High-quality ENIG (Electroless nickel immersion gold) PCB plating\n- Female GPIO header included\n- Kit form: requires soldering of the GPIO header\nProtoZero Front\nProtoZero Rear\nProtoZero Front-Side\nProtoZero Left-Side\nIs it a HAT?\nNot quite. Whilst it does have holes that align with the PiZero's mount holes, the board doesn't have an EEPROM or any of the other official HAT requirements.\nIt's also not something to wear on your head.\nWhich Raspberry Pi does it fit?\nThe name of course suggests that this board is for the new Raspberry Pi Zero, however it will fit any Raspberry Pi models with 40 GPIO pins. That's the Pi Zero, A+, B+ and Pi 2.\nIt will not fit any of the older 26-pin models due to the header being blocked by the composite video connector.\nOf course this board was designed with the new Pi Zero in mind, which is obvious from the size and mount holes - but don't let that stop you using it as a neat little board for your other 40-pin Raspberry Pi models.\nProtoZero on a Raspberry Pi 2\nProtoZero on a Raspberry Pi A+\nExample Project - LED Scanner\nLet's say you were experimenting with some LEDs, writing code to make them flash in different patterns and sequences. You've probably wired it up with a breadboard like this:\nPLAY\n\nWouldn't it be cool to make your very own 'add-on' style board for your project, that you can fit and remove again and again?\nThat's where the ProtoZero comes in. Simply spend a few minutes working out where you want your LEDs to sit on the PCB, and where resistors and wires will be placed, and then solder these to the ProtoZero.\nPLAY\n\nHere I decided to solder the resistors to the rear of the board to make the front even tidier.\nProtoZero 7 LED project\nYou could add different size or colour LEDs, buzzers, sensors, ICs, RTCs, headers and pretty much anything else that will fit!\nCan I stack it?\nYes! The ProtoZero comes with a standard header, but if you decide to use a stacking header (available in most good maker stores around the globe) you can stack ProtoZero boards on top of each other.\nPledges come with a standard header as the design was intended to be small and low profile, just like the Pi Zero itself.\nProtoZeros stacked (stacking header not included)\nDesign Changes  \nRefinement\nUnlike my previous Kickstarter campaigns where I had a finalised product at the time of launch, the ProtoZero is still being refined although 95% of the design is confirmed.\nI will be refining the product during the course of the campaign to tidy up small things like the ambitiously tiny silkscreen print on the rear. I'll also look at other minor changes such as potentially changing the pads from circle to square to make soldering easier. I already have these prototype revisions on order.\nColour\nI'm also reviewing the colour, looking at using the usual ProtoBoards black/gold theme to keep in line with my previous campaigns.\nPCB Quality\nThe current prototype PCB you see in the images and videos is made by OSH Park - a renowned printed circuit board manufacturer in the USA.\nProtoZero PCB\nI've used various PCB manufacturers previously but chose OSH Park for the prototypes due to the low-cost low-volume options they offer. This has allowed me to keep the initial pre-Kickstarter costs down.\nThe final boards that are included in your pledges will be made by one of a few different reliable board houses that I have used in my previous Kickstarter campaigns.\nBelow is a video showing my previous Kickstarter PCBs - I may use the same PCB manufacturer including the black/gold colour scheme again:\nPLAY\n\nPrice\nThis is an interesting subject when making an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi Zero.\nThe clever people at the Raspberry Pi Foundation have done such a good job on making the Pi Zero as cost-effective as possible (and manufacturing MUCH larger numbers than a 1-man-band like myself) that it's very hard to price this product relative to the cost of the Pi.\nSo whilst I've tried to keep costs down as much as possible, there's only so much I can do at the low order quantities that the ProtoZero will be made at.\nWhat you get?\nLet's confirm what is included in the different pledge options:\n(Remember: the ProtoZero is sold as a kit. You will need to solder the 40-pin header (the same soldering effort as you will have undertaken with the Pi Zero)\nProtoZero Personal Pack\nA single ProtoZero kit for the curious makers out there: 1x ProtoZero PCB, 1x 40-pin GPIO header.\nProtoZero Twin Pack\nTwo ProtoZero kits, double the fun: 2x ProtoZero PCBs, 2x 40-pin GPIO headers (Pi Zero not included!).\nProtoZero Triple Pack\nThree ProtoZero kits. Three's a crowd, but this is a good crowd: 3x ProtoZero PCBs, 3x 40-pin GPIO headers (Pi Zero not included!).\nProtoZero Quad Pack\nFour ProtoZero kits. You're some kind of serious maker! 4x ProtoZero PCBs, 4x 40-pin GPIO headers (Pi Zero not included!).\nProtoZero Five Pack\nFive ProtoZero kits. The top pledge, the gold standard! 5x ProtoZero PCBs, 5x 40-pin GPIO headers (Pi Zero not included!).\nProtoZero Draft Packaging (bag will likely be black in the final version)\nWhen do you get it?\nThe campaign is aiming to post all pledges in March 2016. I'd like to say 'deliver' in March, but some of you guys live in far away lands so it might take a lot longer to get to you.\nIf all pledges are with the Royal Mail in March 2016, I'm calling it a success!\nHow much is postage?\nAll pledges from the UK have postage included - it's factored into the price.\nFor everywhere else in the world it's an additional \u00a33. This is simply how much it costs, and there's no way of making this any cheaper. The price to different countries varies very slightly, but it's always around this mark.\nStretch Goals\nIn my previous two Kickstarter campaigns I avoided the use of stretch goals to keep things simple and avoid any possible complications. I simply wanted to deliver the product being kickstarted and do that on time, to quality and to cost.\nThose projects both delivered on time and exactly as described, so I'm going to take the same approach here and avoid any stretch goals that will distract from the plan.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI really want to make this board and see it being used in projects all over the internet (and maybe the ISS one day - a man can dream!).\nThe Raspberry Pi Zero is a great design and its small form factor makes it ideal for small fun projects - especially ones you can clip on with a board like the ProtoZero!\nUnfortunately I'm not one of those lucky people with hundreds of pounds spare to get a large batch made. This is why I'm here, presenting the product to you to gain funding to allow me to do this.\nWhere is the early bird?\nUnfortunately there wasn't any room in the budget to add a decent size early bird. I really wanted this kit to be super affordable, which means things like early bird pledges have to be sacrificed.\nNot in the shops (yet)!\nAt the time of launch there is currently no plan to supply this board to electronics stores - so you could call it limited edition, but there's no guarantee.\nMy primary focus is on this campaign and providing you good people with the product you've given your hard earned money for. Whilst I will make more boards than I need to cover myself for defects etc, I will only supply stores if requests come in during the campaign.\nWho am I?\nI'm Richard Saville, Also known as 'Average Man' from my popular Raspberry Pi blog AverageManVsRaspberryPi.com.\nAverage Man Vs Raspberry Pi - that's mine!\nI'm not a programmer, teacher or any way linked to the Raspberry Pi other than my 'hobbyist' activity - generally making little projects and writing about them.\nI'm 'nearly 30' and have a wife Claire and 18-month old little girl Evie. I live in Southend-on-Sea in Essex (UK) and commute to a day job in the city of London as a Business Analyst. Rock n' Roll huh?\nI've got a 100% track record on Kickstarter so far, with 2 projects under my belt both of which delivered on time and with lots of positive feedback. I really hope to see some of those same names popping up on this campaign.\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions at all, just ask. I'll respond to every comment made on this campaign, and I'll always be 100% honest and open.\nIf you haven't pledged but still want to ask something, try me on Twitter (@AverageManVsPi).\nShare Share Share!\nSharing makes a massive difference and helps get the word out.

Amazing coffee is the result when fresh roasted beans are brewed to perfection, with keen attention paid to every step - water quality, grinding, measuring, blooming, heating and steeping.\nInspired by the timeless tradition of handcrafted coffee and modeled after the skills of a well-trained barista, Bruvelo was built to be simple, smart, and to do one thing - extremely well.\nWhether you want to easily brew an amazing cup of coffee with a push of a button or want complete control over every detail, Bruvelo will allow you to enjoy fine, handcrafted, pour-over coffee in the comfort of your own home.\nAmazing Coffee. Amazingly Easy.\nThe Bruvelo has three built-in 'Flavor Profiles', each bringing out unique characteristics of the beans with just the push of a button.\nChoose between Delicate, Balanced and Robust and the Bruvelo will automatically adjust the grind and brew settings to bring out the delicate flavors and aromas locked inside the grounds. It's amazing how different the same bean can taste when brewed with different ratios and steep times. Go on, experiment, and enjoy the wonderful complexities of various beans from all over the world!\nComplete Control with WiFi + App\nIf you'd like complete control over the brewing process, connect the Bruvelo to WiFi and use the mobile app to create Recipes.\nRecipes control temperature, ground-to-water ratio and steep time for a particular bean. Once created, Recipes automatically appear on the Bruvelo where you can easily brew your favorite beans, just the way you like, with a simple tap.\nWhether you simply want a cup of great coffee, or want complete control over every detail... enjoy a smooth, perfectly balanced cup of coffee\u2026 with the push of a button.\nTo create the Bruvelo, we focused on all of the individual parts of a coffee maker, optimizing each to ensure the best cup of coffee with every brew. Then we made sure they all work well in delicious harmony.\nGreat coffee starts with fresh ground beans. The removable built-in ceramic burr grinder grinds just the right amount of beans based on your Flavor Profile or the Recipe you're brewing.\nIn addition, the grinder has been set to work in perfect harmony with the rest of the Bruvelo. The grind particle sizes are in perfect balance with the steep times and filter pore sizes. This ensures an incredible taste that you just won't find in a regular coffee maker.\nGround-to-water ratios are extremely important to a great tasting cup of coffee. A difference of just half a gram of beans can make a very noticeable difference in how the coffee tastes.\nA weigh scale built into the Bruvelo has an accuracy of just 0.1g (a truly amazing accomplishment in itself!). No more weighing beans or guessing about the number of scoops. The result is a perfectly smooth, perfectly balanced cup of coffee, every time.\nSay goodbye to using expensive bottled water when brewing your favorite cup of joe. The Bruvelo filters great tasting water using a coconut shell carbon block water filter.\nThe water filter in the Bruvelo is an ANSI/NSF Particulate Class III carbon block water filter that's been formulated to pass NSF 42 certifications. In other words, it creates really, really great tasting water. Why is this important? Coffee is about 98% water. You got to start with quality water if you want quality coffee.\nProper brew temperatures might seem like a boring detail, but in reality, it\u2019s really really important when it comes to extracting all the subtle flavors and aromas from the grounds. Between 195\u2070F and 205\u2070F is generally the best brewing temperature, but we\u2019ve found 199\u2070F to be ideal for most beans. The Bruvelo maintains 199\u2070F throughout the entire brew process. No detail is too boring when it comes to great coffee.\nLike your coffee brewed at a specific temperature? Connect it to WiFi and use the mobile app to brew your coffee, at the temperature you love.\nThe Bruvelo uses a standard 01 paper coffee filter to ensure a clean, smooth taste and a wonderful mouth feel. Simply fold the filter and drop it into the brew chamber and the Bruvelo takes the extra step to pre-rinse the filter before the brewing begins\u2026 this not only pre-heats internal components, but ensures that the only thing you taste in the cup, is coffee. Pure, unadulterated coffee.\nAs any great barista will tell you (and even your casual coffee connoisseur) it\u2019s important to aerate the grounds just before brewing. Aerating the grounds prepares them for optimal extraction. This is typically called the \u201cbloom phase\u201d, and the Bruvelo blooms like nobody\u2019s business.\nEverything about the Bruvelo, both inside and out, has been designed with quality, and the coffee, in mind. For instance, on the exterior we've chosen quality extruded aluminum for the towers to ensure a solid structure, look and feel. The base is glass with a capacitive touch screen console (it's like tapping on your cell phone!).\nOn the inside, we've chosen an extremely accurate and reliable peristaltic pump for water transfer. This is not only very quiet, but extremely accurate in water measurements. In addition, we've chosen every material that comes into contact with the water or coffee with great care, and chosen only materials that will not impart any unwanted flavors or aromas.\nSpeaking of being quiet, the grinder motor is one of the quietest we've tested. Plus, the use of a ceramic burr grinder does an excellent job of managing heat buildup during grinding - which protects the delicate oils which are so important in the coffee's taste.\n(One thing to note, the copper heating coil you see in the pictures is a prototype coil. In production the heating element will be silver - and much more beautiful!).\nBeing an avid coffee lover, I was pretty excited when my old drip coffee maker broke. Unable to find a new one that could replicate what I could brew by hand - I set out to build one with the simple goal of automating my morning ritual.\nI remember thinking\u2026 \u201cThis should be easy! I should have it done by the weekend!\u201d. And so the journey began.\nWhere it all started.\nAfter about 6 months of testing various temperatures, ratios, grind settings, steep times and filter pore sizes (that worked with a majority of beans), I was ready to start automating the whole thing.\nTesting a new carbon block water filter.\nWanting to make it a little more presentable, design of something more aesthetically pleasing began.\nDrawings and cardboard mock-ups proving out usability and dimensions.\nAfter working out a few usability kinks - CAD prototyping and mechanical engineering began. Valuable partnerships where formed with some of the best electrical, mechanical and design engineers I could find. In addition, water quality, manufacturing and material experts provided valuable guidance.\nPictures sure do make it look easy.\nOver eighteen months later - and after many, many prototypes (& gallons of coffee!), version 1 was complete. Great tasting water, pre-rinsed coffee filter, grinding, blooming and brewing with perfect temps and ratios... all with a push of a button!\nBut most of all - the coffee is *amazing*!\nCheck out the size of the WiFi module!\nWiFi connectivity and a mobile app were added enabling hardcore coffee connoisseurs complete control over the brew process. Suddenly beans of all types, and from all regions of the world, were being brewed using the parameters that brought out the best in that particular bean.\nCoffee ground sifter - used to measure grind particle sizes.\nAfter taking the Bruvelo as far as I could financially, I found myself at a crossroads. I could continue working my day job (at one of the best jobs I\u2019ve ever had btw), or I could take a chance on my passion.\nIn the end, I\u2019d rather pour my heart into this\u2026 and give it all I\u2019ve got\u2026 than to be 85 and wonder \u201cWhat if?\u201d\nThat\u2019s the story of Bruvelo so far\u2026 and it\u2019s just the beginning. And I\u2019d love to have you along for the ride. \nHere\u2019s to pursuing your dreams!\nDustin\nThe dramatic difference between coffee from a fine coffee house and what comes from your average coffee maker just fascinates me. Several years ago I set out to solve this great mystery in life. One of the things I discovered during my quest is the Coffee Brewing Control Chart.\nDifferent beans require different brew parameters.\nThe 'Coffee Brewing Control Chart' represents the relationship between strength, extraction and the ground-to-water ratios. When used along with a coffee refractometer you can essentially measure how well coffee has been brewed (gross simplification - but you get the point). When these three variables come to together, the results are simply amazing. And it doesn't happen when you simply heat up water and pour it over an arbitrary amount of grounds.\nA particularly fun day of testing.\nBuilding a coffee maker that makes it easy to brew the caliber of coffee you'd typically only get when brewing it by hand has been the driving principal at Bruvelo.\nAnd we couldn't be happier to share the incredible taste of a wonderful cup of coffee with you.\nHere's a little \"less polished\" video (shown in the Week #3 Update), but I wanted to show an end-to-end running of the Bruvelo...\nPLAY\n\nAs of October 1st 2014 we've completed the final prototype which has been designed for manufacturability. We\u2019re continuing to make refinements to ensure quality and ease of manufacturing and assembly. With your support we\u2019ll be able to complete certifications and order tooling and raw materials - and ultimately bring the Bruvelo to market!\nWHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON: We're heads down in software code at the moment. We're also testing new materials for the base-plate (immediately under the brew chamber where the cup sits) to ensure it's as durable as possible.\nA FEW THINGS TO NOTE: The copper heating coil you see in the pictures is a prototype coil. In production the heating element will be silver - much more beautiful!\nWe're also investigating a lid for the bean hopper and water carafe. As a backer, we'd love your thoughts on this subject!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo minimize the risk to you, I\u2019ve personally funded the design and development of (multiple) prototypes as well as IoT and mobile development. This has enabled me to work through major functionality, usability, design and implementation challenges up front. \n\nBut as with any complex project there are inherent challenges, the major ones we see that could impact timelines are:\n\nUL CERTIFICATION:\nWe\u2019ve been working with a leading independent electrical testing and certification lab throughout our design and prototyping, and feel confident about the certification process going smoothly. We've accounted for additional iteration and testing in our timeline and are prepared to make design tweaks and adjustments during this phase if necessary.\n\nMANUFACTURING: \nWe\u2019ve designed the Bruvelo to be easily manufactured and assembled from the beginning (and in a cost effective manner). The version shown in the pictures and videos is the DFM (design for manufacturability). The materials and components will not only perform well, but will keep the Bruvelo within an affordable price point. But there\u2019s a risk in the tooling and manufacturing process that might cause the design to change slightly. If too many of these occur, it could cause delays in shipping. But you\u2019ll be made aware of what we\u2019re doing every step of the way if any of these scenarios occur.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we'd be happy to share these things with you, our valuable backers, and get your feedback! \n\nFULFILLMENT:\nWe\u2019ve chosen to use third-party fulfillment services (think Amazon Fulfillment Services, Shipwire, etc) to handle warehousing and drop shipping. Ironing out smooth interactions between suppliers, manufacturers, warehousing, drop shipping and front-end ordering systems will take a lot of work and coordination. To minimize the possibility of any setback impacting the entire process, I\u2019m working closely with folks who have \u201cbeen there before\u201d to ensure we do everything we can to bring the Bruvelo into your kitchen as smoothly and quickly as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dustin Sell (deleted)\n2 created \u00b7 48 backed\nProud US Navy veteran.

There are currently six fully designed and tested bricks.  They work great and really allow you to \"free your mind\" and come up with all kinds of fun creations, expand your creativity and get more fun time out of your toys!  We need your Kickstarter support so we can build plastic injection molds for the six new bricks.  Then we can bring Versa Bricks\u2122 to the masses!\nhttp://prlink.toledoblade.com/Whitehouse-Ohio-family-brings-their-new-toy-project-to-Kickstartercom,243\nHere's a look at all six bricks!!!\n Where did the Versa Brick\u2122 idea come from?\nThe Versa Brick\u2122 idea came to me way back in 1973 when I was a kid playing with my LEGO\u00ae and Hot Wheels\u00ae tracks.  Once you build everything you can per the instructions, you start to get creative!  Make the tracks go through the LEGO\u00ae buildings and trying to use LEGO\u00ae to support ramps, the ideas are endless!  But the problems are too!  Nothing seemed to hold up.  I always thought there should be a way these toys could be used together, I could picture it in my mind, I could sketch it, but just couldn't make the parts!\nLater in life I now have my own kids and they face the same challenges with these toys that I did.  Then I remembered my ideas from back in '73.  But today I have an engineering degree, 3D solid modeling software, 3D printers and most of all Kickstarter!\nFinally Versa Bricks\u2122 can become reality!\nWhat have we done so far?\nCreated 3D solid models for six new brick designs\nMade prototypes from ABS material using 3D printer \nTested for fit and function\nApplied for patents, Versa Bricks\u2122 are now Patent Pending\nDetermined tooling and productions costs\nCreated a project plan & timeline\nEarly concept sketch.\n  Wire frame model generated by SolidWorks\u00ae\n  Virtual fit & function using SolidWorks\u00ae\nPLAY\n\nVirtual fit & function using SolidWorks\u00ae, Versa Bricks\u2122 shown in red.\nFirst batch of 3D printed prototypes!\nWhat are the rewards?\nHere is a quick look at Brick #7 which will be made if we reach the stretch goal!\nPLAY\n\nShare: Even if you don\u2019t back Versa Bricks, please share the project.

We need your support and in return you can get your very own Versa Bricks\u2122 and the \"warm and fuzzy feeling\" that comes from supporting a great project.

Here's a video from Alex explaining:\nWhat is the ProtoCam?\nThe ProtoCam is a prototyping board for the Raspberry Pi Model A and B, that offers a whole new way to prototype with your Raspberry Pi. It's designed to hold your Raspberry Pi Camera Module - surrounded by prototyping area - allowing you to build fun and interesting new projects.\nFeatures / Design\nThe ProtoCam is unique -  It's a prototyping board for the Raspberry Pi that mounts your Raspberry Pi Camera Module around a large area of prototyping space. \nYou can build around your camera module, and what you build is entirely up to you!\nThe camera module is surrounded by prototyping space\nThe ProtoCam is designed to help you be creative. The large area of prototyping lanes makes it easy to fit LEDs, Infra red, segment displays, sensors, buzzers and much much more - all around your Camera Module!\nExamples\nHere are a few examples/ideas to get you started:\nAdd a flash with as many LEDs as you can fit\nAdd seven-segment displays as a countdown timer for your shots!\nHow about an LED matrix...\n...or even a mini LCD display!\nWhy not use your universal tripod with the ProtoCam?\nFit one to a robot chassis for a robot camera!\nFitting\nThe ProtoCam pushes on to your Raspberry Pi via the 26-pin GPIO, and fits both the Model A and B boards thanks to the supplied extra-tall stacking GPIO header.\nModel A Raspberry Pi\nModel B Raspberry Pi\nThe ProtoCam Fits Generic Cases\nWhilst not an intended design feature, I tried the ProtoCam in my generic acrylic Raspberry Pi case and it fits perfectly, simply by removing the top panel:\nThe ProtoCam fits generic cases really well\nThe board is almost level with the top of the case\nCamera Module & Belt\nAlthough I originally intended for the ProtoCam to make use of the standard Camera Module belt, I wasn't happy at how this slightly raised the board at an angle. \nThe final ProtoCam will come with a shorter and firmer camera belt included, which is more suitable for gentle folding under the PCB.\n(Note: The footage in the video uses the standard camera belt, which you can see only just about fits, hence why I've updated the design, reflected in these images)\nThe Camera Module fits to the board using the supplied small nylon screws\nThe belt folds gently underneath the board\nThe belt and ProtoCam stay securely in place\nGPIO Breakout\nThe ProtoCam breaks out the GPIO pins to an identical labelled connection section, making it easy to interface your design with the Raspberry Pi:\nThe GPIO breakout makes it easy to interface your design to the Pi\nLane Terminal Section\nI've included a section of 4 longer prototyping lanes that are great for creating more power connections:\n4 longer lanes of pads for power connections\n PCB Support\nA nylon screw is provided for use in one of the three support holes. Place this wherever your project needs the most support:\nA nylon fixing is provided to use in one of the three support holes\nColour\nThe board is a stealthy, classy and modern black PCB shade, complimenting the black camera module unit.\nPCB Plating\nPCB plating is high-quality immersion nickel gold - ensuring excellent quality connections and looks great alongside the black PCB.\nAssembly\nThe ProtoCam is easy to assemble - just solder the GPIO header and fit the nylon screws. What you add to the board after that is up to you...\nMade in the UK\nThe ProtoCam's PCB is manufactured in the UK! The PCB is made by a high quality and highly rated UK manufacturer with a lot of experience with Kickstarter projects. The ProtoCam proudly brings manufacturing back to the UK.\nProject Background\nI've always enjoyed making prototypes for my Raspberry Pi, but always found that integrating the Camera Module with electronic components is difficult or messy to achieve. Even with a case that holds your Camera Module, adding anything else can be tricky, especially if you want to keep things neat and tidy.\nI wanted to use electronic components to make interesting new prototypes that included the camera module. I didn't want to buy an off the shelf solution as the options are limited and creativity takes a back seat -  I wanted to make my own designs. This was why I came up with the ProtoCam concept.\nThe ProtoCam gives YOU the freedom to add whatever you want around your camera module. There's space for LEDs, Infrared diodes, segment displays, buzzers, sensors, temperature monitors, LCD modules...and anything else that you can find! The possibilities are truly endless.\nExample Prototype\nI've already had some fun with the early prototypes, and came up with this camera countdown and flash design:\nOur camera countdown and flash prototype!\nPress the button and the countdown begins...\nAnd then the flash with 9 ultra-bright LEDs!\nWhy is the ProtoCam not pre-assembled?\nThere are a few reasons the ProtoCam comes as a kit:\nAssembling electronics kits is a great way to practice soldering, and all part of the electronics learning experience - and learning is a big part of the Raspberry Pi 'scene'.\nThere's one less part in the process to delay you getting your ProtoCam on time.\nYou're likely to be soldering parts to the prototyping space, so this makes sense as...\n...selling as a kit keeps the price down for my backers.\nWhy only for the Model A/B Raspberry Pi?\nThis board is designed to fit the original Model A and Model B boards only. It is not designed to fit the new Model B+ board as the GPIO size and position has changed, however Alex Eames from RasPi.TV has discovered that it does fit and work on the B+ board, but just sits slightly off centre.\nThere are a few reasons we've only designed for the Model A/B:\nManufacturing two different types of board would deteriorate the economies of scale with the PCB manufacturer, increasing the price of the board.\nThere are currently more Model A/B boards in circulation than the new B+. Simple logic, but logic that I hope gives this project more chances of meeting its goal.\nA Model B+ board will be produced if this project is a success.\nHere's the video from Alex Eames/RasPi.TV showing the ProtoCam fitted to a B+ Raspberry Pi:\n(It may be possible to connect the board to the Model B+ as the GPIO on the B+ has an identical 26-pin section, but we are not guaranteeing this, and therefore not advertising it as compatible - just to cover ourselves for anyone disappointed at how it fits a B+, in case they didn't read the full explanation).\nRewards and Delivery\nI want to keep this project simple, as 'simple' means less potential complications for the project, faster delivery for you, and more time for me to make sure you get a great product.\nIt also means I'll have more time to send regular updates to my backers, something I believe makes a great project.\nWith this in mind, I have kept rewards to 4 simple and clear levels, including an 'Early Bird':\nProject Updates: Support the project, stay in touch and receive updates on how the project is going. (\u00a31)\nEarly Bird: Get the ProtoCam board for the reduced price of just \u00a38! Includes the ProtoCam PCB, a GPIO extra tall stacking header, shorter camera belt and nylon fixings. Fits the Raspberry Pi Model A and Model B only (Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Camera Module NOT included!)\nProtoCam: Get a ProtoCam kit and let your creativity run wild! Includes the ProtoCam PCB, a GPIO extra tall stacking header, shorter camera belt and nylon fixings. Fits the Raspberry Pi Model A and Model B only (Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Camera Module NOT included!)  (\u00a39)\nProtoCam x2: Get 2 ProtoCam kits to double your creative potential! Includes 2x ProtoCam PCBs, 2x GPIO extra tall headers, 2x shorter camera belts and the nylon fixings for 2 boards. Fits the Raspberry Pi Model A and Model B only (Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Camera Module NOT included!) (\u00a318)\nWho Am I?\nMy name is Richard Saville, also known as the \"Average Man\" from my Raspberry Pi blog. I live in Essex, UK, with my wife Claire and 3 month old little girl, Evie.\nI've always been interested in technology, gadgets and computers, and a couple of years ago I was introduced to the Raspberry Pi by a colleague and went on to teach myself how to use it from the very first print of \"hello world\".\nAfter becoming a bit of a 'Pi fanatic', I decided to start a blog to share my experiences and help others, as I found tutorials always had something missing, or assumed a certain level of knowledge that the average person wouldn't have - hence the name \"Average Man\" from my blog 'Average Man Vs Raspberry Pi'.\nIf you would like to see my blog and previous Pi projects, you can find it at AverageManVsRaspberryPi.com.\nDay to day, I work as a Business Analyst within the Financial Services industry, so I aim to make use of my skills to help make this project a success. \nThanks For Your Support!\nThank you for looking at my project and helping to make the ProtoCam a success. If you've pledged, well, I really can't thank you enough for having confidence in both me and the product. I'll do everything I can to keep you up to date, keep the project on schedule and deliver you a fantastic prototyping board.\nWhether you've made a pledge or not, why not help spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and any other social networks you use? \nYou can follow me on Twitter where I'm most active: www.Twitter.com/AverageManVsPi . I'm also on Instagram, Pinterest and Google+.\nA Final Thank You...\nA lot of family, friends and colleagues helped me get this project where it is today.

COOLMATERIAL\n\u201cIt easily competes with the best midrange names like the Jawbone Mini Jambox or Soundmatters FoxL DASH 7, which were my favorites until today.\u201d CNET\nThe product won the CNBC TechCrowd competition with 79% of all votes.\nIt all started in 2013 when a designer from San Francisco teamed up with a group of acoustic experts and manufacturing veterans, with the vision of creating a line of portable speakers that would challenge the trend of a booming Bluetooth speaker market that packed lots of features into products, but lacked focus on acoustic performance.\nWe launched NudeAudio last summer with a line of fashion forward portable speakers in three sizes. L for around the house, M to grab and take to the park and S to leave attached to your snowboard jacket or backpack. \nThe launch was received with fantastic feedback from the tech, fashion and design communities. Less than a year after launch, we found ourselves selling products in over 40 countries.\nThe grab-and-go size of M proved to be by far our most popular, so for our next and most ambitious development to date, we decided to explore how far we could take the acoustics in the M size. The result is Super-M.\n4 full-range, high-performance neodymium drivers are tightly packed on both sides of the Super-M, with each pair complemented by a passive radiator, totalling 6 drivers.\nThese are driven by highly efficient amplifiers and a powerful Lithium-ion battery. A state-of-the-art Bluetooth 4.0 chipset ensures the best signal and efficient battery use.\nThis innovative and unconventional set-up means Super-M can pump out incredible, 360\u00ba sound and keep the party going for 8-hours straight, all from a package that fits in your jeans pocket.\nThe final step was sealing the whole package for IPX-5 waterproof rating and sand-proof so the Super-M can be taken anywhere.\n\u201cTom asked me to audition the NudeAudio Move range in S, M & L against the big-brand competition and I was astonished with the rich, natural sound. I blind-tested the M and a competitor three times the price and the M won hands-down.

It's always been our intention that nobody pays more than $99 for a Super-M, wherever they come from, and because of the initial success of our campaign we feel we are able to make this pledge ourselves. \nPlease note that pledges in California will be subject to sales tax, so please add 9% (pledge $108 for $99 pledge) or we will have to eat it ourselves!\nYOU CAN EXTEND AN EXISTING PLEDGE BY SIMPLY ADDING AN AMOUNT AND SENDING US A QUICK NOTE.\nWe introduced black this spring for our entire product range with great reception. What better color than monochromatic black to launch our Super-M with?\nWe are introducing seasonal colors in alignment with the latest fashion trends. This fall, we have Petrol, Pine and Plum. Complex but muted in monochromatic style.\nMany of you asked for it so we added a Kickstarter edition. Black body with iconic Kickstarter-green cord.\nWe've also collaborated and handful of our friends and supporters to deliver some Kickstarter exclusive Special Edition designs, which we will be launching during the campaign. Don't worry about your color or Special Edition choice for now, you will only need to decide when we email you later after you've backed us. So keep watching our updates during the campaign to see the different collaboration options as they are released.\nThe last but certainly not least collaboration we are presenting is with the Kickstarter community itself. We announced to create a community color as a $500K stretch goal, created and decided by the backer community. After many suggestions from everyone, we visualized 9 options and put them out for a vote. Black and Coral was the clear winner.

Our collaborations with other artists and brands are a great opportunity to work with other people's passions too.\nDavid is a London street artist who travels the world, painting murals and creating objects and canvasses. His work can be seen in the streets a few blocks from Kickstarter HQ, as well as in villages in Africa, projects in Kosovo, in Cape Town, Japan and Rotterdam, to name just a few places.\nDavid came to OUR UK office a few weeks ago and painted an amazing mural on the wall. He also agreed to hand paint 20 sets of grilles of Super-M to create a David Shillinglaw Limited Edition especially for Kickstarter backers. These will each be bundled with Limited Edition 'Kingless Kingdom' print.\nLimited Edition David Shillinglaw Hand-Painted Super-M plus 'Kingless Kingdom' Limited Edition Single Colour Screenprint (from run of 100)\nEXISTING BACKERS PLEASE LOOK AT FAQ BELOW\n\nBelow is a short video that we made while David was painting the mural in our offices, I hope you enjoy it and David's unique character.\nPLAY\n\nWe are talking a lot about protecting the technology inside the speaker against its environment. But let\u2019s not forget that we first need the environment to enjoy the speaker in. So let\u2019s try help protecting it, a little bit at the time.\nIntroducing the Cuipo special edition. With each unit sold, we will purchase 5 square meters of rain forest for you to own and keep protected against deforestation. You will receive documentation and the geolocation of your personal 5 square meters. Interesting fact is that there is a population of one monkey per square meter. But no, you will not own 5 monkeys!\nThe main body is kept in a safari green with a contrasting bright red cord to make sure you don't lose it in the jungle.\nWe are partnering on this with Cuipo, a lifestyle brand dedicated to preserving prime rainforest around the globe. Cuipo was created to inspire the preservation of our planet's most vital ecosystem by empowering individuals and institutions to act and become responsible trustees of our planet.\nWe are very excited to announce a new Special Edition Super-M collaboration with UK star-DJ, MistaJam.\nWorking closely with Peter, he designed the duotone black and turquoise Super-M with a slice of colour peeping through the grill, exposing both the MistaJam and Speakerbox logo. The MistaJam presents Speakerbox logo has also been screen printed to the base, and of course finished it off with our trademark NudeAudio cord in turquoise. \nClick the video link below to hear what the man himself has to say about it: \nPLAY\n\nWe're pretty excited, and hope you like this new option as much as we do.\nIn addition to the special editions that we will continue to announce during the campaign, we are delighted to announce an exclusive Limited Edition today, live from Miami, Florida. \nIn celebration of late night parties, sleeping in, weekend getaways, staycations, singing in the shower and breakfast in bed, we are stripping down and teaming up with one of our favorite hotels, The Standard, to bring you a custom speaker evocative of our worlds. \nWith their devotion to design and innovation, The Standard are at the forefront of the industry with five properties in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami. And in true Nude style, The Standard's Limited Edition Super-M is in the buff, colored monotone nude.\nThe Standard X Nude speaker is available to all of our Early Bird backers, (select it when we ask for your color choice), and there are only 100 limited edition pledges available so pledge quickly before they disappear.\nYelle is a recording artist from France, currently touring the USA. They have released 2 albums, Pop Up and Safari Disco Club, with a third album, Compl\u00e8tement Fou, eagerly anticipated. NudeAudio loves their brand of dance floor friendly European disco-pop, and the band have designed their Yelle Special Edition Super-M in a standout bright blue with red silk screened logo on the base to match their album cover.\nPLAY\n\nWe've had a great number of requests for a bike mount for Super-M, so we decided to offer one. Since it hasn\u2019t been designed yet, it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for a collaborative design project. Join us for the ride by pledging $124 which includes the bike mount plus Super-M.\nAbove picture is a functional prototype to proof the idea. Look and feel is to be designed in the coming weeks.\nTHE PROCESS: We just started thinking about the design and what you see on the picture above is only our first prototype. We will facilitate the process gathering your input and translating it into ideas that will be shared with you to feedback on. Please share your initial insights and ideas, as well as feedback on the first prototype here. Based on your thoughts over the next few days, we will be iterating on the design and present new iterations before the end of the campaign.\nTHE DESIGNER: NudeAudio partnered up with Adam Reineck, ex IDEO, bike design superstar who helped design the Faraday bike as well as the Spurcycle Bicycle Bell. Both of which gained a lot of appraise across the bike and design community.\nWe had a lot of comments on ideas for additional colors. Extra thanks to Henri who even sent some designs over. Every color has a minimum order quantity and while we always liked to have more colors, we had to draw a line. \nIf we reach 500K, we'll add one color and have YOU design it. We will invite everyone to tell us their color idea, collect them all and visualize the most popular suggestions. At the end of the campaign, we'll put them out for vote to all backers and produce whatever turns out to be the community favorite.\nEarlier in the campaign we revealed that there was a candidate for an upgraded driver for Super-M. Packed with four, even a small cost increase is multiplied 4 times, and the potential cost increase to include the upgraded drivers was high. But there was a noticeable improvement and we set a stretch goal at $550k, as we need the volume to get a good price from the supplier and justify the margin hit.\nWe're pretty certain that we'll hit the goal, but we're uncomfortable leaving you guys hanging and wondering whether or not the upgrade is coming. Furthermore, while we are doing parallel tuning processes for both driver types, it's important that we lock it down soon so we can ensure we don't have any procurement hiccups.\nSo we've decided today that we are going to guarantee the stretch goal now, which will make you guys happy, whilst reducing supply chain risks, and make communication easier over the coming days.\nTom & Peter demonstrate and challenge the IPX5 Waterproof rating\nPLAY\n\nPeter takes a look at the hardware and explains some of the functionality.\nPLAY\n\nOK, you got this far, so we figured you're really interested (or have time on your hands). Either way, here's a 5 minute video of Tom unboxing and reacting to the latest prototype, demoing the simple functionality, and describing the final steps of development, all in a single (first) take!\nPLAY\n\n  It's a cruel world, and the conventional way to launch new brands and products in this very crowded market takes a lot of effort and money and can be very risky.\nWe know that when people hear our philosophy and our story, when they see and hear our products, it really resonates. Every NudeAudio owner that we've talked to is a big fan. But we don't have the resource to market in the traditional way with advertising and big in-store presence.\nKickstarter, and you, our crowd, seems to be the very best way for us to spread the word. By offering the product at a very fair price, with shipping included worldwide, we hope that you guys will give a a little back by sharing with your friends, giving us great feedback, and joining our mission for better sound.\nEntering mass production for a high-volume consumer product like Super-M is a big investment. We need to raise at least $75,000 to fund the balance of our minimum production run (hence the target), and we've got access to parts for up to 10,000 units immediately if the campaign is big success, before hitting long lead times for additional parts.\nWe'll use you pledges to get into mass production and use the residual funds and the momentum of the campaign to get our brand out into the big, bad world and stand up to our big-bucks competition. Thank you!\nDisclaimer: There is no disclaimer. We decided to give everyone free world wide shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the time of writing, Super-M is very close to pilot production, with virtually all hardware parts developed. The audio tuning process described in the video above is commencing. At this stage of development, the risks associated with the development project have been almost entirely eliminated.\n\nThere are also inherent supply chain risks which need to be managed, but we have secured parts for the first 10,000 units of production so these risks are controlled at least for this level of production. Our contract manufacturing partner is a large, experienced company with members of our respective teams have long-lasting relationships going back 10 years.\n\nQuality is also something that needs close management in any manufacturing process. Our quality team, based in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, follow professional processes to ensure that quality is managed throughout the design, development, supply chain and manufacturing process.\n\nDisruptive Hong Kong, parent company to NudeAudio, will take responsibility for fulfilment of all product pledges, which will be shipped direct to our backers worldwide directly from Hong Kong as soon as production has been completed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Update correction!", "update_content": "Dear NudeAudio friends and backers,\n\nToday we received confirmation that the Yelle and MistaJam collaboration Super-Ms have arrived in our Hong Kong warehouse, and are ready to ship out to our distribution centres world-wide.

We were playing in the parking lot outside their apartment in case of spills. With no stereo (and no one volunteering to drain the battery on their car) we were forced to listen to music on a cell phone. \nWe've all done this before, no big deal. But when you're in a group of 15+ it's a little difficult to hear the song (especially with my singing). That's when I thought: How awesome would it be if we all had the same music and could just play the same song, at the same time? \nThat's what lead me to this idea. With my app (Turn it up!), your cell phone connects to all your friends devices through bluetooth turning their phones into bluetooth speakers (almost in the same since that most cars now have bluetooth connectivity). The app can be downloaded on Android's and Apples, allowing for connectivity with phones, tablets, laptops, cell phones, and anything else that has a speaker and can download the app. The app will run in the background on all devices so that everyone can still use their device while the leader of the Turn it Up! group (the one choosing the songs) utilizes their speakers. \nThe whole idea is to let everyone enjoy music using the hardware they already have without having to buy even more expensive equipment like bluetooth speakers.\nNot only will you be able to share the music on your phone, but because the host phone will be using the other phones as speakers, anything the host phone is playing will be transmitted. This will allow the host phone to use other apps like Pandora, Spotify, or Youtube and still be connected to everyone in the Turn it Up! group.\nIn the future I plan to partner with music recognition software so that all phones being used as speakers will have the option to buy the songs they're listening to.\n**All Rights Reserved - Patent Pending**", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge I see for the app will be synchronizing all devices.
