We were some of the best\u2026until we weren\u2019t.\nNot sure how it went to the side, but one job ended with the needed one dead and the marked one livin\u2019, while the next job dumped us right on the heads of another Skulk workin\u2019 the same and bein\u2019 earlier. I conceive that the coffin nail must have hit when we tore down a quarter of the waterfront in our rapid departure, and it turned out that knowin\u2019 our doin\u2019 was just about the last thing our patron wanted. I blame our glow-crust, fae-brained handler for the lack of detailin\u2019, but the Magus don\u2019t need or hear excuses. We got lax and dropped the lash.\nSo the Magus took it up.\nNow we\u2019re trapped and treadin\u2019 on a world that almost was, where it seems every race has died out or been killed off by humans. And these are Steel Worshippers, the worst kind of humans. They learned to tame this place without magic, using mechanix to brutally bend the elements to their will without regard to cost or consequence. They still burn most things for power and locomotin\u2019 and every inch of their spaces is crawling with electric. These are a fearsome people, and we have been set here to clear our accounts and prove our worth.\nThe Magus has a taste for magical numbers and obfuscated lessons, so we got four trials on our compass. Four significant dealings that are as much punishment as test. Well that\u2019s no thing. We been through the worst tongue-looseners of Bol-Darac and saw our way through. As for putting us to the test? Every test is meant to be passed, otherwise they\u2019d call it a \u2018Fail\u2019.\nWe\u2019ll come through this, heads still on our necks. Skate our demons and dust this gauntlet to regain our place in the Drape. And once we\u2019re back, won\u2019t be no one that glances hard or talks soft about us for a good while. I know this in my bones, and I trust my Foxes. Overcoming is in our scroll.\nBut first I\u2019m to figure out what a \u2018grocery store\u2019 is, and how we can go about robbing one.\nA Fine Mess is what we like to call a \u2018chimeric hack\u2019. It borrows the Fate Point structure from the Coretex Plus Action system and adds it to the storytelling core from Blades in the Dark. There is also a bonkers weapon-creation mechanic of our own design. This alchemy has resulted in a standalone game system designed for boisterous campaigns that can just be an evening of fun, or last 2-4 sessions depending on your group\u2019s interest.\nIt is meant to be played with 3-5 players including the GM. Though it's possible to have more players, it can get a bit unwieldy.\nIf there were a one sentence description of A Fine Mess, it would be: Ocean\u2019s Eleven meets Scott Pilgrim by way of D&D.\nIn the late 1800\u2019s, our world experienced the \u2018Intersection\u2019; a melding of our reality with another where magic was the dominant force, and elves, dwarves, faeries and many things that go \u2018bump\u2019 in the night were commonplace. Over the past 150 years, technology continued to advance alongside magical inquiry, leading to new and unexpected amalgamations. Technomancers, magical artificial intelligences and cyborgs powered by eldritch forces, to name a few.\nIn this new world, influential individuals or organizations often make use of small teams of specialized groups to perform \u2018extralegal\u2019 tasks. In the Drape -the largest city on the planet and a confluence of Ley Lines- these groups are known as Skulks, and their members are Foxes. In A Fine Mess, each player takes the role of a Fox, and all the Foxes at your table are part of a single Skulk that has failed to accurately complete one too many assignments. Your employer has decided a lesson in impulse control is required and has therefore provided a set of opportunities- grueling tasks to prove your worth and earn your way back on to the A-list..\nYour employer also happens to be a Ley Line Magus, and in a fit of pique has tossed your Skulk into an alternate reality to do these jobs.\nOur reality, in fact.\nYou are now a Fox with a magical ward that prevents the locals from noticing if you aren\u2019t Human, and your own considerable skills to see you through.  You will naturally run heists to acquire rare items from our reality, but you will also face Herculean efforts like getting licenses from the DMV, organizing an office party for Karen\u2019s retirement, waiting tables at a Denny\u2019s at 3am on a Saturday, or maybe even attending a wedding.\nSounds painful, right? Well, that was your Patron\u2019s point, really. Except, he didn\u2019t realize that by forcing your Skulk through a dimensional membrane, that membrane was weakened. Substantially.\nThis bleeding of reality manifests in two ways. First, you are able to influence the actual fabric of this world with your will. Sometimes it lets you turn ordinary objects into incredible weapons, and other times it allows you to solve problems by altering the problem itself, or even your own previous actions.\nThe second complication is that difficulties in this reality may evolve into much more dangerous obstacles or opponents simply by coming into contact with you.\nFor example, you may have a mission to find the perfect birthday gift for your boss. While you shop at this \u2018Target\u2019, which you wrongly assumed to be a weapons dealer, you encounter a screaming child throwing a tantrum on the floor. You opt to turn around and leave the aisle the way you came, but find you are blocked by a retiree in a mechanical shopping cart. You decide to ask her to move her cart aside so you can pass, but you fail the dice check, and are suddenly facing a slathering geriatric demon of Ur, and they only get meaner with age. You try to run the other direction, only to discover that the screaming child has become a Wailing Banshee Shogun Warrior with an escort of floating skull Otogi, and there is no option left other than to fight.\nYou turn to the shelf on your right, roll a few dice, burn a Weaving Point, and you now face your opponents with the Crystalline Shield of Cheerios and the Flaming Short Sword of Butterworth. You desperately hope your Skulk got the 911 text and are only a few aisles away, because things are looking grim...\n\nA Fine Mess will be a classic 8.5 x 5.5inch, saddle-stitched, B/W softcover. There will also be an optional companion Zine that will contain detailed descriptions of the Menagerie of Antagonists (MoA), their Lieutenants and Henchmen. The MoA have unique abilities, weaknesses and interests in you and your activities during your campaign, and you will create timers during play that convey their impending interaction with you. The variety of MoA and their 'flavors' necessitated a separate Zine because it exceeded the maximum size the saddle-stitching could handle.\nRest assured, everything you need to play is in the core A Fine Mess zine, including a selection of Antagonists not represented in the MoA companion. The companion Zine is meant to provide depth and  a constantly rotating set of opponents to keep your campaigns unique. Additionally, all of the custom Antagonists and Lieutenants that Handler and Magus level backers help create will be included in the companion Zine.\nLayout/Design is subject to change. This page is 25% gray in order to make it visible against the background\nAdditional elements you will find in the Zine:\n- A selection of major antagonists, their lieutenants and henchmen. All with unique attributes. You will start with an Arch Enemy faction, and, if you choose to play a campaign, your Skulk will acquire or placate more factions during or after each session. The various antagonists and complications will have a countdown to an encounter that stays in the play area, and you will have a limited ability to deal with these timers. This makes every session and campaign of A Fine Mess unique, with multiple narrative Swords of Damocles, hanging ominously or humorously over your Skulk.\n- A breakdown of weapon types and attributes that will allow you to turn any common object into a fearsome dealer of defense from harm, possibly even one that is Named. But you will just as often get a weapon with a weakness, like a Terrifying Sword of Baguette that is remarkably powerful, until it gets wet. And blood, well, is typically wet.\n- Several campaign structures that can be followed, as well as a list of scenarios, missions, obstacles and opponents that you can slot into your campaign, or use as fodder for your own creations.\nIf you are looking for a grit and steel role-playing game that lasts two years and takes your character to the edge of their capabilities and an arbitrary level cap\u2026you may need to keep looking. A Fine Mess is meant to be a raucous, laugh-filled night of absurd storytelling and skin-of-your-teeth successes. The systems are simple enough to be adapted for your own games, should you want to drop your players into an unlikely scenario, but complex enough to make this a fun diversion or a solid entry-level game.\nIf this Kickstarter is successful and there is interest, we may explore a zine that allows you to play in the origin reality from which you were banished in A Fine Mess.\n\nOur Stretch Goals are low-key, but become progressively more difficult to incorporate into the core game. This adds time to the production as well as pages to the physical copy, so we set the goal posts at levels that indicated a significant interest in this Kickstarter.\nTwo additional races and primary job classes will be added, bringing the total to 12.\n Two additional Main Antagonists will be added, bringing the total to 10.\nTen additional attributes in the Weapon Creation system, bringing the total to 30. \nThirteen Unique Weapons will be added to the game that have their own set of reality bending rules.\n\nAs we stated above, this work is based on the Blades In The Dark narrative RPG, which is used with permission. \nBlades in the Dark\u2122 is a trademark of One Seven Design. The Forged in the Dark Logo is \u00a9 One Seven Design, and is used with permission.\n\nThe PDF will be distributed through a download link provided by Dropbox.com\nThe physical copy of the game will go out through standard mail worldwide. Based on mailing address, there are three different shipping & handling costs that will be paid through the campaign manager: United States (+$4), Canada (+$10), or Other International (+$15).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, so there will naturally be growing pains, which is precisely why we chose delivery in December, as we would rather delivery early than miss the deadline.\n\nWe have selected Smartpress for production since they were used by several successful Zines last year and their reputation was solid.\n\nNaturally, we can't possibly foresee all production difficulties, but if things go too far sideways, we will do everything in our power to get you at least the PDF versions before the delivery deadline.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "A Brown\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nTabletop Gaming EnthusiastSee more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Kit", "descp": "PDF Copy of A Fine Mess and all Stretch Goals\nINCLUDES:\nPDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Kit & Kaboodle", "descp": "Receive a PDF of both A Fine Mess and the Antagonist companion Zine\nINCLUDES:\nPDF Copy of A Fine Mess\nPDF Copy of Antagonist companion Zine", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Fox", "descp": "Physical Copy of A Fine Mess, the PDF and all Stretch Goals\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical Copy + PDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Skulk", "descp": "In addition to all Fox level rewards, you will also receive a copy of the Antagonist companion Zine.\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of A Fine Mess\nPhysical Copy of the Antagonist companion Zine\nPDF\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Handler", "descp": "Your name (or a name you provide) will be immortalized as a unique lieutenant in one of the antagonist groups.

Players form a Crew and attempt to survive among clunky technology and quirky denizens of a megalithic Hotel.\nYou enter the Hotel. You were not looking for adventure, just a brief escape from the limbo of daily life. The Hotel seems to have other plans.\nUsing a streamlined rules system featuring regular six sided dice, Dead Halt is a complete setting for cyberpunk-esque roleplaying. It was designed to be extremely quick to learn, easy to play, and narrative driving. It is a perfect game for one shots as well as for developing long term campaigns. Characters are created during play, and Game Masters can run it with little to no preparation.\nDead Halt is a passion project that I began a few years back. I was in search of a Roleplaying game that allowed anyone to sit down and play at the drop of a hat. After a more than successful ZineQuest 1, Dead Halt needs more content! Happy New Year 1999 is our answer, This 5.5 x 8.5 in Zine will contain:\nFIVE New Adventure Arcs\nEach one is a four page story arc, just like those in the Dead Halt User's Guide. These get a session off the ground instantly by inciting Job, a few key items, characters, and a simple premise or quest to launch players into the Hotel without any delay.\nEach Adventure Arc in Happy New Year 1999 will cover one quarter of the year leading up to Y2K, where Crews will encounter everything from email viruses to cryogenically frozen undead.\n HAPPY99 - A mysterious self replicating email virus containing nothing but a small fireworks simulation accidentally brings the sentience protocols from standard Consoles to unconscious robots, the Nearly-Autonomous Automatons. \n Return of Keldon - Funding for cryogenics in the Hotel finally takes off when deep below the surface an ancient clan of armored warriors is discovered frozen into the bedrock. With these knights returned from the dead, what else may resurface? \n It\u2019s FORTRA\u2019s World - As fear of the Millennium Bug sweeps through the Hotel, the final date for Consoles is on the horizon. Can the Crew find the Hotel's long lost central cortex FORTRA in time, and what must they do to prevent it's corruption? \n Stack Overflow - On the dawn of Year 2000 the Hotel tries to drag itself out of the inevitable catastrophe that has befallen it. Where does the Crew stand? \n Advent of Aphelion - A new era is on the horizon, is there any place for the Hotel? \nNew Character Origins\nThese Origin options will give you new abilities and backgrounds for when your first character inevitably becomes a Clunkhead and you have to create another. The first two are Undead and Nearly-Autonomous Automatons (NOT-O's)!

New Item lists have also been posted in the Downloads section!\nDead Halt includes everything from:\nHorror elements with breaks of light hearted humor.\nDiscussions of the change of ones personal identity through body modification.\nExistential dread under the rule of an unhinged super computer.\nA robot-slaying bird-headed business man and his sarcastic cat.\nClunkPunk is our word for it: CyberPunk motifs jammed into the aesthetic and unreliability of 1980's technology. \nSetting aside, the Dead Halt game system was created specifically to;\nBegin play within an hour of picking up the Zine.\nHave no session zero, jump right in and create characters in game.\nBring in players brand new to Roleplaying Games.\nThis 44 page Zine is a quick read and packed full of content bound by simple to learn rules that allow for incredible stories to emerge without any difficulty. No clunky game mechanics or exhausting text. This in no way means Dead Halt is simple, just efficient.\nIf you enjoy games like Paranoia, Tales from the Loop, Mutant Year Zero, Gamma World, ZORK, or quirky settings with a bit of terror, I encourage you to try out Dead Halt; I think you just might like it. \nMost rewards are a combination of the new Happy New Year 1999 module and the reprint of the Dead Halt User's Guide (The base game for Dead Halt). So onto the Floppy Disks. The Floppy Disks have one adventure on each disk. If you only get one disk for \"FORTRA Forgotten\" this is the new adventure arc. If you get both Floppy Disks you will receive both the original \"Fate of FORTRA\" adventure from our first Kickstarter and the new adventure\"FORTRA Forgotten\".\nYou found out the fate of the Hotel's defunct super computer; FortRA, and now continue the journey with FORTRA Forgotten.\nYeah, its a 3.5 in Floppy disk, probably owned by someone else but I promise I will delete their old MS Paint scribbles or Taxes and such.\nOn the disk will be a PDF Adventure for DEAD HALT. Fate of FORTRA ended up being 18 pages long, has illustrations, game changing rules, and multiple outcomes. If you go through the trouble of buying this outdated media, all I can do is reward you.\nThese Adventures will only ever be released on Floppy Disks, and I will not publish it anywhere else. There will be no link, no download, no print out, just a Floppy Disk. The only way to get this adventure from me will be on this terribly outdated disk.\nWhy? Because at this point I find it incredibly wonderful that people thought this was as delightful as I do. Get a floppy disk, wonder whats on it, break out your old Mac G3 and check it out.\nAny extra funding we gain above our goal will go straight into more pages, art, oddities, and content for the book, as can be seen in our Stretch Goals below!

Instead, it creates unique portraits from professionally hand-illustrated weapons, armor, gear, clothing, and facial features. All of those elements can be selected and combined across nearly all of the artwork, including artwork from the stretch goals.\nAs a result, you can make millions of portraits without seeing the same one twice.\nThe simple interface is fun and easy to use. Select your character\u2019s traits (age, gender, race, class, and beauty), and then multiple portraits appear. Pick one you like as a starting point, and fine-tune it until it matches your vision of your character.\n You can make a beautiful portrait on a phone or tablet, then export the image for a range of uses. If you back this Kickstarter at the Publisher level, you can even publish the portraits you create in your own books and games.\nMark a portrait as a favorite, and come back later to update it with new outfits or gear. Keep multiple versions to show how your character looks in town, on adventure, or in disguise. You can make as many portraits as you want; there is no additional cost for each one.\nA rogue in standard gear; in disguise as an alchemist; in prison after the plan goes awry\nYou can even export portraits directly into World Anvil \u2014 one of the world\u2019s best campaign management tools \u2014 to add more personality to your character or your campaign.\nPortrait Workshop isn\u2019t just a cool idea; we\u2019ve actually built it.

Everything in this \"What Can You Draw?\" section is included in the Basic reward.\nRaces & Ethnicities\nWith the Basic reward, you'll be able to make portraits of dwarves, elves, half-elves, gnomes, halflings, humans, orcs, and half-orcs.\nWith the Advanced reward, you'll be able to make dozens of additional races. See the table at the bottom of this page for one list, but you can also combine elements to make even more. \nThere is only one human race, but it contains a wonderful diversity of ethnicities and cultures. Portrait Workshop includes Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, English, Germanic, Greek, Latino, Malinke, Mongol, Persian, Roman, and Viking elements. \nYou can change the coloring on nearly everything in Portrait Studio, including people. For example, your elves can be fair, blue-skinned, dark-skinned, or any other color.\nClasses\nPortrait Workshop covers the classic classes (barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlock, and wizard) as well as a range of NPCs (commoner, royalty, merchant, and more). You can also create characters that go beyond the typical archetypes...

Advanced backers will get a whole lot more gear, now that every stretch goal is unlocked.\nSome of the gear included in the Basic reward\nClothing\nYou can dress your characters in a wardrobe of over three dozen garments suitable for a wide range of adventurers and NPCs. You can layer up to five items of clothing to create a variety of different looks.\nEach garment can be colored in many ways. By default, Portrait Workshop applies one of our professionally designed, color-coordinated palettes. You can change palettes with a single click, or with the Masterwork Tools (included in the Advanced reward), you can select every color individually.\nBodies\nPeople come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Portrait Workshop covers a range, from fantasy archetypes to more \u201ceveryday\u201d body shapes.\nAges\nNot all adventurers are in their twenties. You can use Portrait Workshop to show older characters as well.\nHair\nAll backers get over three dozen hairstyles, as well as facial hair and stubble. Advanced backers will get even more, now that the Hairstyles stretch goal is unlocked.\nWe want to give the gaming community the best tool ever for creating character portraits.\nWe have already built alpha versions of the iOS and Android apps, have worked out the technical, artistic, and product design details, and have commissioned enough artwork to validate the approach. Now it\u2019s up to you to help make it a reality by backing this Kickstarter so that we can complete the remaining artwork.\nPlus, this project funds talented artists doing a whole lot of great work \u2014 a cause we can all get behind!\nOur backers have unlocked every single stretch goal below; the Advanced reward now contains every one of these. Thanks for helping us make Portrait Workshop so much bigger!\nThe stretch goals are not simple, stand-alone \u201cpaper dolls\u201d. You can combine artwork between them and the basic art in nearly unlimited ways. \nThese portraits intermix pieces from some of the unlocked stretch goals\nWhile Portrait Workshop is not part of, or specific to, a single game system, below is an idea of how you could use it to draw illustrations for characters of most of the playable races from D&D. You can also combine different elements to invent your own races.\nOur target timeline is:\nFeb 2020 - Kickstarter completes\nMay 2020 - All backers receive the Beta version of Portrait Workshop with Basic features and artwork\nJuly 2020 - Advanced backers receive the beta version of the Masterwork Tools, Frame Shop, and at least two Stretch Goals if funded (the remainder will be released as completed, likely over several months)\nAugust 2020 - All backers receive the final version of Portrait Workshop.\nAfter our backers have the final app, we\u2019ll release Portrait Workshop to the public as a free app with Basic controls and limited artwork. The free app will include a fraction of the outfits, hairstyles, and facial features that our Basic backers receive, with only humans and none of the Stretch Goal content. Additional artwork and features will be available via in-app purchase.\nBy backing this Kickstarter, you are getting significant savings from the cost of the same features and artwork when the app goes public. \nWe will accept pre-orders for the app at some point after the Kickstarter ends. Those will have higher pricing than the special backer pricing here, and will not include the exclusive Curiosities of Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nArtwork: We have completed the artistic design including formal art style guide, templates, and references. We\u2019ve assembled a team of talented artists who have contributed to what you see on this page.

But that was before Beazt slew the Children, and Abominous, his creator, broke the world. Scattered, the remaining Children struggled for survival, trying to tame a paradise that had turned against them.\nFor millennia they have been separated from one another by Sorogoros, the worldwyrm, which wraps it's huge serpentine coils around each continent on the planet. Controlling the sea and sky, the Sorogoros ensures that no fish, no fowl, no ship can cross from one \"coil\" to another. And so have the Children been trapped on their continental islands, the knowledge of their brethren fading with each passing day, their desire to travel the open sea long all but lost.\nBut things are changing.\nThe Children are thriving. They are restless. And they once again hear the calls of their ancestors from across the churning seas. Tales abound that the Sorogoros has by tamed. Ships are appearing in ports outside of the safe harbors and the inland seas. Their destination - new lands. Their guarantee - Adventure.\nAre you brave enough to board one today? Are you brave enough to discover what lies beyond the horizon? Are you brave enough to explore Denoa? \nBehold The Doorway To Adventure\nDenoa is a world built for storytelling. It contains a rich mythology and history that inform adventures without overwhelming them with detail. An official campaign story plays out in real time, with key events hosted at kitchen tables and game stores around the world. However, DMs and players can take things at their own pace, and choose to play the meta story, or use it's ideas to tell their own stories.\nBehold a world that feels like home. Whose paths and plains, forests and fields, cities and landscapes feel familiar. Like something you know, and understand, because you've been there before. \nBehold a world that feels fresh and new. Where familiar ideas and common tropes are upgraded, updated, and never stale. Where the familiar is just different enough to excite your senses, and invite you to explore it.\nBehold a world that is strange, and magical, and unlike any world you have seen before. A world where the unfamiliar and uncomfortable clash with the fantasy that you know. Where any - and every - fantasy idea has a place to grow. Where continents, cultures, monsters, and magic have evolved separately from each other. Where each location is amazing, wondrous, and completely unique.\nBehold a world made up of worlds, where all of your favorite settings come together - and clash. Imagine a green world, where humans, elves, and dwarves band together to fight a common foe. Imagine a savage world, where tan, magic-hating barbarians tread the land on sandalled feet. Imagine a frozen world, where snowbound creatures draw magic by singing to the northern lights. Imagine a fairy world where fey folk and talking animals are commonplace. Imagine a burning world, where hell has literally come to earth, and demons, devils, and insect races dominate the harsh landscape.\nBehold Denoa. The world where these worlds - and others - are on the edge of discovering each other.\nDenoa and it's official campaign will bring modern technology to bear in it's story telling. Through the use of in-store-only events, online surveys, and a dedicated app, we hope to gather your experiences and use them to shape our story. What you share with us could shape our official campaign, our next official event, or even a future product! \nUnofficially you can shape the world in any way you choose. We've even built it so that you can add your own world TO Denoa. So if you like worldbuilding, there's no need to abandon your work to play Denoa. Use one of the provided options to put Denoa into YOUR world, or YOUR world into Denoa, making the story you tell uniquely yours.\nDenoa is in every way a collaborative effort. Designed by Danny O'Neill, it will be created by some of the best talent and game companies in the industry (for a full list, see the bottom of this Kickstarter). And that design is guided by YOU and the actions you take during Organized Play events.\nOne of the key collaborators on the project is DGNFOG who will help us build all the maps for Denoa. Another is the community we hope to build around World Anvil and our Organize Play efforts. If you are a retailer, a designer, a writer, or interested in contributing to Denoa in ANY WAY, reach out to us through our social media. We might not have room for your particular talent or idea, but we'd love to include you any way we can. \n There are three major components to this project - the Book, the Denoa App, and the Organized Play. We have set a low goal in order to help with internet marketing algorithms. For the book to reach it's full potential, this Kickstarter will have to earn approximately $15,000. \nThe Denoa app has 3 Tiers. Tier 1, the Basic App is already funded. Tier 2, the Advanced App is our true goal. We will need this Kickstarter to fund between $25,000 and $30,000 for this app to be fully funded. \n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDenoa is a broken, magical world. In the time before time, it's continents were separated by a titanic sea serpent know as the Sorogoros. As a result, the ecology of each land evolved without the others. Each now sports it's own peoples, it's own cultures, it's own magic styles, it's own monsters. Your job is to uncover them all. But for now, things are secret, and information is purposefully made scarce.\nTo discover as much as you can about Denoa, head to World Anvil.\nColarwyn\nOur story starts in Colarwyn, a region which acts as a hub for this project and future ones. Colarwyn is one of 5 regions in the continent known as Ostarwyn. Almost all of the countries in this region border an inland sea, known as Merala.\n\nThe Free City of Arbor\nWe are extremely proud to be partnering with some of the most talented companies, writers, and artists in the business. \nAuthors\nEd Greenwood is a Canadian worldbuilder, writer, game designer,  and librarian who creates imaginary worlds; his best known one is the  Forgotten Realms\u00ae fantasy setting, which he began creating when he was  six years old, and is still expanding  and enriching more than fifty years later.

The primary artwork for the book is already completed, and writing has begun. We're in a good place with how the capsules and OP work, and we'll be playtesting within a few weeks.\n\nThe largest challenge we have is making sure Denoa fulfills it's potential by fulling funding the app. The basic version will be enough to stay connected and play Denoa events, but the full version will allow for players to integrate their characters into the storyline with ease. That will allow a lot more players into the collective story we are telling. So although Denoa will survive with even the Basic app, the Full App is what we are truly shooting for. The goal for this is high - we need this Kickstarter to hit $40K to be able to get to this plateau. And that's why we consider this our largest challenge.\n\nThe next challenge we have is to get enough stores into our network hosting Denoa events. If your local game store hosts role-playing games, and if you think they are interested, please tell them about us!

I almost didn't run this crowdfunding on this platform because of the anti-union stance of Kickstarter leadership. I'm the son of a unionized worker and I like things like 40 hour work weeks, vacation time, paid sick time, week-ends, lunch, and safe working conditions. I'm also a technology professional and it's well past time for the workers in our industry to advocate for themselves in organized ways. When many companies call themselves tech companies that happen to \"x\", its workers are part of that change in visualization. We too must change our view of technology professions. As we become ubiquitous, obligatory, and integral to corporate success, we will be increasingly considered interchangeable and expendable (it's already happening if you haven't noticed). Unions are there to protect the worker and protections we will soon need. I stand in solidarity with KSRU. I call on Kickstarter\u2019s senior leadership to recognize the union now, and I hope you\u2019ll join me. How you can help.\n#RecognizeKSRU\n Thanks for listening. Back to the regularly scheduled crowdfunding plea.\nThe House of the Red Doors\n\"Generations ago the House of the Red Doors visited your village. Now, so many years hence, could it be passing this way again? As the story goes its mistress, Jassafae, still untouched by time\u2019s ravages, is an instrument of Ullhume, a powerful being of unknown origin. Through her fates are altered and wishes granted, but only to those brave enough to cross her threshold. You toil ceaselessly and suffer much and to what end? Unrequited dreams and the hope of an early grave? You resolve to enter and change your destiny.\"\nThe House of the Red Doors is a Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG funnel that can be used for tournament play or it can level up a peasant for campaign play. It is one player adventure that requires a Judge. \nIn most Table Top RPG adventures there is a group dynamic. This adventure, is more intimate, like visiting a psychic or a gypsy. In fact, the beginning of Ultima IV was an inspiration for this adventure. The House of the Red Doors also presents the interesting dynamic of a player solving puzzles alone. \nThis version of the adventure will come with instructions to run as a tournament and for character development. It is short in duration (about 20 mins) and can be replayed several times if necessary (it's usually necessary).  \nCan you survive The House of the Red Doors?\nThis funnel has gone through extensive alpha and beta testing as both a tournament and for character creation. A 3-day tournament was ran at GenCon this year. Feedback has been very positive. I think the best quote over the testing was, \"It's got that Appendix N, trippy vibe.\"\nGen Con 2019 House of the Red Doors Tournament\nThe adventure is also edited and layout is nearly finished. 95% of the art has been completed. I expect to be able to send codes for the PDF without stretch goals soon after this Kickstarter concludes - a perfect X-mas adventure. It's is as done as you'll ever see in a Kickstarter.\nWhat You'll Get:\nA table top RPG adventure funnel for one 0-Level peasant to try their luck\nProduct dimensions: 8.5\" x 11\"\nPages: ~30\nColors: Color cover, B/W inside\nArt: YES! by  Stefan Poag \nHeavy paper for print backers: 100# cover, 80# interior\nLimited edition, hand numbered for print backers\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nSo, it's time to produce this adventure for the masses. Print on Demand has been a godsend for the hobby (and me), but I feel it's time to start printing copies and exploring other distribution channels (like the Friendly Local Gaming Store, online stores, etc). That's where you come in.\nThis kickstarter will pay for the last few art commissions and print up a limited number of high quality books. If you backed Lesser Key to the Celestial Legion, you have good idea of what that quality means. I'll be hand numbering copies and once they are gone they are gone. The House of the Red Doors will be released in association with Donn Stroud and Psychoda Press. Stefan Poag has supplied the art and is working on the cover as I finish this. Doug Kovacs is on standby for a drop table to be used for creating the PC's backstory. If we get close to the TROIKA! version of The House of the Red Doors, I hope to set-up itch.io bundle with the TROIKA! Numinous Edition fantasy RPG rulebook.\nStretch Goals\n ACHIEVED! $2,500 Tournament Extras: We'll produce a full set of illustrated handouts to facilitate running the adventure at gaming convention.\n ACHIEVED! $3,500 Drop Table: A spiffy drop table (illustrated by Doug Kovacs) for determining why peasants enter the House of the Red Doors.\n ACHIEVED! $4,000 TROKIA! Edition: We'll produce a PDF only version of the adventure for the TROKIA! RPG, the other world's favorite fantasy RPG.\n ACHIEVED!  $5,500 Mini Booklet Player's Handout:  A one page, fold & cut, mini booklet handout. Featuring mini maps and vistas not yet illustrated in the adventure. \nThanks for your consideration. \nWhere doth yon door lead?\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games. Mechanically, DCC is based on the world\u2019s most popular RPG, but the rules have been reforged\u2014streamlined in some places, expanded in others, and injected with a wild and exciting imagination throughout.  The fantastical imagery and fast playstyle are designed to invoke the classic fantasy and science-fiction adventures tales of old. You\u2019ll find the influences of Leiber, Moorcock, Howard, Vance, Brackett, and more throughout Dungeon Crawl Classics.\nFind out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\nAbout the Author\nI'm a OSR gaming hobbyist living in Michigan who loves to write stuff. You can see some of my other work (Angels, Daemons & Beings Between Volume 2: Elfland Edition, Fae Hard) on DrivethruRPG and Goodman Games. Free stuff in Sanctum Secorum and Gongfarmer's Almanac. Get a marvelous heavy paper copy of The Lesser Key to the Celestial Legion from Psychoda Press or Goodman Games. You can tweet at me @lectrotext.\nAbout the Artists\nStefan Poag: Lives and works in Michigan with his significant other (Annie) and two dogs.  His illustration work has appeared in the Dungeon Crawl Classics core book and many, many DCC RPG modules from Goodman Games. He can be found at  https://stefanpoag.com and tweets @sbpoag.\nDoug Kovacs: If there\u2019s one artist who has helped define \u201cthe DCC experience\u201d, it\u2019s Doug. His cover art for the Dungeon Crawl Classics core book and many adventure modules have helped set a tone of adventure, mystery, and the fantastic that reaches throughout the line. And his black-and-white art inside the DCC core book and its many adventures have defined the game\u2019s look\u2014not to mention his awesome maps.

It is, in short, a setting book inspired by the works of legendary Golden Age comic book artist Fletcher Hanks, using the popular Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) rules system. It\u2019s like a Flash Gordon fever dream.\nIn 2011 we (Leighton Connor and Josh Burnett) were inspired by a short Fletcher Hanks story in which the hero Space Smith encountered the terrifying Leopard Women of Venus. We asked ourselves questions like, \u201cWhy are there Leopard Women on Venus?\u201d and \u201cWho else lives on Venus?\" From that we developed our setting, a grotesque alien world seething with malice and filled with exotic locales, bizarre cultures, and murderous monsters. We wrote the original version of Leopard Women of Venus for Hex Games, using the QAGS system.  \nThe Fletcher Hanks page that inspired it all!\nYears later, we realized that our feverish nightmare Venus would be a perfect match for Dungeon Crawl Classics. Like DCC, Leopard Women of Venus is heavily inspired by pulp fiction and foundational fantasy authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs; committed to instilling a mixture of awe, wonder, and horror; and extremely dangerous for Player Characters.\nWe got to work and converted the setting to DCC, adding in new character classes, spells, patrons, and monsters. We also saw plenty of opportunities to tweak and improve--we have expanded and updated everything, including the history of Venus and the relationships among the factions. We have also added a new organization, the Humanoid Coalition, that makes it easier to assemble a PC party.\nEverything people loved from the original version is still here, polished and improved and adapted to our favorite fantasy role-playing adventure game. But now you\u2019ll also find:\nThe Leopard Woman class and their powerful augments\nClear guidelines for how DCC character classes function on Venus\nTwo patrons, Stardust the Super-Wizard and Fantomah, complete with spells\nA list of 100 Venusian occupations useful for creating 0-level characters\nA 0-level funnel, \u201cSaucerful of Secrets\u201d\nA 1st-level adventure, \u201cThe Mines of the Moglugs\u201d\nFantastical sci-fi gear and equipment\nRandom tables to generate countless springboards for adventure\nThe Magnificent Moglug Maker\nAnd much more!\nThe exciting new material in Leopard Women of Venus is usable whether you\u2019re running a game in the savage jungles of Venus or plugging it into your own campaigns!\nWant to see more? We put together a free preview zine that will give you a big juicy taste of LWoV. CHECK IT OUT HERE!\nFormat\nThe book will be released on DrivethruRPG digitally and via print-on-demand.  It will be a 7 x 10\" graphic novel-sized softcover, coming in around 175 pages.\nPlease note that we are not shipping the POD books.  The costs associated with shipping are determined by DriveThruRPG.\nThe Setting\nFrom a distance, Venus is a beautiful blue orb suspended in the inky void. But up close, Venus is a tropical hell-planet, its ecosystem mutated in grotesque and deadly fashion by the mysterious Compound-N. From the Quivering Blood Gnats to the Hideous Spider Priests, from the acid-dripping Venusian Fly-Traps to the carnivorous mushrooms, every living thing is bent on destroying human life.\nDespite the odds, four human factions continue to survive on Venus. In addition to fending off the endlessly lethal flora and fauna, they must also keep watch for invaders from other worlds--Earth, Mars, and Bloodu--and the constant threat of betrayal by the other factions. \nEven the Leopard Women of Venus, with their flying saurians and comet-fire helmets, are hard pressed to defend against these threats. Human civilization exists on Venus now--but for how much longer? That\u2019s for you and your gaming group to decide.\nThe Factions\nHuman civilization of Venus has splintered into four different factions. All are troubled, but the PCs have the chance to make things better.\n Otram: The largest settlement on Venus, Otram is a fortress city ruled by a ruthless prophet-king. The people of Otram only value strength, glory, and powerful weapons.\n The Caverns: Ruled by the unfeeling Science Robots, the people of the caverns have access to amazing technology but little personal freedom. They are defended by the planet\u2019s mightiest warriors, the Leopard Women of Venus.\n Palna: Superstitious scientists and apocalyptic theologians, the people of the mountain-city of Palna pray for the legendary super-wizard Stardust to rain his judgement down upon Venus.\n Avrok: The people of Avrok live in loose tribes deep in the hellish jungles. They are hedonistic pseudo-shamans in a distressing relationship with Venus\u2019s giant snakes.\n The Humanoid Coalition: Founded by gonzo cartoon-journalist and lunatic prophet Forecastle J. MacBeth, the Humanoid Coalition is a cross-factional organization dedicated to preserving humanity on Venus and countering the coming apocalypse foreseen in MacBeth\u2019s dreams.\nWho Was Fletcher Hanks?\nFletcher Hanks produced bizarre stories in the earliest days of American comics. His work is boldly drawn, frequently ugly, and strangely compelling. Hanks only worked in comics from 1939 to 1941, but during this short time he created Stardust the Super Wizard, a terrifying superman from the stars; Space Smith, an outer space adventurer; Big Red, a lumberjack; Fantomah, the first super-powered comic book heroine; and more.\nFletcher Hanks died in obscurity, but he left behind some fascinating comic books. The original comics--issues of Fantastic, Fight, Jungle, and Planet--are extremely rare and require quite a bit of time and money to track down. Fortunately, stories by Hanks are available on the Internet, and in high-quality reprint collections such as Turn Loose Our Death Rays and Kill Them All!: The Complete Works of Fletcher Hanks, edited by Paul Karasik and published by Fantagraphics.\n\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games.

We have been writing games for decades and are two of the co-creators of the ENnie Award-winning game Hobomancer. Josh wrote the ENnie Award-winning Hobomancer Companion and recently wrote and illustrated the OSR zines Crepuscular and Draugr & Draculas. Leighton is also the co-creator of the web comic The Electric Team and the author of the Ross Fulton, Occult Detective series of stories.\nWe have both done illustration work for a variety of projects, including the original Leopard Women of Venus, and we will be contributing artwork to the book. We\u2019ve got experience and we\u2019ll do some good stuff. But we don\u2019t want this book to just be good, we want it to be PHENOMENAL. That\u2019s why the money we raise will go toward hiring additional artists. And the artists we\u2019ve lined up . . . seriously, these artists are great. The book will be lavishly illustrated, with luscious, mind-blowing drawings by some of the finest illustrators working today: \nErol Otus!\nMatt Kish!\nBradley K. McDevitt!\nEvlyn Moreau!\nDiogo Nogueira!\nJuan Navarro!\nJames V. West!\nThose are just the beginning.

West\nThe toxic jungle by Evlyn Moreau\nThe streets of Otram by Juan Navarro\nA map of Venus, by Joshua LH Burnett\nWe are committed to producing a beautiful, high-quality book that is free from any distracting errors. Your Kickstarter dollars will also allow us to hire experienced editors to help us polish the text and deliver the best book we can.

The illustrations are either drawn or underway. The editors are lined up. We are ready to do this thing! Josh recently ran a successful Kickstarter for his Draugr & Draculas zine, and from that experience he developed skills we will use to run this project efficiently.\n\nOne way that we are limiting the risks of this campaign is by using DriveThruRPG for fulfillment. Since your book will be printed by DriveThru when you order it, and shipped through DriveThru, we will not have to fulfill the orders ourselves, which will cut out a whole range of potential problems and make things easier for our international backers. \n\nWhile we are sure there will be challenges along the way, we believe we are ready to handle them and get you your book in a timely manner.

This campaign aims however to set a world record and produce the Worlds Largest Digital, Modular, Dungeon Tile series with 144 beautiful unique sets, each with a massive 144 tile designs.  That was at least, until it funded, and today, I doubled the ambition with an attempt at 288 individual tile sets. Shown below are 240 of them...\nWant a closer look? Kickstarter compresses images but you can download a larger viewing selection from here: SOLOMAN TEMPLE SQUARES SET SELECTION\n This graphic 'THE LESSER KEY OF SOLOMAN' will later feature checkable boxes and be available as a digital poster to allow backers to mark off which sets they have - and which sets they might still want to buy later on. \nA Story in the Bible relates that \"Solomon's Temple\" was a fabled architectural marvel built by King Solomon in ancient times to house the Ark of the Covenant. But his legendary deed became enmeshed in a variety of occult grimoires (magical books) and babylonian demonology with intriguing names as such as the 'Lesser Key of Solomon' and the famous 'Legemeton'. It is books like these that popularized ceremonial magic widely and the practices associated with it can also be seen in RPG which has borrowed a great deal of lore from occult sources - including the concept of sorcery, magic seals, signs, protective rings, magic squares, planes, demonic hierarchies, talismans against evil, invocations, curses, circles to summon or enclose demons and so on.  Some tellings of this legend claim Solomons building method enlisted the aid of 72 Demons by means of a magical ring emblazoned with a golden pentagram entrusted to him by the archangel Michael to complete the task of building the Temple.  Whether true or not - I have been fascinated with such stories since I was a boy and the idea of an architect calling down/up Demons/Angels to help in the construction of a Temple is a very cool mythology. In homage I created 72 tile sets for modern day RPG architects, loosely one for each of Solomons supposed demons if you like - and I would like to create 72 more for a grand total of 144. The name of the tile set is also a play on words via 'Solo-man' i.e. someone. an architect, that builds alone. The name is also influenced by the numerological magic square formulae of the occult that I found similar in nature to the different layouts of the tile designs in an 8x8 grid. Finally, I wanted to capture the imagination with a tile set so large to build our 'dungeons/temples' with - it might seem I too had enlisted the help of demons :) And so we have, Soloman Temple Squares. Pledge $45 or more within the first 72 hours and you'll get a free 18 Room Sorcerers Pack (viewable down below) that further pays tribute to these occult/magical connections.\nWith a project name based on this legendary architect - Let's quickly look at some magic numbers to understand how I believe this would be the largest modular dungeon tile set in the world.\n[EDIT: - and now it is twice the size]\n 144 Tile Sets each with 144 Tile-Designs for a total of 20736 Modular Tiles. \nEvery tile is 8x8 with a total of 64 squares. \n Every set of one-hundred and forty-four 8x8 tiles has the equivalent of 9216 individual squares. \n If every individual square is 5x5 ft, every tile represents 40x40 square ft and a total of 1,600 square feet per tile. \n 1,600 sq ft per tile x 144 tiles equates to 230,400 square feet PER SET.  \n 230,400 sq ft x 144 gives Soloman Temple Squares a mind-staggering total area of 33,177,600 SQUARE FEET - (to put this into perspective, the area measures approximately 3 square kilometers, 33 football fields, or the landmass of Coral Sea island.)\n [EDIT: - double these figures]\nBACKERS Can Choose from THREE Tileset Dimensions: - but by DEFAULT your pledge will give you access to all THREE!\n (1) 4FG - sized at 900x900px (50 pixels per square) in 72 DPI for Fantasy Grounds. When the upcoming FGU sizes are known, I will re-supply tiles of that size to backers who use the software. As tiled maps cannot be easily built within the current FG format, it is likely users will assemble maps using an external program such as GIMP or Photoshop, wherein they can resize the map to < 2000x2000px or less with  72DPI jpeg (though I recommend 1350x900) and import the map to FG that way.\n(2) 4Roll20 - sized at 1120x1120px (140 pixels per square) sets in 72 DPI for Roll20 \n(3) 4print - sized at 2400x2400 (8x8\" or 300 pixels per square) in 300 DPI (optimal for printing)\nHERE ARE THE RANGE OF DIFFERENT TILE DESIGNS THAT WILL COME WITH EACH SET:\nHere are some examples of the artwork used in the tiles:  with a mix of Fantasy, Sci-fi, Textured and Non-Textured Tile Sets.\nATLANTIS\nGROTTO\nPUPPY\nFORGE\nCIPHER\nLIGHT BLUE AND WHITE\nFEN\nDUNGEON\nCORPSE\nGLOBE\nISLAND\nJOKER\nPEAT\nSALVAGE\nBROWN and WHITE HATCH\n\nBelow are some samples from additional sets: properly pre-sized and formatted to suit such Virtual Table Top programs as Fantasy Grounds and Roll 20.  You can see how it would be easy to transition from a Temple for instance, to an Ocean Or to alternate different themed-rooms within a single or multiple dungeons - i.e Undermountain and keep your variety of terrain infinitely interesting.\nI have added a HUGE variety of commonly required colour themes including stone, bone, blood, dirt, sand, water, lava, various water depths, and an insane amount more.\n Want a closer look?

This first Stretch Goal will give you 25 Shadow-Based PNG tokens to overlay and alter the appearance, depth and height of your tilesets!\nPLEDGE $45 AUD or more within the First 72 Hours of Campaign Launch to get a Bonus 18-Room Sorcerers Pack! And if we make it to 144 Backers, I'll unlock another special reward.\nMissed out on the time frame? Add this reward to your pledge by adding $18 AUD.\n Just Message me with the Twelve Sets you want and your username and I will make sure you get them when rewards go out.\nWhy back Me? If you haven't backed me before here are some reasons why you might consider backing me and what I do:\n LOW/NO RISK: If funded this will be my 16th successful Kickstarter. I am extremely hard-working and specialize in completing huge digital map/tile projects and have previously delivered all successful projects to promise with no issues and 100% backer satisfaction - you can check the Risks section for a breakdown of previous campaigns.\n VERSATILITY: With a possible 288 unique designs Soloman Temple Squares explodes your options in an unprecedented manner giving you a vast range of tools to suit almost any dungeon tile construction job.\n INTERCHANGEABLE: Every set uses 8x8\" tiles sized for a particular format that will neatly line up with one another for epic-sized dungeons with different areas.\n RANGE: The range includes classic designs, demonic, elemental, undersea, underdark, dimensional, and over 280 different colour combinations to give you every chance of finding the right set for the right job.\n COMPLETION: I have already completed and/or drafted half of the core designs.\n SAVINGS: Soloman Temple Square sets will retail at $5 USD per set. By backing my Kickstarter you pledge in AUD and gain generous saving with a base cost of $3 AUD per set, with costs greatly lowered further for buying in bulk. You also don't have to wait for tiles to be processed and made available from my website to the general public which can take months or even longer.\n UNIQUENESS: It's true there are a lot of modular dungeon tile sets - but no-one has ever attempted one on this gigantic ambitious scale - and I am just the man to do it.\n DILIGENCE: This is not my first campaign - nor my first campaign making a huge amount of tiles - with at least 3 of those behind me, I know what it takes, how long it takes and I strive to deliver an excellent end product on or before time that keeps my backers coming back for more.\n EVOLUTION: Soloman Temple Squares started with just 26 varieties - now I am offering 144. [Edit: And NOW, 288] \n SOLUTION: If you like the artwork, then you can rest assured you won't have to hunt too hard for tiles that match it - with this set of building blocks you can enjoy virtually endless dungeon constructions in the same art style.\n ASSURED DELIVERY: Based on my rate of work and previous experience I am estimating full delivery of all digital rewards by December 2019. I work very hard to complete my art before the stated deadline and get art out to backers as soon as I can - without compromising quality. To date I've not failed to deliver before or on a deadline. \n TRANSPARENCY: You'll always know where I am up to with the project with regular updates and rapid comprehensive communication/replies to any issues that may arise or questions you may have. I strive to keep my backers very well informed of the good (or the bad) and even provide post-campaign support and convenience by installing a campaign graphic that shows which stage of the process I am up to at a visual glimpse, give estimated times for processes, and provide multiple ways to contact me privately or publicly at any time.\n EXCELLENCE: If something isn't right, if something goes wrong, I do my absolute best to fix it quickly and definitively once I spot it or it is brought to my attention during or after my campaigns. I want my backers to have the best tools for their RPG and continually look for ways to improve my products and service.\n REALIZATION: As you can see I am committed to continuing my various Ranges so my users have new and exciting products on a semi-regular basis. Getting to this point wouldn't have been possible without all of the support I have gotten for my art so thank you all very much!\n VTT FUNCTION: Ideal for Virtual Table Top Gaming in at least two popular VTT systems, from both of which I am familiar and a licensed seller of maps and tokens - and my tiles are easy to use in many other generic systems besides.\n RELIABILITY: I always deliver the goods to promise and my record reflects that.\n EXPANSION: Click here to view my website page and other projects including the currently available 900+ Modular Terrain Maps I created called 'Meanders: Synchable Terrain\" that these will also work with: https://gametilewarehouse.wixsite.com/rpgtilesupply\n REPUTATION: My creations currently retail from Fantasy Grounds, Steam, D20 Pro, Roll20 and my own website, Game Tile Warehouse. They are also used by numerous Streamers, Gamers, Savage Mojo and various indie-developers.\n CONTINUATION: I am dedicated to expanding these tiles indefinitely, even with 144 sets I will have only scratched the surface of what is possible, already I am dreaming of far more advanced sets so hopefully I can get the support I need to continue my creative frenzies.\nGAME TILE WAREHOUSE is my website where you can view and purchase other products successfully kickstarted - and get news of new upcoming ambitious projects.\nDid you know? : MEANDERS: SYNCHABLE TERRAIN - my modular battlemap series now with almost 1000  x 27x18\"maps claims to be the worlds largest modular terrain map set. If every square is 5ft, Meanders Maps each measure 135x90ft or a whopping 12,150 sq ft. Currently at about 950 maps when I reach 1000 this will equate to 12,150,000 sq ft of digital modular terrain.\nThank you for taking the time to view my project,\nKind Regards,\nKris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is now familiar territory with little to no risk and I will be working right throughout the campaign and after it to finish any remainder as efficiently as possible.\n\nCreated Art is backed up on Google Drive immediately after it is finalized as well as on two other hard-drives so it cannot suffer loss. Short of personal injury or loss of my equipment nothing in my power will prevent this kickstarter from being completed on time.\n\nI have funded and delivered to promise a dozen giant digital kickstarters in my career and ahead of time as a creator with no issues - Everything will be ready to be delivered in full. I am a professional, dedicated to delivering on time and to promise and this campaign will be no exception.

Obediah Felkner, a prominent resident and claim owner of a nearby quicksilver mine, has recently passed away from a mysterious illness. Surprisingly, a group of complete strangers have been named as his beneficiaries. The claim to Felkner\u2019s mine could become theirs.\nHowever, Felkner\u2019s last will contains a peculiar condition: in order to claim the deed to the mine, the party must collect a holy relic known as the Hand of San Roque and deliver it to Felkner\u2019s grieving widow before dawn. The artifact is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the old Mission San Roque, abandoned by the Spanish almost 40 years ago.\nAnd should they refuse? The lawyer points out they, too, have contracted the same disease that claimed the life of Mr. Felkner, and the retrieval of the relic is their only hope if they wish to survive the mysterious deadly affliction.\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner - Standard Cover (FRK Pyron)\nSummary\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner is a horror-themed western adventure designed for 4-to-6 1st-level characters. This product is compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. The adventure contains pre-generated western-themed DCC RPG characters, so no additional supplements are required. That said, it has been playtested with both David Baity's upcoming Dark Trails RPG and Stormlord Publishing's Black Powder, Black Magic DCC supplement with delightful results. There is an appendix \u201cRunning this adventure with Dark Trails\u201d providing the judge ideas on how to fully leverage the Dark Trails ruleset with this adventure.\nThis full-length, standalone adventure will be between 24 to 28 pages in length. The adventure is completely written, edited, and thoroughly playtested. It currently contains art from some of your favorite DCC RPG artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson. The adventure will be released as an 8.5 x 11 booklet with color cover and black and white interior pages.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! A limited-edition alternate foil-cover will be released and made available for sale only to Kickstarter backers. For an example of the foil cover, check out the one released for Children of the Fallen Sun.\nAnd finally, you will have the option to receive a  Dark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF discount code! See below for details.\nSpoiler Details\nThe adventure is loaded with goodies. Filthy spoilers ahead so if you\u2019re planning on enjoying this adventure as a player you may want to skip to the next section.\nOnly judges here? OK, here\u2019s what goodies you\u2019ll get in the adventure:\nThe bulk of the adventure takes place in a fictional California Mission. Despite being a western, like many of my adventures there\u2019s a strong horror theme where the players will eventually discover there\u2019s a mystery going on at the old Spanish Mission and not everything is quite what it seems\u2026\nThe adventure has approximately 12 keyed encounters, as well as starting and ending events.\nA full-page black and white mission map illustrated by Stefan Poag.\nThe appendix includes descriptions of 3 new magic items (including the artifact The Hand of San Roque), at least 3 illustrated player handouts, and 10 pre-generated 1st-level PCs which can be used as-is or as examples on how to modify a standard DCC class into a western-themed PC.\nStefan Poag illustrates why PCs should be careful when poking around haunted grave yards\nProject Status\nThe project has already reached the following milestones:\nWriting of the adventure is complete, the core adventure has been edited, and the adventure has been playtested by multiple judges at several conventions.\nCover art and most of the interior illustrations are complete.\nA deliciously illustrated map by Stefan Poag is complete.\nThe art for the foil cover by FRK Pyron is complete.\nAmazing new interior illustrations from some of your favorite artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson.\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used to fund the printing of the adventures, and potentially include 2-3 additional pieces of art.\nLimited Edition Foil Cover (FRK Pyron)\nStretch Goals\nGiven that the adventure is almost entirely complete, I will be keeping the stretch goals modest, as I\u2019d like to get the adventure in your hands as soon as possible. Still, I wanted to offer a little something as a thank you to Kickstarter backers.\nAt $3000: Stickers for print backers! Each print copy of the adventure will include  two 3\"x3\u201d stickers: one of the Thick Skull Adventures logo (see below), and another with a new design which will be inspired by one of the pieces of art within the adventure.\nAt $4000: Four additional pages. The adventure is currently 24 pages, but you can help make it 28! The new pages would most likely be a combination of new pieces of art as well as some more background material write ups of the prominent NPCs encountered in Los Castores.\nAt $5500: A full patron write up. Spoiler alert: within the adventure, there is an otherworldly entity meddling with humankind in nefarious ways. At this level, I will do a full write-up of this entity as a patron and include an accompanying piece of art.\nThick Skull Adventures Sticker!\nDark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF Discount Code Offer\nTo get your Weird West campaign started right, David Baity has generously agreed to provide discount codes for the PDF copy of the Dark Trails Quick Start Guide when it becomes available to backers of this Kickstarter.

You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game returns you to the glory days of gaming, allowing you to adventure as 1974 intended you to, but with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery.\nAbout Dark Trails\nThe forthcoming Dark Trails RPG by David Baity is a game which pays homage to the popular Weird West genre.  Dark Trails can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG. While Dark Trails is not required to play The Last will and Testament of Obediah Felkner, the two go together like dust and boots.\nAbout Stephen Newton\nStephen has been publishing adventures for both Thick Skull Adventures and Goodman Games for over seven years. Stephen has garnered a bit of a reputation for his unique style of horror contained with his DCC adventures. He is the author of three of Goodman Game\u2019s Halloween (now Horror) line of adventures including They Served Brandolyn Red, The Corpse that Love Built, and Creep, Skrag, Creep! As the primary author behind Thick Skull Adventures, Stephen has authored the Best Selling Attack of the Frawgs, The Haunting of Larvik Island, Stronghold of the Wood Giant Shaman, and Children of the Fallen Sun (for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG).\nShipping Costs\nEach adventure will ship either in a cardboard envelope or bubble pack via Media Mail. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. This is to protect everyone involved in case there is an unforeseen rate increase in postal costs between funding and final shipping. At the time of launch, shipping and handling is planned to be an economical $5 per book shipped which is charged separate from the pledge levels. Rest assured that we will do everything within our power to ship your books to you the cheapest and most economical way possible.\nAny changes beyond our control to the expected shipping costs resulting from postal rate increases will be fully announced in updates if such a situation arises.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly. \nBut what about international orders? If you\u2019re outside the US and want a copy, the standard cover will eventually be available through the Goodman Games and Game Kastle online store(s). If you are outside the US and want a foil cover, please send me a direct message and I will try to determine the most economical way to accommodate the request \u2013 most likely as a special order.\nPDF Fulfillment\nPDF copies will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG.com.

The entire Tactical Adventures crew thanks you, each and everyone of you who made this Kickstarter a success. If you want to follow the progress of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, don't hesitate to drop by our Website where we'll be posting Dev Blogs & Updates on a weekly basis - and to wishlist us on Steam to be notified when the game goes live!\nOn October 18th 2019, our Free Kickstarter Pre-Alpha Demo will leave our Steam Page as the entire team's focus shifts towards working on the final game. We hope you enjoyed exploring the Ruins of Telema in the company of Garrad, Rhuad, Vigdis & Violet! Keep an eye out, you may yet meet them in the release version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister...\nCreated and written by lifelong fans of Pen & Paper RPGs, Solasta: Crown of the Magister is a Turn-Based Tactical cRPG based on the SRD 5.1 Ruleset.\n An Epic Team Adventure - Create your very own party of adventurers in the classic tabletop RPG tradition with our Character Creation Tool. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. \n Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World - Delve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but be very aware of light and darkness. Many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters.\n Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions - The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\n True to Tabletop - Solasta: Crown of the Magister brings back the thrill, tactics, and deep storytelling of tabletop games, with the rules of SRD 5.1 on PC! As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. Roll for initiative!\n A Team of Passionate Veterans - Led by Mathieu Girard, co-founder of Amplitude Studios (Endless Space...), Tactical Adventures is a small studio of experienced developers with many projects under their belts. \nPlease note that the price in USD is an approximation based on the original price in Euros (since Tactical Adventures is based in France, we unfortunately do not have the option to run our Kickstarter Campaign in USD). Prices in USD may vary depending on the USD to EUR exchange rate.\nStretch Goals Updates: Recap\n Paladin: Vote Starts / Archetypes Revealed / Paladin wins the vote \n Lawkeeper Background: Reveal / Unlock \n Party Banter: Reveal / Unlock \n Cohh Carnage Guest Voice Actor: Reveal / Unlock \n Ranger: Reveal / Unlock \n Academic Background: Reveal / Unlock \n Half-Elf: Vote Starts / Half-Elf wins the vote \n Music Upgrade: Reveal / Unlock \n Boss Monster: Vote Starts / Remorhaz wins the vote \n Legendary Item Questline: Reveal / Unlock \n Sorcerer: Reveal / Unlock \nDiscuss with us on our Official Forums & Discord Server \nWishlist & Follow us on Steam \nFind us on Twitter, Facebook & Instagram \nWatch our Videos on Youtube & Twitch \nOur Referral Program is now over!

Watch our Lore Trailer here!\nAn epic single-player campaign that will take your party from level 1 to level 10. \nA fully-customizable party of 4 characters, each of them as important as the others.\nBuilding the game hand-in-hand with the community, with Communication and Transparency as core values. \n Current Platform: PC Windows, Mac\n Current Languages: English (Voiced), French & German (Interface & Subtitles)\nThere is no \"main character\" when playing on the Tabletop. In Solasta: Crown of the Magister, you will be playing a party of four heroes, as opposed to the usual \"one hero and three companions\". \nCreate your very own party of adventurers in the classic tabletop RPG tradition with our Character Creation Tool, selecting race, sub-race, class, background, proficiencies and ability scores. Each character will also have a different personality based on the choices you make during Character Creation, and this will affect their dialog options - fully voiced ones! Decide on your ideal party composition, and jump into the world of Solasta!\nSolasta: Crown of the Magister currently allows you to create characters from the four classic races: Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling. Each race (except Human) offers two sub-races. Of course, we decided to start with the four traditional classes of Tabletop adventurers: Fighter, Rogue, Cleric, and Wizard, each with three different archetypes. It goes without saying that we have plans for more, depending on the success of the Kickstarter Campaign!\nThe shattered world of Solasta is a High Fantasy setting with rich lore and many wonders. Multiple factions live in relative harmony amid the ruins of a fallen empire. Each has its own agenda and its own uses for adventurers. As you follow the twists and turns of the campaign, you will uncover the truth behind the ancient Cataclysm and fight to prevent it happening again. \nLore Updates:\nAn Introduction to the World of Solasta\nThe Halflings of Solasta\nThe Elves & Dwarves of Solasta\nThe Rangers & Paladins of Solasta\nThe Orcs & Humans of Solasta\nThe Half-Elves & Half-Orcs of Solasta\nThe Sorcerers of Solasta\nYou will explore long-forgotten ruins to unearth ancient artifacts, and face powerful foes in the process. And deep underground, our game's advanced lighting system will  shine - quite literally!\nIn Solasta: Crown of the Magister, lighting not only impacts the visuals, but also the gameplay. Torches and Spells will dispel the darkness, allowing you to look out for ambushes and hidden traps. Some monsters may even be hypersensitive to light, giving you the chance to run away or force them back. \nWithout light, however, you will face major disadvantages. Not only will it be hard to see, but you will also have disadvantages on many rolls. You would do well to be careful around enemies who can cast Darkness... \nAlso remember that you will be exploring and fighting in a dynamic environment. Bridges can collapse, columns can be toppled - make sure you use all your options to forge your path to victory! \nThe dungeons of Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Each level is made from 5' x 5' x 5' cubes, and designed to allow characters to move vertically as well as horizontally. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below.\nIn Solasta: Crown of the Magister, you will experience Combat and Exploration in three dimensions. Spells like Fly or Spiderclimb may save you a great deal of trouble when trying to navigate dungeons and caverns - and you may even find hidden treasures along the way. On the other hand... take care not to lose concentration - fall damage can be quite fatal!\nMake good use of verticality - for your enemies surely will. Giant Venomous Spiders crawling down the walls, Brimstone Vipers harassing you from up high, ferocious Orcs trying to shove you off a flimsy bridge... This is just a taste of what you will have to face!\nWe love Tabletop RPGs. And if you're here, chances are you do too! From Character Creation, to rolling the dice, to arguing with your peers that their idea is dumb and they should go with yours... This is what we want Solasta: Crown of the Magister to be - a PC representation of the Tabletop experience. Most of us have been playing and DM'ing for decades, and we pour that love and knowledge into the game.\nWe are committed in bringing the SRD 5.1 Ruleset to life on PC as faithfully as we can, with changes being limited to rules needing to be adapted for video games (exemple: Longbows would be able to hit targets from dozens of screens away). \nCharacter Creation Update\nYour journey through Solasta: Crown of the Magister will be accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack by Maxime Herv\u00e9, a talented  young composer who has worked on several high profile projects including Space Hulk: Tactics, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Resident Evil 7, and Love Death & Robots.\nThe G4F Prod crew is in charge of the sound design and its integration within the game. From Endless Space & Endless Legend to Furi, Styx, The Council, Blood Bowl, Call of Cthulhu & Space Hulk : Tactics, this award-winning team will deliver a stunning audio experience for Solasta!\nTactical Adventures is a self-published studio founded in 2018 by Mathieu Girard, who previously co-founded Amplitude Studios (Endless Space, Endless Legend...). We're located in Paris, not far from Notre-Dame (although now would not be the best time to visit). \nMathieu has been gathering passionate and experienced developers from all over, many with 10 or 20 years of game development under their belts, and most of them huge tabletop RPG fans. The team has been formed with a single aim: to create an immersive and tactical RPG with strong links to the authentic tabletop experience. \nWe plan to remain a small team of experts, working with trusted partners and making decisions in collaboration with the community. \n\nWe don't just want you to like Solasta - we want you to love it! Additional funds will allow us to add more content, such as more classes, more races and more quests. We want to make the best game we possibly can, and for that we need support from you - the player. \nWe want to hear your opinions and build Solasta with your help. What is it you would like to see? What are you excited about? What are your concerns? Kickstarter enables that direct discussion.\nWe also want to be transparent with you. Know that Solasta: Crown of the Magister will come out no matter what. We already have a sufficient budget from our own money, bank loans, public investments and government grants - so you can be confident that we're not going to bail on you. Kickstarter will allow us to expand the scope of the game, and we can assure you that we will release a complete & polished game. \nIn order to provide the best game experience we can, we will focus on releasing Solasta: Crown of the Magister on PC first, and then releasing a Mac Version. \nFor Consoles, we do not want to make promises that we might have to break due to complexity, time or budget constraints.\nIt is also too early for us to know where exactly we will be releasing our game on PC, but we can already tell you that we will be on Steam and that we'll be considering other distribution platforms. We will not be Exclusive on Epic Games Store. \nStarting November 2019 (the links won't work before that), you will be able to access our Pledge Manager - Crowdox.\nThrough CrowdOx, you will be able to:\nReview your Kickstarter Pledge & Rewards\nUpgrade your Pledge (for a limited duration after the campaign)\n Buy Physical Add-Ons (for a limited duration after the campaign)\nUpdate your Address\nPay the Shipping Fees\n Lost your Survey Link?

My first attempt at combining these two things was the creation of the podcast If You Give a Mouse a Dagger, an actual play podcast that uses the FATE Core system and is set in the Redwall universe. When deciding what system to use for this podcast, I could not find a system that worked exactly for what I wanted from the game. The closest we could find was FATE Core, but even this system doesn\u2019t have a rule system in place for food, bravery, honor, or many of the other aspects I loved about Redwall without creating extra rules.\nBecause of this dilemma, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a system that allows for all the things I found missing from FATE. This way, if anyone is like me and searching for a system to use for their Redwall or similar themed campaign, they can find it. Thus, Paws & Claws was born.\nWhat is Paws & Claws?\nPaws & Claws is a tabletop roleplaying game that uses the Status Die System and is set in the medieval fantasy world of Wudlind. \nThe world of Wudlind.\nWudlind is a land of rich forests, rushing rivers, majestic mountain ranges, relaxing beaches, and calm meadows. Each part of the map is filled with life and every area showcases a unique culture. When you adventure in Wudlind, will you be a member of a travelling band of entertainers loyal to the Fox Merchant Collective or a member of the Order of the Crescent who pledges to protect the small folk of Wudlind? Perhaps you will be an ambassador to the mole kingdom stationed in the Geode Keep deep underground while representing the squirrels of Hightop Castle in the thick foliage of the Great Oak Woods? Perhaps you won\u2019t be a part of any kingdom or organization already designed. Wudlind is an ever-evolving world with room for whatever you bring to the gaming table! \nThe world of Wudlind is inspired by novels like the Redwall series, Watership Down, and The Builders.\nWhat all does this game feature? Or what are you paying for?\n\u00b7 The all-new Status Die System\n\u00b7 8 unique vocations\n\u00b7 10 unique species\n\u00b7 Systems for crafting, cooking, honor, bravery, and more.\nRules and guidelines for GMing\n\u00b7 100+ enemies\n\u00b7 4 short ready to play adventures\nIn addition, stretch goals will allow for more vocations and species available for play.\nWhat is this Kickstarter for? Or where does my money go?\nThe funds from this Kickstarter will be split between three main areas: professional artwork, professional editing, and professional design. I am only interested in releasing a professional product, and in order to create one I need to hire others to do this work.\nCan I try this game out before I commit to this Kickstarter?\nYes, you can! You can find the Quickstart Guide on DriveThruRPG and download it for free! It is important to know that this while the core system of Paws & Claws will be mostly the same in the final product, the page design, quality of editing, and certain aspects of the gameplay will be drastically different. You may find the free version here:\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/278565/Paws--Claws-Quickstart-Guide?term=Paws", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy is the timeline a full year?\n\nThe timeline is projected to be an entire year before the finished product is released. It might seem long, but it is once again about creating a top quality product. I want to spend a significant amount of time play testing to balance and nuance every aspect of the game. Of course, during that time, a significant amount of artwork and design can be done. However, editing cannot happen until the rules, lore, and other text are done. It might be sooner, and I wish I could promise it would be. However, this is an indie game made by one guy who already works a full-time teaching job. It might take a while for the finished product to be released, but it is to ensure quality. If I try to rush it, the product will suffer in quality.

Scroll down to the section LEARN MORE ABOUT TORG to find out more and get started!\nLimited Offer: Aysle Champion\nWant to add your own hero to the ranks of the Army of Light? You get everything in the Aysle Treasure Coffer Pledge Level, plus we\u2019ll work with you to create an official Core Earth or Aysle Archetype! This includes one custom Perk, Spell, or Miracle, plus art for the character, and the character you help create becomes the \u201ciconic\u201d version of that Archetype.\nThese Archetypes become part of the game and are available as a bonus to all backers who receive the normal digital Archetypes. The archetype is the property of Ulisses and we reserve the right to refuse any names or other features of the character that we consider inappropriate (such as inflammatory or vividly \"against theme\").\nUltra Limited Offer: Aysle Royalty\nAdd your Archetype as a Champion above, plus you earn a seat for yourself or a designated proxy at our very special GenCon event on Friday night. Last year's event was an epic battle that determined the fate of the Mystery Men. What will this year's game hold? Note that this offer doesn't include travel, lodging, or tickets to GenCon. This is a different night and a different adventure than the session for Nile Empire Vigilantes!\nBest Value: The Aysle Treasure Coffer   \nFor the best Aysle experience and the most value for your pledge check out the Aysle Treasure Coffer. It is the most convenient way to get all of the core items in this Kickstarter, plus much more! Note that the base price has gone up a little, but that\u2019s because it features an entirely extra book even before Stretch Goals come into play: Greg Gorden\u2019s new Cosms Collide mega-adventure! The Treasure Coffer also starts with a sheet of Threat Blips, 5 new Threat Cards, the Aysle Possibility Tokens, and the CD soundtrack for The Revenge of the Carredon...and tons more goodies waiting to be unlocked! Any Add-On labeled as \"Treasure Coffer\" comes in the box.\nAysle is a realm of magic, fantasy, and an eternal struggle between Darkness and Light! It's ruled by High Lord Uthorion \u2014currently inhabiting the body of a Viking warlord\u2014and his Dread Covenent of nightmares, necromancers, and nefarious lords. Uthorion attacked from above and below, with maelstrom bridges crashing down in the sea to bring his Viking raiders, and a massive ritual connecting the underground passages of Aysle to subways, cellars, and caves on Earth. Any break in the ground may now be a portal to treasure and danger.\n\nWithin Uthorion\u2019s borders magic is powerful and miracles happen, but technology beyond a flintlock rifle sputter and malfunction. High tech doesn\u2019t belong here, and reality tries to right it and transform items into something accepted by the Ayslish. Storm Knights resist this effect, and may bring modern weapons (and more) to bear against the forces of Darkness.\nHigh Lord Uthorion didn't come to Earth alone. For the last century he had possessed Queen Pella Ardinay, the Lady of Light, and used her to corrupt her forces and undermine her allies: the elves and the last of the dwarves. She was recently slain and resurrected\u2014freeing her\u2014and now she leads the remnants of her armies to Earth in pursuit of her hated foe.\nThe Aysle source book is an expansion designed for both players and Game Masters. Inside you'll find:\nNew Perks, Spells, and Miracles for advancing characters. Includes options only available to Beta Clearance Storm Knights, as they learn more about their own abilities and the nature of reality.\n Magic Gear! A bevy of new items for adventurers, and random tables for discovering items in coffers or on foes!\nAn extensive status update for the default timeline. See the course of the first year of the Possibility Wars and the toll it's taken on Great Britain and Scandinavia. Includes a list of ongoing Delphi Council operations and who's who in the Aysle theater of the war.\nGet the statistics for the Dark Lord himself, as Uthorion takes matters into his own hands. Defeating him comes at a price, as Pella Ardinay found out the hard way!\nNew threats. Angered Elementals erupt throughout the realm as raw magic courses across new lands. Knights and wizards roam the roads\u2014many of them selfish and bent towards the ways of Darkness. The Dread Covenant has its own troops: monsters of legend, giants, undead, Vikings, and the foul spawn of Darkness controlled by Uthorion.\nQuest generation tables, new Eternity Shards, and more!\nRevenge of the Carredon is a massive adventure suitable for several months of gaming. Start off in middle of the war, fighting in the trenches of Oxford. Tolwyn Tancred, the legendary hero who slew Uthorion\u2019s strange dragon\u2014the dreaded Carredon\u2014and returned to save Pella Ardinay is cursed, and heralds the return of the mighty beast she seemed to slay. Embark on a quest to unlock the mystery of the Carredon\u2019s origins and break the curse before Tolwyn is lost forever and Uthorion regains one of his most powerful weapons.\nWhen Cosms Collide! Original Torg co-creator Greg Gorden returns with a new mega-adventure! The Cyberpapacy, technodemons, Mobius' shocktroopers, and others all seem to have business in the realm of Aysle\u2014and the Storm Knights are caught in the middle. Join the action and uncover the mystery of what has so many High Lords moving through Uthorion's kingdom, and if anyone can beat the Dark One on his home ground !\nThe Aysle GM Screen has three panels. On the inside, all the most needed charts from Torg Eternity in addition to the new charts specific to adventures in Aysle. The outside features a single, gorgeous seamless image and the axioms and World Laws players need to remember. \nAysle Archetypes come within the GM Screen, and offer new stock heroes to draw from to fill the ranks of your Storm Knights. Meet the Champion of Light, a Core Earther transformed by the magic of Aysle into an armored paladin, the Necromancer, a hero touched by Darkness but who deploys her deadly spells against a common foe, and the Cleric of Dunad, an elf from Aysle who channels the holy power of the gods\u2026and many more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd like extra copies of an item or would like to add a product from another pledge tier to your order, you may use the list below.

It features a multi-chapter campaign story that progresses through a series of over two dozen illustrated dungeon maps, where each area is a hand-crafted puzzle. Fight monsters, acquire keys to open doors, get life-boosting elixirs, powerful equipment and enchanted items, and defeat the boss at the end of each level. Use your wits to find the right path through each area and survive. Solve each puzzle to move forward with the story.\nTwisty Little Passages is a game of full-color, fully-illustrated thematic puzzles.

Play it easily wherever you go!\nIf you like puzzles, mazes and dungeon crawl adventures, you'll find this a uniquely engaging experience!\nTwisty Little Passages Book\nSpecial challenge areas will contain an extended layout, with multiple story pages tied to epic two-page map spreads.\nTo play, you draw right on the laminated dungeon maps with a fine-tipped dry-erase pen to track your progress as you explore, find treasure, track stats and inventory, defeat enemies and uncover the secrets of solving each area. Survive each puzzle without getting stuck or running out of health. It may require multiple attempts to find the solution to a puzzle, and it's easy to restart your progress by wiping the page to start again.\nBONUS MATERIAL: We're including a section in the back of the book with spoiler-resistant progressive hints for all the puzzles to keep difficulty balanced for all players, plus another section with full solutions.\nPodcasts\nListen to a six-minute segment reviewing Twisty Little Passages in the On Board Games podcast with Isaac Shalev (starts at 5:05).\nTutorial Puzzle 1-1: Kradra Prison\nRules of play\nLearn the basic rules of how to play through the puzzles here:\nPrototype rules for download (PDF)\n\nPrint-and-play versions of demo Puzzles 1-1 through 1-5\nAfter reading the rules above, try to solve these introductory puzzles from the book in order:\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-1: Kradra Prison -- keys and locks tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-2: Underground Caverns -- combat tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-3: Abandoned Hub -- armor tutorial\n\nDemo Puzzle 1-4: Roach Nest -- multiple equipment pieces tutorial\n\n Demo Puzzle 1-5: Kradra Prison Escape -- multiple enemies tutorial \n\nThere are 27 standalone puzzle areas (including unlocked stretch goals) total in the book, plus world map and secret meta-puzzle stretch goals.

Get ready to put on your thinking caps!\nWe designed each puzzle to be played in about a single sitting.  Expect to play each puzzle beyond the tutorial for around 15-90 minutes, some shorter and some longer, with some especially challenging areas that can take longer.  You can pause and continue play at any time, simply closing the book to save your place in the current area.\nTotal play time to solve all puzzles is estimated at 15-30 hours.\nWritten reviews \nRead Father Geek's review of Twisty Little Passages.\nThe final production version of Twisty Little Passages will feature multiple upgrades over the prototype preview copies you see here and in videos, including:\nMetal wire-binding, not plastic spiral bound\nOffset printing (no white border along the edge of the page)\nPlus all unlocked bonus and stretch goals listed above, including heavy-duty 10 pt card stock glossy laminated pages!\n(Early puzzle spoilers)\nHere are playthroughs of the simple tutorial puzzles in the introductory chapter of the book.

Questions directed to us on specific shipping situations are welcome.\nOur goal is maximize the value we provide you while keeping production and shipping overhead as low as possible.

It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up in Unity. Read on to find out what this all means and why we are excited for this project.\nFantasy Grounds is a popular system for playing a host of different roleplaying games online.  It is used by more than 130,000 gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and more.  This type of program is commonly referred to as a virtual tabletop, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various part of an RPG session in a digital form.\nWhat makes Fantasy Grounds different than competitors is how we expose character sheets and automate large portions of gameplay specifically for each system we support.  This is done through rulesets.  Your experience playing Deadlands Reloaded will differ from D&D and will be unique to that environment, contain custom graphics, character sheets, and automation specific to that game system.  \nOne feature shared across most game systems is maps.  Some may use hexes while others use square grids and some may not use grids at all.  Facing is important in some and less so in others.  While FG has featured maps for many years, they have been primarily focused as reproductions of maps in existing adventure modules from our many licensed publishers. We believe that we can enhance these to provide dynamic line of sight, fog of war, and even map building support with painting and tiles.\nWhat you get for backing this project will be a license for Fantasy Grounds Unity (or FGU). This new game engine has all the great features of current version of Fantasy Grounds (soon to be called Fantasy Grounds Classic) along with new enhanced features. \nOriginal Features Supported:\nMultiplayer support for playing tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons (2E, 3.5E, 4E and 5E), Pathfinder RPG 1, Pathfinder RPG 2, Starfinder.\nBuilt-in content for D&D 3.5E, 5E and Pathfinder 1\nOfficially licensed add-on content available for D&D, D&D Classics (2E), Pathfinder, Starfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, Castles & Crusades, Mutants & Masterminds, 13th Age, W.O.I.N., Traveller, and Rolemaster Classic\nGeneric system support through our CoreRPG ruleset\nBrilliant Campaign Management\nIntegrated character sheets with lots of automation built in for playing and leveling (depending on ruleset and content owned)\nCombat Tracking\n3D dice\nFantasy Grounds Unity Enhanced Features Include:\n64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)\nNative support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC\nNetwork lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)\nTile based map building\nEnhanced Drawing Tools\nAdditional Dice Macros support\nA new FGU only skin\nDynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers\nPaint with images, such as walls\nAnimated image effects\nBackward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC\nIn addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward. We have lots of ideas for new features and this rebuilt engine will make it easier for us reach those goals and deliver consistent updates for free. \nTile based Map Building\nDynamic Line of Sight (LOS) and Fog of War (FOW)\nLine of Sight - Doors and Terrain\nMap Fx Layers\n New Grid Options\nAdvanced Dice Expression Support\nWe have already devoted over 4 years and 10,000 developer hours to this project. Any funds raised will help us push it over the edge and begin work on new features and functionality. If the project does exceptionally well, this may even allow us to add even more resources to the team.\nWe have over 1200 existing DLC and add-ons. Our goal is to prioritize these by popularity and work on enhancing as many of these as we can. Without enhancements, they will continue to function as they always have in Fantasy Grounds Classic. You will be able to add dynamic line of sight to maps and begin using the new features straight away. As we work through this large back catalog of DLC, we will do all the enhancement and upgrade work for you so you can just load it up and begin using the advanced features without having to define any Line of Sight blockers yourself. \nLink: www.fantasygrounds.com\nGreat! We anticipate that a large number of our backers will already be fans and users of our software. For you, we have added discounted Upgrade tiers available to get you up and running on the new engine as soon as possible. A lot of the time spent building the new engine was devoted towards making sure that everything you've already bought or created will continue to work in FGU. The only difference is that now you will be able to further enhance them.\nOver time, we will begin going through older products and enhancing them for you. Just look for the Update Available button to light up and stay tuned to our newsletter for regular updates on which products have been newly Enhanced. \nWhich Upgrade option do I choose?\nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license in 2018 or 2019, then pick the Rookie Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate. \nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license before 2018, then choose the Veteran Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate.\nIf you are on a subscription, then you will be able to subscribe to the new version once it is released on the store. If you want Beta or Alpha access, then you would need to get a Newcomer tier option on the Kickstarter. \nHow do I upgrade multiple license keys?\nIf your account has multiple license keys, it is possible that some of them are newer and some are older. Pick the tier that best fits your main license key that you personally use and then increase your pledge level for each additional license you have based on the age of that license.  Our survey system and fulfillment will allow some corrections there later on and we can always help on a case-by-case basis through our support email at the time of fulfillment.\nDo I need to pay a subscription going forward?\nOur newcomer tiers are 1-time purchase licenses for Fantasy Grounds Unity. No further subscription is required. If you had a subscription to Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may want to maintain that as long as you want to continue using that version. \nYes, Fantasy Grounds Classic will remain a viable product for many years to come. While the data is backward compatible, we chose to separate the data paths for FGU and FG Classic so that changes to one won't be reflected in the other. You can copy campaigns over to FGU to try things out there and maintain your original copy back on Fantasy Grounds Classic. \nOver time, we expect most users will migrate fully to FGU.\nDo I get access to Fantasy Grounds Classic if I buy Fantasy Grounds Unity?\nNo. If you already have a license or subscription, then you can continue to use that. The licenses will be different even though they share the same add-ons. \nStandard licenses can host or play in a game with other licensed users. An Ultimate license allows the GM to host a game for any number of players and those players can use a free Demo license of Fantasy Grounds. Initial copies will go out to backers only, but we will try to  send out the demo license links to backers at some point prior to launch so those can be shared with players for your game.\nWe have over 1200 DLC items available -- an entire gaming bookstore worth of games. It's too much to feature in the Kickstarter, but we have a select list of bundles below that you can choose from when we send out the backer surveys. Just increase your pledge amount for the add-ons you want from the list below. \nAlso -- Anything you already own on your account at fantasygrounds.com will continue to work with FGU, so you won't have to re-buy any of those. In fact, you can go shopping at fantasygrounds.com if you see anything on sale there during or after the Kickstarter and those items will unlock automatically for your account once you gain access to FGU during the Alpha or Beta.\nWhat if I bought my add-ons from Steam?\nYou will be able to use those in both versions: Fantasy Grounds Classic and Fantasy Grounds Unity. Our system will know what purchases you have made from either location. \n*Note: We have some unknowns about how the Steam Store will reflect purchases across the two versions of Fantasy Grounds. If you bought bundle items on Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may need to buy new additions to the bundle there instead of on the new FGU store page on Steam.  \n\nNew portraits commissioned from the Ultimate Gamemaster level by amazing avatar artist, Mates Laurentiu! \nArtist Bio: Born in Dracula's lands, Mates Laurentiu is a Romanian freelance artist with a love for fantasy, horror and science fiction.

We make notes on things that we know we need to check into for Mac and Linux support but we have not yet attempted builds on those platforms. It is possible and expected that there will be a delay between releasing versions for Windows PC and Mac and Linux. In the worst case scenario, Windows PC users may complete the entire Alpha and Beta process before the Alpha and Beta process begins for other platforms. \n\nWe will lock down the FGU Alpha Launch Party by the start of June. If there are significant delays in getting you access to the Alpha, we will still have some hands-on stuff for you at the event but we may delay access to the Alpha keys until a later date.

Instead, we gave general responses that we would be looking into that and other features once we completed the initial port to Unity.\nI am now happy to announce that we have released this feature into our TEST channel for people to play around with and experiment.

The GM can then approve or reject movement on a per token basis. Once enabled on a map, any attempted move by players will need to be confirmed by the GM.

OVER 100% FUNDED!\nYou guys rock so much. I don't even have the words to articulate how awesome you guys are. Now that we're funded, we can move on to some AWESOME stretch goals!\n At $20,000, we'll add maps for EVERY CITY that's unlocked during the campaign. These maps will include not only a bird's-eye-view of the city, and not only details about specific locations like landmarks or specialized shops and locations, but ALSO playable maps for those specific locations! That means, if your players decide to up and start a bar fight in their local Owlbear Wild Wings, you, as the Dungeon Master, won't have to go searching for a generic bar map and give them some imaginary fluff about the magic screens displaying the latest and greatest Sportsball game - you can just pull out the Owlbear Wild Wings Battlemap and let them have at it!\nLet's work together to unlock this stretch goal and tons more, like these:\n What exactly is Monsters of Murka?  \nMonsters of Murka is a hilarious new campaign setting for fifth edition DND full of comical monsters, detailed maps, parodical mayhem, and political satire! This campaign setting includes adventures for first to tenth level characters.\nQuotes from Monsters of Murka playtesters\nThe World of Murka\nMurka was once a land of great promise. People flocked to it from across the known worlds. It was a place of myriad creatures, creeds, and most importantly, connections, each seeking its place among beautiful landscapes and bountiful resources. After centuries of development, prosperous cities dot the countryside. Their populations hail from distant lands, yet they thrive, together, with the common goal of progress, and of prosperity. \nThe populace share a common goal of achieving that which all sought; The Murkan Dream.\nThe Murkan Dream\nThe Murkan Dream is an artifact of an unknown origin. In fact, so little is known about the Murkan Dream that some doubt its existence entirely. Others view it as an ultimate goal, an achievable reality towards which they push, day in and day out. Whispered words litter the streets, telling tales of those who have supposedly obtained or achieved the Murkan Dream. Many of these have proven to be categorically false: people who claimed to have achieved the Murkan Dream only to later reveal that they had begun their journey with such a wealth of resources and advantages, that the Murkan Dream was never something they really even wanted or needed.\nThese false mythologues serve only to further drive the Murkan people towards their goals, both individually and collectively. Recently, however, an evil being has come into power over Murka, and now his minions roam the lands, terrorizing those whose pursuit of the Murkan Dream may threaten his power...\nSeveral years ago, The Don asserted himself as the leader of the free world of Murka. He painted outsiders as a threat to the Murkan Dream, insisting that their presence alone would somehow be enough to destroy it permanently. He claimed that he had achieved the Murkan Dream, that he had seen the light, and that he wanted his people to do the same. \nHe gained influence over the population, and so gained control over the lands with false promises to its inhabitants\u2014promises he never had any intention of keeping.  \nNow, he remains safely within the well-guarded walls of The Pale Fortress, from which he issues commands to impose his will on those who support him to control those who do not.\nHowever, rumors have spread of a resistance group growing within Murka: a people who want to stand against The Don's dark influence, who want to usher in an era of progress and providence, and return the Murkan Dream to the Murkan People.\nThere are a whole host of creatures and cretins roaming the lands of Murka. Many of them are intelligent, having their own societies and roles within the Murkan government. Others are wild and feral, seeking only to make a life in the wild and attacking anything they perceive as a threat. Here are some examples of some Monsters of Murka that you might encounter in your travels.\nWhether it be the fearsome tromp, the bumbling trumplins, or any of the other various villains, you'll be sure to meet your match and more in combat encounters! These and many other creatures of varying shapes, sizes, and abilities await you in the wilderness of Murka. \nSo, will you journey forth into this setting, encountering creatures and solving mysteries, in order to bring an end to The Don's evil rein of terror over the Murkan People?\nGuest Art\nOne of the most fun parts of this book was working with some of my favorite artists who contributed guest art for the book.

It can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG.   As a player, you\u2019ll find a wealth of material that allows you to assume the role of one of 11 unique classes, with descriptive names like: the Calavera, the Bedlamite, and the Sin-Eater.   As a Judge, you\u2019ll find over 400 pages of material giving you a wealth of resources for designing and running fantastic adventures set against the haunted landscapes of an unforgiving weird West. \nYou may be wondering about the above mentioned game that Dark Trails is tethered to. Dungeon Crawl Classics is a Fantasy RPG written by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games. Since debuting in 2012, the book has gone through seven (7) printings and spawned a wonderful community of passionate gamers both new and old. DCC continues to grow by leaps and bounds by way of exciting adventures penned by some of the best writers in the industry, including third-party publishers using the system to fuel their own creative fires.\nFortunately, the Dark Master (Joseph Goodman) has granted permission to include a modified version of the DCC ruleset within the pages of Dark Trails to make it the first 3rd party published work to include the necessary rules for play. You don\u2019t need anything other than the Dark Trails RPG to play the game aside from some dice, paper, and pencils. \nSome of the DCC rules were purposefully left out when weighed against their place in a weird West setting, but these omitted rules can easily be added to Dark Trails should you own a copy of DCC and wish to include them.\n This Kickstarter funds the standalone hardcover book for the game. Funds raised will be used to pay for additional art, editing, and layout for a quality book made by traditional offset methods to ensure it is as durable as it is beautiful. \n Dark Trails is the product of three years of writing and playtesting by author David Baity. You may remember David from his first DCC adventure \u201cCarnival of the Damned\u201d published by  Purple Sorcerer Games. While David has handled the majority of the writing chores with the Dark Trails RPG, lots of folks have thrown their name into the hat to help flesh out the magic and bestiary sections. Daniel J. Bishop, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman, Diogo Nogueira, and Jeff Scifert are just a few of the talented minds that have worked their magic to make Dark Trails something truly special.\nFor one of the two editions of the game we've commissioned none other than the legendary SanJulian to grace us with a beautifully painted cover filled to the brim with \"weird.\" You can see a few more of SanJulian's DCC covers below, and be sure to check out his website  for several works you've probably seen grace the covers of your favorite novels and other publications over the years.\nWho else is on board to help to bring the world of Dark Trails to life? Over the last two years, the author has recruited some of the best up-and-coming artists in the industry. The Dark Trails RPG currently features work by Angga Augustiya, Todd McGowan, Christopher Torres, Simon Todd, Danny Prescott, Adam Slivka, David Hoskins, Aaron Robinson, MARCINs, David Coppoletti, and Diogo Nogueira.\nAdditional funds raised by the Kickstarter will help continue to fund new art from the above-mentioned artists, in addition to work by Stefan Poag, Peter Mullen, and Bradley K. McDevitt, just to name a few!\n Dark Trails will be printed in two editions (standard and limited edition), both are hardcover books  8.5\u201d x 11\u201d trim size. The books will be printed in the USA by offset printing methods to ensure the quality of the book meets consumer expectations.  Currently, we plan to keep the interior printed in B&W on 60# paper and stitched binding. \n The standard edition will feature a full-color cover painted by iconic artist, Sanjulian (Creepy magazine, Vampirella, etc.) while the limited edition will feature a leatherette cover, accented with metallic foil stamping and an embossed version of the Dark Trails RPG logo. The ultimate goal with the limited edition is to create something that looks like it was pulled right out of the Old West! \nBelow, you can see mock ups of each book to give you an idea of what we're visualizing. The painting used to represent the standard edition is not the final Sanjulian cover, and both covers are subject to change. \nA mock-up of the standard edition. This is not the actual cover and all elements are subject to change\nA mock-up of the limited edition leatherette edition. All elements are subject to change.\n\n\n The weird West genre is certainly well represented in the RPG industry, but those wishing to find a fully developed weird West RPG that utilizes a class-based system based upon the DCC RPG will be sadly disappointed. Dark Trails fills a niche for a DCC based weird West RPG by providing 11 original character classes paired with innovative rules designed to leave your players feeling like they\u2019ve just spent several hours adventuring in a Western landscape where the emphasis is placed upon the weird!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find several classes to choose from within the pages of the book, so let\u2019s give you a basic rundown of what you\u2019ll find. \nBedlamite: Absent-minded inventors constantly constructing inventions that defy all logic, including \u201cwondrous\u201d contraptions that are brought to life by their creator\u2019s sheer force of will. Bedlamites often become addle-brained and introverted, preferring the company of their automatons to that of their allies.\nCalavera: Spirit-mediums, most often female, that can both see and speak to the nearby dead wandering the closest regions of the Spirit Lands. The calavera shines like a beacon in the night to the restless dead, eager to have her deliver a message, or perform one last task that will put the spirit to rest. Aiding in those tasks marks her as a veritable queen of the underworld and the dead are not only willing to share some of their dark secrets but also have been known to reach across the grave to protect their only connection to the land of the living.\nGambler: With the big changes running through the weird West, the gambler could be called the chosen paladin of Lady Luck, able to manipulate the ebb and flow of chance like an occultist weaves arcane energy. Gamblers alter the probability of events going on in their surroundings and have a skill set that favors thievery and subterfuge.\nGunslinger: Sometimes, a poor soul is cut down before their time, and when that person is a law-dog or hardened soldier even death isn\u2019t enough to discourage them from staying in the fight. These restless spirits possess the guns they died with and send out a call to those deemed worthy of carrying them. Gunslingers find their uncanny skill at gunplay supernaturally elevated by the spirits of vengeance that choose them.\nLuchador: A luchador is most often a person noble of heart seeking the thrill of martial combat in and out of the sacred ring. In addition to high-flying acrobatics coupled with raw strength and fortitude, luchadores gain the ability to tap into their inner spirit, channeling it through their masks for supernatural effects.\nMountebank: The typical \u201csnake oil salesman\u201d of the frontier, these amateur alchemists and full-time showmen find that the events of the Seven Days of Night have unlocked a doorway to the mind that reveals recipes that defy all logic and, once brewed, resemble the magic potions of legend.\nMystic Monk: Trained in the sacred art of martial arts and schooled by master philosophers, the mystic monk is a humble warrior wandering the weird West in search of enlightenment. In addition to being a master of martial arts, the mystic monk can summon his inner chi, a virtual battery of spiritual energy used to perform superhuman feats.\nOccultist: Occultists devote their lives to the mastery of the ambient arcane energies constantly flowing around all living things, learning to weave and channel them to miraculous effect through spell work. Occultists are considered master investigators and have a nose for all things arcane and unusual.\nRevelator: The revelator serves as a bastion of faith to those seeking refuge from the madness infecting the world. They can perform divine healing and miracles in addition to serving as a bane to evil creatures\u2014both living and dead\u2014all while serving as a pillar of faith to those that still believe in the comforting words of The Good Book.\nSin-Eater: During the Seven Days of Night, no souls were granted passage to the Underworld and instead were cursed to wander the Spirit World where they were preyed upon by creatures native to the realm, or worse, taken as slaves by their own kind. Charon, lord of the ferrymen, knows an abundance of restless spirits could potentially unravel the barrier between worlds. Some ferrymen are hand selected by their lord to return to the surface world in order to shepherd lost souls to the afterlife and destroy those that prey upon them by using River Rites and the soul-aegis, a weapon that strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked.\nTommyknocker: Sometimes, a soul is just too pissed off to pass on and needs to get a slice of vengeance before taking that ride into the sunset. Tommyknockers are walking corpses for almost all intents and purposes, but the strength of their soul is such that it acts as a furnace, providing a means to animate its corpse-shell to take care of unfinished business. In addition to an unnatural strength, the tommyknocker is one of the toughest hombres found in the weird West.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the DCC magic system, you\u2019ll be familiar with how things are done. If you\u2019re new to DCC styled magic you\u2019re in for a real treat! Spells can be cast multiple times if you continually roll high enough. Roll low and you might lose the spell for a day, or worse, suffer from the effects of corruption! On top of being able to cast known spells multiple times, the total of your roll means potentially casting that low-level magic missile spell with effects so strong that you just might wipe the playing field with your trusty \u201cfinger guns.\u201d In addition to a full complement of spells and miracles found within the pages of Dark Trails, you can import any of the 120+ existing spells found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG into your game, should you own the book.\nYou\u2019ll find over 150 spells, wondrous contraptions, elixirs, and miracles within the pages of Dark Trails, but we didn\u2019t stop there. In addition to the above, you\u2019ll find a reliquary of beneficial and cursed magic items, along with rules and tables for crafting magical firearms. \nThe author of the Dark Trails RPG really wants to present you with a game that has some innovative rules that help capture the feel of a Western-themed game. You\u2019ll find several interesting mechanics scattered throughout the book (some that you may even wish to port to your DCC game), but the main rules that make the Dark Trails RPG a horse you\u2019d want to throw a saddle on include:\nNew rules for firearms that incorporate a standard poker deck, including specialized critical hit and fumble tables.\nBoons & Hexes represent a run of good/bad luck your character might be having during a typical session. They\u2019re awarded based on things like exceptionally good/bad die rolls, true heroics, and great role playing.  Boons earned can be spent for in-game perks, while Hexes increase your chances of receiving more disastrous results on fumble and fear charts. In addition, they affect how NPC interactions pan out\u2014consider the unlucky cowboy to have a dark cloud following him around.\nA new system that replaces the \u201cstandard\u201d alignment mechanics found in most RPGs. The new system helps tell the story of how decisions determine the path a character may walk and how that path affects their reputation when dealing with NPCs.\nAn innovative system for fear and madness that simulates a character\u2019s ability to handle both physical and emotional stress during the adventure, including an extensive list of mental disorders for those who slip too deeply down the rabbit hole!\n\n Lot's of folks are hard at work putting their twist on the weird West genre. For starters, you can check out Thick Skull Adventures \"The Last WIll and Testament of Obediah Felkner.\" Author Stephen Newton is close to launching his exciting take on a weird West adventure that blends perfectly with the Dark Trails RPG. You can find more info at Thick Skull Adventures \nYou can also take comfort in knowing some talented up-and-coming writers in the gaming community have become so inspired by past playtests that they\u2019ve taken the initiative to start writing Dark Trails adventures. \nThere\u2019s no bigger compliment for an author than to learn folks think enough of their game to create material before the book is even released! The author has big plans to produce both free and paid content once the book is released into the wild. This includes supporting those who wish to produce their own Dark Trails material!\nYou\u2019re going to love the bestiary in this book! Over seventy-five creatures have been pulled from the works of Lovecraft and the pages of folklore from all around the world! Several notable folks have thrown their passion into helping make the bestiary something special, including but not limited to: Daniel J. Bishop, Jon Hook, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman and more! \nYou\u2019ll also find that several included creatures contain charts with all sorts of tweaks and nasty surprises to make each encounter terrifying and unique!\n\nSometimes, a Judge has a hard enough time wrangling up a posse, let alone coming up with a trail-ready adventure to keep'em busy! Don't you worry, partner, we got you covered!

Arbeitet zusammen, um euch euer eigenes Comic-Universum zu erschaffen und die Geschichten der verschiedenen Helden darin auszuspielen.\nIcons ist dein Alles-in-einem-Paket f\u00fcr Rollenspielabenteuer mit Superhelden: schnell, leicht, beschreibend und lustig! \n___________________________________________________________________\nUrsprung des Crowdfunding:\nIcons wurde vor einigen Jahren als Nebenprojekt von Steve Kenson entwickelt, in welchem er mit der Stufenskala und den Mechaniken von Fudge experimentierte und mit \u00c4hnlichkeiten zu der Skala und den mit Eigenschaftsw\u00f6rtern (toll, unglaublich, atemberaubend) benannten F\u00e4higkeitsstufen im alten Marvel Super Heroes Rollenspiel, wenngleich mit ein paar \u00dcberlegungen zu Superhelden, die mit Zufallsw\u00fcrfen ausgew\u00fcrfelt werden, als Sprungbrett f\u00fcr die Fantasie der Spieler. Sp\u00e4tere Entwicklungsschritte arbeiteten dann Ideen aus FATE (einer bekannteren Weiterentwicklung der Fudge-Regeln) mit ein, sowie Kensons Erfahrungen mit dem Regeldesign f\u00fcr das auf d20-Regeln aufgebaute Mutants and Masterminds.\nIcons wurde zuerst von Adamant Entertainment verlegt. Sp\u00e4ter trennte Steve Kenson sich von Adamant, finanzierte \u00fcber Kickstarter das Quellenbuch Great Power, \u00fcber das er schon l\u00e4ngere Zeit nachgedacht hatte, und ver\u00f6ffentlichte sp\u00e4ter die Assembled Edition des Spiels unter seinem eigenen Label namens Ad Infinitum Adventures, gedruckt und vertrieben durch seine Freunde bei Green Ronin Publishing. Seither sind bei Ad Infinitum Adventures ein paar weitere Quellenb\u00fccher (Icons A to Z und Icons Adversaries) und eine Reihe von Abenteuern erschienen, einschlie\u00dflich eines Abenteuers, das die gesamte lange Kampagne Rise of the Phalanx des K\u00fcnstlers und Autors Dan Houser in einem \u201eextradicken Icons-Band\u201c zusammenfasst.\nAnfang des Jahres 2018 hatte der Verlag Beyond Affinity \u2013 Phantastische Literatur Icons als sein erstes Rollenspielprojekt ausgew\u00e4hlt und die Lizenz f\u00fcr die deutsche Ausgabe erworben. (Alles, was direkt von Kensons Ad Infinitum Adventures f\u00fcr die Marke Icons ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, ist auch von der Lizenz abgedeckt. Das hei\u00dft, es k\u00f6nnen auch die Supplements und die Kurzabenteuer in deutscher \u00dcbersetzung kommen und f\u00fcr jahrelangen superstarken Nachschub ist im Prinzip gesorgt.) Fast zeitgleich hatte auch der langj\u00e4hrige Comic-Fan und Rollenspieler Norbert Franz, nach vielen interessierten R\u00fcckfragen zu Icons bei Spiele-Conventions in S\u00fcddeutschland, mit einer \u00dcbersetzung begonnen, die zuerst nur f\u00fcr ein paar Fans und die eigene Spielergruppe vorgesehen war, ohne kommerzielle Hintergedanken. Norbert Franz und Andr\u00e9 Boyens von Beyond Affinity erfuhren quasi nur zuf\u00e4llig auf Facebook voneinander und einigten sich im Prinzip gleich darauf, dass Franz die schon begonnene deutsche \u00dcbersetzung f\u00fcr Beyond Affinity weiterschreiben w\u00fcrde. Nach viel sprachlicher Detailarbeit, aufgeopferter Freizeit, Kontrollen, R\u00fcckfragen bei Steve Kenson und intensiver Feinabstimmung insbesondere zu der Regelsprache von Icons und dessen zahlreichen Comic-Besonderheiten lag dann am Abend des 30. April 2019 erstmals eine Version des kompletten Icons-Regeltextes vor. Beyond Affinity hatte f\u00fcr das Comic-Nischenspiel von Anfang an einen eigenen deutschen Kickstarter geplant, um eine erste Buchauflage auf den Weg zu bringen. Dieser Kickstarter sollte im vern\u00fcnftigen, vorsichtig kalkulierten Rahmen bleiben und sich dabei nur auf das Regelbuch Assembled Edition als PDF und Hardcover-Band konzentrieren. Um Punkt Mitternacht am 15. Mai 2019 ging dieses Crowdfunding online.\n___________________________________________________________________\nEin paar Informationen zu Icons f\u00fcr Neueinsteiger:\nIcons verwendet ein komplett eigenes System, einen entfernten Verwandten von Fudge und FATE, das inzwischen als das Icons-System fest etabliert ist. Kein anderes Regelbuch ist zum Einstieg oder zum vollst\u00e4ndigen Verst\u00e4ndnis n\u00f6tig. Alles beginnt genau hier mit der Assembled Edition. Im englischsprachigen Raum kann man Icons sogar mit der OGL als Regelsystem f\u00fcr Third-Party-Produkte, oft kurze kleine PDFs, unter Lizenz verwenden (diese tragen dann das Logo \u201eICONS Compatible\u201c).\n\nW\u00fcrfelmodus und Grundstruktur\nDas System verwendet nur die handels\u00fcblichen \u201enormalen\u201c sechsseitigen W\u00fcrfel (W6), mit den Zahlen von 1 bis 6, keine W\u00fcrfel mit Minus- und Plus-Zeichen oder Sondersymbolen usw.\nDas Icons-System kennt 6 fest vorgegebene Attribute (auf Deutsch: Kampftalent, Koordination, St\u00e4rke, Verstand, Achtsamkeit und Willensst\u00e4rke) und man hat mindestens ein Spezialgebiet (ein Paket von Fertigkeiten und Kenntnissen in Kurzform ausgedr\u00fcckt) und dann die Powers, also Kr\u00e4fte. Die Powers sind nicht \u201efrei erfunden\u201c oder allein vom Spieler benannt (wie oft die FATE-Aspekte), sondern einem Kr\u00e4fte-Kapitel entnommen. Man kann sie sich aussuchen, mit Punkten kaufen oder aber kurzerhand per Zufallstabellen \u201eausw\u00fcrfeln\u201c (was auch die zuerst vorgeschlagene Methode der Charaktererschaffung im Buch ist \u2013 so wei\u00df kein Spieler zu Beginn, welche Superkr\u00e4fte oder F\u00e4higkeiten er bekommt).\nSowohl die 6 Attribute als auch die Kr\u00e4fte funktionieren in den Regeln numerisch auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10, wobei alle Stufen ab 7 als \"super\" gelten und man mit einem blo\u00dfen Attribut ab 7 auch Stunts erzeugen kann. Mit St\u00e4rke also improvisierte St\u00e4rke-Stunts, mit Verstand eben Verstandes-Stunts, mit Achtsamkeit Achtsamkeits-Stunts und alles so weiter, ganz regelm\u00e4\u00dfig.\nSpezialgebiete gehen von 1 bis 3 und werden einem Attribut hinzugez\u00e4hlt, wenn sie gerade in einer bestimmten Situation zu einer Aufgabe passen. Das muss dann nicht immer dasselbe Attribut sein. Aber zum Beispiel: Verstand 5 und Detektiv 2 ergibt effektiv eine Stufe von 7.\nPowers k\u00f6nnen beispielsweise auch in Gegenst\u00e4nden, Werkzeugen und Waffen schlummern. Magische Artefakte und Green Lanterns Ring und Doctor Stranges Mantel sowie der ber\u00fchmte Batman-Werkzeugg\u00fcrtel sind hier also schon mit ber\u00fccksichtigt.\nBei jeder spielrelevanten Aktion w\u00fcrfelt die aktive / angreifende Seite i.d.R. Attribut + 1W6 gegen eine vom SL vorgegebene Schwierigkeitsstufe + 1W6 oder gegen die passive / verteidigende Seite, die ebenfalls Attribut + 1W6 verwendet. Nur auf die Differenz zwischen den beiden Seiten kommt es an. Die h\u00f6here Seite \u201egewinnt\u201c die Aktion oder erzielt zumindest einen Vorteil. Es gibt i.d.R. keine Re-Rolls (wiederholten W\u00fcrfelw\u00fcrfe) und ebenfalls keine explodierenden W\u00fcrfel. Daf\u00fcr gibt es strenggenommen auch keine Kritischen Erfolge oder Patzer. Die Differenz zwischen den beiden Seiten reicht schon aus, um zu bestimmen, wie toll oder wie schlimm etwas wird. Damit gen\u00fcgt im Extremfall sogar schon ein einziger herk\u00f6mmlicher W\u00fcrfel zum Spielen, neben dem Buch, den Charakterbl\u00e4ttern und Stiften zum Notizenmachen.\nMit speziellen Heldenpunkten, die Entschlossenheitspunkte hei\u00dfen (im Original Determination Points), kann man weitere Tricks und Spieleffekte erzeugen: das hei\u00dft, zus\u00e4tzliche Geistesblitze oder Eingebungen haben, eine F\u00e4higkeit f\u00fcr kurze Zeit verst\u00e4rken, einen spektakul\u00e4ren Stunt erzeugen, sich blitzschnell erholen oder wieder aufraffen, eine Situation durch eine \u201eRetcon\u201c anders erkl\u00e4ren und so weiter.\nDie Elemente, die manche Spieler vielleicht als Aspekte aus FATE kennen, hei\u00dfen in Icons \u201eEigenschaften\u201c (engl. Qualities). Diese haben selbst keine Zahlenwerte und dienen einfach als zus\u00e4tzliche kleine Merkmale oder Hintergrundinformationen \u00fcber den Charakter. Sie k\u00f6nnen eventuell auch Beinamen sein (\u201eDer letzte Sohn Kryptons\u201c, \u201eDer Dunkle Detektiv\u201c, \u201eDer Oberste Zauberer\u201c, \u201eDer schnellste Mensch auf Erden\u201c, \u201eDie rothaarige Teufelin mit dem Schwert\u201c ...) oder Ausspr\u00fcche und Zitate (\u201eHeiliger Strohsack!\u201c, \u201eBei Rao!\u201c, \u201eX\u2019Hal!\u201c, \u201eCowabunga!\u201c, \u201eZwo, eins, Risiko!\u201c). Diese kann man dann im Laufe des Spiels durch bestimmte Entscheidungen und Spielz\u00fcge triggern und ausnutzen, manchmal zum Positiven und manchmal zum Negativen.\nDas Regelwerk ist Allgemeinen bewusst lockerer und kompakter aufgebaut als viele andere. Es ist auch knapper geschrieben und fr\u00f6hlicher und verspielter in seinen Illustrationen als beispielweise Mutants and Masterminds, das vom selben Autor stammt. Das Grundregelbuch deckt viel ab, ohne den Leser mit endlosen Textkapiteln zu belasten, die monatelanges Textstudium erfordern und eher vom Spielen abhalten und den einzelnen Spieler wom\u00f6glich entmutigen.\n___________________________________________________________________\nMit ICONS - Die Gesammelte Edition (Assembled Edition) erh\u00e4ltst du alles, was ben\u00f6tigt wird, um praktisch direkt loszulegen ...\nWohin flie\u00dft der KICKSTARTER-Betrag?

We hope you\u2019ll join us on this exciting new adventure!\nThe Crypt in Cadaver Canyon\nThe Crypt in Cadaver Canyon challenges 4-6 2nd level adventurers to save a hidden desert city (along with its cursed inhabitants) from the wrath of a devious and chaotic god. Its 48 digest-sized pages are packed with dangerous environments, exotic threats, and a world-shaking finale with thousands of lives on the line! \nDungeon Crawl Classics RPG adventures are easily adaptable to work in any \u2018old school\u2019 system, so the adventure and additional materials will benefit any GM looking to deliver some classic adventuring to their players, even if DCC isn\u2019t your system of choice!\nThe Sullenlands Adventure Omnibus and Guide\nAt it\u2019s most basic level, the Omnibus will combine all three of Mark\u2019s adventures (Nebin Pendlebrook\u2019s Perilous Pantry, The Frost Fang Expedition, and The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon) into a single beautiful book. As stretch goals are met, the Omnibus will expand to include:\nWorld details: cities, towns, thieves guilds and more!\nNew Monsters\nNew Magic Items\nRandom Encounters and Events\nA new mini-adventure: The Bellows of Bromforge (featuring the amazing artwork of Misinkthrope!)\nAnd more!\nWhen complete, The Sullenlands Adventure Omnibus and Guide will come in at almost 300 digest-sized pages of adventuring goodness, taking your players from zero to 3rd level and beyond! \nStretch Goals\nThis is where things get fun! As your pledges to the campaign mount, we\u2019ll be able to add all sort of cool stuff to the Kickstarter:\n$3000: Stefen Poag will create an awesome cover for The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon!\n$3500: We\u2019ll add The Life in the Sullenlands campaign guide to the Omnibus! \n$4000: Peter Mullens will create a wrap-around cover for the Omnibus!\n$4250: We\u2019ll add paper miniatures for The Crypt in Cadaver Canyon! \n$4500: We\u2019ll include an exciting mini-adventure in the Omnibus: The Bellows of Bromforge (featuring the amazing artwork of Misinkthrope).\n$5000: We\u2019ll include a Dwarf Cleric Class, and a full patron write-up for a Dwarven god Greythaak the Bearded Anvil \n$5500: We\u2019ll add a plethora of fun random tables, including encounters, events, character deaths, names, magic items, and more! \n$6000: We\u2019ll add beautiful, high-resolution Crypt PDF battlemaps by Frank Turfler \n$6500: We\u2019ll add a POD poster code for Peter\u2019s amazing cover for backers in the US. (Since DriveThruRPG only prints posters in the US, International backers will receive a PDF copy of the poster, and a free copy of the 0-level funnel Perils of the Sunken City).\n$7000: We\u2019ll add a POD poster code for Stefan\u2019s amazing cover for backers in the US.

If you back at the Digital Everything level or higher, just let us know in an email (or a comment when you order), and we will add a special bonus short adventure written by Jon Marr to your package that currently isn\u2019t available anywhere else. (If you\u2019re a fan of the Sunken City, you\u2019re going to like this one!) Thanks so much for your continuing support!\n How POD Printing and Shipping Works \nHow does a POD Kickstarter work, exactly? If you pledge at a POD level, you will get emailed a coupon code from DriveThruRPG to be able to purchase the book at only the actual printing cost plus the actual postage. This means no mark up at all. \nAs the printing will be conducted in both the US and UK, the shipping costs should be reasonable for many backers. If you haven\u2019t ordered POD books from DriveThruRPG before, contact us and we can help determine if shipping to your country is possible, and if makes sense financially!\nWe highly recommend ordering all POD titles in one order, as this will cut down on shipping costs considerably! (All the POD codes will be sent to you at the same time). Printing and shipping both books and the stretch goals should likely cost in the range of $12-16 in the US. Many countries will only cost a few dollars more, but some can be significantly more expensive to ship to. Again, just contact us and we can help you make the best choice!\nWant to See the Quality of the Previous Books in the Series?\nCheck out these older videos introducing the print versions of both Nebin Pendlebrook\u2019s Perilous Pantry and The Frost Fang Expedition:\nAbout Purple Sorcerer Games\nWe\u2019ve been creating free Dungeon Crawl Classics tools since the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG beta was released in 2011. Our popular Zero-Level Party Generator has produced millions of characters doomed to be ground up in DCC\u2019s popular funnel adventures, and over the years we\u2019ve added many utilities that thousands of DCC players rely on. (Including the Ennie-Award winning Crawler\u2019s Companion game management app, the Sorcerer\u2019s Grimoire spellbook, utility, the Upper Level Character Generator, and the Mutant Crawl Classics Generator). All of the tools are generously supported by the amazing DCC community each year through a pledge drive that helps pay for server costs, computer expenses,  mobile device acquisition for testing, and much more!\nOnce the DCC RPG was officially released, our adventure Perils of the Sunken City was the first DCC 3rd party adventure published. (Beating Attack of the Frawgs from our good friends at Thick Skull Adventures by a couple days). It was followed by 3 additional Sunken City adventures that were eventually combined into the best-selling Sunken City Adventure Omnibus and Guide: we\u2019re grateful that it continues to be one of the first titles picked up by many players new to DCC!\nWe\u2019ve been lucky to work with some of the best writers in the old school RPG community. In addition to Mark\u2018s adventures mentioned in this Kickstarter, we\u2019ve also published David Baity\u2019s fan-favorite tournament adventure The Carnival of the Damned, and Terry Olson\u2019s thrilling Escape from the Shrouded Fen.\nYou can purchase all of our adventures through DriveThruRPG, and print copies of most titles can be picked up from the extensive Goodman Games Online Store!\nAbout the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG from Goodman Games.

Just open & roll for initiative!\nThe Dungeon Books of Battle Mats are a pair of modular Battle Map Books that combine to give you up to an epic 2\u2019x2\u2019 encounter battle mat while still fitting in your bag and on your bookshelf alongside your rule books. Modular designs line up seamlessly to allow you to form a dungeon for any encounter!

An Endless Dungeon awaits!\nThe Dungeon is a fully modular & complementary pair of Battle Map Books designed to enable you to create a vast number of dungeon battle maps by using different page combinations in the books individually or side by side.     \nFully Laminated throughout and thus wipe clean, every page except the front & back covers is a map so you get the maximum dungeon out of the books!\nTwo Books Laid Out as a 24\" x 24\" Square\nEndless map options, completely flat and fits in a bag or on a bookshelf. Loke BattleMats books boast the 360\u00b0 spine so the books will open and lie dead flat or fold in half along the spine. It also means the books line up flush, level and flat so it plays just like one large map.

The number of tiles is increasing along with any pages unlocked via Stretch Goals for the physical books.\nThis digital collection will also include an adventure module for Dungeon & Dragons 5th Edition that will be set within the designs of the Dungeon books, delivered as a pdf. \nPlease note that shipping for any physical goods will be charged after the Kickstarter ends and at a set rate for your location regardless of how many items you are receiving.

We started designing and printing our own tabletop battle mats 4 years ago and since then we have developed an award winning range of Wargaming/RPG battle mats and accessories in a range of materials.\nWe published our first Battle Map Book in April 2018, and have since published additional fantasy and science fiction volumes. After this we will be designing two modern day, post apocalyptic and cyberpunk themed encounter map books, and we have two additional fantasy volumes ready to release towards the end of the year.\nThis is our 5th Kickstarter for a gaming accessory and our second focused on Battle Mat Books.\nOur Collaborators \nJames Gray, (aka quigonjim), is an illustrator and artist who will be producing the cover art for each of the Dungeon books. Former clients and books include the anthologies Zombies, Robots and Westerns for Accent UK Comics, the Kickstarter backed Amnesia Agents with Jason Cobley and the upcoming Brawler anthology, card art for Oligarchy from Entropic Games and poster and T-Shirt designs for the band Dead Man's Whiskey. He also has a substantial back catalogue of Superbike and MotoGP artworks.   \nJohn (JC) is co-authoring the adventure module along with Matt.\nAnd finally thanks to the Brighton Dice Saloon, our FLGS,  for hosting our video & photo shoot. You can find out more about them here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have identified the following risks, and I outline here how we are managing them:\n\n- Getting the price right\nIt sounds basic but when costing a project there are a lot of things to remember, and they all add to the cost! We have used our experience from 4 successful Kickstarters and having our range in retail & distribution to price our books. We are able to offer our backers a good deal for coming on board early, however we have ensured all the hidden costs, as well as the basics like printing and transport, are covered in our price.\n\n- Delay\nThe first delay risk is what we term \u201cmission slip\u201d! I.e. that the project expands into new areas which add time to deliver. We have a very clear vision of the product we want to deliver, and again we can call on our experience to ensure we deliver it in a timely manner! For example the designs, while they will evolve based on feedback and new designs hopefully added, are very much underway and a long way down the road already.\n\n- Product quality\nThe main risks for producing a book to replace & improve on a standard RPG battle mat is that you end up with a product which has all the disadvantages of both. To avoid this we believe the book must lay flat and must line up next to another book to allow the adventure to flow. We have been designing and producing Battle Map Books since 2018, and we have the experience of our existing, award winning range to testify we know how to make a good battle mat book! Light and portable as well as flat, easy to use (lays flat when opened, just open & roll!) you can back with confidence that we produce the highest quality products.\n\n- Print quality\nBy using our existing printers we know exactly what we are getting, and we can produce any of our existing library as an example of the high quality of their work. We know what is required of our designs in order to produce a work of art, and our printers can deliver it with us \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Fulfilment issues\nShipping thousands of products worldwide can be a daunting prospect, and it is the area which can easily grind a project to a halt. We will be using a fulfilment expert \u2013 GamesQuest \u2013 who are best placed to ship our products in a timely manner. They are experts in their field and able to offer fast effective service so your books will be with you as planned! This also covers risks from Brexit as GamesQuest have contingency plans in place.\n\n- We don\u2019t fund\nThis is the worst case scenario. That we don\u2019t attract enough funding to move forwards. In order to attract backers we will promote this kickstarter heavily prior to launch and throughout its live run. We have a (rather modest) advertising budget for social media and we will be calling on our network of media contacts and online influencers to help us spread the word. We have also added a number of social media goals all aimed at getting word out there far and wide. We prefer to spread the word through the RPG community as opposed to online advertising as it allows us to keep our costs reasonable and deliver more product for the money. This is the approach which has seen us successfully fund 4 previous Kickstarters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Digital Dungeon", "descp": "Receive the dungeon in digital format to print at home or use online.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital dungeon - All designs from the books in digital format\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nD&D5e Adventure module set in The Dungeon (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["477 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Dungeon", "descp": "Get one copy of The Dungeon at \u00a35 less than retail price.\nThe Dungeon is Two Modular 12\"x12\"Books presented as a set.\n*Shipping charged at the one set rate for your location listed on campaign page in shipping section of Kickstarter after campaign ends for any physical goods.

That said, I may have forgotten to rein them in a bit! While we normally aim for a page-count of about 120 for our Pocket RPGs, L.B. and Samantha went above and beyond building this behemoth book that clocks in at more than 300 pages.\nAnd it\u2019s through this Big Eyes, Small Brains boasts:\n6 amazing classes, which include the always-coiffed Combat Maids and Butlers and the shimmering Idols\n9 vast regions to explore, from the Ayakashi-filled Yotsuya, to the glimmering streets of Lancastar, and the small-town neighborhoods of Mitakihara\n32 villains and baddies, that include jack-booted Storm Troopers, steely-eyed Yakuza, and fangirls who will fight literally anything to have senpai notice them.\nOodles of character traits, mecha, and more to make your character stand out\nCooking skills!

Now, I\u2019m compiling them into a glorious hardcover compendium.\nThis limited edition hardcover book contains:\n55 illustrated adventure locations, settlements and wilderness regions\nAdventure summaries and a giant table of hooks & rumors \nA full-color campaign map that puts the adventures in context\nAn illustrated bestiary with more than 90 monsters\nA detailed index of people, places, creatures and things\nCompanion Bestiary PDFs add stats for 5e, B/X and Dungeon World \nEach adventure is lovingly illustrated, and fits on a single page or spread, making it easy use as a one-shot, a drop-in location in your home-grown campaign setting, or a source of ideas for your own creations.\n\"Stop writing adventures and use these\"\u2014Ryan Chaddock, Geek and Sundry\nThe adventures in the book are dungeons, ruined towers, underworld mega-caverns, creepy cult hideouts, treacherous cities, and deadly wilderness regions, all in the same easy-to-reference format. \nMy adventures are inspired by the weather-stained heroism of Middle Earth, the grounded, emotional honesty of Earthsea, and the fantastic whimsey of stories like Rupert Bear.\nThere are classic underground loot grabs, encounters wondrous and weird, terrors from ages past, and apocalyptic showdowns\u201442 adventure sites, 5 danger-filled settlements, and 8 wilderness regions in all. \nEverything is written as tightly as possible, distilled to get the maximum idea density on the page. I don't put in stats, so they're best for games where you can stat on the fly: early editions of D&D, Dungeon World, Torchbearer, Into the Odd, Maze Rats, or World of Dungeons (to name but a few).\n(Update: we have unlocked all four bestiary stretch goals, so backers will now get companion bestiary PDFs with stats for Dungeon World, Basic D&D, and fifth edition D&D!)\nFrom One-Shots to Sandboxes\nEach adventure location is designed for ease of use at your table. They're not stories but scenarios spring-loaded with potential. Whether your players arrive as marauders, explorers, diplomats, or thieves, interesting things will happen.\nMy hope is this book becomes an obvious addition to your emergency GMing kit. When it's an hour before game night and you need a one-shot scenario, pull it the book and send your players into your favorite underground hellhole.\nIf you're planning a mini-campaign, it's easy to snap together several adventures into a short series, by location type or theme using the two-page Adventure Summaries. Descend from the Unmended Way to save Tealwood from the poisons of the Martoi, or stitch together a desert arc out of the Oracle's Decree, the Roots of Ambition, and Lair of the Lantern Worm.\nThere's enough material in the book to pack a sandbox knee deep. I've kept them deliberately light on backstory to make them easy to reskin for your own setting. Even so, there are connecting themes and hidden links between the adventures. If we reach the realm map and gazetteer stretch goals, the adventures come together into a premade sandbox you can play directly from the compendium.\n \"The guy has thought the whole thing out really, really nicely\"\u2014Dean Putney, Boing Boing \n\nDue to overwhelming success of this campaign, the physical compendium will be a high-quality offset print run. It will NOT be a print-on demand book, despite what the reward tier says. (I can't change that, unfortunately!) I have queried the backers, and the response was almost unanimous: offset printing is worth the additional wait.\nEach adventure has been laid out in magnificent landscape, and the whole book is packed with illustrations, start to finish.  \n(An early POD test print; not the final cover nor the final print process.)\nThe book is 112 pages, without stretch goals, and includes:\n 48 adventures, reformatted, revised for clarity, and re-edited\n Ten of the adventures have been expanded to an extra page \ntwo pages of adventure summaries so you can quickly find the perfect adventure\na detailed index of people, places, demigods and monsters that reveals the hidden links between the adventures\nup to 46 pages of stretch goals are planned, which would bring the book to 160 pages \nArmed with this material, you'll be able to quickly prep for one-shots on a moment's notice, drop fantastic encounter sites into your hex map, or dig into the world behind the words.\nAs well as compiling previously published adventures, the book includes a special scenario, A Clutch of Shadows, in which a Grinvolt garrison desperately holds a captured Dradkin sun temple against counter-attack from below.\nUnfortunately, the garrison is running out of funds\u2014and allies\u2014and treachery is everywhere. Smugglers move underworld contraband past the noses of the Grinvolt axewives, dradkin infiltrators from below move among the camps. Worst of all, Flametender Gathana's foolhardy dabbling will bring ruin to everyone.\nEveryone who backs this campaign will immediately receive the two-page Clutch of Shadows PDF. so they know what they're getting into. See the backer-only update.\nThis campaign has three tiers. If you just want to dip your toe in, pledge $1 CAD and follow along the campaign. You'll get immediate access to the Clutch of Shadows adventure location PDF, and you'll get all the updates as the campaign plunges down into the dradkin fortress (see below).\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter \nThis is the all digital rewards pledge tier. For $12 CAD (about $9 USD), you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nAccess to all unlocked stretch goals (see below) in PDF form\nThis is the limited edition hardcover compendium tier. By pledging $66 CAD (about $49 USD) plus shipping, you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nA copy of the hardcover Compendium \nAll of the stretch goals that we unlock throughout the campaign (see below)\nIf you back at this tier, the hardcover book will be shipped to your address in Canada, the USA, UK, EU countries, Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Malaysia, Australia or New Zealand. \nMy plan is to run this campaign lean and mean, with sensible stretch goals that don't add a lot of risk to the project. I'd much rather you get your book quickly, so I can be back at this in a few years with more amazing material for you.\nMy main goal is paying everyone more. I've worked out a roughly proportional system with my contributors, based on the time and effort we've each put into the content. As the campaign clears its costs, the extra money will be divided up among us venal goblins to be used for good or ill.\nEven so, there are some very fun things waiting to be unlocked, my dear backers!\nStretch Goals (EVERYTHING HAS BEEN UNLOCKED!)\n UNLOCKED: An entirely new adventure, set in the aftermath of the Kickstarter campaign\n UNLOCKED: A campaign map that welds the adventures into a ready-made setting\n UNLOCKED x6!!: Two-page regional gazetteers, detailing the world section-by-section\n UNLOCKED: A short history of the lands, the underworld, and magic\n UNLOCKED: A complete bestiary of the 90+ monsters described in the adventures\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with Dungeon World stats \n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with OSR stats \n UNLOCKED: A giant table of hooks and rumors for one-shots and campaign clues\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with 5e stats! \n UNLOCKED: A map pack PDF, all the maps so you can show them to your players!\nFor details, read on! \nI did my stretch goals a little differently than some campaigns. Every time a campaign milestone was hit, it unlocked a random stretch goal. That's right, it's random. Every time a milestone is reached, I'll grab my dice and figure out which stretch goal unlocks!\nThing is, we blasted through them all. Only two formerly-random goals remain, two more two-page gazetteer entries. After that, there is one final goal. \nAll dollar amounts CAD\nThe funding milestones are hit based on the overall Kickstarter funding level. Each one unlocks a random stretch goal.\nThere are also two social media milestones, each of which revealed a dread turn of events in the 'Axewives Assemble' scenario (see below) in addition to unlocking random stretch goals. \nAs the Kickstarter campaign hits its milestones, I will reveal a new adventure map, unique to this Kickstarter campaign. Not only will it be a location, but we'll actually play it out during the campaign.\nThe dour warriors of Grinvolt have realized their position in the captured dradkin Sun Temple is untenable. The dradkin are preparing for counter-attack, and if they succeed, every life lost in taking the temple will have been for nothing. Using the last of his clout, Quarter-Lord Counobel sends word for every axewife still loyal to Grinvolt to come forth and join the battle. \"We descend!\"\nEvery backer of this campaign represents a soldier in the assault. Once the Kickstarter campaign is underway, I will reveal an illustration of the long stair down to the dradkin fortress, and the first of deadly preparations that await the forces of Grinvolt.\nWe will play out the battle that follows in the comments and updates! \nSocial Media Milestones\nAs mentioned above, two of the milestones are social media milestones. As well as unlocking stretch goals, they also have terrible effects on the battle. \nAfter the campaign, I'm taking the fully revealed map and turning it into one last adventure location for the book, representing the aftermath of the battle. Those of you who fought will have been there during the battle, but what remains afterwards?\nWill it be held proudly by Grinvolt, a beacon against the darkness of the underworld and a staging area into the Ur-Menig and beyond? Or will it be a warren of night-dark tunnels, slippery with the blood of fallen warriors? That all depends on the campaign!\nFor centuries, the Seree were the undisputed masters of the lands. But where did they come from? What did they learn, and where did they go? The Dradkin remember.\nA trove of learning has fallen into the hands of the Grinvolt force. The compendium now includes a six-page appendix describing the lands, the rise and fall of the Martoi, the Seree, and their war with the gods. The nature of the heavens and the earth themselves is revealed!\n\nI will be adding a giant table of hooks and rumors to the compendium. There will be six hooks for each adventure in the book, 294 hooks in all!\nPlanning a one-shot of Stellarium of the Vinteralf, but not sure what to tell your players about why they're there? Roll d6 or just choose among that adventure's hooks.\nDid your PCs just find a dusty old map, dusty old tome, or a dusty old tinker with a loose tongue and you need an adventure lead to spill? Roll on the full table and\u2014presto\u2014you have an instant connection to more adventure! \nEven though each adventure in the compendium is independent from the others, and meant for reskinning to homegrown settings, an implied setting has taken shape over the years. I've slowly been adding the adventures to a 'big map' that situates the adventures.\nThis map welds the adventures into a pre-built, open-world sandbox setting you can play directly from the compendium.\nIf I roll this stretch goal, the big map goes into the compendium as a full-color, full-page illustration. I'll add two versions to the book\u2014one with the adventure locations called out, and a player-safe version with only the place names, so you can share it with your adventurers.\n\n\nEach time this goal is rolled it unlocks a gazetteer entry of one of the regions of the land where the adventures are nominally set\u2014places like Strielund, the Border Lands, Claimsun of dead gods, the far blightlands from Curselake to Firevault, and cavernous Ur-Menig below them all.\nThe gazetteers build on the connecting themes between the adventures: the fractured political landscape of the north coast; lost Tealwood that slumbers under the poisons of the Martoi; the ecological warfare along the Pelaago plateau.\nEach regional gazetteer will be done up as a two-page spread, digging into the people, settlements and politics, food, wildlife, and wilderness of the area. Random tables will make it easy to use in play, with just enough text to put the results in context.\nIf your players just want to know where they can get a hot bowl of river-cabbage soup for their troubles, you'll be ready!\nWith the Dradkin laboratory breached, the Grinvolt force has won their accumulated lore. There are more than 90 new stocks, beasts, demons, animals, and aliens from the adventures, and the Dradkin Chimeromancers know them all. The compendium now includes a 20-page bestiary appendix that describes each and every one of them.\nWith this goal unlocked, the inestimable Johnstone Metzger is writing Dungeon World stats for the monsters in the bestiary! These will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nBrave warriors have allowed Johnstone Metzger to produce B/X-style stats for the bestiary! This bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nNow that we've hit $65,000 in funding, Jen Adcock is busy at work producing 5e stats for the monsters in the bestiary! The 5e-compatible bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG!  \n\nSince we've hit $80,000 CAD, all PDF and Hardcover tier backers will get a separate PDF with all the adventure location maps!\nI'll give them a once-over in Photoshop so there are no secret doors, people or monsters. This is a PDF of clean, full-size map illustrations that you can print for player hand-outs, share them on your virtual table top, or restock yourself with crazed margin notes!\nThis book would be much smaller were it not for the timely efforts of a creative bunch of collaborators and co-conspirators!\nMichael Prescott (writing, layout, illustration)\nI've been publishing Trilemma Adventures for five years, and was fortunate enough to be a winner in the One Page Dungeon Contest in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

I've had many people helping me, but at the moment I'm holding all the strings to get this thing shipped. I'm in good health, but if I'm eaten by meebs, that will be hard to overcome.\n\nI've done my best to reduce project risk to a minimum. With the exception of the 'Aftermath' adventure, all of the adventures are written, laid out and assembled, ready for final proof-reading.\n\nThe most likely risk is schedule delays arising from hitting all of the stretch goal milestones. To reduce this risk, three of the stretch goals already exist the first draft stage, and are about to go to editing. (You know, optimism.)\n\nThere are three remaining contributions required from outside parties: editing (which is required to ship the book), a dozen pieces of layout-supporting art (same), and the system stats stretch goals (which are shipped later as PDFs).\n\nDTRPG shipping can be lengthy, so if print-related errors (bleed, weird colors, etc.) are found in the test print, this could add several weeks to delivery of books to backers.\n\nMy editor (Andrew Young) has worked with me for several years; I'm able to produce the necessary art myself, and stretch goal PDF production has already begun. All other contributions are already squared away in the book.\n\nA risk to backers is complications in printing. I've selected the highest-quality option that DTRPG can produce, and I'm completely satisfied with the test prints I've received so far, but since DTRPG fulfills directly to backers, I won't see the actual books as they go out.\n\nAdditionally, as DTRPG produces each book at the closest print center to the shipping address, books for some backers will be manufactured at sites whose output I can't directly observe.\n\nA final risk to backers comes from shipping, either from damage in transit, goods never delivered, import duties if DTRRPG prints from somewhere other than where you live, or the wild card complications arising from Brexit.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Axe Friend", "descp": "Join the Axewives of Grinvolt in the assault into the Dradkin fortress below the Sun Temple.

It's up to you to make them wrong again! \nThe Great Old Ones reach out from the future and into their past\u2014our present\u2014corrupting the timeline such that events and individuals turn towards the apocalyptic and lead to their inevitable rise. A small and battered resistance effort mounted by time-travelers and present-day heroes stands in their way.\nYou are those one-way travelers from a dark future and their crucial allies from the present day, working together to save the human race from looming apocalypse. Armed with foreknowledge of Judgment Day, you must succeed at a series of vital missions aimed at restoring hope to the future. \nBut the clock is ticking. The corrupting influence of the Great Old Ones is sure to affect you before the end, twisting you slowly and inexorably into something alien and unrecognizable. \nCan you defeat the vast unknowable evils of the Great Old Ones before you become a monster yourself? Find out in Fate of Cthulhu, a new stand-alone tabletop roleplaying game from Evil Hat Productions!\nAre you already a backer? Go to this backers-only post and download the prototype\u2014a completely-playable PDF of Fate of Cthulhu\u2014right now! \nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Fate of Cthulhu through them? Encourage your FLGS to back this Kickstarter at the Retailer Ally level. (If you're in the UK or EU, Leisure Games has up a page for folks interested in preordering the book. See our Shipping section further below for other options as well.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFate of Cthulhu is a stand-alone game powered by the Fate Core system from Evil Hat Productions. It will be around 256 pages in length, featuring color art in 6\"x9\" hardcover and digital PDF formats and a whole lot of tentacles (so, so many tentacles).\nThe idea for Fate of Cthulhu started with a simple question: what if Cthulhu operated like Skynet? In this game you'll face down Mythos-style threats with Terminator-style action and adventure, whether as a present-day Sarah Connor type, or an agent from the future already facing the creeping effects of corruption. This is Lovecraftian roleplaying made new again, with time-traveling operatives from a future apocalypse journeying back to the present day to warn others of the coming danger (and recruit them) to try to set the timeline on a new and hopefully better course.\nYou'll discover whether they succeed, and whether or not their success will lead to salvation or some fresh new horror, throughout the course of play. The future changes with each move the heroes make, the Old Ones always pushing back with their own dire countermoves, both inflicting new ripples on the timeline. Sometimes the best you can hope for is a less awful apocalypse\u2014but somewhere out beyond the dark roiling clouds and tentacle-lashed landscape of mankind's ruin, there is a glimmer of hope, thanks to your sacrifices.\nAnd the sacrifices will be many. To fight the tentacular and squamous, operatives must become so themselves. Through time travel itself or exposure to Old One threats during their missions, characters will gain strange new abilities and bizarre new anatomies as they absorb more corruption into their own flesh and psyches. In time, they might twist so far they become lost, turning into new agents of the Old Ones themselves... with any luck, they'll have a good friend nearby to put them down when it happens.\nDoes Terminator action with Lovecraftian style sound interesting to you? Learn more about Fate of Cthulhu in this Techraptor interview: PK Sullivan and Stephen Blackmoore on Fate of Cthulhu and Punching Elder Gods \nA corruption clock that fills up as you sacrifice more of your humanity to power or gain monstrous abilities (supercharged stunts), slowly transforming your character's aspects into new, corrupted versions of themselves.\nA system for tracking key events leading up to the apocalypse that the players change through their actions and choices during play, including support for ripple effects and time paradoxes.\nModifications to stress and concession rules, including support for heroic last stands that sacrifice a character but help turn the timeline towards a better outcome.\nA rituals and spells system that offers great power at a cost, treating spells as secrets of arcane Elder technology that must be sought out in play.\n Five detailed example timelines plus rules for running them and making your own.\nThe full Fate Core game system condensed to about 50 pages but still supporting the standard Core skill list, stunt building, and more.\nFate is a system focused on story, where both success and failure help to create interesting moments for players and characters. Fate models fiction, not physics. In Fate it's as much about the choices your time-traveling agents face and the story consequences of those choices, for good or ill, as it is about those visceral, dangerous fights to save the human race. (You'll get plenty of both.)\nDo you sacrifice more of your humanity to gain the abilities you need to fight the Great Old One's minions? Or do you hold on to what makes you human and avoid turning into the very monsters you fight? When you choose to stick with or go off of your mission, how does it affect the future's timeline? Fate helps generate drama by pushing play toward answering these questions.\nThat's right: you don't need to buy any other books to play Fate of Cthulhu, though you're welcome to grab other Fate products and cross-pollinate with this one. \nFate is a nimble rules-light system that uses 4 six-sided dice and a pool of tokens to advance the narrative. While you can use standard d6's or poker chips if that's your jam, we do offer our own Fate Dice\u2122 and Fate Points\u2122 which you can grab as part of the Equipment Cache and Well-Equipped Elder God Squad reward levels. We put a lot of thought into the design of these items. If you love dice and game accessories as much as we do, you'll be very happy to put these on your table top!\nThe Prototype PDF: As a backer of this project, you get immediate access to the current version of the PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes (click here, or see the link under the video up top). We want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you're new to RPGs. The prototype PDF still lacks a lot of art and a few other finishing touches, but there's enough there for you to get started playing right now.\nThe Completed PDF(s): Backers at $20 and up will receive the final, art-complete PDF as soon as it's ready (after we get all the missing art made). They will also receive all digital stretch goals which are unlocked during the course of this campaign.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $35 and higher will receive one (or more, depending) copy of the 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover, color interior book with 256 pages and a matte finish on the cover. Will ship before the end of the year. You can increase your pledge by $35 for each additional copy you want to receive. Backers at this level also receive PDF copies of the final book and any digital stretch goals which are unlocked.\nYour choice of Fate Dice\u2122: Some of our reward tiers let you pick one of our 12-packs of Fate Dice\u2122. We offer them in a wide variety of styles (including our popular and on-theme Eldritch set). They're $15 each, so if you want some extra packs, just increase your pledge amount appropriately.\nA set of Fate Points\u2122: This past year we released our branded Fate Points\u2122 tokens, which are included on some of our reward tiers. They come 30 to a pack for $12. Want more points? Increase your pledge in $12 increments.\n\nIf you want to add any of the above items after the campaign's over, we'll make that possible with BackerKit (see \"Shipping and Fulfillment,\" below).\n UNLOCKED!\nOur first stretch goal is all about adding some extra bells and whistles to the book and showing you some horrific gratitude to boot. \nWhen we hit this goal at $30,000 the Digital Apocalypse package (available to backers at $20 and up) gets its first new items:\nA PDF of the Fate Horror Toolkit (great for use with Fate of Cthulhu!)\nA PDF of the Fate Adversary Toolkit (also great!)\n High-resolution digital wallpaper of the book's cover art to haunt your digital workspace\nThe hardcover book will get some extra bits of polish and chrome too, to up the luxe factor: \nSpot-gloss effects for the cover (similar to what we've done with gloss accents on Blades in the Dark and Scum and Villainy)\nPrinted endpapers (those are the usually-blank sheets of paper that line the inside of the cover of the book) that'll showcase the cover artwork without logos and text covering up its portentious doom\nWe'll also be able to increase the size of our initial print run and hire a professional indexer to make sure the final book's index is top notch!\nIn addition to all the above, there's a community component to this stretch goal: we'll commit to providing an open-licensable version of the system components of the game (with our setting and Cthulhu derived IP taken out, for hopefully obvious reasons). By and large, this will be a \"condensed Fate Core\" plus a couple other bells and whistles, but we think there's potentially some real value in that. Til now, Fate Accelerated has been the primary \"condensed Fate\" for folks to build their third-party Fate games from; the 50-pages-or-so version we have in Fate of Cthulhu cleaves more strongly to Fate Core's defaults, while still leaving a lot of room for original content for folks looking to build their own stand-alone Fate games. \nUNLOCKED! At $75,000 we'll add a partial preview of the Fate Accessibility Toolkit to the Digital Apocalypse package available to backers at $20 & up. See Update #8 for details on this stretch.\nUNLOCKED! At $85,000 we'll provide EPUB and Kindle formats along with our PDFs for backers receiving the Digital Apocalypse package at $20 & up. See Update #8 for details.\nStarting at $40,000 and at each $10,000 increment afterwards up to $100k, we'll expand the Digital Apocalypse package to include a new timeline by a new author, to expand your options for play. As we get closer to these goals, we'll fill you in on which Elder Gods and other doomsday threats we have for you to face.\nEach timeline will run about 24-or-so pages of material, including several new pieces of art in each. Funding for each goal will cover the writing, editing, system development, layout, art direction, artwork, and digital release costs.\nWe've lined up a diverse set of authors to uncover new dimensions of terror for you and your friends to take on.

You see what we did there.\nWe've put $20,000 of our own money into getting Fate of Cthulhu to this point. With your help we'll cross the remaining distance and get this off to press as soon as possible.\nWe already have the preliminary layout done (backers can take a look at that right now\u2014check out the linked graphic right underneath the video, up top), which includes some of the art. We'll need to give a few months for artists to finish up the rest, starting once the campaign concludes in May, if not sooner. \nThen it's off to the presses for manufacture. One advantage of Kickstarting is that it allows us to size that print run like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge\u2014just right. Our printer usually takes 2-3 months to turn around a book, although that timeline\u2019s dependent on their availability. We\u2019ve added some cushion to our delivery estimates, and we\u2019re confident that we will ship this before the end of the year. We hope to beat that estimate, of course, but when it comes to book production it's best to put a buffer into your schedule. \nYou can be confident that we'll ship on or before our estimated delivery date, because that's been our consistent track record across a dozen other campaigns in the last seven years. Just ask our backers; we keep our promises. Our two most recent campaigns, Uprising: The Dystopian RPG and Tachyon Squadron, shipped within four months of conclusion. We've got a bit more to do here on the artwork front, but we're still very far along in the process, and we're confident we have all the remaining time-factors well in hand. For Evil Hat, it's not so much Kickstarter, as Kickfinisher.\nStretch goals have a separate production timeline. We consider them truly extra content, and that means we don't start production on the stretch goals until after they fund. We may adjust the planned goal order behind the scenes as we learn what the backers are most interested in. \nWe're excited to see what you unlock! Once the campaign concludes we'll put together a plan for getting the funded goals done. There are a lot of moving parts to coordinate (writing, system development, editing, layout, art direction, and artwork), but since these are digital-only they're not vulnerable to any manufacturing hiccups.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up their rewards.  \nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll have the option to add on some items via BackerKit, tho for our sanity (already taxed by exposure to the dread gods) the selection will be limited. If there's something you want to have shipped along with your rewards that we don't list, just reach out and let us know.\nBased on our average shipping cost scenario in the USA, we've set up shipping costs like so:\nFor book-only shipments we're charging a flat $7 shipping fee (media mail + handling costs) for USA addresses. \nFor shipments including dice and tokens that goes up to $12 (priority mail + handling costs). \nHere\u2019s the sad part: we\u2019re only able to offer shipping to the USA. Our shipping options outside of the country would cost more than the actual book in most cases (and would badly distort the funding model we're using for this campaign). However, every reward offered in this Kickstarter will be available to our international fans.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options:\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, use a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address and then get packages delivered to it, to you. Those costs will still likely be below what we could offer!\nBack the KS at the Digital Apocalypse and get all of the digital rewards that way.\nBack the KS at $10 to get access to the prototype version of the game. Later, buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution (we sell to a variety of international distributors in Canada, the UK, Europe, and Australia). Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately.\nWait and buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution. Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately. \nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list (like with Leisure Games, see below) so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. Without this kind of communication, the chances that a store will order enough quantities for you to be able to get a copy from them go down significantly.\nLeisure Games has a page up for people in the UK or EU who are interested in preordering the hardcover. https://leisuregames.com/pages/fate-of-cthulhu \nText length limits have forced us to move our creators' bios off of this page and into a separate document!

We've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Fate of Cthulhu is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2019 and 2020. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Fate of Cthulhu to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run two or more Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 12+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

The game is intentionally rules-light, putting the focus of play on imagination, improvisation, and fun. The rules are optimised for ease of use at the table, with meticulous attention to wording and layout clarity. What's more, Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the classic Basic/Expert game from 1981, meaning that decades of adventure are at your fingertips!\nOld-School Essentials comes in two forms: a chunky tome and a modular boxed set. The content is identical. Choose one or both, depending on your preferred format!\nThe first two Old-School Essentials supplements \u2014 adding extra classes, spells, and combat options \u2014 will be available as optional add-ons in BackerKit (following the completion of the Kickstarter)!\nDigital mock-ups. Final products may vary. Some new cover art in progress.\nSee below for in-depth info on all products!\nPDFs\nAll books will also be produced as extensively hyperlinked PDFs. Once the Kickstarter has finished, backers will get early access to PDFs in their current, near-finished forms. Once all artwork is in place and everything is finalised, the final PDFs will be sent out to backers.\nFree Basic Rules PDF: To whet your appetite for this game, you can download a free PDF, featuring the basic rules for creating characters, adventuring in dungeons, combat, magic, and spells. Includes the complete rules for four classic fantasy character classes: the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.\nKiller Features of Old-School Essentials\nUsability: Old-School Essentials is meticulously edited and laid out, with the aim of maximising ease of reference during play. No more searching for references scattered across multiple pages. No more scanning dense paragraphs of text to pick out details. Everything in Old-School Essentials is logically organised and collated, and presented in a quick-to-read format based on \"control panels\" \u2014 two-page spreads presenting a single topic in its entirety. (See page examples below or check out the free Basic Rules.)\nModularity: The rules of Old-School Essentials are divided into \"modules\" \u2014 cleanly separated chunks of related content. For example, the core rules of the game are cleanly separated from the rules for the classic fantasy character classes. This makes it simple to swap out any of the modular components of the game's rules with alternatives \u2014 perfect for referees who love to customise and tweak. We have lots of plans for further rules modules in the Old-School Essentials line, building on the core rules to take the game into a myriad of different settings and genres, from science fantasy to post-apocalyptic to sword and sorcery.\nConvenience: All books are produced in handy A5 (Digest) size for convenient use at the table. The small, modular books in the Black Box make it easy to find what you need. Want to look up a spell? Just grab the book of spells. No need to navigate a big tome to find the right section.\nQuality: We're set to produce the Old-School Essentials books at a deluxe level of quality \u2014 hardcovers with sewn bindings. These will be beautiful and seriously durable books!\nCompatibility: Old-School Essentials is a 100% accurate restatement of the original Basic/Expert rules (B/X), with nothing added, changed, or removed. All material written for the B/X rules over the last 38 years can be used with Old-School Essentials, without any conversion effort whatsoever!\nRefinement: The original Basic/Expert game presents a wondrously solid rules set, but the rules are not without areas of confusion and contradiction. All known omissions, contradictions, and areas of confusion have been carefully ironed out in Old-School Essentials.\nBen Milton of Questing Beast\nBen's video review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nQuesting Beast Patreon\n\nThilo Graf of Endzeitgeist\nThilo's in-depth reviews of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nEndzeitgeist Patreon\n\nSave or Die Podcast\nSave or Die review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\n\nA box full of adventure to fire up your nostalgia to the max! The Old-School Essentials core rules plus four rules modules for creating characters and running adventures in the classic fantasy genre. Each of the five books in the Black Box is described below.\nCore Rules\n72-page A5 hardcover\nThe core rules of the game, including procedures for: creating characters; exploring dungeons, the wilderness, and the high seas; combat, hazards, and challenges; retainers, hirelings, and vehicles; adventure design; magic, monsters, and treasures.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules are carefully designed to be applicable to a multitude of fantastic campaign settings and genre conventions, from Classic Fantasy to Post-Apocalyptic to Sword and Planet. Just add a book of genre rules and you're ready for adventure!\nA spread from the adventure design section\nClassic Fantasy: Genre Rules\n40-page A5 hardcover\nOptions for classic fantasy characters: classes, equipment, vehicles, hirelings, strongholds, and more. Play as a devout cleric or a sagacious magic-user, a doughty fighter or a cunning thief, a surly dwarf, a noble elf, or a homesick halfling. This book contains all character options from the Basic/Expert game.\nFull rules for character advancement to 14th level.\nThe dwarf class \u2014 all on one spread\nClassic Fantasy: Cleric and Magic-User Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\nAll 106 magic spells that can be used by clerics, magic-users, and elves, ranging from 1st to 6th level.

Includes full encounter tables by dungeon level and wilderness terrain type. This book contains all monsters from the Basic/Expert game.\nT-rex, unicorn, and vampire\nClassic Fantasy: Treasures\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by the referee\nA hoard of classic magic items, encompassing enchanted weapons and armour; magic wands, staves and rods; magical scrolls, rings, and potions; and the plethora of weird and wondrous items that don't fit into any of those categories! Includes full rules for sentient swords. This book contains all magic items from the Basic/Expert game.\nRules for sentient swords\nFor those who prefer all of their RPG rules in one book, rather than divided into modules \u2014 this is what you've been waiting for! Everything that's in the Black Box, combined into a single 256-page, A5 (Digest sized), hardcover tome.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules plus all of the classic fantasy genre content, all in one meaty hardcover book.

The final retail price will be \u20ac30.\nThere's Also a Super-Deluxe Limited Edition!\nIn conjunction with our manufacturer, we're delighted to be able to offer a super-deluxe and highly limited edition of the Rules Tome, only available to backers of this Kickstarter!\nThe limited edition book will be wrapped in luxurious black leatherette, and foil stamped with the Old-School Essentials logo plus a design based on the cover illustration. (We'll post updates on that design as work on the cover illustration progresses.\n\nThe Rules Tome and the Black Box present a loving restatement of the classic Basic/Expert rules from the 1980s. But this is just the beginning of the Old-School Essentials line \u2014 we have many more books in the works, taking the game into a vista of different worlds and genres.\nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will also be producing a pair of hotly anticipated books to add Advanced magic and character options to your games! These new options are inspired by the beloved Advanced rules from the 1970s, and carefully scaled to mesh smoothly with the lower Basic/Expert levels of power and rules complexity.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Genre Rules\n56-page A5 hardcover\nThis book adds:\n 9 new human classes: acrobat, assassin, barbarian, bard, druid, illusionist, knight, paladin, ranger.\n 6 new demihuman race-classes: drow, duergar, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, svirfneblin.\nOptional rules for choosing race and class separately.\nAdvanced rules for poisons, combat options, and more.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Druid and Illusionist Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\n106 new spells that can be used by bards, druids, gnomes, and illusionists, ranging from 1st to 6th level.\nMore Advanced Fantasy Books...\nWe plan to continue expanding Old-School Essentials with more Advanced books, bringing in monsters and magic items inspired by the Advanced rules.\n\nDeluxe Quality\nAll books in these deluxe editions will be high quality hardcovers with sewn bindings. In addition to their high durability, a great thing about books with a sewn binding is that they can lay open flat!\nWhat's more, we have stretch goals lined up for extra trimmings, to further increase the quality of these books. See below for more info on what we have planned, if the initial funding goal is surpassed.\nThe Team\nWondering who's behind all of this? Allow us to elucidate:\nGavin Norman: Author of Old-School Essentials (and formerly B/X Essentials), co-creator and principle author of the critically acclaimed Dolmenwood campaign setting, and founder of Necrotic Gnome. Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, editing, and layout.\nAndrew Walter: Visual genius behind a vista of weirdness, including Dolmenwood and Troika! Andrew's flights of imaginative fantasy feature on the covers of the five books in the Black Box. Four of these are complete (as shown in the product mock-up above). Andrew is now working on a completely new cover for the Core Rules book in the Black Box.\nPeter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter is working on a brand new piece that will grace the cover of the Black Box and the Rules Tome, and full 4-panel art for the front of the referee screen!\nStefan Poag: Prolific and beloved creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others. Stefan created the cover art for the Advanced Fantasy rules modules.\nInterior artists: A crack team of artists is tackling the interior illustration of the books, including: Luka Rejec, Matt Ray, Michael Clarke, Alex Mayo, Tom Kilian, Sean Poppe, Kyle Latino, Thomas Novosel.\nPlus full-colour art plates by: Thomas Denmark, Rachel Quinlan, Jon Hodgson, Olivia Politz, Tom Kilian, Sam Mameli, Emma Lazauski.\nWhat's This About 1981?\nThe 1981 Basic/Expert Fantasy Adventure Game sets (also known as B/X) have experienced a vibrant renaissance over the last decade. Many players have returned to (or discovered for the first time!) the simple rules and imaginative open space of the Basic/Expert game, with the focus on ease of play, adventure, wonder, and mystery.\nRenewed interest in this vintage game has led to the creation of a wide array of retro-clones: games that restate or are inspired by the rules of the Basic/Expert sets. In fact, the B/X rules (and games based on them) are the most popular rules in use in the old-school gaming scene.\nOld-School Essentials is exactly such a retro-clone, and we're immensely proud to be a part of the renaissance of these beloved rules.\n100% Rules Accuracy\nThe material in the Black Box and the Rules Tome forms a complete retelling of the classic Basic/Expert rules, including all of the classic fantasy classes, spells, monsters, and treasures.\nOld-School Essentials has been developed with equal measures of love and precision. The ultimate aim of this project is to produce as accurate as possible a restatement of the revered B/X rules, while improving the structure and presentation, and fixing errors and contradictions in the original rules. (For those with a passion for rules archaeology, this document describes all the areas of the Basic/Expert rules which are clarified in Old-School Essentials.)\nThe resulting books are the product of over two years of meticulous research, rules archaeology, and discussion.\nA Single Optional Addition \u2014 Ascending Armour Class\nModern iterations of the world's most popular RPG use an Armour Class system where AC values start at 10 and go up. This is known as Ascending Armour Class. (The default Armour Class system in B/X has AC starting at 9 and going down, known as Descending Armour Class.)\nFor those more familiar or comfortable with Ascending Armour Class, this optional rule has been fully integrated into Old-School Essentials. All AC ratings are presented in a dual format, for example: AC 7 [12].\nThis is the single rule we've added to the game that is not present in the original Basic/Expert rules, and it is strictly optional \u2014 Descending AC remains the default.\n\n\u20ac16,000 \u2013 Purist Character Sheet [UNLOCKED]\nDesigned by Gavin Norman.

That said, Necrotic Gnome has been relentlessly producing high quality old-school content since 2012. The team behind Old-School Essentials is by no means new to producing games! We are renowned for our communicative and transparent development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Rules Tome and the books in the Black Box is 100% finished. The layout of all books is done. The cover art for most of the books is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast.\n\nThe box manufacturer isn't someone we've worked with before, so that is a slight unknown, but in case of an utter fall-through in communication, we have a second box manufacturer lined up.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, the majority of them are designed such that they will not add delays to the production and fulfillment of the main campaign goals:\n\u2022 The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time. (They just cost extra!)\n\u2022 The referee screen (as noted above) will be shipped separately from the books / box, so any unexpected delays in development there will not delay the whole project.\n\u2022 Development of all the digital stretch goals (character sheet PDFs, the rules reference website, etc.) likewise does not impact the delivery of the books / box.\n\nThe stretch goals that require additional print production (the Advanced books and the introductory adventure) are the main extras that could, in principle, cause delays. However, all of those products are already written. They just need to be laid out and illustrated. This extra work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Halfling", "descp": "PDF of the Rules Tome.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Sprite", "descp": "PDFs of all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Gnome", "descp": "PDFs of the Rules Tome and all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["321 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Fighter", "descp": "The Rules Tome \u2014 at the special Kickstarter price!\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["658 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Dwarf", "descp": "The limited edition, foil stamped, leatherette cover Rules Tome.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited super-deluxe Rules Tome with stamped leatherette cover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Magic-User", "descp": "The Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["582 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "Elf", "descp": "The Rules Tome plus the Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["603 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "Retail Fighter", "descp": "Five copies of the Rules Tome for retail.

Both books will be 128+ pages in PDF and Print On Demand.\n\nWhat\u2019s in The Umerican Road Atlas?\nThe Umerican Road Atlas takes you all over this irradiated land and shows you what\u2019s what. Written by Reid San Filippo and Bob Brinkman, this book includes:\nInteresting Places to Die\nInfamous Gangs of the Wastes\nThe Random Gang Generator\n New Vehicle Rules: construction and military vehicles\n New Classes: holy roller, hunter, and road hawg\nNew Vehicular-based Mighty Deeds\n\nWhat\u2019s in Umerica Unnatural?\nUmerica is a place full of weird supernatural mysteries, and Umerica Unnatural covers them all. Written by Reid San Filippo and Forrest Aguirre, this book includes:\nRevised and Expanded Psionic rules\n Grimoire of the Wastes:  over a dozen new spells for wizards and clerics\n New Classes: wasteland psion, psi mutant, beastkin, shifter\n Cache of Astonishing Salvage: new equipment and artifacts of technology, magic, and just plain weirdness\n The Goal (WHAT\u2019S THE MONEY FOR, BUB?) \nThe plan is to produce at least two books with color covers and black and white interiors in both PDF and Print on Demand (POD) formats (available at DriveThruRPG, Amazon, and Lulu). Both books will be 128+ pages in length.\nWhat is the money for? The writing is well underway but it still needs get a full proofreading, professional layout, and a lot more awesome art put into it. Some of this is already in the works but the funds from this Kickstarter will be essential to finishing this project.\nHow does a POD Kickstarter work, exactly? If you pledge at a POD level, you will get emailed a coupon code from DriveThruRPG to be able to purchase the book at only the actual printing cost plus the actual postage. This means NO MARK UP at all! You\u2019ll still get the books cheaper than retail!\nAs the printing will be conducted in both the USA and UK, the shipping costs should be reasonable for many backers.\nIf you\u2019re still in doubt as to the quality of the work or you\u2019re not sure if the books are what you need for your game, the first update for this Kickstarter is a backers-only preview of both books\u2026 over 30+ pages each! Is it worth a $1 pledge to find out what your money will get you? Of course it is.\nHere\u2019s where things get really exciting.

A small pond, its surface decorated with lily pads with lilies in bloom. Small colorful stones decorate the pond\u2019s shoreline, water bugs swim like ballerinas dancing over glass. Then, quite suddenly, a spark of blue light flashes above the water and a Water Fairy is born. She flies around, happy at her own arrival. An Air Fairy swoops down from the sky to welcome the new Water Fairy, and they begin a dance of joy. \nAbout Fairies\nFairies: A Role Playing Game lets you experience the life of a fairy in a fictional version of earth. This comprehensive manual will give you the tools to tell a story from the point of view of a fairy. Standing only 3''-6'' in height fairies live world built by humans and face many challenges from this perspective, many of which are unforeseen.  Fairies are also naturally nonviolent and will not harm any living creature no matter how angry the housecat is. However, fairies consider themselves to be the some of the most powerful beings on earth and are not afraid to unleash their full strength if threatened by eldritch powers. \nA debut release from Spectra Games, the Fairies: A Role Playing Game core manual is a concise guide containing everything you need to play the game, giving players the ability to craft their own wonderful adventures. \nFairies: A Role Playing Game runs on an original d10 system created by the team here at Spectra Games. It is a game with focusing on storytelling as a core aspect of the game supported by optional in depth mechanics. The mechanics were meant to reflect the innate magical nature of a fairy. There are very few attributes important to fairy's, which also makes character creation a breeze. \n Sprites are the fairy's one and only stat. Fairies wink into existence, coming to life through a magical life force called sprites. Their sprites not only act as their life/hit points but also as a way for the fairy to manipulate their innate magical ability.  \n Speed determines how far fairies can fly, who goes first in battles, and how quickly they can save themselves in bad situations.\n Terrain is the landscape in which the fairy winked into existence. Being within that terrain grants the fairy a number of advantages\n Skills can give the fairy a deadly edge over enemies or perhaps your fairy enjoys building clockworks?\n Magic is almost as natural as breathing to a fairy. Each fairy has magic that will be sure to make them shine.\n\n Pledge Levels\nThe core rule book includes\n9 types of fairies to choose from.\nThe emphasis on teamwork is evident in the design of each fairy as each type of fairy has unique abilities unusable by the others.    \nAir\nBlueberry\nEarth\nFire\nLemon\nPlum\nShaper\nSpirit\nWater \nA comprehensive Fairy Market\nA-Z Creature Compendium, many of which derived from actual myths and legends\nAn adventure module to get you started in the world of Fairies. \nCheck out the current first edition on drivethruRPG https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264184/FairiesA-Role-Playing-Game\nThe System\nA Core aspect of the mechanics we wanted to reflect was that all actions have consequence, whether good or bad. Sometimes a mistake doesn't lead to more than a wounded pride, other times it can lead to losing everything. \nA successful roll will leads to higher chances of success on subsequent rolls, while failures will lower the chance of the fairy succeeding on its next actions. The higher or lower the success/failure the greater the influence it will have on the fairy's future actions. \nFairy's playing Humans\n The World of Fairies\nFairy's were among the first sentient creatures to pop into existence on earth. This makes any period in earth's history a potential campaign setting. In the medieval period, elves, fairies, gnomes, and many other creatures were well known to humans. In our modern era, fairies keep themselves hidden from humans. Fairies and other magical creatures possess a wide range of magic and skills that allows them to easily fool humans and not be seen. It wasn\u2019t always this way\u2026\nExcerpt from Fairy Queen Avarice:\n\u201cHumans have always been wary of us, and we of them. It was decided long ago, after Merlin\u2019s experiments went too far, that all magic must be stripped from the humans. They are a danger not only to our way of life\u2026 but to their own.\u201d \nFairies, since time immemorial, have been subtly manipulating the facts of the world for both the fairies benefit, while  also for the protection of others. They consider this to be a selfless act. \nWhen Human historians first started recording historical events, the fairies jumped on the opportunity to render their existence as fiction. They used their magic to manipulate authors and historians to help bury the truth about the existence of fairies, not to mention the dark magic hidden in the deepest corners of the earth.  \nShaper and Earth Fairies\nMadame Rue and her Crystal Ball\nStoryteller information:\nIn Fairies: A Role Playing Game the game master is referenced as the Storyteller since this game is meant to tell a story and is primarily story driven.

In association with In Search Of Games, LLC., a publisher of roleplaying games (RPGs), I'm developing LatchKey, a simplified, accessible role-playing experience that will introduce new players to the world of tabletop gaming.\nSet in the year 2075, you take on the role of a young adult during the rebuilding of Nashville, Tennessee three years after a civil war. Suddenly, three figures invade and split the city amongst themselves and it's up to you and your party to embark on journeys, solve mysteries, drive these mysterious intruders out of the city and restore it to normalcy.\nLatchKey is a tabletop roleplaying game I developed with the intention to initiate new players into the RPG experience. LatchKey is meant to teach new players the details about a RPG, without sacrificing the storytelling or the challenge that usually comes with an introductory game.\nWhat started out as a passion project based off an innocuous request evolved into a stunning portfolio piece during my final year of college, and now a very tangible, very real Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for it. My goal with this campaign is to print out physical books and send them out to players and RPG enthusiasts alike, and introduce them to this world that's been three years in the making.\nLatchKey comes with the following:\n - A Black & White PDF or Hardcover book containing:\n       - 6 Playable Classes\n       - An Introduction & Directions to the LatchKey Game System\n       - A 25-page introductory adventure\n       - A section on running the adventure as the Game Master (GM).\n- If you pledge $5 or more, you'll have your name in the Special Thanks section of the core rulebook.\n- If you pledge $10 or more, you get all previous rewards and a PDF Copy of LatchKey.\n- If you pledge $40 or more, you get all previous rewards and a signed Hardcover Version of LatchKey.\n- If you pledge $70 or more, you get all previous rewards and an exclusive LatchKey Tee.\n\n\n - If you pledge $100 or more, you get all previous rewards and your Original Latchkey Character drawn by me. (I love character design, so this is great for me!)\nA little of what I do\n- If you pledge $200 or more, you get all previous rewards and receive access to a special Discord server where I will run an exclusive scenario of LatchKey. \n(If there is not enough people to run a campaign, you'll still have access to the Discord Server and Christopher Hopkins will host a miniature press conference; min of 3 players)\n\nIf we surpass our goals I have a few ideas in mind to show you all:\n       - $2,000 - I'll create a comic based on the world of LatchKey. It will be a limited         series of 5 issues detailing the underlying story of post-war Nashville.\n       - $3,000 - Along with In Search of Games, we'll be publishing a second adventure book, with non-canon scenarios by guest writers and illustrators.\n       - $4,500 - Collaborating with In Search of Games again, we'll be publishing a third book of non-canon scenarios by more guest writers and illustrators.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my very first Kickstarter.

It's challenging, but nothing good stories and great gameplay can't handle.\n\nThe main obstacle here is the funding for physical printing. I want to deliver a hardcover book to all players, both new and old, and introduce them to this world of war, danger, and family ties.\n\nThis is really big jump for me.

You are running to a place you\u2019ve never seen, somewhere past the mountains you\u2019ve never crossed.\nThe 24\"x36\" map of Stonewater is included at the Stonewater High Council backer level and presents players with random siege-weapon attacks; a gigantic hornets' nest with very cranky residents; critical high ground space; a field of strange wildflowers with butterflies that are rather clingy; crystals that trigger random spells; a blood-filled moat; and much, much more. Art by ilCorvo Artworks.\nThe journey will take weeks, and the way is full of danger. Shadowforde is weak and ill. The king\u2019s men are hunting you. \nAnd you are searching for a legend. \nThis is The Exodus of Wolfbane, an epic 0- to 2nd-level adventure compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics\u2122 roleplaying game. The module features a hefty 56 pages of adventure, illustrations, player handouts, and supplements, including the popular Encounter Cards we introduced in our first project, The Peasants' Fell Bargain. Your peasants will become hardened heroes as they battle strange monsters, harsh elements, and the king\u2019s cruel soldiers. You will grapple with mysteries, hauntings, moral dilemmas, and death-defying chases.\nAnd what will be waiting for you if you manage to reach Stonewater?\nTake the journey and find out! \nMeaningful Motivations\nAs with our first module, The Peasants\u2019 Fell Bargain, The Exodus of Wolfbane is designed to give your player-characters compelling reasons for going on this adventure. You are trying to save your friends and family, men, women, and children, and protect the strange man who has cared for your village for decades. Merciless soldiers dog your every footstep. \nThe Exodus of Wolfbane is a funnel that doesn\u2019t end when you reach first level because the exodus doesn\u2019t end. It is long and dangerous, and your goal isn\u2019t treasure or experience points.\nIt\u2019s survival. \nUnique Game Mechanics\nIn The Peasants\u2019 Fell Bargain, we introduced the fell bargain table to help you add diabolical deals with the devil into your own games. Well, we are pulling out all the stops in The Exodus of Wolfbane, beginning with character creation. Your exodus begins with the razing of Wolfbane, so the peasants you play will be drawn from those lucky enough to survive the onslaught of King Haveron\u2019s men.\nAlong the way, you will need to keep up the morale of the survivors, combining creative roleplay with some lucky dice rolling to lift your desperate band\u2019s spirits.\nAnd you will need this same creativity and luck to care for the ailing Shadowforde, maintain your wagons, and find the food and water you need to survive.\nIn other words, surviving the exodus will require courage, ingenuity, and good fortune: all of the qualities that can transform lowly peasants into the stuff of legends.\nJoin the Exodus of Wolfbane, and find out if the road to Stonewater leads to sanctuary or perdition. \nStretch Goals\n$3,000 Some Paint for the Wagon: Gaming Honors Decal.

Magic is mysterious and powerful, monsters are menacing and unpredictable, and Luck matters\u2014A LOT more than min-maxing and statistical analysis.

Als Mitglied des Ordens der Sonnenkreuzes hat euch der Vorsteher des Ordens zur Hilfe gerufen.\nSeitenumfang\nDas eigentliche Abenteuer umfasst 14 Seiten, daran schlie\u00dfen sich noch die Maps an, womit es insgesamt ein 20-seitiges Heft, Gr\u00f6\u00dfe DIN A4 wird.\nSeite aus dem Abenteuer\nLandkarte & Maps\nDie Gebietskarte zeigt die Umgebung, in der das Abenteuer spielt (wie eine Landkarte). Die einzelnen Maps sind daf\u00fcr gedacht, dass die Charaktere mit ihrer Umgebung interagieren, die Spielleitung noch genauer den Ort beschreiben kann und vor allem, dass auf den Maps direkt gespielt werden kann, sei es mit Miniaturen, Papp-Aufstellern,...

Deshalb ist ein Playtest nat\u00fcrlich auch notwendig, was wiederum Zeit kostet, aber letzten Endes der Qualit\u00e4tskontrolle dient.\nZur Erstellung von Karten und Maps nutze ich bew\u00e4hrte Tools.

One day a thunderous howl echoes across the land. \nA flicker\u2026 a shudder. Then. Darkness. \nEven torches threaten to burn out as the creatures of the black Void crawl out to consume all they can catch. \nCan you relight the beacon of salvation before all you know and love is devoured by the crawling dark?\n\nA DCC Funnel Adventure\nCharacter Creation Should Be An Adventure\nA discovery, not a slog.\nSoul for the Ocean Dark is a 0 level funnel adventure designed for the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG system. It is the story of an impossible call to adventure with the highest of stakes: save a world interrupted, or face certain doom. \nPlayers will create characters from a dark and isolated world which has never known a sun. A towering, mystical lighthouse provides the closest thing to natural light for this world. Since time immemorial, it has pushed back against the oppressive darkness of the Void, providing salvation from the endless horrors that await in the dark. Suddenly, the world is plunged into darkness. With the hope of their people on their shoulders, and sputtering torches in their hands, the players must seek the missing light. \nFrom a dark and grim foray through the Fungus Wilds, to consoling a god, to besting a tempest storm \u2013 players must gather all of their wits and resolve to face their destiny. \nJudges, get your players ready for 20+ pages of adventure! \nIn Soul for the Ocean Dark, the archipelago dotting the Shadow Sea is a hidden legend unto itself. Created eons ago by a pair of gods, not everything went according to plan. Even gods have limits, and the growth of this world has long been stilted. The ancient village of Omera\u2019Palissada has always been on a razor\u2019s edge of survival, fishing the dark waters for sustenance under the unfaltering lighthouse of their patron gods.\nAdventure Book Cover\nWith the light suddenly gone, your players must find a way to restore it. They will set forth on a daunting quest to face their gods and return the divine power to the Lighthouse. This will not be easy, as the deep darkness is home to supernatural creatures long kept at bay, eager to take advantage of this sudden boon. The pincers of Giant Crabstosities, the swooping jaws of Boros, the gnashing teeth of Oki \u2013 some of these monsters are driven by hunger, others compelled by divine force. Whatever their motivation, they eagerly await in the shadows.\nFuel your imagination with inset black and white illustrations of the village, the monsters, maps of ancient ruins, island sea charts, and more.\nDon\u2019t Just Write your Backstory\u2026 LIVE your Backstory\nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG is a d20 RPG system that was crafted by Goodman Games as a homage to the earliest editions of D&D. It is a return to combating capricious dice as much as monsters. Players delve into dungeons and exotic locations for treasure and glory.\nDCC has a few unique features which set it apart from D&D. Players start with not one character, but several. The first adventure played is called a \u201cFunnel.\" This is a \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d tale and a time of desperate survival, where life is cheap and only the heroic survive. Depending on the size of the party, each player starts out controlling 2-4 player characters.\nCharacter Generation\nCharacters are generated almost completely by rolls of the dice. This liberates players from the catch-22 of needing to know how to play to build their characters before they play. Characters are not yet heroes, so they are easy to relate to and easier to play.\nHere at The Keep Studios we LOVE funnels as a method of creating characters. It\u2019s a fantastic way for new players to jump in and get straight to the meat of the game. Don\u2019t just write your backstory\u2026 LIVE your backstory! \nYou can learn more about the DCC system at Goodman Games.\nWe have also written a quickstart guide on our website, including some tips for people new to RPGs in general: Starting out with DCC.\nFrancisco Duarte returns with a new adventure!\nFrancisco Duarte is a Portuguese sci-fi and fantasy author, and the creator of The Keep Studios\u2019 first Dungeon Crawl Classics adventure - Sword in Jungle Deep. Francisco lives in Aveiro, Portugal, with his girlfriend, Marta. When he\u2019s not writing he usually enjoys reading and playing RPGs and other tabletop games with his friends. He has written several short stories for tabletop and video games, as well as one sci-fi novella. \nBeing a trained anthropologist, he draws inspiration from myths and cultures from all over the world, meshing them into unique realms that come alive in front of the reader\u2019s eyes. He then creates realistic characters to face the overwhelming odds of surviving in such settings. Not all get to survive, but without some challenge what\u2019s the fun of living?\nMeet our artists\nCover Art and Cartography By Alena Lane\nThe artists from our first book, Sword in the Jungle Deep, return for our second adventure!\nAlena Lane's artwork from Sword in the Jungle Deep\nAlena Lane has already completed the stunning cover art for our book, and will be once again taking the lead on all of the interior maps. Her map for Sword in the Jungle Deep may be one of our favorite pieces.\nWe can't wait to share more of her work with you once it's complete, but for now you can get more of a taste for her art on her Instagram.\nProgression of the cover art of Soul for the Ocean Dark\nLonny Chant Returns as our Interior Illustrator\nWe love his linework and the striking contrasts in his black and white pieces. We can't wait to see his take on our new adventure.\nLonny Chant's Artwork from Sword in the Jungle Deep\nThe PDF\nThe PDF will contain all the content of the print edition in a digital download format. Great for reading on a mobile device while on the go.\nThe Book\nThe book will be a high quality perfect bound adventure module, with glossy cardstock color cover and 20+ pages of high quality paper with crisp black and white text and illustrations. This book will feel nice in your hands, and will be something to be proud of having on your shelf.\nThe Monster and Encounter Cards\nTwo of our stretch goals are to fund the creation of physical artifacts to help you run the game: \"Monster\" and\" Encounter\" cards. The cards are planned to be standard US playing card size with embossed printing to give you the highest quality experience.\nWhen the first goal is reached, the smaller set of Monster Cards will act as handy reference guides for the monsters' stats and appearance. Having a fast, clear and attractive reference during fights will improve the gameplay experience.\nUpon successful funding of the next stretch goal, the Monster Cards would be available as a stand alone set, but would also be folded into a higher tier reward item including all possible encounters; e.g., traps, pitfalls, and natural phenomenon. This \"Encounter Deck\" will allow you to draw cards instead of rolling on tables for the many possible encounters while exploring the world. Let the players draw their own encounters, and survive the fickle fate they have brought on themselves! \nArt Prints\nThese canvas prints will feature the cover art in a high quality wall mountable format. We're working with printers to produce prints ready to be hung on walls as an eye-catching collectible. We have selected a standard 11 x 14 inch format to fit nicely amongst any decor.\nShipping\n\"Early Bird\" Reward Tier\nThis tier includes a book produced for you \u201cAt-Cost.\u201d As normal, you pay your pledge here on Kickstarter, and when your rewards are ready, you will receive a link to finish your order with DriveThruRPG. In this way you will be paying DriveThruRPG directly for the actual printing costs with no mark-up from us! This is part of our \u201cThank you\u201d to our Early Bird backers. Also, your shipping charges will be accurate as you will be able to provide up-to-date shipping information.\n\"The Curious\" and Higher Tiers  \nWe'll send you an email once your rewards are ready, so you can fill in your up-to-date shipping information and pay accurate shipping charges for your goods.\nSee the FAQ section for more details on our approach to shipping.\n \nStretch Goals -  Higher funding means even better rewards \n$1500: UNLOCKED Custom Level 0 Professions - A custom table of professions in the setting of the world for generating characters.\n$2000: UNLOCKED 5e Compatibility - Encounter conversions for playing with the 5e SRD games.\n$3000: UNLOCKED Monster Cards - A card set containing all the monsters encountered in the adventure.

Every so often, we create fantastic story ideas that we burn to share!\nOur First Adventure Book - Sword in the Jungle Deep\nAfter a lot of blood, sweat and tears, we crafted our first adventure, Sword in the Jungle Deep. This taught us a lot about adventure book production, and we\u2019re using this experience to expand our catalog with your help.\nSword in the Jungle Deep was reviewed by the fine folks over at Spellburn, a DCC centered podcast. Here are some of the things they had to say:\n \u201cA really nice classic Appendix N feel\u2026 very Conan wandering around in the jungle, looking for the lost temple... A great classic, old school feel\u2026 Keep \u2018em coming!\u201d \u2013Judge Julian\n\u201cA funnel adventure\u2026 that I think you could run as a first level adventure.\u201d \u2013Judge Julian\n\u201cThe art on the inside is really quite lovely, and I especially like the cartography of the main map, it very much has the DCC vibe\u2026 In terms of content\u2026 it has this really kind of  nice, pulpy, Appendix N vibe to it. .. and what cracked me up\u2026  at the end of every box text, there\u2019s a little TLDR section which I thought was hilarious\u2026  and actually very clever and helpful.. at the table.\u201d Judge Jeff\nThey also had some great constructive feedback that we have considered while developing Soul for the Ocean Dark. You can listen to the episode here. (They review Sword in the Jungle Deep starting at the 13:35 mark.)\nOur Online Community\nThe Keep Studios also fosters an online community via a Discord server and a Twitch channel. We love table top RPG\u2019s, but that\u2019s not all! Our company members and affiliates also enjoy playing and sharing various video games, including retro, indie, and mainstream hits. Naturally, we also stream some of our tabletop campaigns. You can visit our website to learn more about us, and to find links to Discord and Twitch. www.thekeepstudios.com\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat will the Kickstarter funds be used for?\nSimple: Artwork, printing of backer rewards, and writers for stretch goals. The adventure is written, layout is complete, and the artists are at the ready to complete the original illustrations.\nFunds will be set aside to print all of the backer rewards. We plan to use DriveThruRPG's fulfillment services, meaning we can print our small-run books with lower overhead and ship them reliably all with less cost to you.  \nA sizeable allocation of funds is also necessary to pay our contracted artists and writers. We have a good working relationship with our artists and writers, and they have always astonished us with their results.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019re big fans of Kickstarter both as consumers and publishers. Heck, some of our favorite projects such as Mutant Crawl Classics, Numenera and Strongholds and Followers were kick-started. Inspired by these examples. we have decided to follow in the footsteps of giants.\n\nCan I use this for my level 1 party?\nYES! We've made sure to include \"Hooks for Established Parties\" right in the book's introduction section.\n\nWhat if I play D&D or another 5e SRD compatible game and not DCC?\nOne of our lower level stretch goals is to add in a supplement to make 5e SRD compatible versions of all the encounters. We've already written a free guide on using any DCC funnel (especially this one!) to transform character creation itself into an adventure within the 5e rules. Read about it here!\n\nWhy are you invoicing shipping separately?\nShipping is always tricky business when it comes to Kickstarter, and many projects have failed by not properly taking care of shipping expenses. Often, backers have a change of address before a project\u2019s rewards are complete. In those situations, we wouldn\u2019t want to overcharge a backer for shipping, or have to bill backers for small discrepancies in actual shipping costs. For small changes we would feel compelled to eat the cost, and small changes can add up to a lot on our end. \nKickstarter campaigns can elect to include collecting shipping funds, but did you know that counts towards your total pledge? This can artificially inflate goal completion, making it appear that we have more raw capital to work with than we really do. We could try to estimate shipping costs, and increase our goal amount accordingly, but an estimate is an estimate, and that means that it's much harder for us to give our backers a genuine view of what we really need to fund our rewards.\nTo avoid all this we're separating shipping funds entirely. We'll send you an email once your rewards are ready, so you can fill in your up to date shipping information and pay accurate shipping charges for your goods.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve already published our first adventure book, and at this stage of development in our second adventure book, the risks are low. However when dealing with any kind of custom creation, setbacks can occur.\n\nPrinting and Shipping: As mentioned earlier, we plan to use DriveThruRPG\u2019s fulfillment services. DrivethruRPG is a reliable service that serves thousands of publishers with an excellent track record. However DriveThruRPG is separate from ourselves, and so if they face delays for any reason, so would we. The total demand we place on them is also contingent on the amount of rewards we need to fulfill, including possible successful stretch goals. Though we\u2019ve always had good results from DrivethruRPG, we cannot be sure how long a large print run would take, as we have yet to use them for backer reward fulfillment. For backup, we have established contact with a local print house. In this case, we would ship US orders from our home base, and we should also be able to ship to the EU via an agent in Portugal.\n\nArtist Timelines: Our artists are trusted and reliable external contractors, which works well for us in that we only need to call on them when the other parts of our project are ready to integrate with the artwork. Naturally any contract work means we have to negotiate with a freelancer\u2019s timeline. We have reasonable assurances that they will be able to complete their work, and we also have backup artists on the line just in case a personal emergency or some other interruption should occur. Any of these scenarios would not cause the project to fail, however, as we always pay upon receiving the artwork, so in this way no backer funds would be lost.\n\nLong story short, our anticipated possible road bumps would be delays, not outright failures. In any event, we would keep our backers informed regularly through our \u201cUpdates\u201d page.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Fan", "descp": "Get A Personalized Thank You Message From Us!\nINCLUDES:\nA Personalized Thank You Message", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Merchant", "descp": "This tier is for retailers who can provide proof of re-seller status.

Swords and Sorcery and Metal Gods. Danger, treasure, blood and glory all mixed in a blender and served up in golden Ur-Hadad, the First City of Ore. Enter, if you dare, the bitchin' mural on the side of your cousin's Ford custom van. Enter the world of the Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad.\"\nBack in 2012, those words, written by the Rev. Dr. Edgar Johnson, ignited a fire that would set the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG community ablaze. First, it was a rallying cry that assembled the greatest group of gamers I've ever been privileged to game with. Then, in 2014 through 2015, it became a sort of mission statement for the zine that would bear the name of that gaming group, the Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad. The Metal Gods zine was a fire that burned brightly for three issues, then that fire dimmed and has been a brightly-glowing ember these past four years. \nThe time to reignite the fire is now!\nThis year, just in time for Kickstarter's ZineQuest, the original creative team behind the Metal Gods zine (Wayne Snyder, Edgar Johnson & Adam Muszkiewicz) are getting the band back together for three fantastic new issues. We'll be collaborating with some of our favorite people in gaming, artists and writers alike, to not just bring back the Metal Gods, but to up the ante. Here's what's in store for you:\nIssue #4: Time of Crisis!\nLike any other multiversal hyper-megalopolis, Ur-Hadad is no stranger to calamity. In fact, crisis is one of the First City's defining features! This issue provides a whole slew of tools for Judges to use to spin up their campaigns from small adventures into city-wide, culture-shaking phenomena! Including profiles of Ur-Hadad's most notorious crises and their causes (along with special rules introduced by each) and a Crisis Generator, this issue is all about turning your game up to 11!\nThis issue is almost completely written and will be ready for art & layout soon. It'll be 32 pages long and feature art from Tristan Bell and Diogo Nogueira among others.\nDiogo's centerpiece illustration for issue #4\nIssue #5: Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad\nFirst, we gave you Street Kids of Ur-Hadad. Then we gave you The Heist! Metal Gods has always focused on urban adventures and now we're taking them one step beyond! In Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad, we'll present a system for running a thieves guild, assassins coven, coterie of smugglers or however your criminal taste run. This unique system builds on some trends already out there in the greater DCC-o-sphere, bringing them together in a tight, cohesive package. You'll also get to know the seedy underbelly of the First City, including profiles on some of her most notorious gangs. \nThis issue is currently in playtesting and is expected to be finished by mid-Summer and Doug Kovacs has signed on to do the cover! We've also got Evlyn Moreau doing this issue's centerpiece illustration and it looks like this issue is on track to reach 32 pages. \nDoug Kovacs's cover for issue #5\nIssue #6: Mysterious Gods of Ur-Hadad\nFrom the Avenue of One Thousand Gods to the Gloaming Deeps beneath the city's docks, cults and mystery faiths permeate Hadadi society. In this issue, we'll explore some of the First City's stranger religions and sects, from the austere followers of the God of Blackened Skies to the debaucherous Last Adherents of the Sensate, we'll profile these bizarre faiths and how to use them in your game. We'll also include rules to integrate cults into your Murder Gangs of Ur-Hadad game, whether as foes or as your PCs' crew!\nThis issue is currently in playtesting and is expected to be finished by mid-Autumn. It will feature cover and centerpiece illustrations by Luka Rejec! Other artists include Tristan Bell, Craig Brasco and of course our own Wayne Snyder. \nWhat's Different This Time Around?\nA bunch of stuff is different. First, we have a plan. The first time around, we did stuff when we wanted to, but didn't have a clear vision of where we were going. We do now. \nAlso, we're expanding our circle of collaborators. Previously, Wayne had done all of the art for every issue of Metal Gods, but this time around, we're going to be hiring some artists who'll be contributing illustrations through out all three issues we're funding. The funding for some of these artists is baked into our initial ask, but some are reserved for Stretch Goals (see below) because of how much their contributions will add to the final package. Having more artists involved will certainly increase our turn-around time, something I'm sure our fans are looking forward to. \nWe're also upping our production game here. We're bringing the page count of each issue up to 28 pages from 24, and there's a chance that #5 & #6 will surpass that. We've had a bunch of little ideas on how to increase the quality of the zines out of the gate, and this Kickstarter will allow us the opportunity to explore some of those and we'll be filling you in when they become a reality. \nStretchgoals\nIf we surpass our initial funding goals, we have some great plans for making the zines even better. \nSo far, we've crushed the following goals:\n$1,400 - Luka Rejec of Wizard, Thief, Fighter will do the cover to Issue #6!\n$1,650 - Luka will also do a full-spread centerpiece illustration for Issue #6 \n$2,000 - We bring in the fantastic Craig Brasco for more art for all three issues\n$2,250 - Every physical reward tier (all of them but the digital tiers) will include a Metal Gods of Ur-Hadad vinyl sticker\nThere were even some goals I didn't even have a chance to post before you all smashed them! At $2,500, you unlocked a new centerpiece illustration for Issue #4 by none other than the Metal Gods' own Diogo Nogueira! We've also unlocked some more  vinyl stickers,  one themed after each of the new issues (four stickers in total!). There's also a super-secret hidden Stretchgoal known only to Wayne and myself. We'll tell you when it's unlocked because it's just too awesome to even hint at.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIssue #4 is almost finished being written and will happen anyway, so our biggest challenges are slow-downs at the development or writing stages for Issues #5 & 6. Art could also slow the process down, but that's one of the reasons that we're doing this Kickstarter, to be able to spread the work out over more artists than normal. Basically, we see the completion of the products as inevitable, but there are few places where things could slow down a bit.

The catch?  Each player is a unique voice in one man's head. \nUPDATE - NEW ADD-ON!\nThe Old and The New\nIn the early 2000's, an indie RPG called Everyone is John began making its way across the convention circuit.  It was strange, unique, and a ton of fun.  You could play it with scratch paper and a couple of six-sided dice. Slowly, surely - this quick-hit RPG became a genuine cult-classic.\nWe are proud to bring you this new edition of that cult-classic RPG with over 40 pages of new material an extra content!  The game has been heavily expanded with enhanced rules refined through hundreds of hours of playtesting to provide the best game experience, ready-to-use character and GM sheets, original art, gameplay examples, and numerous adventure seeds to entice players and game masters.  \nAdditionally, the book expands the world of Everyone is John with sections on running an adventure in worlds of Fantasy, Science Fiction, Horror, and other settings - with detailed rules for each, such as letting John cast magical spells, use super-heroic powers, or deal with mind-altering attacks on his sanity!\nThe Game\nEveryone is John is a fast and fun competitive RPG where each player assumes the identity of a \"Voice\" inside the head of John - a man with no real identity of his own. John's actions, skills, knowledge, and goals change constantly as the voices in his head vie for control of him by using their own finite willpower. Each voice will struggle to achieve their own obsessive goals before all Willpower is gone and the game is over - with only one Voice left as the victor. \nEveryone is John is a fast, fun game that lets players create their Voices in just a few minutes, and begin play right away.    It's the ultimate pickup RPG. But you know what? We can tell you all this... but we'd rather just show you...\nOur Pledge for Your Pledge\nYou see, this book is already fully written and ready to send to the publisher.  And when you back this kickstarter at our $5 level or above, we will immediately share with you a digital copy of the core rules.

But these entities are also shrewd opportunists. Many of them see humans as a resource to be harvested, corrupted or enlisted for their dark plots. Humanity, with all its noble aspirations, has many flaws. Greed, lust, envy, hatred and fear are ripe fruits for these forces to exploit. Division and separation makes the humans easier to control. While the best of humankind fights for just laws and civilization, those who cling to power and privilege stand ready to quash protections for those who need them most. In the shadows of human injustice lurk loathsome, inhuman entities. As investigators square off against the worst aspects of mankind, they also find themselves entangled with the parasitic powers of the Mythos.\nWelcome to An Inner Darkness, from Golden Goblin Press.  \nThis is collection of Classic 1920\u2019s era scenarios of 7th edition the Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game (published by Chaosium, Inc) with several goals in mind. We hope to present well researched, historically accurate and challenging adventures, with a slightly darker, harsher and more brutal tone than our fans might be used to. For Golden Goblin Press, this will be a more mature book, one focused on adult themes, designed to spark deep conversations among your players for years to come.  \nThese scenarios will of course feature the malignant taint of the Cthulhu Mythos, but at the forefront of each will be one or more examples of social injustice, societal corruption, and mankind\u2019s inhumanity to man. The 1920\u2019s was a period of great social upheaval in America, when the borders between classes, races, and genders were changed. In this time of social upheaval and chaos, eldritch forces found fertile ground to exploit us. Mankind is never so vulnerable than when we are divided from within. \nWhen this Lousy War is Over, by Brian M. Sammons \u2013 Arkham, Massachusetts, 1923. At the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars association, men who fought in the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d gather together, seeking a bit of solace from those who\u2019ve shared similar experiences. Many are wounded in body, in mind, and in spirit. Many suffer from horrifying nightmares, violent outbursts, disfiguring injuries, or alcoholism, but their pain and struggles are mostly ignored by society. They are reminded that the war is over, and told to just \u201cget over it\u201d by a public who finds it all too easy to judge. Then, chapter members start to mysteriously die in violent and terrible ways, with clues pointing to the occult, possibly involving a member of the association no less! Can the investigators find those responsible and stop them, before it\u2019s too late?\nThey Are From Away, by Charles Gerard - Bangor, Maine, 1923. Maine has become a major battleground for the Ku Klux Klan. Protestant nativists have grown fearful about the recent influx of Catholic Immigrants, mostly Irish and French-Canadians. This provides the KKK with fertile ground for spreading their message of hate, division, and violence. Enter Eugene Farnsworth, a charismatic former stage magician, hypnotist and filmmaker, now known as King Kleagle, the head KKK recruiter for Maine. He hosts \u201cwholesome\u201d public events while spearheading an aggressive recruitment drive, making alliances with area politicians and heads of industry. Meanwhile, macabre, inexplicable and unnatural events begin to occur, aimed at humiliating and terrorizing the area\u2019s Catholic citizens. Investigators must discover if there is a link between the two, and find a way to stop it if they can. \n\nFire Without Light, by Helen Gould - Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1922. Less than a year has passed since the Tulsa Race Massacre, when the wealthiest black community in the United States was destroyed and hundreds of innocent people were murdered by rampaging white mobs. Though most of the 10,000 black residents left Tulsa, some remained to rebuild their devastated community. Now tensions are on the rise once again. A new pastor and his wife have arrived, preaching hate and violence to the white population. Their congregation is growing at an alarming rate, and violence is spilling out from their church and into the streets. Strangely, even families and friends of the same race are turning against each other. Something very wrong is going on here. Investigators must tread carefully to discover just who - or what - is fanning the flames, pushing the citizens of Tulsa towards another wave of catastrophic violence.  \nA Fresh Coat Of White Paint, by Jeff Moeller - Los Angeles, California, 1931. Early in the Great Depression, the U.S. institutes its first mass deportation policy, supported by a cross-section of interests such as racist nationalists, eugenicists, paternalistic \"charities\", and labor unions \"looking out for their own.\" This leads to a roundup of thousands of ethnically Mexican families, many of them U.S. citizens, carried out federal employees, local police, various \"charities\", and outright vigilante groups. The deportees were (sometimes) given summary hearings, detained in makeshift conditions, and then loaded onto trains. On the outskirts of Los Angeles, one such \"charity\" is refurbishing an old prison to \"give the unfortunates somewhere to stay.\" However, this long abandoned facility has a dark past, which is quickly becoming a horrible, otherworldly nightmare for those interred there. Can the investigators get to the bottom of things in time to save the prisoners?  \n A Family Way, by Oscar Rios \u2013 New York, New York, 1925. The investigators must come to the aid of a dear friend, a student at Columbia University. She\u2019s found herself \"in trouble\" after what should have been a harmless girls' night out. Her group ended up drinking and dancing with the wrong sort of fellas, the kind willing to slip them a mickey and take what they wanted from their unconscious victims. Now the girls need help, as the authorities won't act, or even take their stories seriously. These men have deep pockets, powerful allies, and dark secrets. When the men return with offers of marriage and gifts of strange, pale gold jewelry, it becomes clear they aren't the sort to take no for an answer. There aren\u2019t many options for girls in their \u201ccondition\u201d, and one of the few happens to be illegal. But your friend just wants this nightmare to be over, if such a thing is still even possible.   \nDreams of Silk, by Christopher Smith Adair \u2013 Pennsylvania, 1922. The cosmetics industry is growing fast, as the public\u2019s obsession with youth and beauty grows. As profits soar and businesses expand workers at such companies suffer due to lax regulations and poor conditions. At Hempstead Cosmetics, located in Brights Mill, Pennsylvania, a state infamous among labor advocates, conditions are especially bad. Local government turns a blind eye to protect their economic boom, ignoring any indiscretions or complaints against chemist and owner Mervyn Hempstead. Consumers marvel at their newest skin cream, promising to give a complexion as smooth as dreams of silk, and the youthful glow of Imelda Hempstead, Mervyn\u2019s wife and chief model.  Meanwhile, his employee\u2019s bodies and minds deteriorate and their complaints of rashes and troubled sleep are ignored.  But things are much worse than anyone can possibly imagine, as they are drawn into a web of literal nightmares as unspeakable horrors from beyond our reality are tied to Hempstead Cosmetics' \u201cmiraculous\u201d secret ingredients.  \nWe have some wonderful authors, editors, artists, cartographers, and designers who are already hard at work on this project. They are: \nBrian M. Sammons - is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and Golden Goblin Press. He has penned stories that have appeared in a number of publications and has edited the books Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, Edge of Sundown, Steampunk Cthulhu, Dark Rites of Cthulhu, Atomic Age Cthulhu, World War Cthulhu, Flesh Like Smoke, Return of the Old Ones, Children of Gla\u2019aki, Dread Shadows in Paradise, and more. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Strange Aeons II, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.\nWhy \"When this Lousy War is Over\"\u2013 War and horror and the horrors of war have always fascinated. Just see a fiction anthology I did called World War Cthulhu for proof. Or a Call of Cthulhu scenario I did for Strange Aeons II set in another forgotten war, Korea. And make no mistake, The Great War is largely forgotten today as are some of the barbaric treatments and practices used to patch up those mutilated by it in both body and mind. As for veterans, they have always been forgotten. For a country that seems so proud of its military might, the way America treats those who fought after the fight is over is just disgraceful. So I wanted to tell a tale of brave men, damaged men, marginalized and purposely forgotten men having to face the horrors of the everyday, and those from beyond, too.   \nBrian Sammons\nCharles Gerard - is a Franco-American Mainer, writer and journalist based in New York City. Relentless curiosity is both his superpower and his fatal flaw. In the tabletop gaming realm, he has published work with Sentinel Hill Press, Cubicle 7, and the Dungeon Masters Guild, and has a scenario in Golden Goblin Press\u2019 forthcoming Invictus scenario book, No Faith in Appearances. He is a co-host of the Miskatonic University Podcast, as Keeper Chad.\n  Why \"They Are From Away\" - I wrote \"They Are From Away\" to shed light on the intractable, repeating history of nativism, xenophobia, and bigotry against religious and ethnic groups. In this scenario, I am proud and honored to explore the heritage of my francophone, working-class grandparents and forebearers in my home state of Maine. They toiled as low-wage woodcutters, builders and mill workers during a time of great prosperity for the timber and manufacturing industries. But the French-speaking residents of Maine, along with other immigrant groups, faced discrimination, harassment, and humiliation by those who feared newcomers might upset a social order tilted heavily in their favor. That time in Maine\u2019s history, with charlatans whipping up conspiracy theories, distrust, and intolerance of outsiders, strikes me as a crucial reminder that monsters of inhumanity thrive on forgetfulness, and they never truly sleep.    \nCharles Gerard\nHelen Gould - is a black British writer and editor focusing on poetry, horror, and tabletop roleplaying. She's contributed to games from Black Armada; Rowan, Rook and Decard; Stygian Fox; and Graham Walmsley's Cthuhlu Dark. You can also listen to her playing Pathfinder over on The Rusty Quill gaming podcast.\n\nWhy \"Fire Without Light\" - I wrote this to explore the culpability of white women and the middle class in propagating racism. Too often, the image that people hold of a racist is an angry, working class white man, when the reality is that it is just as likely to be a well-spoken professional white woman or an educated white male professor. The scenario is also a response to the prevailing notion of racism as something done by people who don't know any better or who didn't really mean it. They do mean it, and the infantilising assumption that racism is an accident is incredibly dangerous.   \nHelen Gould\n Jeffrey Moeller - Is a cis-male, middle-aged Caucasian father of five who lives in Cleveland but considers Alaska home. He is the author of dozens of published Call of Cthulhu scenarios, is a frequent Golden Goblin Press contributor, and won a 2017 ENNIE for The Things We Leave Behind, along with Oscar and Brian.\nWhy \"A Fresh Coat of White Paint\" - If you want to blame someone for this collection, blame me; I pushed for it. My day job is immigration attorney, and I've represented detained immigrants before. Originally this was going to be set in the modern day, in a children's detention camp (administered as is often the case by a \"charity\") along the Mexican border. Oscar asked me to set it in the Classic era, and I was horrified to read about what went on in 1907 and 1931 Los Angeles, with itinerant populations, forced labor and the Mexican \"repatriation\". People think of California as a bastion of liberalism today, so a history lesson seemed in order.   \nJeffery Moeller\n Oscar Rios \u2013 This native New Yorker and Hispanic-American cosmic horror writer is the author of more than ninety scenarios for Call of Cthulhu, including the campaigns Ripples from Carcosa and The Legacy of Arrius Lurco. He is also the President of Chaosium licensee, Golden Goblin Press.\nWhy \u201cA Family Way\u201d \u2013 I wrote this scenario back in 2007, and have only run it a handful of times. I wanted to explore something truly horrific, namely rape, its aftermath, and the terrible choice a woman faces should a pregnancy result from the attack. Compound that horror with others taking that choice away from the victim, and the health and legal risks involved with getting an abortion in the 1920\u2019s, and you find yourself in a very dark, very real place. I swore I\u2019d never publish \u201cA Family Way\u201d, because I was afraid. There were arsonist attacks in Austin and Virginia Beach on women\u2019s health clinics about the time I wrote this. I am ashamed, and the telling of this tale is long overdue.   \nOscar Rios\n\nChristopher Smith Adair \u2013 Christopher has written numerous scenarios and articles for Call of Cthulhu, both for Chaosium and a number of its licensees. This includes the upcoming Pulp Cthulhu campaign A Cold Fire Within. They are currently tinkering away on their own game-design ideas in what spare time remains.\n  Why \u201cLike Dreams of Silk\u201d \u2013 Work takes up an enormous part of our lives. It affects everything. Often, we do it simply for our survival and that of our loved ones, hoping that our sacrifice results in better days. Some are privileged to do something they love or that is meaningful. But too often the work we do to live is itself detrimental to our well-being. The history of labor is full of horror stories, and that continues to this day. The \u201cworkplace horror\u201d sub-genre hasn\u2019t been explored as much as it could be in fiction and, especially, roleplaying games. And while this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve touched on this subject, I\u2019ve been looking for the right opportunity to make it the centerpiece. \nChristopher Smith Adair\nMark Shireman  -  is a graphic design professional (and secret cultist of Nyarlathotep) with over 29 years of experience, and is currently GGP's acting Director of Design. He has also been a part of the Cthulhu LARP community, as well as the well-regarded TerrorWerks events held at Origins and Gen Con in years past. He has been covertly encoding summoning glyphs and sigils into his work, spreading the influence of the Crawling Chaos for nigh on two decades now, and his success is evidenced by the increasingly unstable reality of recent years. Feel free to visit his portfolio at http://www.markshireman.org to get a glimpse of his work.   \nMark Shireman\nReuben Dodd \u2013 Reuben has been illustrating roleplaying games off and on again since 2005. At first, it was mainly on fantasy games, but since 2010 he has worked almost exclusively on Lovecraftian horror games, the bulk of which has been for Golden Goblin Press but also for some other publishers including Chaosium Inc., Miskatonic River Press and Stygian Fox Publishing. Illustrating Cthulhu Mythos themed RPGs has given Reuben the chance to indulge his artistic dark side and pay tribute to Weird fiction and horror imagery. Something that he is incredibly grateful for.\nReuben Dodd\nGregory Shipp - Hello! My name is Greg and I make maps.

Now members of the Secret Court are being found gruesomely murdered inside a fairy ring at an old red cider mill on the Miskatonic River.

MSPE (as it came to be known) allowed players to run rpg adventures from the 1800's all the way to the modern era, ranging from Victorian steampunk, and crime noir, to super spy thrilllers in the cold war. Michael Stackpole wrote the MSPE role playing game, using the Tunnels & Trolls framework as a jumping off point. \nIn 1986, Flying Buffalo took a hit from an unrelated disaster, and sold the rights of MSPE to Sleuth Publications. They came out with an edition that had a black & white cover, and they left out a few things that Buffalo had included, and inserted a few new things that weren't in the Buffalo edition. The last existing copies of the Sleuth edition have sold out, so now Flying Buffalo is printing a third (Combined Edition of MSPE) which includes all the material that was in both editions! \nThe Combined Edition: What's in it? The new edition will contain all the original text and art from the Flying Buffalo and Sleuth editions.  From the Buffalo edition, we will use the amazing painted cover and will include the Tunnels & Thompsons section (which was not in the Sleuth edition) along with some missing art. We have also made various corrections to the rules text that have been found by players and fans over the years.\nRestored and enhanced covers and the Tunnels & Thompsons section\nThe Sleuth edition had several extra sections at the end of the rules that are not in the Buffalo edition. These include optional rules on aging; 13 fully described statted Non-Player characters (including Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty - illustrated by Liz Danforth) and a special folding version of the MSPE Character sheet. All of these will be added to the Combined Edition. \nPLUS New material: On top of that, we are also going to add some new information on using MSPE in sci-fi environments and info on stopping distances for vehicles. All newly illustrated by Steve Crompton. We just might also add a few other rule enhancements based on the response to this Kickstarter.\nPlus sample characters/portraits, and additional material added to the Combined Edition!\nWe will be including all of this in the Combined Edition - (Along with  possibly a few other surprises!)  The rules will  be printed as a trade paperback 8 x 11, (or as a hardback) and for a little extra you can even get your copy of the rules signed by Michael Stackpole. (see details in the pledge levels)\nIf you are a Tunnels & Trolls player you should get this book to see how T&T evolved to allow for guns, grenades, cars, planes and tech skills. And you can easily adapt the MSPE rules for use with your T&T characters and campaigns. Trolls with grenade launchers? Elves with machine guns? Why not!)\nADD ONS: Here are some extras you can add to your pledge!\n Stormhaven printed -  $6 (note if you are buying a hardcover you get 1 free copy)\n Stormhaven PDF -  $5  \n  Add your name to the book - $10 if you are buying a hardcover book\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper printed - $9 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Mugshots 1: Case of the Pacific Clipper PDF - $3 (Written by Dave Arneson)\n Jade Jaguar solo printed  - $6 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\n Jade Jaguar solo PDF  - $2 (Written by Mike Stackpole)\nGM Screen printed - $7\nGM Screen PDF  - $3\nTo purchase add-ons, just add the price listed above of any item you want to the your pledge total.

Also if you buy printed copies of any books you will also get a FREE copy of the PDF.\nOTHER INFO ABOUT THIS PROJECT:\nWe've already scanned and restored all the pages of the rules and the book is ready to go to press. All we need to do is add the page of backer names, scan Stormhaven and Jade Jaguar and give them to the printer.  So there really should not be much delay. \nPledge today and help bring this classic piece of RPG history back to life again! \n Final (probably) stretch goal:  If we make $25,000 we will make a poster of the original cover art for the book, and send one free poster to everyone who has requested a physical copy of the rulebook!  If you only requested pdfs, you can get a poster by adding $10 for postage to your pledge.  If you want more than one poster, add $5 for each additional.\nWhere does the money go? Almost half goes to the printer to print 1000 copies. another share goes towards production (scanning, restoration, new material added to the book, new art and pre-press) About 5% goes to kickstarter ($500), 5% more goes to the credit card company and we expect to have to ship around 300 copies at $4 each for postage and packaging. The rest goes to cover any expenses I've forgotten about, or unexpected expenses, and if there is any left over I might get to keep some. \nKickstarter doesn't let you support with more than one reward. So if you want extras, just add extra money as below to your pledge: for each extra copy of the book, add $16. Fpr each extra signed copy of the book, add $25. When I send out the survey I'll ask you for what you wanted. You can also select other items when you answer the survey.\nUS Backers note: postage is included for USA backers.\nAlso note: nothing from this project is limited edition, so if you want something, but cannot afford it right now, just tell me when you answer the survey. You can send the extra funds later by credit card or by paypal. We will work with you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is written, edited and laid out. All we need now is the money.

It\u2019s 52 pages long (with 5 unlocked bonus map stretch goals included). Inside you\u2019ll find:\n\u00b7 10 'adventure-on-a-page' one-shot adventures of all varieties - murder, dungeon crawls, heists, breakouts, sieges, love stories - complete with additional DM and player maps! These adventures are fully playtested, for PCs of 1st - 5th level and are designed for minimal preparation and flexible delivery. Each adventure can be run as a \u2018fill-in\u2019 for 1-2 gaming sessions (3-4 hours per session) or played as a mini-campaign. Over 50 hours of gaming content!   \n\u00b7 12 New monsters! 4 new magic items! \n\u00b7 Hints on the art of improvisation to bring your NPCs and adventures alive\n\u00b7 Random tables - for names, motivations, room dressing and special items to add additional nuance to your adventures \n\u00b7 Verona City - a city for adventurers to use as a base \n\u00b7 Verona Province - a region for players to explore, complete with every location used in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES\nAll the major work is done\u2014writing, playtesting, layout, editing, proof reading\u2014completed! Now that we've achieved all the stretch goals, the stretch goal bonus maps and adventure seeds have been drawn and added. The digital maps package has also now been compiled. All that's needed is to add backer names to the PDF and send off the print proof (which can take 4-6 weeks to be approved - not my delay, my friends), which will happen as soon as the Kickstarter ends and Kickstarter sends me the list of backer names. Then a few adjustments to the print PDF to make it a Tablet/Electronic book PDF (such as removing the print gutter and inserting front and back cover) and voila! All done.\nHere are a some examples of completed pages:\nDesigned to be concise, easily accessible and quick to prepare, these adventures include flexible sandbox-style and structured storylines - something for every style of DM. The 'adventure-on-a-page' format means you get an entire adventure with an intriguing storyline, maps, NPCs and monsters, with plenty of meat to get your teeth into, but with enough 'space' to allow you to incorporate improvisation based on your players' decisions.   \nThere is a huge variety of adventures in this package\u2014murder mystery, dungeon crawls, heist, siege, investigation, bizarre love, puzzles\u2014something for all your players, whether they prefer role playing, hack-and-slash or brain-teasing intrigue! You can run them as one-shots that slot easily into your existing campaign, or as a mini-campaign taking PCs from 1st - 5th level, using your own setting or the one provided in the book. \nI love mystery, conspiracies and double-crosses! These adventures feature lots of that, as well as interesting moral quandaries for players. Would you defend a group of murderers? Have the monsters been framed or should they be exterminated? Do you eliminate the opposition in order to win the prize, or do you work with them? Do the ends justify the means? All is not as it seems\u2026 There\u2019s enough intrigue and suspense in each adventure to keep your players excited and engaged for many hours of gameplay!\nCheck out these teasers for each of the adventures included in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES: \nThere\u2019s more than just adventures in this lovely little tome.\n\u00b7 New Monsters and magic items! Humanoids like the despairingly ugly Grov\u2019l, the vicious, partying Barfs, the psionic spider-like Sholix, and new magic items like Seeds of Growth and the Dagger of Defence. Plus, I've used some interesting beasties from Kobold's wonderful Tome of Beasts, like the Angler Worm and Clockwork Beetle. \n\u00b7 City campaign setting! Verona City, also known as the City of Canals and the City of Bridges, due to its extensive magically-carved canal network. Why has the Duke not been seen in years? Is the Mages\u2019 Guild the source of the magical Haze drug causing townspeople to hallucinate and see ghosts in the city streets? The war between the Thieves\u2019 Guild and the Dockers\u2019 Union over the city\u2019s illicit trades is coming to a head! The Council of Six argue amongst themselves while worshippers of the Death Cult of Asgarte infiltrate Verona\u2026 Verona City is a broad, brush stroke setting with adventure seeds, that is easily expandable and the location of several SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES.         \n\u00b7 Regional campaign setting! Verona Province lies on the edge of the empire. To the north, an uneasy truce with the warring Skandarans, to the west Orc raiders in their longships ravage the coast and monster hordes spew forth from the Break in the World. To the south the great dragon Antraxus roams freely through wastelands, threatening to break the fragile peace negotiated with the Council of Six. And the slave trading Sherviath Elves plot with the dark gods to bring the empire to its knees\u2026 Complete with adventure seeds, Verona Province is a broad, brush stroke setting that is easily expandable and includes each of the adventure locations used in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES.   \n\u00b7 Random Tables! 5 tables with NPC/PC names, backgrounds and motivations, adventure introductions and locations, special curiosities PCs can find along the way and interesting room dressing items. Need a way to introduce the characters to an adventure and at a loss for ideas? Roll on the Random Adventure Introductions table. The coach they\u2019re travelling on is ambushed by Orcs! An NPC passenger is especially impressed with how the PCs handled themselves during the battle and suggests an interesting job\u2026         \n\u00b7 An article on the art of improvisation in games! Not used to improvising in your games? Locked into linear storytelling with fixed outcomes? Time to break the mold and let the game take on new life as you work with your players to create an evolving story based around improvisation and saying \u2018yes\u2019.  \n\u00b7 A section on using these adventures with OSR games!

The book will look great on your bookshelf and in play! \nIf this campaign is successful, I\u2019ll be following it up with:\n\u00b7 SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES 2 \u2013 10 adventures for character levels 6th \u2013 10th. \n\u00b7 THE BLACK MERIDIAN \u2013 a mini-campaign for high level characters 12th \u2013 14th, set in the Verona Province, the Shotglass Adventures campaign setting.\nSo, please help me to help you!

I have a semi-regular column called Laidback DM on my website, stevestillstanding.com, where I post free maps, hints and suggestions on DMing, and 5e game aids. Last year I decided to write a number of 'adventures-on-a-page', using Adobe InDesign to create professional layouts, started playtesting them with two separate playtest groups and created additional content to support busy DMs who have minimal preparation time\u2014these became SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES! This project has been a labour of love for me.

Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control.

Massive and sincere thanks to everyone for the massive support and enthusiasm that's been shown so far. Not only has the campaign been fully funded, but every stretch goal has been met, assuring that Grey Cells will support not only modern mysteries, but also Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian mysteries! If you'd like to learn more about the game, here are some additional places to look!\nYou can find the Google Drive folder containing the case files and all profile cards related to the case by following this link.\nIf you'd like to see Grey Cells in action, you can see me playing Death of a Survivor with backers in this video.\nI was also a guest on Professor Jimbles' Dicebag Podcast and Professional Goblins to talk about Grey Cells, including its past, its design principles and its future!\nGrey Cells is a game of unravelling mysteries. It\u2019s about stepping into a dark morass of crime and deceit, and piecing together nuggets of truth into a full picture of what really happened. Players take the roles of investigators of all stripes - policemen and detectives, reporters, scientists, socialites and criminals (reformed or otherwise).\nEvery character wields powerful tools to shake loose information from the world. When making deductions, some character abilities can build on the information you\u2019ve gathered to help you connect the pieces more clearly. This makes it much less likely that players become stuck without recourse.\nAnd once you have that information you can start making deductions yourself, or you can have your character help you. Several character abilities assist in interpreting evidence, and can help put your deductions on the right track. They\u2019ll never solve the case for you, but they allow you to utilise your character\u2019s experience in the field to aid in the deductive process, should you need it.\nThe game emulates your favourite crime fiction genres, whether that be a civil and proper Cozy mystery such as a Hercule Poirot adventure, a hard-boiled detective flick like The Big Sleep, and more! It also provides advice on how to make your game feel the way you want.\nGrey Cells is a race, and the villain is already a step ahead. They have their own agenda - the thief escapes with their prize, the hacker erases their tracks, the killer stalks their next victim. Take too long to catch them, and they could be long gone.\nCases can involve a lot of dialogue with non-player characters, be they witnesses, suspects or even friends and allies brought into the world by the players themselves. However, Grey Cells doesn\u2019t have a Charisma stat to help you convince and manipulate them. Instead, how well you can persuade or intimidate someone depends on how much you know about them. Discover what they want, what they fear, and what their dirty secrets are and you\u2019ll have them talking in no time.\nThis creates a more thematic experience - people won\u2019t cave until you have something to press them with. Also, since success is dependent on something that\u2019s not on your character sheet, each player\u2019s voice is equally powerful; you don\u2019t have to stand aside while the persuasive character does all the talking.\nWriting mysteries can be tremendously challenging, especially for a roleplaying environment. This is why the game includes tools to help gamemasters weave their own mysteries, expanding and connecting elements of the story until they have a full web of mystery. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need to lay every piece of the puzzle beforehand - the same mechanics that help keep the investigation\u2019s momentum going also help the gamemaster create clues during the course of play.\nCrafting a compelling case still requires more preparation than many other types of roleplaying adventure, but it\u2019s one of Grey Cells\u2019 goals to make the process as smooth and effective as possible.\n- 83 pages of content\n- Basic rules of play\n- Guidance on how to play in different genres: Great Detective, Cozy, Hard-Boiled, Police Procedural and Thriller\n- Six unique backgrounds for player characters: The Beat Cop, The Crook, The Detective, The Reporter, The Scientist and The Socialite\n- Special actions to uncover new information, engage in combat, and more\n- Rules for adding permanent new characters to the game in the form of Contacts\n- Rules for Exploits: Special advantages representing your investigator\u2019s strengths\n- Rules for Momentum Powers: Potent abilities to make breakthroughs in the case, and other special effects\n- Extensive guidance on how to create and run a mystery adventure\n- Rules for making custom backgrounds\nThe core rules of the game are already complete. The game is playable, and in terms of rules all that remains is to tweak and perfect them. This will require more playtest sessions to find weaknesses in the design and improve the systems and verbiage used in the rules.\nThe zine will require numerous art assets. Of these, the most important will be character designs to represent the six character backgrounds available to the players. They will reflect not only the background but also an associated genre. These character concepts will be used in illustrations throughout the rest of the zine.\nSeveral stretch goals are available, including supplementary materials for the game. If the goals are met, any backers receiving PDF or printed copies of the core game will also receive PDF or printed copies of the additional materials, as matches their tier.\nIt all started with Poirot and cake. My friends and I would gather to watch Agatha Christie mysteries and enjoy unhealthy quantities of cake. Eventually, this interest overlapped with our passion for roleplaying games, and we tried our hand at creating investigative crime fiction adventures.\nAlthough the adventures were fun, it always felt like we were playing two separate games. The games we played were great for epic combat and high adventure, but the rules took a back seat when it came to investigation and deduction. I decided to make my own game that put the investigation itself in the spotlight.\nI\u2019ve studied game design and participated in multiple Game Jams. With my history of tabletop roleplaying I wanted to use that knowledge to create a game that supported and encouraged the inquisitive style of play we were after.\nUPDATE:\nThanks to the massive support received, I'm adding Discord & playtest access to the Junior Detective ($3) tier! Also, the Detective ($5) tier and upwards will gain access to weekly update emails, including development notes and artwork to be included in the final book! Unfortunately the text on the backer rewards can't be changed after launch (which makes sense!) but rest assured that you'll get them!\nUPDATE:\nI've completed the first set of playtest case notes for Grey Cells, and as promised they are going to be freely available. The following link goes to a google drive folder that contains not only the PDF of the case notes, but also JPEGs of all the Profile Cards involved in the case.\nDeath of a Survivor is a hard-boiled mystery that should take about two 4-hour play sessions to complete. Full disclosure: Most playtest cases will be a bit shorter than this one, but I will try to maintain this standard of quality. Furthermore, playtest cases will be from all of genres supported by Grey Cells, including Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian cases as development continues.\nI hope this gives you an idea of what Grey Cells has to offer, and that you enjoy Death of a Survivor!\nAlso, if you'd like to see an example of how this case works in action, you can find a recording of the playtest here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first game I\u2019ve designed, but it will be my first professional release. However, this is not the first iteration of Grey Cells - throughout its development it has had two major rewrites, replacing, redesigning and improving large portions of the game. Now it has reached the stage where it can stand on its own, and I\u2019m ready to share it with a wider audience.\n\nWith the core of the game nearly complete, the most risk lies with the design and illustration of the zine itself. Preparing enough illustrations to fill the zine could take longer than I\u2019ve accounted for and cause delays, but in this event I will recruit additional artists to assist in production.\n\nAs a black and white zine, printing risks are low even with a zine of this length. Distribution could face delays depending on shipping factors, but even in the event of delays backers would have the PDF available to them.\n\nThis is my first crowdfunding campaign, and while I\u2019m going in with eyes open there may be issues I have not anticipated, especially surrounding pricing and shipping. If issues arise, I will be as transparent as I can be and try to resolve them in a manner that is as fair as possible to the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 3 or more", "title": "Junior Detective", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of the Grey Cells playtest rulebook, as well as a PDF copy of the finished rules and any supplementary materials met through stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["314 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 5 or more", "title": "Detective", "descp": "Everything above, and access to the Grey Cells Discord channel, where you can participate in online playtests.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "Inspector", "descp": "A printed copy of the rulebook, as well as printed copies of supplementary materials met in stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["246 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 30 or more", "title": "Super Sleuth", "descp": "Gain access to PDF copies of the case notes from each playtest, so you can run them yourself.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nAccess to playtest case notes", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 50 or more", "title": "Ace Investigator", "descp": "Receive PDF case notes for a unique single-session murder mystery with yourself cast as the villain or the victim.
