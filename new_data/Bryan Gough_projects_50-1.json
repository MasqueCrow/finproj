Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.\nEncounter creatures both wonderous and horrifying (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nThe default tone for Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with starships cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost.\nVisit Remote Settlements on perilous worlds (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nIt's a dangerous life for anyone living in the Forge, and doubly so for the Ironsworn\u2014those adventurers bound to sworn quests.\nSwear iron vows and see them fulfilled or forsaken (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nInspiration comes from the the quest-driven adventures of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and outer-rim locations of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated suspense and industrial grittiness of Alien, the desperation and retro-tech of the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the mysticism of Dune, and the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse. It's all blended together into a heady stew of perilous sci-fi adventure, and topped with a dollop of Guardians of the Galaxy gonzo.\nMost aspects of the setting can be adjusted to your preferences. The campaign launch exercises offer inspiring prompts and guidance to immerse you in a galaxy of your own creation. \nThe Art\nStarforged is packed with amazing illustrations by lead artist Joshua Meehan. Josh composites photos, textures, 3d objects, and hand-painted elements to create a vibrant, cinematic rendering of the people, places, and perils of the Forge.\nSet off on perilous expeditions (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nJosh uses the Starforged oracle tables and generators to help build the unique subjects and aspects of each illustration. The art is directly inspired by the game!\nDevelopment process for an Ironsworn: Starforged illustration - from initial concept to finished piece (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nExplore mysterious precursor sites (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nIt's a perilous galaxy, so consider bringing an ally (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nFace deadly foes in high-action battles (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nThe System\nStarforged is true to Ironsworn's roots, tuned to fit the spaceborne setting, while incorporating experience and feedback from years of development and play. \nIf you're new to Ironsworn, here's a summary of how it works.\nThree Ways to Play\nLike it's predecessor,  Ironsworn: Starforged offers three ways to play.\n Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.\n Co-Op You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.\n Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous galaxy. Good luck!\nYour Character\nThe Starforged playscape, with print-and-play asset cards and character sheet.\nYour character in Starforged is composed of stats and trackers. These elements help you determine the outcome when you perform risky actions.\nAs you complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, you gain experience. You spend this experience to add assets\u2014vehicles, modules, paths, companions, and deeds\u2014which deepen your abilities and options.\nCharacter creation is fast and flexible, with a guided exercise to help define your background, resources, expertise, and goals.\nMoves\nMoves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in Starforged. \nFor solo and co-op play,  moves help resolve your actions and trigger new opportunities and complications. For guided play, moves take an active role in the conversation between the guide and the other players.\nSample move from Starforged.\nIronsworn: Starforged moves are inspired by the innovative, fiction-first mechanics of the Apocalypse World system created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.\nMomentum\nThe momentum meter is one of your character's most important mechanical attributes.\nMomentum is a special mechanic which is core to playing Starforged.  You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. You lose momentum when you suffer a cost which causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.\nYou can use momentum to gain a decisive result \u2014 or avoid dire failure \u2014 on a critical move.\nAction Roll\nWhen you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, roll three dice at once:  An action die (D6) and two challenge dice (D10). Add your relevant stat and any bonuses to your action die. This is your action score.  Then, compare your action score to each of the challenge dice and check for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. The move will tell you how to interpret the result.\nThere are three possible outcomes for the action roll:\n Strong Hit: Your action score beats (is greater than) both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.\n Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.\n Miss: Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions\nThe Oracles\nStarforged Oracles are random prompts and generators which help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide creative backup for the guide in guided play. They are an inspiration engine--ready to introduce amazing locations, surprising revelations, and dire challenges to your Starforged campaign.\nMockup of oracle tables within the Starforged rulebook.\nIf you loved the oracles in Ironsworn, you'll find much more to love here. It's an entire galaxy of possibilities! Plus, these tables are largely system agnostic and can be paired with other sci-fi systems. \nStarforged oracles are included in the Preview Edition, which is an immediate reward for backing this campaign.\nShipping Info\nThe pledge levels do not include shipping. After the Kickstarter concludes, you will pay shipping for any physical rewards through the pledge manager. \nHere is a list of shipping estimates by region. \nContiguous USA: $11-$16\nEU/UK: $20-$25\nNorway/Switzerland: $33-$41\nCanada: $20-$25\nAustralia: $21-$25\nNew Zealand: $21-$34\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: $12-$17\nRest of Asia: $24-$36\nAll Other Countries: $57-$120\nWe are customs-friendly in the UK/EU and many other regions! Check the FAQ for details.\nPledge levels and the shipping fees above do not include VAT. If VAT fees apply in your region, you will be charged those fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. However, we want to alleviate these charges as much as we can,  so we will cover 50% of your VAT fees!\nLegacy Add-Ons\nIn collaboration with DriveThruRG, we are offering Ironsworn books and cards as add-on rewards during this campaign. These materials are not completely compatible with Starforged, but include mechanics, tips, and guidelines which might help enrich your Starforged campaigns. Plus, they allow you to experience vow-driven quests in the perilous fantasy setting of the Ironlands. These are the existing editions of these books and cards, and are not new versions or reprints.\nThe bad news: Shipping on these legacy items is managed separately through DriveThruRPG, and shipping cannot be combined with physical Starforged rewards. \nThe good news: You'll receive your reward codes after this Kickstarter campaign ends. You can order your legacy books and cards at that time, rather than waiting for release of Starforged. \nAs a thank you for supporting Starforged, printed legacy add-ons are discounted from current prices by about 15-20%. You can select these add-ons when choosing your backer level. If you add a legacy item to your pledge, you'll receive a code to purchase that item from DriveThruRPG for the cost of production and shipping.   Check this page at DriveThruRPG for current estimated shipping costs.\n Ironsworn Print Edition - Set off on perilous quests with this 270-page core rulebook. Winner of a Gold ENNIE award! \n Ironsworn Asset Deck (Printed Deck) - Upgrade your Ironsworn playscape with a deck of printed asset cards.  \n Ironsworn: Delve - With a vast array of new options and tools, Ironsworn: Delve is the perfect companion for your Ironsworn campaign.

Playtesting has been underway for several months. Much of the art for the book has already been completed. \n\nAbsolute Tabletop has developed dozens of RPG products, and managed four successful Kickstarter projects. They have experience with fulfillment and logistics, and will help ensure a smooth delivery for our valued backers.\n\nBecause this project involves a larger team than previous Ironsworn products, we may encounter delays due to a specific individual's availability. We will put measures in place to ensure that no one (including Shawn) is an indispensable resource that would cause a failure to deliver. We will keep the backers informed about what is happening with the project, and will provide regular preview releases of the book as it is developed. \n\nWe may also encounter delays due to unexpected issues with production and shipping. Working with our fulfillment partners, we will make our best effort to identify and resolve any issues before they impact the backers. \n\nShawn has always believed in open and transparent communication with Ironsworn fans, and this project will be no exception.

Whoever has the Agent itself scores even more points, but only if they successfully lead others off their trail!\nAs the end of round approaches, the stakes get higher and higher\u2014every action taken affects who ends up with the Agent card, as well as who might know its location! Deceive your friends with mind games, reverse psychology, and other strategic plays to maximize your points.\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg\u2014keep an eye out for stray point cards, the valuable Asset card, the elusive Double Agent, and much more\u2026\nIf you enjoy strategy card games or spy-themed stuff as much as we do, join the #Agency and help us make this game a reality! Your mission is a go.\nWith all the love in the known universe,\nJohn \ud83d\udc27 , Ethan \ud83d\uddff, Alex \ud83c\udf2e\n\nWhen the campaign ends, we will be ordering the decks in bulk from PrintNinja, a top-reviewed custom printing manufacturer we've partnered with.

Our current estimate for when you'll get the game in your hands is October 2021!\nThe above is a prototype from The Game Crafter. The final decks will be ordered from PrintNinja using higher quality materials with all the same card counts!\n The Origin Story \nOn day 5 of a 16-day cross-country road trip, deep into the barren yet beautiful highways of Idaho, arguably hallucinating in the heat of the van, John turned to Alex and asked, \u201cYo, wanna make a card game?\u201d\n\u201cIght.\u201d\nThe original idea was to have a ~special card~ and aim to end the round with it in your hand. The card was nicknamed \u201cthe card\u201d, and so the game \u201cthe card the game\u201d.\nSoon enough, basic action cards like Search, Investigate, and Wiretap were added (various name changes omitted), among others.\nFinally, the yin to the yang of \u201cthe card\u201d was added: the endgame voting chart. \u201cIt would be super interesting if you only want to end with \u2018the card\u2019 if some players don\u2019t know you have it\u2014it\u2019d be a constant mind game battle whether to keep it or give it away, and how many players know where it is or not!\u201d\nEventually we added a spy theme to spice things up. \u201cThe card\u201d became the Agent, and the game became \u201cIntel\u201d. Of course\u2026 it\u2019ll always be \u201cthe card the game\u201d in our hearts. \ud83e\udde1 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: a tuck box poker deck is a relatively straightforward product to make.

Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts!\nBattle massive monsters in a wild open world.\nWith two complete core sets, playable standalone or together, you can embark on quests in two distinct habitats teeming with native beasts. \nAs you gain more experience, the monsters get tougher. Every beast has three difficulty levels to challenge your skills. Successfully slay a 4-star monster, and you\u2019ll win your campaign!\nWant a one-shot monster fight without the tracking? \nArena quests let you hunt any monster, at any difficulty level, using any hunters, right away. Simply equip your hunters with the recommended loadout and dive headfirst into the fight!\nExplore the lush Ancient Forest...\n\n...the arid Wildspire Waste...\n...or combine sets to expand your world!\nPlay with any combination of hunters and hunt any combination of monsters during your campaign. Because hunters can make equipment from other sets, combining sets opens up a whole new world of weapons and armour for your hunters to craft.\nFind out how the core sets combine\n\n\nBecause hunters are defined by their weapons, every hunter is a different way to play. Where the great sword hunter trades movement for raw strength, commanding respect with its incredible stopping power, the dual blades hunter favours swift strikes and mobility \u2014 dashing in with a flurry of blows before dodging to safety.\nSome video game weapons come with extra special features, like the charge blade and insect glaive. To really squeeze the juice from that Divineapple in the board game, those hunters come with special rules.\nThe monsters you hunt will determine which loot you earn and what weapons you can craft to help on your next quest. So, you\u2019ll need to decide together where to follow the Scoutflies next. \nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a monster, track them through the lush Ancient Forest or arid Wildspire Waste using the choose-your-own-adventure quest book.\nImmerse yourself in the New World, gathering resources, avoiding health-sapping pitfalls, and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment.\nJust like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. The tracks you discover will determine what state you find the monster in, and which special attack is added to their deck.\nEnjoy the beauty of the landscape as you climb trees, scale cliffs, and explore caves for bonus resources \u2014 but don\u2019t get too distracted. Every quest has a time limit. As you hunt, you\u2019ll discard time cards, giving you less time to take down the beast when you eventually track it down...\nDiscover more about the Gathering Phase\nIt\u2019s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these! Every monster is a boss, and every boss is a unique challenge, with different ways of moving, different attack styles, and special rules that will trigger during battle to change things up.\nMonsters dictate the flow of battle, deciding who to target and even taking the first turn.\nLuckily, the more experience you gain, the better you\u2019ll get at predicting the monster\u2019s next move. As you learn their \u2018tells\u2019, the clues on the back of every behaviour card will give you a bigger hint at what\u2019s coming next.\nOnce the monster has made their move, it\u2019s your chance to react! Because these are wild beasts you\u2019re fighting, you won\u2019t always have the same opportunity to act before the monster moves again. \nYou\u2019ll need to decide who\u2019s best placed to attack, who needs to sharpen their weapon, and who needs to get the heck out of the way before the beast strikes again...\nDiscover more on Monster Behaviour\nYour position matters. Monsters have four arcs for their behaviours and their body parts: front, left, right, and rear. Where you\u2019re standing determines whether you\u2019ll get hit, but also what parts you can target.\nBreaking parts can trigger rules that change monster behaviour and earn bonus loot for your whole party, which you can use to craft upgraded weapons for taking on tougher beasts.\nWhen you\u2019re taking on a monster, three things are vital to success: positioning, teamwork, and managing your cards.\nThere are no dice in combat. Instead, combat is controlled by cards which you\u2019ll use to create combos, meaning you\u2019ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina.\nBecause attack cards can also be used for movement and dodging attacks, which also uses stamina slots, you\u2019ll need to make strategic choices about when to play cards and when to keep your board clear.\nKeep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!\nDiscover more on How Hunters Work\n Craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles, swapping cards into your deck to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks.\nChecking potential rewards is key to choosing your next monster quest. Some equipment offers elemental damage and resistance which could help you in a future hunt.\nBecause everything you craft stays in your inventory, switch equipment between quests to give you the best chance against the next beast!\nYou\u2019ll start with a unique attack deck based on your hunter\u2019s weapon and upgrade options you can craft from bone and ore. The more monster loot you claim, the better your weapon choices become!\nDiscover more on Upgrading Your Hunter\nLike the video game, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game is a campaign game. Over multiple sessions, you\u2019ll face tougher monsters, upgrading your hunter and equipment as you go.\nThe more monsters you slay, the better the weapons you can craft, the bigger the monsters you can hunt \u2014 until you\u2019re ready to take on a 4-star monster and win your campaign!\nWith 25 campaign days to spend (more if you're playing with combined sets), you'll need to make strategic choices about which monster to hunt and when. \nWill you hunt tougher versions of the same monster to craft all the weapons you can? Or try a fresh challenge?\nAfter a heart-pounding hunt, you may want to kick back and relax. Spend a few campaign days at HQ visiting the Smithy to craft new equipment, petting the Poogie, and enjoying a meal whipped up by the Meowscular Chef!\nHow Hunters Work\nTracking Monsters\nMonster Behaviour\nUpgrading Your Hunter\nArena Quests \n Combining the Core Sets\n   We\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs.

Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

Players deploy recruits into battle, then spend their available action points during each activation. Trigger powerful attacks and abilities from either a deployed recruit itself or from the cards in their hand.\nTo begin play, each player chooses a runelord then everyone chooses one of several game modes. Follow the setup and win conditions found in the Battle Compendium and hit the battlefield!\n\nQUICK OVERVIEW  \nLet's have a look at some gameplay basics:\nACTIONS\nThere are several types of actions that recruits can take during play. All actions will have a cost associated with them and every recruit has access to three action points to spend per activation. If you see an action point icon, simply pay the corresponding point and perform the action shown. \n32mm runelord miniatures available as an add-on! Models do not come painted.\n\nBATTLE DICE\nThere are 5 battle dice in the game, each tiered by color. The higher the tier, the more powerful the dice.\nThe combat system is progressive. The better you roll on the battle dice, the more wounds are dealt and the more varied the attack's effects will be. In the example below, watch how this melee attack gets better as the rolled dice tier increases!  \nTAKING ENDOWMENTS\n  During each warzone activation, players have three options when using Facilitators:\nOption 1: If activating a warzone with a runelord deployed, simply discard any number of Facilitators from your hand during the Endow Phase and increase any rune of your choice by one for each Facilitator discarded in this way.\nOption 2: When activating a warzone with a non-runelord recruit deployed, you may discard a single Facilitator during the Endow Phase and destroy the deployed recruit to increase any rune of your choice by one. If you have another recruit in your hand to deploy, do so, and keep fighting!\nOption 3: During the Active Phase of any recruit you control, you may discard any number of Facilitators from your hand and draw a card for each Facilitator discarded in this way.\nRECAP: Unique Aspects\n Recruit Actions: When you draw into a recruit, if you do not need or want that recruit to be deployed into battle, you can spend them from your hand for their actions just like any other card! Does that Peacekeeper need a ranged attack this turn? Play your Hound Master for her attack action and discard it. This not only creates surprise attacks that your opponents don't see coming, but it is also a great way to free up hand space if you need to draw cards and you are at your max hand size. \n Endowments: Runes allow players to level up mid-combat! Do you need that one extra hex of movement? Good thing you drew that Facilitator. Unlock an endowment of Grace and get there!\n Modular Map Tiles: Do you want to play a small, single-tile battlefield where there's nowhere to run? Select one of six double-sided tiles small enough to bring the battle to a coffee table. Want to play a full-on war with four players? Put all six map tiles together for a 19x27\" double-sided battlefield! [Spoiler: If we are fortunate enough to unlock our second set of double-sided map tiles, they are designed to combine with the core tiles offering two more 38x54\" battlefields! Not recommended for coffee tables.] \n Battle Dice: The progressive battle dice system puts all of the important information during combat into one place. Simply roll the attack's denoted dice and apply the wounds rolled to the target along with any Weak (circle), Strong (triangle), or Critical (star) effects rolled, each effect unique to the attacking recruit! \nThis guide is a work in progress.\nJoin the game designers for this quick overview of combat basics: \n [NOTE: All components shown are prototypes and can change based on your feedback.] \nThink you're ready to give it a shot? Download our demo on Tabletop Simulator!\nAdventures are scenario-based experiences for 1-4 players depending on the selected adventure. Each adventure will have a guide on how to set up the components for play and specific win|lose conditions for players to solve, hindered by the actions taken by AI-driven recruits called villains.\nVILLAINS\nVillains follow a simple series of behaviors that are unique to each villain in the adventure. When activating a villain, simply follow its list of behaviors in the order shown. When they have completed all of their behaviors, their activation is complete.\nLet's have a look at a villain from the adventure, The Unrighteous King:\nAt the top, you will note that this Brute has rulesets for both one or two-player experiences. Every villain will have rulesets that scale its difficulty based on the number of players. In this example, all of this villain's innate actions are listed in the top section while all his behaviors are listed below. When you activate this villain, you would follow its behavior list from behavior 1 through 5 then complete its activation.\nFor a better look at the contents of an adventure, download the demo rulebook below or give it a shot on Tabletop Simulator!   \nThis guide is a work in progress.\nActual prototype shown above.\nThe Sovereignty Stage is an optional game mode where players can take the armies of their favorite runelords and mix them into a resource-management, deck-building engine where players take turns purchasing cards over twelve rounds of play. Purchasing is done from three available markets: The Barracks, The Armory, and The Training Grounds. Along the way, journey cards are drawn where dangerous encounters, exciting events, and aggressive PvP cards can dramatically change the outcome of a player's resources. \nPHASES OF A ROUND\nDRAW: All players draw and reveal five cards.\nJOURNEY: Beginning with the first player, each player draws a single Journey card, then resolves its contents. If the card being drawn has the PvP card back, only that single card is drawn and all players perform its contents together!\nPURCHASE: Beginning with the first player, players may purchase a single card from the available markets or they may pass. After each player has passed or purchased, restock the markets and begin again until all players have either passed or can no longer afford to purchase.\nDISCARD/RESTOCK: All players discard any remaining cards from their hands and restock all markets.\nActual prototype shown above.\nWHY THE DECK BUILDER?\nThough it's optional, the deck builder mode allows players to create countless new combos by mixing their runelord's cards with the cards from other runelords' armies. As new runelords are introduced in future expansion, old runelords will get a new lease on life, expanding the game's replayability for years to come!\nPLAY\n\nNOTE: Battlefield/Adventure Add On is set as an $85k stretch goal.\nActual prototype shown above.\nYou may be asking: \"What is a runelord?\" \nWho better to answer that than the creator himself, author David Farland?\n Here's an interview with David Farland and game design John D'Angelo:\nRunelords take qualities like strength, intelligence, and beauty from their willing vassals. As runelords do this, they became stronger as their vassals become weak and infirm. But there's a catch! The Runelord must keep the vassals safe, lest they lose their powers. \nVIDEOS\nDoug of 2+Tough breaks down what he thinks makes The Runelords stand out.\nMark Streed from Dice Tower goes into the biggest changes from the first campaign. \n Unfiltered Games gives the rundown on The Runelords and gives a live playthrough!\n Not_A_Superhero learns the game in real-time!\nGloryhoundd presents a quick overview of theme and gameplay!\nJoin Mike from One Stop Co-Op Shop as he attempts to tackle The Unrighteous King Adventure solo!\nThe Battle Cast breaks down what makes The Runelords so unique and helps answer the question: Should You Play?  \nThe Hungry Gamer discusses the evolution of The Runelords.   \nARTICLES and PODCASTS\nGabe and John go over the value of community feedback.\nCheck out this interview with Board Game Halv!\nA fun episode where designers John J.

As such, we're well aware of the common bottlenecks in Kickstarter fulfillment. We also are well aware of the supply chain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSo with this in mind, here's what we're going to do to make sure you get your game on-time and in mint condition:\n\nWe have an active relationship with our manufacturer. We've had prototypes created and we can vouch for their quality. As soon as the campaign funds, we're ready to manufacture the game. That includes stretch goals too - every single additional goal has been vetted so we can confidently fulfill on-time and within our budget.\n\nSlow shipping is also a common problem. That's why we've chosen our domestic and international shipping partners very carefully. We've scoured online reviews and have contacted some of their current clients to make sure they're up to the task.\n\nHave a concern that you don't see addressed above?

She also noticed that the selection of products offered for water activities lacked sophistication and a cultural connection. Alma Ocean is the first, Black-owned pool inflatable start-up with a mission of promoting inclusivity, creativity, and sustainability through the design and production of inflatable pools and water activity accessories.\nFounder + CEO, Danielle Hodge\n\nCREATIVITY: Inflatable pools should not only cool you off in the Summer, but they should create an experience and set a mood once placed and filled. Alma Ocean offers creative designs that will enhance any outdoor space and serve as the centerpiece to every backyard barbeque or balcony. \n\nSUSTAINABILITY: Alma Ocean believes in protecting the ocean, which is why upcycling is such a priority. Reusing and recycling inflatable pools and water products is a way to alleviate Alma Ocean\u2019s environmental imprint on this Earth. We have partnered with some of the best Upcycling Guru's worldwide to help us accomplish our goal of inflatables being a \"Forever\" product.\n  INCLUSIVITY: We want EVERYONE to enjoy the water and have access to swimming resources at their finger tips.  Alma Ocean offers resources for swimming lessons, surfing groups, and other water activities to encourage EVERYONE to safely get their feet wet. We empower swimmers and non swimmers to navigate through the water with confidence.\n\n WHY CROWDFUNDING:\nAlma Ocean is currently in the crowdfunding phase and early manufacturing phase. We are dedicated to offering countless varieties of inflatable pools and water product designs; however, financial limitations only allow for a small selection of designs to be available at this part of the process. With the help of donations from supporters, the capital raised will be used to manufacture current designs and expand to include additional design concepts for production. The crowdfunding capital is also being used for marketing, graphic designers, product shoots, media, and other production costs. Every dollar raised is a step towards the business goals and mission of Alma Ocean.\n\nWHERE WE PLAN TO GO:\nOnce the crowdfunding goal is reached, the capital received will be allocated in a variety of ways. This includes the production of the inflatable pool and water accessory designs that are currently available, and fulfilling orders generated from crowdfunding supporters. It will also be allocated towards marketing, graphic designers, product shoots, media, and other production costs. Additionally, Alma Ocean will use the capital raised to expand and grow its business. As the business grows, the product designs available will also grow.\nCulture Addict Inflatable Pool - Fits 3 adults comfortably.\nThe future of Alma Ocean is limitless. Its long-term plans include expanding product variety, evolving product design to incorporate innovative engineering, developing consumer connections, and increasing awareness for water safety. Alma Ocean strives to be the resource on everything related to water activities. Whether someone needs to learn how to swim, wants to enhance their swimming experience, or wants to upcycle their current water products, Alma Ocean will be their destination.\nIn production phase\n\nTo say thanks to everyone who makes a contribution to this campaign, we are offering Alma Ocean products through this campaign before we offer them anywhere else. Contribute now and help us create wealth in the black community \u2013 supporting a group of black entrepreneurs who are building a business that means something.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nIn addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for what we are doing by sharing a link to the campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people hear about Alma Ocean today, the smoother our launch is going to go.

Being in the water is healing for your mind, body, and soul. A little history on our OG leaf float, this one is special to us. We asked our designer to give us something that speaks to culture. He looked up leaf patterns in Africa and BOOM, low and behold the OG leaf float was born. We call this float OG because Its original and unique design left us with no choice but to put it at the top of our list. P.S.

Here lie the remnants of the First Born, an advanced civilization that conquered the galaxy long ago but have since been dormant, waiting for the younger species to take their first steps into space.\nThis sleep wasn\u2019t dreamless, and over the millennia the First Born were slowly driven mad. Fanatical and paranoid, they have learned to fear and despise the new species that they once longed for.\nWhen the Traders arrived in a seemingly abandoned asteroid field to pick over the bones of a long-dead people, the First Born were awoken\u2026\nCore Space: First Born is a sci-fi miniatures board game in which you control a band of Traders venturing into the ancient First Born temples. The game takes place on the highly- detailed 3D board included in the box. Your Traders must explore the area, fulfil their objectives, salvage what they can and then escape back to their ship, spending their earnings on desperately-needed repairs. The exciting campaign system will track your crew from game to game, developing their skills, upgrading their equipment and immersing you in their story.\nFirst Born is based on last year\u2019s cyberpunk bestseller Core Space (see \u2018What is Core Space?\u2019 below for full details) but is a fully standalone starter set playable by new and existing players alike. It retains the same simple core mechanics and our unique \u2018real search\u2019 system while seamlessly integrating this new and mysterious alien race.\nTo find out more about the gameplay, download the rules HERE or check out the playthrough videos further down the page.\nThe Crew of the Eidolon \u2013 these incredible characters are just some of the 32mm scale plastic minis included in the box (supplied unpainted).\nThis time the narrative campaign in the starter set is built for a single crew and playable co-op and solo \u2013 something that\u2019s long been requested for the game! It is of course fully compatible with the existing range of crews and expansions as well as our wide selection of terrain. All Core Space expansions and boosters are modular so you can mix and match them for a fully customisable experience, from a solo RPG-style adventure to a full-on 6-player PvP skirmish.\nTo win you will need to follow the Trader credo:\nSALVAGE // TRADE // ADAPT // SURVIVE\nCore Space is a fully self-contained skirmish game \u2013 everything you need to play the game, including a 2\u2019/60cm square neoprene mat covered in our award-winning modular terrain (no glue or paint required!), is included in the starter set. Established players will be excited to hear that all of the miniatures, terrain and equipment in the box are brand-new, expanding on the huge Core Space universe with never-seen-before settings, characters and stories.\nLet\u2019s find out a bit more about the two pledges on offer:\n You can find Xanadib's latest Pledge Calculator HERE.\nHave you been living under an asteroid?

Genetically engineered to be the most intelligent form of First Born; millions of years without stimulus has atrophied their once-great minds. In a real sense this has reduced them to little more than beasts, but they are extremely powerful and near indestructible.\nThis expansion includes one of these True Gods. It\u2019s the biggest miniature we have ever made for Core Space and stands over 120mm tall! It\u2019s designed to straddle the terrain, representing its phenomenal power to reform the living rock of the surrounding chambers it as it moves. Flanked by its two hulking Guardians and with brand-new missions to tell its story, this is a challenge your Traders can\u2019t afford to miss. \nThe Gates of Ry'sa are a network of interlinked portals to other worlds, times or alternate realities. The gates are not wormholes like Lagrange points nor tears in time and space like Core Space; instead the gates imprint a galactic 'map' on the traveller's own neural network to alter its place in time, space and reality.\nThe First Born primarily use the Gates to travel between asteroids within their own star system, and they keep this technology heavily guarded from intruders\u2026\nThe Gates of Ry\u2019sa is a brand-new expansion to Core Space First Born that adds these gates to the game along with some powerful new First Born threats \u2013 the Talos and the Cerberosa. See Update 11 for full details.\nThe new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders attempt to secure one of these gates for themselves before passing through it to reach yet more undiscovered treasures in the more distant First Born asteroid bases. New equipment and mining opportunities await amongst the incredible new terrain pieces included in this set. The gates are housed in enormous caverns large enough for all manner of creatures to come through, and the shifting colours in the energy pylons make for an eye-catching centrepiece to your gaming table. New event cards shuffled into the deck will represent the reality-shifting nature of the nearby gate.\nThe expansion can be added to your pledge for just \u00a331 (see Add-ons below for full details).\nTrading Post 5 is a waystation hastily established in a crater on an abandoned asteroid just beyond the Lagrange Point. Here an enterprising Captain can hire traders, mercenaries and other useful hands and stock up on fuel, machines, equipment and weapons in a eclectic bazaar of stores, workshops, bars and dens of iniquity.\nThe outpost attracts a colourful assortment of dubious characters and ne'er do wells; exactly the sort of tough, shifty types you'd expect in the final outpost before untold wealth or grisly death!\nTrading Post 5 is a new expansion for Core Space that brings the Traders back out of the asteroid temples and introduces a host of new characterful NPCs. See Update 21 for full details.\nThe new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders visit the Trading Post hoping for a big score from their recently acquired alien loot. They can peruse the stores, meet with contacts, and even recruit new Traders to their cause. However, the aliens that they so rudely awakened have followed them back\u2026 Can they defend the settlement from its attackers trying to reclaim their asteroid home?\nThe new terrain in the set forms part of Trading Post 5 and is made up of shops and cargo in pre-fab containers. The expansion is populated by new NPCs, including Civilians, a lone Galactic Corps agent, the Ganger proprietor of the Trading Post, and four new playable Traders!\nThe expansion can be added to your pledge for just \u00a331 (see Add-ons below for full details).\nTo add an item to your pledge, simply increase the total amount of your pledge by the cost of the item.

The next stage is getting them tooled and produced, with many samples stages along the way to ensure quality. We predict that we will begin shipping in autumn 2021. However, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China, especially if any components do not meet our high quality standards during production. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nBy backing this campaign you acknowledge that the final product may vary slightly from the prototypes shown in the images, due to tooling tolerances or artwork improvements during production. We will notify backers of any major changes should they occur.\n\nWe are aiming to deliver this Kickstarter in full in advance of the retail release date.

Be careful though, as an alliance can only last so long. Only one player can be crowned the most victorious. Be ready to strategize, calculate, backstab and deceive the other players to victory.\nEach player takes a set of 5 Ships and 5 Cargo cards in the color of their choice.  Each player places their Cargo in front of themselves in a row, with the value face down.  Players can place their Cargo cards in any order they choose.  Place a Ship card on top of each Cargo card, with the Ship side up.\nShuffle the main deck, deal 5 cards to each player face down.  Place the remaining cards face down in the center of the play area.\nThe player that travelled the furthest today goes first.\nPlayers take turns in clockwise order.  The active player may take any of the following actions in any order.\nPlay a single Crisis card\nPlay Crew cards\nPlay Command cards\nTrade card(s) with other players\n  A player that plays no cards, may discard their entire hand.\nAfter each turn, the active player will check for Crisis that still has a Crisis card attached. If that player ends their turn with a Crisis card attached to a SHIP, that SHIP is destroyed and its Cargo is lost.  The Cargo attached to that Ship will not be counted towards their score at the end of the game. The active player then draws from the Main Deck until they have 5 cards in hand, before proceeding to the next player.\n\n\n\nAfter you complete all of your actions, your turn ends.  Any of your Ships with Crisis cards still attached are now destroyed.  Flip over the affected ship, revealing the destroyed side, leaving the cargo in place underneath it.  Discard the Crisis card and any Crew cards that were attached to that ship.\nDestroyed Ships are out of play for the rest of the game.  The attached Cargo underneath the destroyed Ship must remain concealed and will not count towards your final score.\nAfter removing any destroyed Ships, draw from the main deck until you have 5 cards in hand.\nThe game ends when a single player's entire fleet is destroyed.  Everyone else will score points for Cargo attached to their Ships that are not destroyed.\nPlayers will flip over their undestroyed Cargo and total up the points.  The player with the highest sum of points is the winner.\nIf multiple players have the same sum of points, the player with the most intact Ships wins the tie.  If there is still a tie, the player with the most Crew cards attached to their Ships wins the tie.\nSpace TrailBlazer: Standard Game- Backing this reward will get you a copy of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals with an early bird discount.\nStandard Game - Backing this reward will get you a copy of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals.\nSharing is Caring - Backing this reward will get you two copies of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals.\nShare the Love - Double the fun!

With decision branching, you\u2019ll be able to make choices while you listen that could change your story\u2014just like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. \nForteller\u2019s previous work includes Gloomhaven, Frosthaven, Jaws of the Lion, and The Isofarian Guard. So, your legend is in safe hands!\nListen to a sample of Forteller Games' audio for Bardsung:\nBecause Bardsung can be played as a campaign game, the custom Game Trayz insert (unlocked on Day 1) will keep everything from your core box organised between play sessions\u2014so you can pick up right where you left off.\nImage shown is for illustration purpose only. Actual product may vary due to product enhancement.\nLegends are heroes who have adventures worth singing about.\nIn a world where being sung of by bards is the mark of a true hero, you begin with a single tile, a destination, and the desire to become songworthy. What unfolds is a labyrinthine dungeon of your creation, filled with dangerous enemies, wandering monsters, challenging puzzles, and valuable treasure.\n\nThe immersion of roleplaying games meets the elegance of board game mechanics in an epic 50+ hour campaign. \nInspired by dungeon-crawling and roleplaying classics, Bardsung is a cooperative dungeon explorer for 1-5 players that combines the best elements of both with contemporary gameplay to create a powerful new experience.\nInspire the songs.\nDescend into the depths of an ancient forge, building your dungeon and creating your legend as you explore\u2014with no game master needed. As you venture through the ruined halls, you'll face the strange and terrible creatures that call the darkness home...\nLive your legend.\nFrom your path through the dungeon to the growth of your character into a fabled hero, the decisions you make and directions you take will evolve your story.\nBecome Bardsung.\nWith multiple potential paths through the depths, you can always return to take a different route. Play through again and again, hero. The ancient forge is a warren of secrets waiting to be discovered, and your legend is just beginning!\n Bardsung is a game of pathways. \nFrom your physical journey through the ancient forge to your metaphorical journey of building your character into a fabled hero, your choices define your experience.\nExplore the dungeon in standalone sessions, or as part of a narrative campaign that evolves based on your decisions.\nEach dungeon has a way in and a way out. The journey between is up to you.\nWith swift setup, a procedurally generated dungeon, and easy-to-grasp mechanics taught by an intuitive tutorial-based rulebook, your descent into the depths will be quick...\n\nTo hasten your descent, the hero you choose will have a starting role in the party\u2014but how they progress is up to you. You have the freedom to either follow their suggested path, or create your own bespoke hero with a unique set of traits and arsenal of attack combos.\nRead more on Levelling Up\nA classless path system lets you build the hero you want, your way.

Because each adventure includes its own dungeon and takes around 45-90mins to play, adventures can be played as one shots or as part of a campaign.\nRegardless, the choices you make while exploring will change your story, from the secrets you uncover to the way the adventure ends\u2014which, in campaign play, leads you to the next adventure...\nIn a hidden vault, you\u2019ll find set cards that are unlocked by your choices as your game goes on. Perhaps you find a dwarf prisoner, chained to a wall. Free them, and you\u2019ll draw a numbered card from the vault and shuffle into one of the decks.

Aspect decks evolve with your campaign, and can create lasting and long-ranging effects.\nRead more about the Aspect Decks\nAs you walk the ruined halls, you'll face strange creatures that call the darkness home. \nControlled by simple and intuitive AI, enemy behaviours are varied and quick to resolve. Be wary, for enemy behaviour will change as you move deeper into the forge and your foes adapt to your presence.\nJust like your hero, enemies can level up, evolve their attacks, and can even learn to hold grudges against heroes who defeat them.\nEnter intelligent and dangerous combat featuring cooperative combo play that goes beyond simply moving toward an enemy and rolling dice each turn. \nIn a zone-based system that emphasises freedom of movement, teamwork and positioning are vital to solving the combat puzzles created by battle aspect cards, which are unique to each encounter.\nBattle aspect cards modify combat encounters. Be wary of cards that grant enemies more dangerous attacks, such as poisoned weapons, or add more enemies through either a sudden ambush or time-delayed reinforcements. \nYou'll need to adapt to the changing state of play, hero\u2014but your abilities can't be used over and over, so choose your moment wisely!\nRead more about Combat\nRound length, turns, and enemy activations are governed by a dynamic marching order that will keep you on your toes, encouraging you to adopt strategies that control the ebb and flow of initiative.\nThe marching order determines initiative each round and refreshes each turn. Combat can be unpredictable\u2014the marching order is a second battleground you can use to control the chaos, so manipulate it to your advantage!\nRead more about the Marching Order\nPerform heroic deeds to gain fate that can be used to power special abilities. Any fate you earn is shared amongst your party, so working together is key.\n\nAnd speaking of fate, darkness can descend with the roll of a die. \nAs you build your dungeon, you may find yourself needing to double back\u2014perhaps you missed some loot, or an aspect card triggered an earthquake that blocked your route.\nYet turning back may not be so simple. The dungeon may be yours to explore, but you aren't the only inhabitants. Wandering monsters stalk the halls, their movements signalled by echo tokens that come ever closer. \nKept at bay only by closed doors, the nature of the beast won't be revealed until the last moment...\nRead more about Wandering Monsters and Mini Bosses\nExploration\nCombat\nAspect Decks\nMarching Order\nWandering Monsters\nLevelling Up Heroes\nExample Hero Builds\nWeapons & Equipment\nCampaign System\nAlternative Endings\nMini Bosses\n\nEverything you get in Bardsung: Legend of the Ancient Forge!\n\nWe\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs.

Keep in mind that these costs could change based on the total number of stretch goals unlocked during the campaign. Once the campaign is finished and you\u2019ve confirmed your address and any add-ons, your accurate shipping cost will be calculated in the pledge manager.\nSadly, due to customs, import laws, and other restrictions, Steamforged is unable to ship pledge rewards to these locations (see point 10 of terms).\nBecause of the size of the package, we\u2019re also unable to ship to P.O. Boxes.\nKeep in mind that any pledges confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from our UK hub at a later date. For non-UK backers, this will likely increase shipping costs.\nFor the regions listed as \u2018friendly shipping\u2019, we cover any VAT or sales tax charges. So, those are accounted for in the pledge price and shipping estimations. \n                                                               Backers in other regions will be liable for any VAT or sales taxes which may be applied in their own countries. There will be no extra costs for VAT charged in the pledge manager.\nBelow is a rough schedule of when you can expect key things to happen once the campaign ends. This schedule should give you an idea of when your payment card will be charged, and when shipping is likely to begin. Because circumstances are different from project to project, this timeline is estimated based on our experience.\nWe want to get your rewards into your hands as soon as possible. Because of the potential for unexpected effects on planning and production schedules, there\u2019s a chance you might not get your rewards before the game is available at retail.

You can then spend the Credits to do extra actions.\nThe Ghost Piece expansion adds 24 new puzzles with unique shapes and new reward mechanics. There are also 3 new types of level-5 pieces, the Ghost Pieces. This expansion enhances the replayability of Project L and opens new strategic options for you to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Add-ons?

It\u2019s because of your continuous involvement and interest in our games that we amass enough energy and motivation to push our projects further ahead. As a thank you, we\u2019re including a special promo pack in all our Kickstarter campaigns that our ambassadors get for free!\nYou will automatically receive Project L: Finesse Ambassador Pack for free if:\nYou have pledged during the first 72 hours of the campaign,\nYou have supported any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns, or\nYou were subscribed to our newsletter before this Kickstarter campaign launched.\n\n  Looking back to the original campaign in 2018, Project L went a long way. Two years ago, thanks to the support of all the amazing backers, we've fully unlocked all Stretch Goals that allowed us to produce the game in a shape and quality we had never dreamed of. There's not much that could be added or upgraded \u2014 just look at what the backers and reviewers say!\nWhen it comes to the Finesse expansion, we had no other option than to follow the quality of Project L & Ghost Piece (not that we wouldn't like that), so Finesse is already coming to Kickstarter in a super-maximized mode.\nWe prefer to not add anything superficial, untested, or not fitting the content that's been originally planned for the game. And since mostly everything has been already added to the game, the inevitable result is that this campaign is Stretch Goal free.\nOn the other hand, the journey towards making Project L a reality has been so exciting that we just love the idea of sharing it with you in full detail (in even more detail than that the backers of the original campaign remember!). To accomplish that, we\u2019ve prepared a series of behind-the-scenes stories as well as making-of interviews.\nStay tuned for the project updates!\nSince the original campaign from 2018, we\u2019ve partnered with Paul Grogan from Gaming Rules!, a professional rulebook writer & editor, to enhance and streamline the way you can learn to play Project L. Furthermore, focusing on the feedback we\u2019ve received since the first version of the game, we\u2019ve also perfected the rules in terms of game mechanics\u2014mostly concerning the player actions and endgame. \nCheck out the Revised Rules 2.0 (WIP).\nPrinted Revised Rulebook (2.0):\n comes automatically with all pledge levels! So, if you're a backer of the original campaign and are now pledging for the Returning Backer rewards (just the Finesse expansion), you'll receive the physical revised rulebook 2.0 as well.\nincludes the rules of Project L (base game) and all expansions in a single book.\nincludes updated player aids,\nis printed on premium soft-touch paper (that you know from the original campaign).\nis available in English only (see below for more details).\nWe're proud to announce that Asmodee will localize and manufacture Project L (base game) and also distribute it in retail.\nIf you're interested in a localized retail version of the base game, get in touch with your local branch of Asmodee for details about if/when they are releasing Project L in your country and/or language. Since the localization is now in the hands of Asmodee, we're no longer allowed to produce non-English versions of the game.\nPlease note, however, that the retail version by Asmodee and this Kickstarter version by Boardcubator are two separate product lines run by two separate companies. While there's a good chance that the content of one will be compatible with the other, we cannot guarantee that.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager.\nFriendly Shipping \u2014 We offer friendly shipping to the EU, US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Backers from these regions won't spend additional money on customs or other import fees. Based on any given region, we will either ship your reward directly from within the country or will fully cover all potential import fees you might get charged for. \nAdditional Copy Shipping Discount \u2014 If you're interested in getting an additional copy of Project L or one of the expansion, you will spare on shipping for the subsequent copy thanks to reduced rates. Check the table for the discount.\n\nIf you're interested in getting an additional copy of the game, check out the Shipping section for shipping discounts.\nBigger Groups \u2014 If you\u2019d like to pledge for even more copies, get in touch with us at sales@boardcubator.com and we'll get back to you with a special offer.\nJan \"Suki\" Soukal \u2014 Co-founder of Boardcubator who left his day job in IT security a few years ago to become an independent board game creator.

However, we believe that with the experience we have from the previous campaigns, we will successfully overcome any obstacles that might come up.\n\n\u20ac1 PLEDGE \u2014 If you aren\u2019t decided which pledge level you want, just rewrite the pledge amount to \u20ac1.

Rulebooks, game boxes, player aids, and puzzle boards have scratch resistant varnish or lamination that ensures that these components will last a long time under frequent use. Based on hundreds of rounds of playtesting, we have gradually improved the technological aspect of puzzle boards into their current 5-layer structure.\n\nThe base game is readily expandable without the need to make any component changes or upgrades to the base game that would require releasing a new version of the game. All expansions of the game can be mixed together.\nReusability and recyclability\nGiven the durability and material quality of the components in the game, Project L will last a long time before it starts showing signs of use or general material deterioration. In the rare case a component gets damaged, we will provide replacement parts.\nSustainable materials\nProject L holds Verification of Conformity according to the EU Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC, which declares the game as safe for children and parents to play with and also verifies that there are no physical / mechanical, flammability, or chemical risks.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPanda GM, the manufacturer of Project L pays extreme attention to worker comfort and safety standards with a fully air-conditioned environment, while being BSCI social compliance certified and following the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.\nSustainable Distribution\nBased on our previous experience with successfully fulfilling Kickstarter projects, we are constantly optimizing the shipping routes to make sure that the distance the game travels is as short as possible. We use several distribution hubs and fulfillment companies to make sure that packages are shipped in bulk where possible before the last mile delivery to our backers.

For this reason, we have carefully selected our manufacturers and with them we are committed to optimizing and defining every single content of the Soulgivers box according to high standards, both for the prints and for the game elements.\n\nWe give particular importance to the chosen finishes and materials, because we want the visual and physical aspect of the game to be part of the experience itself. But we are also putting all of our energies into this project. All of our energies go to a collaboration with an Italian company that has been dealing with imports for over 40 years, which financed the first prototypes and financially supported Soulgivers to get to where we are today. With their experience, we are confident that we can better manage any aspect of production and imports from China, with the upmost attention to safety, with Quality Control on site. \n\nWe believe in our project so much that we have opened a company dedicated to the design of board games, operational since July 2020: Gravity Games. \n\nMoreover, today Soulgivers is already in an advanced phase of its production.

See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs.\nFailure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.\nIf you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company.\nINTERNATIONAL DELIVERY NOTE: No physical rewards are offered to international backers. If the project closes successfully, we will offer the Random Fun Generator book through Amazon's print-on-demand service*, which will make it cheaper for you to purchase the print books (shipping will cost a lot less).\nWe continue to search for reliable, economical solutions to international Kickstarter delivery.\n* As a perfect-bound book, not a wire-bound title.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSteve Jackson Games is an established game publisher with a successful track record and we have enough Kickstarter experience to deal with issues should they arise.

To reduce the chance of delays, we are limiting physical rewards to U.S. only.\n\nNow it's time for you to tell us whether or not to complete the project.
