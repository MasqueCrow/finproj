Cold-blooded betrayal has never been so much fun!\nWe played over 100 games at UK Games Expo with overwhelmingly positive feedback. With the art and design complete, we need to raise \u00a33000 to get Game of Blame professionally printed.\n        Choose from one of six Roles. Advanced rules add unique abilities to further your ambitions.\n  Each turn you raise Issues by playing up to 3 cards onto the Blame pile. Each Issue played must share at least one emblem with the card beneath it. The number of Issues you play triggers an event:\nPlay no issues, draw 3 cards\nPlay 1, draw 1 card\nPlay 2, swap 2 Roles\nPlay 3, accuse another player\nIf an Issue\u2019s emblem matches your Role\u2019s emblem \u2013 it is your responsibility.\nWhen you accuse someone you both go through the Blame pile and count up your responsibilities. If the accused player has more, they take the Blame pile. Otherwise you must take the Blame!\nAfter someone has taken the Blame, the other players may take advantage of the confusion by burying a secret. Take a card from your hand and hide it under your Role card.\nPlay then restarts with the blamed player turning over a card to start a new blame pile and then taking a normal turn.\nThe game ends immediately when the draw pile is empty. Everyone counts up the Issues in their hand that match their current Role and add 6 for each Treason card. The higher your score, the worse your punishment.

We're giving you an extra pair free to compensate.\n      Having stumbled upon a study by social psychologist Dr. Adam Galinsky proving colorful socks literally change the way we think, act and how others perceive us, we knew we had to test the theory.\nWe created a batch of incredible socks and went to work. We found those wearing colorful socks received 427% more comments on how well they dressed and 97% of people wearing Bryt Socks felt happier and more confident! \nAs a result of our research and requests for more designs we injected 8 proven features into the drab sock and created the ultimate 25 designs. Bryt Socks say - 'I know the rules and I\u2019m confident enough to break them.'\nSee what our founding community from June 2015 had to say.\nAfter our first campaign we shipped over 10,000 socks from a limited range of 9 designs in the most unforgettable boxes on the planet. Our backers said:\nSo we listened, enhanced the technology and brought you more enviable designs to choose from.\nWhether you're at work, the gym or its time to play, Bryt Socks 2.0 will make you the standout performer and centre of attention.\nSince our first campaign in 2015 we've got much better at producing the ultimate colourful sock. We're now able to bring you more designs for a better value at up to 51% off retail prices.\n  Prices shown in USD and EURO are approximate conversions from GBP. \nOnce the project ends, we'll send you a Backer Survey to gather your design and size choices. Pick how many pairs you want at this stage.\n    Bryt means - BOLD\n  9 designs wasn't enough. With plenty of requests for more we created the ultimate 25 designs.\n  25 Awesome Designs\nWe learnt that shipping charges feel bad but are essential to receiving your product. As a compromise we're throwing in an extra pair for International backers and complimentary shipping for all UK pledges.\n      We have partnered with Playtonic, a fellow British Kickstarter-funded company to dream up the merchandise item you\u2019ve all been waiting for\u2026 limited edition Yooka-Laylee socks!\nTo buy a pair, select a reward tier between 1 - 9 pairs and when our campaign ends you can choose your size and design options in the post campaign backer survey. You\u2019ll want to keep a pair fresh for when Yooka-Laylee arrives.\nThey're crafted in the same material with the same added features as the rest of our range of 25 designs.

That is why I have turned to Kickstarter\u2122 to turn this University project that has expressed my ambitions and utmost dedication, into a fully fledged video game.\nWithin the Metro Manager game, players will take command of a Metro Station and utilise pathways, escalators, elevators, CCTV, Staff and much more, to run an efficient, profitable and most importantly, safe Metro Station.  In order to do this, players must be able to satisfy an important criteria of 5 demands:\nSafety - This is determined by how secure your Station is to vandalism, theft and emergency situations.\nSanitation - This is determined by how clean your Station is. Litter, puddles and footprints are only some of the circumstances that negate this demand.\nAvailability - The more amenities your Station offers your Commuters in the form of Vending Machines, Advertising, Ticket Booths or Coffee Shops, the better this demand is satisfied.\nReliability - Commuters in the Metro Manager world love a fully staffed Station. Absence of Station Staff  will hamper this demand.\nAccessibility - Commuters prefer a quick transit between the entrance, to the platform. If your Commuters are left wandering aimlessly around your Station, confused as to where the platform is, this demand will plummet.\nOf course, satisfying these demands is only half the battle! Each demand will at some point, cause ramifications for another. For example, satisfying the Safety rating will inevitably cause Accessibility to drop, as the precautions, such as installed Ticket Barriers to ward off freeloaders will increase Safety, but also decrease the time it takes to transit between Entrance and Station.\nPlayers will make money in the Metro Manager game through ticket sales, and may also acquire further funding from third party sponsors, such as installing a Bicycle Hire outside your station, to encourage more people to commute more efficiently, whilst pocketing the profit made from the freedom of choice.\nIn terms of what I am raising funds for now, is to get Metro Manager actually rolling as a game. Most, if not all of the in-game assets have been drawn out, and digitally rendered to my satisfaction, and the logic of the game is also complete, now I turn it to the kindness and gratitude of our Patron's to help me get this game - for lack of a better phrase - on track!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a Game Programmer, my skills in C# coding as well as with handling the Unity game engine (of which I am hoping to build the game on) are primitive, at best. I still need a lot of education within those realms, however I remain optimistic as I am not a person to easily back down from something I know next to nothing about. This is my dream and I am going to do everything I can to the letter, to ensure it's delivered on time.\n\nAs for when I imagine Metro Manager to be released, I am hoping for a early 2017 release, ideally January.

She is not easily pleased, but what god is? To prove your worth you must perform sacrifices according to Inanna\u2019s sacred rituals. Place your workers in workshops to gain resources and goats. Offer up the resources to Inanna and use the goats to trade for new workshops and abilities. Only the swiftest and cleverest noble will become the ruler of Sumer.\nA worker placement video game! \nSumer takes the board game mechanic of worker placement to a new level. Each day, you and your competitors will awaken at dawn to begin your worship. Run and jump around the ziggurat to place your workers so they'll collect resources. You only have 2 workers, so you better figure out your strategy, move fast, and claim workshops before your friends beat you to it!\nReal-Time Dynamic Auctions! \nWhoever is willing to sacrifice the most goats gets Inanna's blessing! The auction is simple \u2014 just move left or right to change your bid in real time. Each auction is a mind game of bluffing and bravado, and you never know an item\u2019s real price until time is up! Trick your opponents into overpaying for their bids while you snag good bargains for your own!\n                                                       For an in-depth look at the basics of how the game is played, check out our gameplay explanation video:\n1-4 players - Play local with up to 4 players. Master playing solo or try to beat up to three of your friends.\nDevious AI - A variety of personalities and skill levels makes the game a challenge for any player.\nOnline multiplayer - Much of the development funding from this Kickstarter will go towards letting you test your skills online against friends and strangers.\nComfortable game length - With a game experience of 20 to 30 minutes, Sumer plays in a fraction of the time of a comparable strategy board game.\nInfinitely replayable - Randomized setup and a huge variety of different auction items make each playthrough a unique strategic experience.\nNuanced strategies - There is no single key to winning. Being quick on your feet and making smart long-term investments are both crucial to victory. \nSumerian culture - We\u2019ve worked with professional historians to bring you the ancient civilization that invented writing, beer, and board games.\nCustomizable gameplay - Play the way you want by turning on variants like Big Head mode and Hidden Auction Items.\nYour controls - The game can be played with controllers, mouse and keyboard, all at the same time! \n\nWe wanted to make sure that playing Sumer felt like playing a board game designed from the ground up to be a video game. While there are digital versions of existing board games, we wanted to make something that took advantage of the affordances of video games - in other words, a board game that could only ever be digital.\nThe two board game mechanics at Sumer\u2019s core are worker placement and auctions. We gave each of them a digital twist to bring them to video games. \nEach mechanic has its own phase, and the two are deeply intertwined. Use the worker placement phase to compete for points and prepare for the auction. Then, use the auction phase to build your strategy with items that will help you get more points in the next worker placement phase. Learning to take advantage of both phases is therefore key to victory.\n \n\nAs ancient civilizations go, Sumer is pretty obscure. Heck, most people think it\u2019s called \"Sumeria\". That\u2019s understandable, since the culture was lost and forgotten until only about 150 years ago. \nWith the help of historians and our own research, we drew from a wealth of Sumerian culture and mythology that inspired the mechanics and visuals in our game. We hope you get to know this intriguing ancient culture while playing.\n\nDid you know that Sumerians...\n\n...invented writing? Originally used for counting bushels of barley, the written Sumerian language, like Latin, was used for thousands of years after their culture came to an end.\n...built the first cities in the world? We actually chose Sumer as our setting because we wanted to create the sense of building up a city from nothing.\n...invented both beer-brewing and the drinking straw? They used huge straws to sip beer out of massive pots without having to drink the muddy part at the top.\n...wrote the world\u2019s first literature? They composed the cycle of Gilgamesh stories which became the basis for the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered the earliest great literary work.\n\nGugalanna, Bull of Heaven\n\nAtmospheric Music\nAlthough we know what materials and instruments the Sumerians used, nobody knows exactly what their music sounded like. Armed with contemporary research and the few surviving examples of ancient Mesopotamian music, composer Neil Quillen has created a beautiful, atmospheric soundtrack. Try giving our title screen music a listen:\n                                      UPDATE: \nFor $75 you can get the FOUR NOBLES and a t-shirt!\nFor $500 you can voice goats, workers, sound effects and music. A special option will be available in game that turns on your set of custom sound effects.\nIf we hit our goal of $25,000, we will release the great game of Sumer on PC and Mac. But even more funding gives us the possibility of adding additional features and would allow us to bring the game to more platforms.\nWe formed Studio Wumpus to explore the exciting possibilities of digital board games. If we combined the social experience and elegant systems of board games with the visceral thrill of video games, what sort of new experiences could we create?\nWe\u2019ve been working on Sumer for the better part of 2 years. The game was jointly designed by the four members of the team, with each member taking over an important development role as we progressed. Although the initial phases of development were supported by the NYU Game Center Incubator, we've been working independently without external funding since fall 2015.\nWho are we?\nOur core team consists of four people: Misha Favorov, Sig Gunnarsson, Josh Raab and Geoff Suthers. We handle the design, code, and implementation of everything in the game.\nWe have been working with several freelancers to create our stunning visuals and music, including artists Jet Landis and Adam Alexander, and composer Neil Quillen.\nWe are in the final stretch of the game development process, but there is plenty left to do in the next few months. That is why we need your help!\nThe greatest task ahead of us is implementing online multiplayer, but we will also be commissioning art, music, and voice-over work and adding that last bit of extra polish to the game. Visual feedback and high-quality voice acting gives better cues to players, helps with learning the game, and creates a more engaging experience for both players and spectators.\n\nSumer is a game about its community of players, something we want to share with as many people as possible, and we feel that online play is vital towards letting Sumer reach its potential. The more people that play it and master its strategy, the better it will be for the community.\n\n\nWe were Greenlit by our amazing community in just 8 days! We\u2019ll get Sumer up on Steam Early Access within the next few of months and once it\u2019s up, you will get constant updates on the game until we release it at the end of the year.\nA successful Kickstarter campaign means we are able to implement online multiplayer and get the game to it's community in less time. It will let us continue working with our incredible freelance talent for more great art, music, and voice-over work. It will let us make our best version of Sumer. The finish line is in sight, and we can get there with your help.\n www.sumergame.com | Facebook | Twitter | Steam Greenlight", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is always a risk to making a whole new kind of game like Sumer. Breaking new ground means that there haven\u2019t been many games we can look to for guidance. The good news is, we\u2019ve already spent the time figuring most of this stuff out. We\u2019ve iterated continually on our user interface to make the game easier to learn and understand so that players can enjoy the fast-paced gameplay. Of course, nothing is perfect, and there may be unexpected delays as we make improvements based on feedback from the Early Access community.\n\nBeing a new game studio also has its challenges. We have a strong background in game development, but this will be the first time we\u2019re self-publishing on Steam or consoles. We expect some kinks in getting the game onto all target platforms, but our network of game developer friends and contacts will help us get those sorted out quickly.\n\nRest assured: Sumer will be released. If unexpected delays accumulate and funds deplete, we will still work hard to get this great game into your hands.

Using some of the world's most beautiful works of art, players complete these masterpieces using transparent cubes in an attempt to become famous artists. It takes about 40-60 minutes (approximately 20 minutes per player).\nStarving Artists is played over a series of turns. Each turn represents a new day. On each day, you must choose between: buying new canvases, painting the canvases you already own, or working in order to get more paint. If at the end of the day, you've completed a masterpiece, you can sell it to earn more paint and food.

But, you'll be competing in the limited marketplace for paintings with anyone else who wants to sell.

Players take turns launching their squadrons, dogfighting in space, firing torpedoes at the enemy carrier, and escaping back to their own mothership. There, they reload, refuel, and line up on the flight deck to launch on another mission. It's a Sci-Five Minute game, built on the Unity Engine, that you won\u2019t want to miss!\nHow It's Played\nBoth sides begin the game with:\n1 Frigate - a support ship that maintains a defensive line against incoming enemy fighters and bombers, and can help recover damaged ships\n3 Starfighters - starships that are purpose-built for shooting down enemy fighters, but can be used to torpedo the enemy mothership\n3 Torpedo boats - heavy attack starships that are purpose-built for taking out the mothership, but can be used to shoot down enemy fighters\nPlayers get a dice roll on their turn and have a number of options available to them according to the result. Some numbers give you multiple options, so you'll have to choose which to do.\n1-3 Activate a Squadron - Advance a launched squadron this many spaces towards the enemy carrier. If the squadron is within this many spaces of the enemy carrier, it fires a torpedo at the enemy then turns and begins the trip home.\n3-5 Activate the Carrier - Advance a squadron one space in your own carrier. Squadrons need to be recovered upon arrival, then moved from the flight deck to the hangar bay to be refueled and rearmed, then returned to the flight deck for launch.\n5-6 Activate the Frigate - Move the frigate one space in either direction. The frigate acts as a support ship, shooting at enemy spacecraft and repairing damaged friendly spacecraft. Each starship counter is double sided. One side has a squadron at full strength, the other has the squadron damaged.\nDamaged squadrons cannot move or shoot, but they still occupy that space on the board. If your frigate can get to them in time, the squadron can be repaired and continue its mission. If any enemy gets a hit on a damaged squadron, it is destroyed and removed from the game. The first player to eliminate all enemy squadrons from the game wins.\nBackground on the Project and Team\n\nPocket Option Games- In 2015 board game artist Chris Ferguson, set out to solve\u2026well a SMALL problem. Board games had been increasing in size, weight, and price, so much that many people could not afford them; this is especially true in many countries where the costs of shipping are more than the entire board game. In 1977, Metagaming Concepts introduced microgames: a hex map, a counter sheet, and a rule booklet, all in a ziplock bag for $2.95. They were accessible, playable, and portable. Unfortunately, Metagaming went bankrupt after 9 years. Chris formed Pocket Option to pick up where they left creating small, lightweight, fun games that could be designed quickly (1-2 months) and delivered worldwide for $11.62 or less (roughly the same $2.95 adjusted for inflation). After 7 successful Kickstarted projects microgames, including Carrier Commander, he is glad to see that the micro-gaming fan base is still out there.\nHappy Day Games The lead Developer and Publisher of this project Happy Day Games has helped more than 30 teams with production of mobile titles and like Pocket Option, is accustomed to short development cycles and believes they can compete the digital version of the game in a 3 month time frame and launched as a free-to-play product with an Early Access launch in July 2016. If the Kickstarter for Carrier Commander: Digital Edition is successful both studios plan to continue to work together to bring the rest of Pocket Games\u2019 library to its mobile fans.\n\nThe Kickstarter Plan\nOf the $25,000 the goal, the majority of funds ($15,000) will go towards funding the 4-man, three month development costs for Happy Day Games required to build the basic game described above. The remaining funds cover addition QA and bugtesting costs, game-related services, Kickstarter processing fees, and a small amount of marketing expenses. We plan to ultimately release Carrier Commander: Digital Edition as a free to play game, potentially with some in-game purchases but nothing that would have any bearing on gameplay mechanics.\nAllocation of Funds\nJust like the microgames we\u2019re working on, we want to keep this Kickstarter simple, inexpensive, realistic in scope. With only three funding tiers ($5, $10, $35) we don\u2019t want to ask too much from anyone. This is the first of what we hope will be many mobile microgames and we just want to see it get off the ground.. We\u2019ve picked a few stretch goals at what we think are reasonable funding tiers. Each in-game feature will likely add another month of development if achieved and another $5,000 in monthly development expenses: -\n$30,000 \u2013 Expand the scope to design Carrier Commander: Digital Edition and all in-game objects in 3D (for just $5,000 more than the original target!)\n$35,000 \u2013 Port the game to PC on the WIndowsd\n$40,000 \u2013 Add in-game DLC support and new cosmetic skins for different ships.\nWe will likely add a few more stretch goals to this list in the first week of the Kickstarter and we want to invite our backers and fans to tell us what other game-features they might be interested. If the the budget it there we\u2019ll put the work in. Regardless of whether the scope of the project expands to include these features, we still expect to deliver the Early Access version of the base game to our backers sometime in July.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAside from raising the funding, we don\u2019t\u2019 foresee anything standing in the way of the game getting out on time.

I had started a daily exercise - thinking of a new game concept each day. My 5th idea was for an early version of Wibbell, inspired by Prolix - a fantastic word game that - similarly - allows you to also use letters not depicted.\nI played it with fellow designers and toy industry professionals, who generally all enjoyed it.\nPlaytime was increased from 3 minutes to 15ish minutes (originally getting X cards triggered the end of the game, but that then became the end of just one round).\nLetter distributions were balanced and this is an area I continue to tinker with - perfection is impossible but I strive to get as close to as possible.\nAt UK Games Expo 2015, I playtested 3 games for the deck publicly. After the positive reception, I committed to the project and it was a side-exhibit at the parties I hosted when In A Bind was released. By Summer 2015, I had a fair few games for the deck, had worked out the basic format and was sending out early prototypes and planning the KS.\nI've continued working on other games for the deck. As I show it around, folk who play the prototype fall in love with at least one of the games and often invent ideas for new games, which could be playtested and developed further.\nThe game has been enjoyed by game store owners, gamers and non-gamers. It has been playtested and ideas submitted by Matt Leacock (Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Pandemic Legacy); David Brain (Keymarket); Ian Vincent (Ticket to Ride: India); Rob Harris (Modiphius).\nCards will be about 58x88mm. They will have black core - it will be impossible to see through them. They will be - at minimum - 300GSM. This thickness gives the cards a good durability and feel. The cards will be packaged in a single tuckbox.\nThere are 48 cards in the deck. 8 of each border design. 6 of 8 common letters. Uncommon letters appear 1-5 times each and are paired with the common letters.\n\nRemaining cards in the box will be used for rules etc.\nApril/May - Kickstarter runs and is (hopefully) funded.\nJune - Playtesting at UKGE 2016, testing possible-final letter pairs.\nJuly/August - early concepts for final art, sending out new PNP files to backers\nSeptember/October - 1st attempt at final art, new PNP sent out to backers, stress-testing borders' usability, testing at Essen, early concepts for all remaining art sent to backers.\nNovember/December - Final art.\nJanuary/February - printing\nMarch - contingency time in case something bad happens\nApril - delivery to backers\nSHOPS/RETAILERS\nIf you are interested in stocking Wibbell++ 2 months before the general release, please get in touch. I have an option for retailers that allows copies to be bought later at trade price, for a nominal deposit now.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWibbell has been in production for over a year.

I learned a lot about the process of making something awesome. I have a history of delivering what I say I will.\n\nThis time, rather than strive to get stuff done faster, I've given myself marginally more time than the original In A Bind took, in order to do it even better, whilst still having time to enjoy life and not constantly stress out - an issue in the past.\n\nWhereas boardgames on Kickstarter have trended towards the point where they are basically a 'pre-order system' with rules and components nearly all finished, I am offering future games where none of the mechanisms or themes are known. \n\nAll of the games will probably not be to your taste. The games will be designed to cover the gamut of possible playstyles and appeal to a wide variety of players. There will be something for everyone.\n\nI have 10 games that only require - at maximum - a few tweaks. But this late-stage development can require many hours of playtesting so I want to ensure there's an audience/demand to prioritise this.\n\nIf there is demand for even more games, I will devise & design new games, inviting other designers to submit their own ideas to be developed. \n\nThe core 5 games have been tested by strangers - designers, gamers and non-gamers - and they are all games I feel stand up on their own. Even before taking future games into account, you're getting a great set of games.\n\nI am still working on the final art for the typography and card borders.

They are called \u201cneoreactionaries\u201d or, more fancifully, the \u201cDark Enlightenment,\u201d a term coined by Nick Land, an expatriate British exacademic philosopher cyberpunk horror writer whose unexpected turn towards far-right politics electrified a bunch of people on Reddit. He was inspired by the works of Mencius Moldbug, a pseudonymous blogger famed for calling for Steve Jobs to be made king of California and tasked with maximizing profit for the state, and also for claiming that black people make good slaves. Moldbug is more usually known as Curtis Yarvin, a Bay Area software engineer who got his start as a writer in the comment section of Overcoming Bias, a transhumanist blog featuring, among others, the work of Eliezer Yudkowsky, a crank AI scholar who thinks preventing his ideas for sci-fi novels from becoming reality is more important than preventing malaria, and who freaked out once when a computer program from the future threatened to hurt him. The confluence of these facts may or may not be the doom of humanity. And just wait til we work in Thomas Ligotti, Alan Turing, William Blake, Frantz Fanon, China Mi\u00e9ville, and Hannibal Lecter.\nNeoreaction a Basilisk is a work of theoretical philosophy about the tentacled computer gods at the end of the universe. It is a horror novel written in the form of a lengthy Internet comment. A savage journey to the heart of the present eschaton. A Dear John letter to western civilization written from the garden of madman philosophers. A textual labyrinth winding towards a monster that I promise will not turn out to be ourselves all along or any crap like that. \nAccidentally composed by acclaimed cultural critic Philip Sandifer (TARDIS Eruditorum, The Last War in Albion) it is initially only available in limited and 100% Kickstarter-exclusive editions. And what happens to it after that is basically up to you. \nWant to know even more about the book? Well, I've posted five excerpts on my blog.\nExcerpt One\nExcerpt Two\nExcerpt Three\nExcerpt Four\nExcerpt Five\nNeoreaction a Basilisk itself is written and, barring layout of the physical book (which I\u2019ll start working on the moment we hit goal) ready to send out. But I\u2019d like to go through and add a set of footnotes and citations, write a couple essays on loosely related topics, and do a more traditional, permanent edition. So basically, I\u2019m selling some weird special editions via Kickstarter to fund that. \nEBOOK EDITION\nOK, so this one is admittedly not really a weird special edition so much as a nicely formatted ebook of Neoreaction a Basilisk in the format of your choosing.\nCONSPIRACY ZINE EDITION\nNow we get into the interesting ones. A print edition, with pages lovingly hand-taped together and photocopied in the style of 80s zines. (And then scanned in and published via a reputable print-on-demand company because we\u2019re not in the 80s anymore thank God.)\nPreview of the Conspiracy Zine Edition\nCOLOR EDITION\nInstead of third generation photocopies of my taped together pages, this edition will consist of high resolution color scans of the taped-together pages subsequently photocopied and artily degraded for the Conspiracy Zine edition.\nPreview of the Color Edition\nSIGIL EDITION\nPrinted on a single ream of continuous-feed printer paper (the kind with the holes on the side), every copy of this edition will be signed, and have a 100% unique sigil drawn on it. What will the sigil do? Launch it and find out.\nORIGINAL PLATES\nAn edition of one - I will put the original taped-together pages in a box and send them to you.

From Vox Day to Vivian James, a look at Gamergate in the tradition of \u201cGuided by the Beauty of Their Weapons.\u201d\n$6000: Theses on Trump - ACHIEVED!\nPREVIEW OF THE ESSAY\nBecause every leftist critic\u2019s got to have a Trump piece, my humble contribution to the genre. The sort of think-piece that notes, \u201che likes his women like he likes his buildings: big and decorated in gold.\u201d And that\u2019s still only the fourth thesis.\n$7000: \"Theses on Trump\" on the Blog - ACHIEVED!\nAt this threshold, I'll post the final version of \"Theses on Trump\" to Eruditorum Press. An October surprise to end all October surprises, I reckon.\n$8000: Austrian School Economics (guest starring Jack Graham) - ACHIEVED!\nDISCUSSION OF THE ESSAY\nCome on. You know you want me and Jack Graham doing an analysis of the economic philosophy of Ted Cruz. Seriously, this is great stuff - a school of economics heavily influential in libertarian thought that rejects the applicability of empiricism and math to economics in favor of a textual argument from first principles in which all of economic thought is a series of necessary implications of the allegedly self-evident premise \u201cindividual people act.\u201d And people who believe this have the gall to sneer at Marxism.\n$9000: \"The Blind All-Seeing Eye of Gamergate\" on the Blog\nAt this level I'll post \"The Blind All-Seeing Eye of Gamergate\" to my blog so that I can get a bunch of death threats on Twitter from people with anime avatars.\n$10,000: Lizard People, Dear Readers\nA delve into the paranoid murk of classic conspiracy theories, starting with David Icke's contention that the world is secretly run by lizards, and probably getting a bit weird from there.\n$11,000: All Backers Get Bonus Essays as an Ebook\nAt this threshold, all backers of the Kickstarter, at any threshold, will get an ebook of all the bonus essays that go into the finished version, including a short piece that will be exclusive to this collection and never distributed anywhere else.\n$12,000: TERFs\nA look at Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists, the adamant leftists who are strangely indistinguishable from Gamergate. Probably starting from the gloriously bonkers title metaphor of Janice Raymond's 1979 screed The Transsexual Empire.\n$13,000: A Brief Magical Ritual To Neuter The Alt-Right\nAt $13,000 I will conduct a brief magical ritual on the Eruditorum Press site in order to forever blunt the power of the alt-right as embodied by neoreaction. Backers are advised to consult my past work in order to assess how much this goal is complete and utter trolling.\n$14,000: A Short Story\nAt $14,000 I will round out the final edition of Neoreaction a Basilisk with a short horror story riffing on some of the themes in the book and gesturing at a few more.\nFor now, Neoreaction a Basilisk, my strange journey into right-wing philosophical horror, is available for your purchase.

In autumn 2015, we approached Paul Smith with an idea \u2013 what if we could turn Trafalgar Square into a giant crazy golf course? Together, we brainstormed a list of the eight best creatives we could think of, and approached them to sketch out the crazy golf course of their dreams. The designs went through feasibility studies until each artist, architect or designer finalised their vision. \nOur designers have given us behind the scenes peak on what visitors can expect from theirCrazy Golf structure.

The Festival also commissions its own Landmark projects and interventions in public spaces across London. Previous Trafalgar Square projects have included The Tournament, a giant ceramic chess set designed by Jaime Hay\u00f3n.\nThe Tournament in Trafalgar Square by Jaime Hay\u00f3n for the London Design Festival 2009\nFestival audiences are significant, with an estimated direct audience of over 375,000 people from over 75 countries in 2015. \nWe want this number to rise in 2016 \u2013 not only to entertain, but to bring innovative, never before seen design to the masses and inspire the next generation of creatives. With your support we can make this happen.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nThis is a project for the public, funded mostly by the public. Realising a project of this ambition and scale is expensive \u2013 we hope to raise half of the required funds through Kickstarter and will match-fund the rest through sponsorship. The Festival is actively seeking this extra support through its network of supporters, but if we do not meet our \u00a3120,000 target the project won\u2019t go ahead.

It only takes a few minutes to learn or to demo!  \nThe game is set in the Golden Age of Steam where a number of entrepreneurs have set out to supply trains to their international client\u00e8le: you are one of these entrepreneurs and you'll do everything you can to make sure your train is the best of the best!\nYour train will be made up of the cards that you collect during the game including:\n1 Engine, 1 Tender, 1 Fuel, 1 Crew and however many carriages you think you need to win the game\nHow to Play\nTo play the game, a nominated player selects 1 Enquiry Card. This sets out the objective of the game:\nHaving selected an Enquiry Card, each player must then select a Crew Card which sets the baseline scores for Speed, Power, Comfort and Capacity for the players train - these are the four attributes that the trains will be judged on:\nEach player then takes one card at a time from the Train Cards pile to begin assembling their train. A player can try and win the game by submitting their train when they fulfil the objective set out by the Enquiry Card, and their train has all the components required (1 Crew, 1 Engine, 1 Tender, 1 Fuel, and as many carriages as they feel they need):\nThe remaining players can each take 1 more card from the train cards pile before submitting their train. If they can't fulfil the Enquiry Cards objective then they lose the game, is they can then they submit this train. The train that best fulfils the objective on the Enquiry Card is the winner.\nWhat's Included\nIn all, there are 54 cards, each meticulously designed and printed on glossy, durable gaming card. These are presented in a card box. \nIncluded in the game are:\n2 Instruction/Help Cards\n7 Enquiry Cards\n5 Crew Cards\n40 Train Cards\nWhy Just the Ticket needs your help\nThis is a Kickstarter campaign in its purest form in that if we don't reach our funding goal, Just the Ticket simply won't make it in to the world at all.

That plus freight shipping and the art, design, individual shipping, and Kickstarter processing fees amount to our goal. We really believe in this game and we're doing everything we can to make it a success, but we need your help to place the first order.

Starting a company is expensive, and so I've already put a lot of my own time and money into getting Scuttle! ready to bring to the world.\nDue to the success of the campaign, I've been able to get copies of the game into retail stores, and Jellybean Games is going to have a really solid foundation for future projects!\nThis project has been a collaboration between Peter C.

Build a political party in a familiar but fictional world, recruiting politicians to your cause, developing your manifesto of support winning ideas, campaigning for the support of the public, firing off salvos of slander & sabotage at your cunning rivals, and surviving catastrophic events that shake up the nation you\u2019re playing the game of politics in. \nStatecraft - the Political Card Game\nEach game of Statecraft starts off with selecting a scenario, which represents the current events of a fictional nation, and with players selecting their political party\u2019s leader, who\u2019ll form the central character of your party\u2019s team. Supporters are then drawn from the deck to form your nation's population. All this translates to over 180,000 possible starting set ups.\nStatecraft Game Layout\nStarting layout tutorial\nPlayers manage their hand of cards to carry out a series of political \u2018manoeuvers\u2019 during their turn, whether spending cards recruiting new politicians to their party, using cards announcing new policies with their newly minted team members, campaigning for the support of a key demographic or dialing their favourite cable news network to divulge some damaging slander about their opponent.\nUsing policies and claiming supporters tutorial\n For most of Statecraft's scenarios, the player who claims the most supporters will win. They'll have to manage their ideological stance to attract new supporters but retain old ones, and fend off attacks from opponents who are plotting to poach their supporters away with sickly populist promises.\n Statecraft has a lot of unique gameplay features, as well as some tried and tested conventional mechanics which make the game tight. The things that make Statecraft really special, though are shown below, from the hundreds of thousands of different set ups to the unique ideology mechanic.\n\n\nManaging your Pledge\nIf you want to upgrade your pledge level, then all you need to do is click the \u2018manage your pledge\u2019 button next to the campaign video, which will take you to a list of pledge levels, where you can select a new one. Nice and simple.\n\nPrint & Play Edition\nAll pledges of \u00a35 or more will include a set of fully illustrated and organised files which you'll be able to print off, and play a full game of Statecraft with. These will come in English, Spanish, French and German, with more languages in the works! The manufactured game will be produced in English.\nWhen we reach a certain amount of funding level, we'll be able to make Statecraft even better for each and every backer! As we get further up the ladder we'll reveal more of the exciting things we'll be able to bring to Statecraft, including more expansions, card art, quality upgrades and more.\nEver time we hit a combined 100 shares of the 'magic status' on Facebook and Twitter, we'll get Zak to add card art into the core game!\n\nEvery time we hit a combined 100 new Facebook likes and Twitter follows, we'll get Zak to add in another!\n\nFor every 10 pictures of babies dressed up as Donald Trump and/or Boris Johnson shared to our Facebook or Twitter, that's +1 card art!\nThe same goes for original poems about your national government, extra points for them being written in crayon.\n\nFacebook Likes + Twitter Follows at launch = 913\n\nLINK TO MAGIC FACEBOOK STATUS\nLINK TO MAGIC TWEET\n\nLINK TO FACEBOOK PAGE\nLINK TO TWITTER PROFILE\n                                                      Statecraft has been designed with expandability in mind, with plenty of opportunities to build new fictional, or even non fictional, worlds to fill with your nefarious political plans.\nField characters like Barack Obama and Margaret Thatcher, and announce policies like the NHS and drop strikes, with the National Politics: UK and the USA expansion\nNational Politics comes with 27 cards which expand on the core game, with new scenarios, characters, policies and events from the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This set adds a contemporary and real-life edge to the Statecraft system, giving you the opportunity to play as the outrageous characters of real life politics. National Politics is included in all pledge levels of \u00a325 or more*\n*Except for Benign Educator\nWe have loads of ideas for more expansions, including:\nAssets and Agents (adding in 2 new card types to Statecraft) \nNational Politics (East Asia, South America, North Africa, The EU) \nExtreme Policies (incendiary policies from around the world) \nExtreme Supporters (challenging to claim!) \nStatecraft: Histories (historical characters)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign using the project pledge manager. By doing it this way and not charging through Kickstarter, we will pass on any savings we make on shipping, packaging, handling and pack mule fees directly to you, charging shipping cent for cent.\n\nFor the prices below, the upper values represent the worst case scenario. Shipping covers professional handling, packaging and shipping by experienced fulfillment companies in the US, Canada and the EU.\nWe currently are able to offer EU, US and Canadian friendly shipping, meaning we absorb all import/sales taxes and also means you don't have to wait for your pledge because of pesky customs forms and charges! \nEstimated shipping prices, charged after the campaign\nClick for more info on our website!\n                                                                                              The Political Compass was one of the key sources of inspiration for us, as it provides a really interesting insight into where political parties or candidates sit in relation to each other, and where you sit relative to them too! It's even more interesting to see parties from different countries together, like we've done below using their data!\nThe Political Compass provides a method of categorising your political ideology in 2-dimensions. Rather than defining yourself as 'right' or 'left', 'liberal' or 'conservative', the Compass does both at once, giving a richer understanding of political persuasion.\nWhat does the political compass mean?\n                                                                                   We've got a really strong team of talented game designers, artists and graphics people as well as having a successful project already under our belt, Molecular. We've gone strides forward since Molecular, learning more and more about everything from designing the game itself to getting it to backers, putting together a far more efficient shipping pipeline, and working with much better manufacturers to ensure quality and speed.\n\nWe're now working with 6 fledgling game designers to publish their ideas over the next 12 months, across an incredible range of themes and game styles.

We're working with a very skilled designer, so we're confident we won't hit any serious delays with the design side of the project, as they are very experienced and have been in constant contact with the manufacturers.\n\nMANUFACTURING DELAUS:\nBoard games are pretty complex things to make, so we've partnered with PandaGM, one of the industries most respected manufacturers, to ensure that everything is done professionally and to a high standard. Panda have worked with dozens of successful Kickstarters, delivering high quality games on time.\n\nSHIPPING DELAYS:\nFreight from the factory to distribution centers around the world can be quite variable, but we've factored that into our timeline. We've also built in time for the distribution centers to ensure that everything is packed correctly and safely, so you get your games in good condition. We've come an incredibly long way since organising all the freight handling and shipping logistics of Molecular ourselves. We've also had a quiet word with some pirates.\n\nRISK OF BEING PUT ON GOVERNMENT WATCHLIST:\nAs we're producing a satirical politics game, there's a chance that our benevolent overlords will revoke our freedom and send us to some kind of gulag in the Highlands of Scotland.

It\u2019s a chance to host an unforgettable night of fun with your friends as you race against the clock to twist your brain around puzzling problems and cunning clues. \nWe can\u2019t tell you too much without ruining the surprise, but these are not just pen and paper puzzles. There are locked boxes! Keys and codes that must be found! Feats of dexterity, quests for knowledge and mind-bending brain teasers that must be accomplished.  \nEscape Rooms are a wildly popular new form of live gaming sweeping the country. The basic concept is a group of people gets locked in a room and has to solve puzzles both physical and mental in order to find keys and codes that will get them out of the room. In our game, we have all the awesome excitement, so players can have the same immersive and challenging experience in the comfort of their own home (and for a lot less money!). We\u2019ve done a lot of research and despite the massive popularity of Escape Rooms, there is nothing like this on the market.\nYou will receive a beautifully designed, fascinating box. You will take off the lid and notice that there is a panel that you CANNOT LIFT until you start the game.\nIntrigued, you will invite your friends over for the ESCAPE ROOM IN A BOX PARTY. You can even make appetizers, drinks and decorations from the Official Escape Room In A Box: The Werewolf Experiment Party Planner (which you found right under the box lid.)  \nThe day of your party will arrive, everyone will be excited and curious about what's to come. You will eat, drink, be merry and gather around a table to begin this once in a lifetime experience.\nYou will lift the lid and\u2026\nWe can\u2019t tell you any more without spoilers and we would never do that to you.\nOkay, we can show you a little more:\n                                                               Actually, it\u2019s better:\n1. Location: Maybe you don\u2019t live anywhere near an Escape Room. Maybe you don\u2019t want to drive to an unknown part of town or pay for a babysitter. Escape Room in A Box is in the best location (your house) with awesome parking (because it is at your house.)\n2. Cost: Escape Rooms are expensive! Like, $30 a person! That\u2019s $180 for your six person group! Our game is a fraction of the price for 152% of the fun.\n3. You won\u2019t be locked in a room: For those of you who love puzzles but hate the thought of being locked in a room, in our game you aren\u2019t locked in a room. You are just stuck with a box\u2026of AWESOME. And themed snacks.\nAnyone who loves Escape Rooms. Anyone who loves puzzles. Anyone who wants to host a super unique party. Anyone who wants a really fun team building exercise or ice breaker: companies, schools, clubs. Families who want something that will bring them together without being bored or staring at a screen. Also, just, everyone. Are you breathing? Buy this game.\nYes, the game is primarily a one time use game like the real Escape Rooms or Murder Mystery Night Games. As you'll see when you play, it isn't just solving puzzles, the puzzles are part of a complicated web of clues and meta puzzles that lead you to your goal, so after the first play you'll know too much!\nHowever, we want some replay-ability, so we will be selling a very cheap refill pack (included FREE with the kickstarter!) that will include a .pdf of the puzzles, replacements for the elements that are used up, and instructions for reconstructing the box. We will also include a \u201cgame master script\u201d for the host so that you take charge of certain elements (timing, hints, etc.) as you lead another group of your friends through their adventure and watch them escape their terrible werewolf fate (or not!). \nIf you\u2019re up for a room-sized adventure in a pint-sized box, then grab some friends and a little kibble (just to be safe), and head on over to this game\u2019s Kickstarter before its time runs out too! - Ryan (Cardboard Republic)\n                    Review from The Room Escape Artist!\nWe're on LAist!\nInterview on Fanboy Comics!\nWe're on Geek & Sundry!!!!!!\nReview from The Room Escapist!\nArticle about us on escape-rooms.com!\nArticle about us on Intervirals!\nWrite-up on Giant Fire Breathing Robot!\nWe're on Amy Poehler's Smart Girls!\nWe're on World of Wonder!\nMisplaced Pixels did an awesome story about us!\nWant to make your Escape Room Party even more immersive and atmospheric?\nLauren Rock of Boonzy Arts Candles specializes in hand crafting candles to enhance the gaming experience.

The Werewolf Experiment Candle is herbaceous and woody with slight hints of amber and citrus.\nThe candle is 8oz, 100% soy wax, has a cotton wick, premium fragrance oils, and features original Escape Room In A Box artwork. Each candle has around 50 hours of burn time, so you can certainly enjoy it before you game to anticipate what's to come and then after to remember what a blast you had.

God save the Queen!\nLondon, 1899- The board for Victoriana\nTension that builds throughout the game: As the three elements of the conspiracy are revealed, so are Agents of the Mastermind. This results in a game that gets more challenging the closer you are to victory.\nTime made tangible: Each time the clock advances a quarter hour, all the Leads in play physically turn a quarter turn clockwise. If a Lead ever returns to the 12 o\u2019clock position, it is lost forever. Players use this visible timer to prioritize their actions.\nMultiple resources that need to be managed: Players must balance abilities, movement, and trauma in order to stop the conspiracy before time, the most limited resource of all, runs out.\nFantastic variety: With more than 100 unique Leads, 20 possible Plots, 13 fearsome Masterminds, and the whole of 19th century London as the setting, Victoriana will never play the same way twice.\nEngaging theme: Combining characters from Victorian literature with real-world scientists, politicians, occultists, and more, Victoriana offers a rich, exciting world for players to experience.\nOne of the many nefarious plots\nThe Goal of Victoriana\nDiscover the three elements of a vast conspiracy that threatens London- Mastermind, Plot, and Locale- before the clock strikes midnight!\nThe Gameplay of Victoriana\nInvestigate Leads: Lead cards represent information on the conspiracy!

But hurry- take too long to investigate a lead and it will go cold!\nDiscover the Plot: Spend leads to eliminate plot cards. Players are rewarded for each plot they eliminate, but beware- a dangerous agent of the conspiracy lurks in the plot deck as well.\nReveal the Mastermind: Each mastermind is protected by three henchmen. Spend leads to put these villains away for good.\nTraverse London: Avoid sinister agents! Collect help from Scotland Yard!

The idea that the soul of every person contained light and dark halves locked in eternal struggle is an old, old idea, but the Victorians made that duality manifest. Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the prime example, but you can see the themes elsewhere in The Invisible Man, Mina's struggle against Dracula's bite, and Holmes' rebellion against stagnation."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Relaunch Update #2", "update_content": "Hello, backers,\n\nApologies for the radio silence, but rest assured it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve been idle.

The aim is to make the most fabulous world you can, before your tower collapses. \nFabulous Beasts is brought to you by an experienced team of game designers, artists and engineers including Alex Fleetwood (Hide&Seek) and George Buckenham (Wild Rumpus, Panoramical). The soundtrack for the game is being created by Disasterpeace.\nThe digital app is compatible with modern Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.

While stacking bits of firewood and watching pelicans fly by, he had an idea for a game that linked the balance of nature with the balance of objects. \nOnce back in London, Alex called up George, Tim and Lyall - who he'd worked with while making games at Hide&Seek. With the help of Play Sandbox they started working on a prototype with the Engineering department at Bath University. Chris began helping us with hardware, and rapidly became the fifth member of the team. \nWe use technologies like 3D-printing, Arduino, Autodesk Forge and Unity to bring indie creativity to hardware as well as software. We love working together and shaping all the different elements of the game in parallel. \nWe've spent the last year taking the game to festivals, evolving the design, and developing the game. We'll tell you all about it during the campaign.\nWe're lucky to have the backing and support of some fantastic people from the games and hardware industries. But what we're trying to do is something that's rarely been done before. Companies who make games that bridge physical and digital are mostly ginormous multinational corporations. \nWe've got a refined, award-winning prototype and we've built out a manufacturing plan with experienced partners in Hong Kong and China. The fastest way for us to carry out that plan is with your support. \nMost importantly, we want to start a conversation about the future of this game with YOU. We're so excited about being able to keep adding to and improving it and we have a ton of ideas - from different game modes, to extra pieces, to hardware upgrades. With your support, we can make them all happen! \nIn order to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low, we are working with a Hong Kong based logistics partner to pick, pack and ship all rewards to local fulfilment centres in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, and then on to you. EU rewards will therefore be delivered from within the EU. We expect to ship all other rewards direct from Hong Kong.\nShipping prices for the Core Edition / Core Edition Plus / Maker Edition vary as follows from territory to territory:\nUK, US, Canada, Australia: \u00a310 (approx $15 USD / $20 CAD  / $20 AUS ) \nWestern EU* (excl. UK): \u00a315 (approx \u20ac20) \nAll other countries: \u00a325\nOther rewards are charged by weight and volume accordingly.\n*Western EU includes: France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Greece", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing \n\nA key challenge for our game is the manufacturing process. We are working closely with JDH Sourcing, a Hong-Kong based company who oversee every aspect of the game's production from the electronic components to the packaging. JDH work with partners including Teenage Engineering, PowerUp and Perfect Bake. Our team has visited the factories we will be using to see their processes first hand. We have already adapted the game's physical design and electronic engineering so that it can be produced at scale. \n\nDigital Development\n\nThere's a risk that we might not ship the game with all the advertised features, or ship late. The game is already quite fully featured and has been developed in Unity to minimise costs and problems with porting from the current iOS build to Android. We have a working build on Android devices\n\nWe have budgeted time and resource to develop the features we have planned for the core game and any features added in stretch goals ahead of our proposed shipping date in November 2016. \n\nWe also need to ensure compatibility between our hardware and your device. We have planned in testing and QA to deal with this and we are in discussion with Apple and Google about certification.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "BIG BIG News from Beasts of Balance HQ", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Brand New Game on Kickstarter from Beasts of Balance publisher Modern Games", "update_content": "Hey Everyone!\nWe are excited to announce the launch of Raid, a strategic, micro-deck building card game with a norse mythology theme from the Modern Games team, on Kickstarter today.\nYou can learn more and be one of the first to back it at: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moderngames/raid-a-viking-card-game\nWe appreciate any support your can send our way and hope you're enjoying Beasts of Balance!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Modern Games acquires Beasts of Balance", "update_content": "The Beasts are Back!\nMaybe you were wondering what would happen to Beasts of Balance after Sensible Object was acquired by Niantic last year.

Inspired by the works of Alexandre Dumas, The Princess Bride, and other works of high adventure, 7th Sea played fast and furious, emulating the pace of movies like Captain Blood, The Three Musketeers, and Pirates of the Caribbean.\nAnd now 7th Sea is back in the hands of its original creator\u2014that\u2019s me! John Wick!\u2014and that means it's time to bring 7th Sea back to your gaming table! \nRead on to hear more about 7th Sea, but I want to say a huge THANK YOU to all our fans who have made this the most successful tabletop RPG project in Kickstarter history. We've broken every record and funded eleven sourcebooks, six maps, three novels... and much, much more.\nIf you want all the books, we've funded, you should check out these two reward levels:\nAnd if you want to take a look at Second Edition, backers can download the Quickstart TODAY! It\u2019s got everything you need to try out the game, including pregen characters, mechanics, and a starter adventure!\n7th Sea is a tabletop roleplaying game of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Th\u00e9ah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe. Players take the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished and protecting the rightful kings and queens of Th\u00e9ah from murderous villains.\nCore Rulebook Mockup\nAs a 7th Sea Hero, you might...\n\u2026 save the Queen of Avalon from treacherous blackmail! \n\u2026 thwart a dastardly assassination attempt on the Cardinal of Castille! \n\u2026 raid the villainous fleets of Vodacce merchant-princes! \n\u2026 free the Prince of the Sarmatian Commonwealth from a mysterious curse! \n\u2026 make decisions that alter the very course of Th\u00e9an history!\nIn most roleplaying games, you start off as a 1st-level loser who\u2019s terrified of the goblin with a broken knife. In 7th Sea, you are a Hero, an icon of Th\u00e9ah ready to live and die for causes that matter. You can take on ten thugs with swords, knives, and guns all on your own. You don\u2019t start off digging through old dungeons hoping to find a copper piece or two. No! You are trusted knight, a loyal bodyguard, or even\u2026 an adventuring queen herself.\nIn other words\u2026 you\u2019re d\u2019Artagnan, Milady de Winter, the Dread Pirate Roberts, Jack Sparrow, Julie d'Aubigney, and the Scarlet Pimpernel all rolled up in one!\nThis is a game of high adventure, mystery, and action. \nThis is a game of intrigue and romance. \nThis is 7th Sea.\nEach of the Nations in Th\u00e9ah is a unique culture, a country that prides itself on a national identity and a unique voice. There is no League of Nations in 7th Sea; each country stands alone, plotting its future as best it can in the face of dangers both internal and external.\n7th Sea characters usually come from one of the eight Th\u00e9an Nations:\nAvalon: Green and enchanted, this union of three kingdoms has recently risen to the forefront of The\u0301an politics under the leadership of Queen Elaine.\nCastille: Headquarters of the Vaticine Church, this fertile nation was once the home of science and reason, but it has fallen under the spell of corruption and fanaticism.\nEisen: A proud yet broken land, Eisen is a nightmare brought to life by three decades of mass murder kept at bay by heroes as dangerous as the horrors lurking in the Nation\u2019s shadows.\nMontaigne: One of The\u0301ah\u2019s most powerful nations, Montaigne leads the world in art and culture even as its Emperor crushes the populace beneath his thumb.\nSarmatian Commonwealth: Two nations bound by a single crown, the Commonwealth is a democratic monarchy where all people are equal, even kings.\nUssura: A Nation torn between traditional isolationism and an ambitious ruler who will do anything to drag his Nation into the future, no matter the cost.\nVestenmannavnjar: A Nation of raiders and warlords who conquered the world\u2019s economy by hammering their swords and spears into coins.\nVodacce: The former cradle of civilization, Vodacce is now split between seven merchant Princes whose complex and nefarious schemes reach every corner of the world.\nBut the world doesn\u2019t stop at the edges of Th\u00e9ah. In fact, the world of 7th Sea is going to get a whole lot bigger...\nI get more questions about 7th Sea than any other game I've written. Fans of the game truly love the world we created back in 1999 and were sad to see the game go out of print.\nFans of the 1st Edition should know that Th\u00e9ah is still largely as they remember it. We still have Vodacce Fate Witches and Montaigne Porte Magic, but some of the other Nations have undergone subtle changes. Eisen, Vestenmennavenjar, and Ussura are just a little different than they were before. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll still recognize them, but just as fifteen years can change a person, fifteen years can change a Nation, too. And you\u2019ll get to explore a brand new Nation\u2026 the Sarmatian Commonwealth!\n7th Sea: Second Edition gives me a chance to not only bring the game back to all its devoted fans, but also to give it a new engine with plenty of chrome. Since 1999, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the roleplaying game industry. We have new design tools, new publishing options, and new ideas about what makes a roleplaying game work. I want to take advantage of all that new stuff and help 7th Sea become the game that I always wanted it to be: fast, fun, furious action that tells the stories of great heroes facing impossible odds amidst global politics.\nWe\u2019ve also got big plans for the book itself: a gorgeous 300 page, full color, fully illustrated hardcover tome. We\u2019ve got new artists helping us bring the world of Th\u00e9ah to your gaming table in all its grandeur and glory, and we\u2019re working with KrakenPrint to bring the book to your table in both a traditional hardcover edition and in a leather-bound, foil-stamped, embossed (and de-embossed!) pirate edition. Check out our Rewards section to learn more about what we\u2019re planning on printing.\nBut like I mentioned above, we are making the world a whole lot bigger than just Th\u00e9ah. We have huge plans to fill in the map of the entire world: new continents, new Nations, new sorceries, new adventures! All of them are waiting for first-time players and those intimately familiar with the first edition of 7th Sea.\nFans of the old game will be glad to hear we still have the classic five Traits\u2014Brawn, Finesse, Resolve, Wits, and Panache\u2014as well as Skills to describe your character\u2019s training and experience. However, instead of Roll and Keep your Trait, it\u2019s now Roll and Keep Everything. That\u2019s right, you keep all your dice and use them to resolve risky and dangerous actions.\nAfter you roll, you take your dice and make sets of 10. Each set is a Raise. You can use Raises to accomplish goals, overcome obstacles, and dodge consequences. In other words, Raises make your character awesome. And as a 7th Sea Hero\u2026 you\u2019ll have lots of Raises.\nWe\u2019ve streamlined the rest of the system as well, making it faster, more dramatic and easier to learn. We made dueling possible for everyone, not just swordsmen: if you can pick up a sword, you can get yourself into a duel. Everything about the new system is designed to get you into the action! \nWhether you\u2019re a fan of the original edition or someone who\u2019s never played before, you can download the Quick Start right now and see for yourself what the new 7th Sea looks and plays like. Just back the Kickstarter (even at $1!) and you can start your adventures in Th\u00e9ah!\nBut 7th Sea: Second Edition isn\u2019t the only book we\u2019ve got planned for this line; we\u2019re also excited to announce our full line of 7th Sea sourcebooks, each one a new opportunity to expand what 7th Sea is all about. Here's the full list of every sourcebook funded by this campaign:\nWhy are we expanding out to new lands? To give the game more scope, to encourage exploration (and piracy!) and to bring a wider variety of faces and voices to Th\u00e9ah\u2019s shores. We think 7th Sea needs more sea travel, more adventure in far off places, and a more diverse setting.\nBut we're also committed to making sure that this project doesn't drag on forever! We'll be delivering these books over the next year and a half, according to the release schedule above. We'll keep folks updated as each project develops, and we might be able to get one or two out a bit early.\nIf you'd like to grab one of the sourcebooks, add $40 to your pledge or select a reward tier that includes sourcebooks. You can also check out the ALL THE BOOKS, OFFICER or ALL THE BOOKS, PIRATE tier to snag all eleven sourcebooks at a great price.\nThe 7th Sea community was always one of my favorite parts about working on the line when I was at AEG. I still get messages from people who tell me that 7th Sea saved their life when they were homeless or they almost named their kid after a 7th Sea character. Amazing stuff.\nIn order to capture that community again, we asked our backers to tweet, share, and contribute to the campaign with their own unique images and ideas. Over the course of the campaign, our fans have unlocked a dozen social stretch goals, including new Sorte cards, digital wallpapers, early previews, and more!\nIf you want to see the awesome selfies, LEGO ships, and more created by our backers, search on social media using the hashtag #sailthe7thSea. Thank you to everyone who contributed to unlocking these goals! Your fellow backers appreciate it!\nWe're so incredibly excited about the return of 7th Sea and our reward tiers are packed with cool stuff. We\u2019ve got  physical books, 1st Edition PDFs, special play opportunities, and even a treasure chest filled with exclusive 7th Sea artefacts!\nSince we\u2019re funding a whole line, we\u2019re handling rewards a bit differently than you might be used to on Kickstarter. When you back at a level that includes a sourcebook, you choose which sourcebook you get when the campaign is over through Backerkit. You're free to get any book you want or even snag multiple copies of the same sourcebook if that's what you want.\nIf you're interested in getting all the books, check out the ALL THE BOOKS, OFFICER and ALL THE BOOKS, PIRATE tiers that include virtually every product we're funding, including all the sourcebooks!\nOn to the rewards! \n$20 - EXPLORER: You receive the FULL COLOR 7th Sea: Second Edition PDF, including everything you need to play the game, maps of Th\u00e9ah, and more!\n$40 - SCHOLAR: You receive PDFs of ALL BOOKS/PRODUCTS we unlock through this campaign including PDFs for ALL 1ST EDITION BOOKS!

And we'll be joined by additional collaborators that we know and trust, like \"Audio Daredevil\" Kenny Young (Tearaway, LittleBigPlanet) and composer Daniel Pemberton (Steve Jobs, The Man from UNCLE, LittleBigPlanet). And hopefully we'll be joined by you as well!\nInspired by games like Earthbound and Secret of Mana and films such as The Goonies, we would like to take these, along with of our favorite childhood memories, and channel it all through our years of experience making games.\nThe key ingredients of Knights and Bikes:\nIn Knights and Bikes, you can play as Nessa and Demelza on their quest for the truth behind the medieval legends of Penfurzy, an island on the fast track to financial ruin and literal destruction. Recruit a party of creatures from all walks of life, enlist and inspire deflated islanders, and embark on an adventure to find the hero the island so desperately needs.\nTeaming up with Demelza's pet goose, and the pickled severed head of a fallen-knight, they fling Frisbees at demons, trick-out their bikes to reach new locations, and increase their abilities with each islander they rescue.\nOk ok, what Demelza said.\nPedal Yourselves into Danger!\nPlay it single-player, or with a friend!\nTo purchase an add on, all you have to do is:\nClick \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d (or click here). \nClick \"Change your pledge\" \nAdd the costs (including shipping) of the add-ons to your pledge amount without changing your tier. \nThat\u2019s it. We'll ask for all the details in the backer survey after the campaign.\nTrailer Super Cut\nSome of our lovely friends and fans helped us put together a new, extra shouty cut of our trailer!\nKnights and Bikes is currently confirmed for PC, Mac, and Linux. It's also coming to Playstation4, and all pledges at, or above, the Digital Game Plus tier are eligible for the PS4 version.\n\nWe will update this section if and when we add more platforms. \nKnights and Bikes takes place on the island of Penfurzy, an island off the coast of Cornwall, where great medieval legends have driven centuries of culture. Inspired by Rex's childhood, it is a place where fact and fiction are inextricably intertwined. \nAs such, the island has a case of multiple identities. On one hand, it is a home for the islanders who live a life full of tradition, history, and pride. But on the other hand, it is a tourist attraction that is expressed almost as self parody through arcades, crazy-golf, and other fleeting diversions.\nOur story takes place in the 80s when the island's most prized relic is proved to be fake, raising questions about Penfurzy's legends. We pick up in the fall of 1987, the end of the island's worst tourist season ever. All the mainlanders have gone home. Well, all except one. \nAs Nessa and Demelza begin their search for the truth behind the island legends, they unleash mysterious spirits that possesses many of the island's inhabitants, human and animal alike. It's up to our heroines to figure out what these spirits want, where or even when they're from, and ultimately how to stop them. \nKnights and Bikes is filled with characters for you to meet (or be) from all walks of life. They each have their own goals, personalities, and abilities. Here are some of the cast:\nNessa is an orphan from the mainland who follows an old keepsake to the island hoping to learn who she really is. As an outsider, she clashes with many of the islanders, but not Demelza, who becomes a fast friend.\nSample Ability: Frisbee-Lob\nDemelza is a video game-obsessed believer in the Penfurzy legends. She comes equipped with a Power Glove in her quest to fight for the honor of her favorite video game hero. She lives in the island's Caravan Park with her father Gryffyn, but dreams of the mainland and all the comic-books and video games that might exist there.\nSample Ability: Puddle-Splash\nCaptain Honkers is Demelza's pet goose. He has an incredible sense of smell and an insatiable appetite for seaweed.\nSample Ability: Peck\nThe Pickled Knight claims to be the great hero of legend, but even if true, spending many years trapped in a briny rockpool has robbed him of his looks (and abilities).\nSample Ability: Ankle Bite\nIslanders come in all shapes and sizes, each trying to support themselves on this remote island--from the volunteer running the mobile library to the bike-shop-owner. But as things start to go wrong on the island it will be up to you to save them from the ancient spirits. And some may have special talents or items that could be helpful to your quest. \nSample Ability: Worrying\nKnights and Bikes is an Co-op Action Adventure Game where players will explore an island on foot and on bikes, find treasure, battle through \"dungeon\" areas, rescue islanders and upgrade their gear in the town hub.\nLocal Co-Op - Play through the entire game alone with AI helpers controlling the other characters in your party or have a friend join you on this mysterious adventure.\nExplore - Jump on your bike and ride through the ominous wilderness areas of the island following the ever trusty beak of Captain Honkers.\nTreasure - Trade collected treasure to acquire new abilities as well as upgrading those you already have by employing the various odd abilities of rescued islanders.\nQuests - Complete the noble requests of the islanders to win their favor by rescuing loved ones, finding ancient relics, and solving puzzling mysteries.\nBattle - Keep an eye on your health as you fight your way through treacherous dungeons using your improvised arsenal. Execute your combat abilities against possessed creatures to free them from their violent spiritual possession.\nThe rewards we're offering are as important to us as the game, so everything is made by us for you, and not farmed-out to third-parties.

We remember a time when games were something that you would play with your mum, dad, brother, or neighbor and together you could join forces and defeat the ultimate baddie.\nWe wanted to capture the feeling of forming a group, being part of something bigger, but also finding out who you are and where you fit into the world. Of course, a game about friendship wouldn't be complete without the ability to play with friends. We hope that we can give our players an experience that brings them together like so many video games anchored some of our best childhood friendships.\nThe theme of the game is inspired by several classic movies of the 80s like Goonies and ET, films that show the adult world from a child's perspective, and the ways in which they try to understand it.  \nAnd the art-style is a mixture of Rex's own natural style, combined with influences from Eyvind Earle, Ronald Searle, Alex Grigg's exceptional \"Phantom Limb\" short film, and the production-design of Paranorman.\nWe've been extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to meet fans of our games in real life. It's an amazing feeling, but when we hear what they loved most about the game, we wish they had been there the entire time.\nKickstarter gives us an opportunity to recruit a group of fans who share our passion for this project. They can cheer us on and keep us moving forward when we are feeling down with misdirected doubt. More importantly, they can let us know if we're losing perspective and veering off track.\nOn such a small team, it's critical to not only get more voices, but the right voices. We're hoping that Kickstarter is a great way to find you all.\nRex Crowle served as the Creative Lead on both Tearaway and Tearaway: Unfolded and was a key artist on the LittleBigPlanet series.

He also worked on Moshi Monsters and created the iPad multiplayer game Ring Fling.\nTwitter: @oneofmoo\nKickstarter: Kickstarter Profile\nKnights and Bikes is an idea that we've been thinking about for a while. We have created a few different areas in the game to establish the range and consistency of the art style. We love the way it looks already, but will continue fine tuning it over time.\nOn the gameplay side, we've used these various areas to experiment with three of the core aspects of the game. We have built a conversation system to talk to the islanders, deal with quests, and purchase new gear. We've created a basic dungeon as a testing ground for our many enemy and weapon prototypes. And we've created a sprawling forest to get a feel for the explorational aspects of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a very ambitious project, especially for a team of two, but we definitely feel like we are up to the challenge. We each have over a decade of experience making games and have worked together for many years on a number of projects. Not only do we have experience making games with the backing of a studio, we have also shipped games with smaller teams like EpicWin and Ring Fling.\n\nEven though there are only two of us, we do cover a lot of disciplines, each willing to dive into any task that we think will result in making a better game. In addition, we are being smart about using off the shelf solutions (like Unity, Spine, and Yarn) when possible.\n\nWe also have a great support structure. On the personal side, we have great friends and family who have supported us through difficult projects before. On the development side, we have many friends in other development studios big and small who can give advice and lend a favor when in need. Speaking of which, we have some stretch goals in mind to bring in some specialists to help with certain aspects of the game to make it even better. But we'll talk about that if the time comes.\n\nOverall, we believe that with the combination of our passion for the project, support from our fan base, and help from our friends, we will be able to complete Knights and Bikes to the level of our extremely high standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #66", "update_userinfo": "Collector's Special Edition, Xbox, and Game Pass!", "update_content": "Howdy Backers!\n\nLong time no speak!

We have always been here. And we are very, very excited to show it.\u201d\nWhat does it mean, for you, yes, you\u2014the reader, the avid science fiction fan, purveyor of the imaginative even when faced by the banality of a day-to-day life\u2014to support a publication that is colored, and we mean, like really, really colored, by the nuances of culture, race, and history? For one, you get to read something that would dispel the notion of POC-penned science fiction as somewhat inferior science fiction. We will work very hard to come up with a lineup that will counter this assumption, and we will succeed in doing so.\nWe believe in science fiction\u2019s transformative powers, its ability to remedy the dreariness of our lives. People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! will exist, with your kind help, of course, to relieve a brokenness we\u2019ve enabled time and time again by favoring certain voices and portrayals of particular characters. We won\u2019t harangue you with guilt trips involving the importance of openly listening to the assimilated, the colonized, the misappropriated. That\u2019s just not how we roll. What we aim to do, instead, is to challenge you: Join us because it is fun to do so. We don\u2019t mean fun as a vehicle for trivializing centuries of injustice that resulted in the lack of representation for certain groups of people because power structures were skewed heavily in favor of a chosen few. We mean fun as the satisfaction we get in those light-bulb-in-the-head moments of our lives, the satisfaction we get from meaningful conversations that lend clarity, the satisfaction we get when we move past those feel-good-driven acts of tokenism, the satisfaction we get when we read stories that have palpable artistic and intellectual values that speak of our present time and most of all, our future.\nAs we said in our submission call, we will not be asking writers who submit stories to tell us what makes them \u201cpeople of colo(u)r.\u201d We leave that up to your world experience, your conscience, your sense of community, and your sense of fair play. And like the other hugely successful initiatives of Lightspeed\u2019s Destroy series, People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! is saying, \u201cWe\u2019re here. We have always been here.

In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF\u2014and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales. When you read LIGHTSPEED, it is our hope that you\u2019ll see where science fiction and fantasy comes from, where it is now, and where it\u2019s going.\nLIGHTSPEED is a two-time winner of the Hugo Award, and stories from LIGHTSPEED have been nominated for the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Award, and the World Fantasy Award. Previously, we crowdfunded our two other \"Destroy\" special issues: In 2014, we published Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which was named one of NPR's best books of 2014 and won the British Fantasy Award; and in 2015, we published Queers Destroy Science Fiction!, which received similar acclaim.\nWhen not doing special issues devoted to destroying science fiction, LIGHTSPEED is usually edited by bestselling anthologist John Joseph Adams, editor of anthologies such as Wastelands, The Living Dead, and Brave New Worlds, and series editor of Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy.\nAll of the money raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of the POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and related stretch goals. Anything leftover after that will go toward the production of future issues of LIGHTSPEED.\nYou'll find our various reward options in a column on the right side of this page (PC/Mac) or on a separate page (iOS/Android). Below are some explanations and clarifications of our various reward options.\nAll backers who pledge at least $5 (the DESTROY SF! reward level) will receive an ebook copy of the LIGHTSPEED POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue. The special issue will be available in June 2016.\nAll ebook rewards, including ebook subscriptions, will be made available DRM-free in epub, mobi, and PDF format via our ebookstore. Mobi is primarily for Kindle/Kindle app users; Epub works on lots of things, such as Nook, Kobo, and iBooks.\nIf you select one of the subscription rewards, your subscription will begin with the June 2016 issue.\nSince all of the subscription rewards include the DESTROY SF! reward, the POCDSF special issue won't count against your subscription; so if you buy a one-year subscription, you'll really be getting 13 issues, rather than 12, etc.\nIf you are an EXISTING SUBSCRIBER: If you choose one of the subscription rewards, we'll just extend your current subscription by the specified term (i.e., by 1 year, 2 years, etc.). Note: We can only do this for subscribers who subscribe directly via the LIGHTSPEED store or via Weightless Books; unfortunately we can't offer to extend subscriptions for Kindle Periodicals subscribers. When we send out the Kickstarter survey after the campaign concludes, we'll ask you which store your subscription is currently with and renew it accordingly.\nIf you want the DESTROY PRINT reward, but also want to back at a higher tier, we also have options for that. Just look for the rewards that have PRINT in the titles.\nTo our international backers who want the DESTROY PRINT! reward\u2014we apologize for the stiff fee ($20) for international shipping, but that's what it costs, unfortunately! The print edition will likely be between 1-2 lbs., which means the shipping will be $18+, so we rounded that up to $20 for the \"handling\" part of \"shipping and handling.\"\nPREMIUM REWARD - Video Chats: Chats can be about whatever you want (within reason!) in connection with the theme of the project. So that includes the business of writing and publishing, science fiction/fantasy in general, POC SF/F specifically, etc. But if you just want to squee about your mutual interests, that's okay too!\nIn the event we massively exceed our goal, we'd like to thank our backers by offering the following stretch goals:\n(#1) $10,000 - Essays & Artwork Booster - UNLOCKED!\nThe Personal Essays we're posting on Kickstarter throughout the campaign will also be included in the issue, and we'll double the number of stories illustrated in the issue from four to eight.\n(#2) $15,000 - Destroy/Subscriptions Booster - UNLOCKED!\nIf you chose a LIGHTSPEED subscription reward, you'll get LIGHTSPEED issues #1-73 (including the POC Destroy Science Fiction! issue), and your subscription will begin with #74 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-73, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nIf you chose a NIGHTMARE subscription reward, you'll get access to NIGHTMARE issues #1-45, and your subscription will begin with #46 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-45, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nAll other reward tiers will get 3 additional back issues of LIGHTSPEED (for a total of 6), plus 3 back issues of NIGHTMARE and 3 back issues of FANTASY.\n(#3) $20,000 - JJA POC Sampler - UNLOCKED!\nLIGHTSPEED publisher John Joseph Adams will assemble an ebook sampler of POC-authored stories previously selected for publication in his many projects. Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be like a short anthology (about 50K words; about half the size of a normal anthology). All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\n(#4) $25,000 - Podcasts Booster - UNLOCKED!\nWe normally podcast 4 (out of 8) stories we publish on our website each month. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll podcast all 7 short stories we publish on the website, plus one of the flash fiction pieces. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\n(#5) $30,000 - POC Destroy Horror! - UNLOCKED!\nWe'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Horror! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, NIGHTMARE. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Oct. 2016]\n(#6) $40,000 - POC Destroy Fantasy! - UNLOCKED!\nWe'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Fantasy! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, FANTASY. FANTASY merged with LIGHTSPEED in 2012, but we'll revive it for this one special issue. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Dec. 2016]\n(#7) $50,000 - JJA POC Anthology Booster\nWe'll make the JJA POC Sampler (the $20K stretch goal) into a full-sized anthology (about 100K words, about 20-25 stories). Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, then increase your pledge by the relevant amount.\nThere\u2019s no way to tell us NOW which add-ons you want (an unfortunate limitation of Kickstarter), so we\u2019ll get that information from you during the Kickstarter survey process after the campaign is over. Basically we\u2019ll send out the surveys and ask if you added any add-ons to your pledge, and then we\u2019ll cross-reference everything with the pledge data.\nSound complicated? It is! But it's the only way to offer the full array of options our backers have previously requested during our other campaigns.\nAdd-On Selections\nNote: All of the trade paperback rewards listed below INCLUDE the shipping price.

Pledge now at the Initiate level or higher to be eligible to become a SUPER BACKER when the campaign resumes! Details in the latest update!\nCharacters are the lifeblood of The Tower experience. This update delves into the characters, both new and old, who will be appearing within The Tower.\nLet's Talk Consortium includes the detailed narrative chart and post-mortem for CONSORTIUM Game One.  \nThe Factions at War for our Allegiance update goes into discussing factions and the Bishop classes and how it all ties into gameplay.\nIn the Consortium Bishop Combat 2.0 update , we dive deep into how combat in The Tower will be dramatically improved over the original Consortium combat experience.\nOur fourth update goes into how The Tower will be both a standalone AND continuing experience.\nOur third update is up, and this time we take a closer look at The Churchill Tower itself.\nIn our second update, we get DEEP into discussing how Diplomacy and the Spoken Word will be a major part of the gameplay. \nWe just released our first update:  The iDGi Mandate.  In here Gregory discusses the nature of Interdimensional Games and what drives us.\nThe experience of The Tower is one of absolute freedom of movement, speech and action, within a single-location, sandbox environment. There will be no cut scenes, and full control will never be taken away for \u201cgamey\u201d reasons. Immersion is absolutely paramount, and to that end the world within the Tower will feel realistically alive and reactive to however you choose to approach each and every situation.  \nA branching, \u201cwaterfall\u201d narrative and dialogue system should appeal to those looking for a truly replayable experience, and will ensure that your decisions are plentiful without feeling cheap or obvious.\nDiplomacy is a key way of traversing the narrative. Choose to speak anytime and anywhere with the push of a button. While rather difficult, you will be able to play through the entire experience without raising your weapon. Trick, bribe, scare, hire, or simply convince potential combatants to disarm, all while developing relationships with your crew, other Consortium officers, the London Police, and any other characters you meet throughout the experience.\nThe Bishop\u2019s arsenal of customizable, futuristic gadgetry gives him immense freedom of movement. Run faster, jump higher, glide through the air, breathe underwater, and fall from great heights, all while exploring every nook and cranny of the Tower.\nThe Bishop can also utilize highly experimental, potentially dangerous stealth technology, such as invisibility and sound dampening.\nFind yourself in the middle of intense firefights, and choose to either kill or incapacitate all those in your way. The Consortium officers working with you will praise you for using non-lethal means, but will react with increasing alarm should you too often resort to murderous violence. There may also be other factions interested in aiding you through the Tower, should the Consortium turn its back on you.\nAs with CONSORTIUM before it, many events within The Tower will play out regardless of your interaction with them, creating an environment cultivated for immersion and replayability. Your chosen actions (and inactions) within this environment will cause ripples, dramatically impacting the unfolding narrative in major ways.\nWe aim to simulate not just the Churchill Tower, but the people inside it and the world around it.  In many ways, we are striving to realize the \"One City Block RPG\" idea purposed by Warren Spector.\nThe following video takes a deeper look at some of The Tower\u2019s core mechanics, while also demonstrating three different ways the world press could respond to your actions as Bishop Six \u2013 is he a diplomat, ninja, or lunatic? Featured is Kiril Angelov, antagonist from Consortium Game One, and he's just been asked to comment on Bishop Six's \u201crecent behaviour.\"\nThis 2042 is connected on an unprecedented scale. Due to the unusual nature of the Churchill Tower hostage situation, there are literally billions of people watching your every (visible) decision unfold. We want you to feel as though your choices as Bishop Six carry weight on a global scale, and that those choices actually mean something.\nCrowds have formed around the tower, hundreds of police and reporters are on the scene, and you are at the centre of it all.\nThe Tower is a role-playing game in which you play as yourself, and you are being given the opportunity to physically control a man in a parallel world. His code name is Bishop Six, and he\u2019s a field agent for the Consortium, a powerful peacekeeping force in the not-quite-utopic future of 2042.\nThe Churchill Tower: most of our adventure takes place on top, inside and under this massive skyscraper in the heart of London, England\nWhen a hostage situation suddenly erupts within London\u2019s monumental Churchill Tower, Bishop Six and a team of Consortium officers are sent in to subdue the terrorists, and rescue the hostages. It sounds simple enough, but when the layers peel back you'll find that they just keep peeling. Everyone seems to want the Bishop on their side, but none are very keen to reveal just what \"their side\" truly stands for.\nConcept of the Churchill Tower Power Facility. This is where the hostages are being held, and is initially your primary mission objective.\nDiscover the source of an unnatural earthquake originating from below the Tower. Find out what's really behind the Tower's malfunctioning builder nanites. Befriend or manipulate the London Police to your advantage, or have them turn against you. Attempt to uncover the truth about the Consortium King (a sentient A.I., and the source of our connection to their world), his creator, the terrorists, your crew, and the Tower itself. Even gain the attention of a mysterious benefactor whose \"alternative\" ideas and perspectives will begin to make you question your definitions of \"friend\" and \"foe.\"\nWe're excited about creating an atmosphere where you're in the middle of a conflict for your trust and loyalty, with multiple sides struggling to keep your attention.\nTo further complicate matters, an old enemy of the Consortium tells us that within this \u201cgreat tower\u201d a global event is about to originate. The King demands our help in dealing with this, claiming multiverse-scale destruction if we refuse. Does his understanding of who we really are affect his judgement? And is the Consortium really the selfless peacekeeping organization he claims it to be?\nWithout warning enemies seemingly become friends while multiple factions vie for our assistance in unraveling a mystery stretching back thousands of years. Amidst all this chaos there is one question that only you, as the Bishop, can answer: Whom can you trust?\nThe Terrorists have taken over the Churchill Tower Power Facility, and believe it to be capable of arming a globally banned orbital bioweapon \u2013 they\u2019ve been sent in by unknown parties with instructions to prove this to the world through the use of the press.\nThe Consortium's main concern is the securing of the civilian hostages being held in the center of the Churchill Tower, and they are relying on you to make this happen as quickly as possible. Despite assurances that the Power Facility houses a safe, modern fusion reactor, the Consortium King is worried about it being tampered with and causing a devastating explosion that could destroy all of London.\nOne possible outcome...\nMysterious Benefactors encourage you to actively rebel against the Consortium. Potentially join them after gaining their trust, uncover their identity, and discover their claims of truth about the Consortium King and his officers.\nThe London Police are at first warned to keep their distance while the Consortium handle the situation. As things progress, the Police Chief can end up as friend or foe entirely dependant on your actions and interactions with him.\nA police cruiser surveys the situation...\nThe Churchill Tower itself will sometimes seem to be working for or against you: state of the art security systems, initially controlled by the terrorists, and the \u201cmalfunctioning\u201d builder nanites will need to be controlled and understood before they interfere with your mission.\nCivilians populate the various sections of The Tower, and include the hostages and any other people remaining behind after it was evacuated. As with everyone else, every civilian you meet will be a unique, fully fleshed out human being.\n1)  Add-ons can only be added at the $20 tier and higher\n2)  Simply choose what you want, and add the amounts to your pledge amount. Keep track of what you chose, as come survey time you\u2019ll need to tell us what add-ons you wanted.\n3)  Shipping charges to the U.S and Canada are *included* in these numbers, but other places in the world may have to pay additional shipping charges (to be worked out post campaign).\nT-shirts.  $60 for one, $80 for two  \nAdditional copy of the Backer Special Edition of Consortium: The Tower. $15\nFull name (or name of your choosing) used somewhere in the lore/gameworld.  $50  \nVidal's physical journal.  $110 \nPoster of The Tower signed by the team.  $80\nNon-signed posters, choose from two designs.

This means that what characters ended up where, inventory, decisions, relationships, and many conversational choices will be preserved as they were at the end of Game One, and in turn will affect situations and dialogue throughout The Tower. \nNew to the Franchise: An update will go into more detail on this, but for now you can rest assured that you do NOT have to play Consortium Game One in order to fully understand and enjoy the Tower from start to finish.\nThe Interdimensional Alternate Reality Game\nThe A.R.G. is packed with heavily layered backstory and lore for the iDGi-1 Trilogy through interactive media of all types. This particular rabbit hole goes as deep as you\u2019re willing to dig, but is absolutely not necessary to fully understand and enjoy Consortium and/or The Tower. To dive head-first into our Alternate Reality Game, started in 2010, click HERE and choose \"Experience.\u201d\nFor the latest from the A.R.G., click HERE and then select \u201cCONSOLE\u201d in order to access the iDGi-1 Command Line Interface. This is the first version of this console, and contains a single release of documents mostly pertaining to the Churchill Tower and events surrounding The Tower\u2019s story. Keep an eye out for hidden codes, and attempt to uncover a video the Consortium King does not want you to see!\nMaking games is expensive.\nWe will be gauging the success of this campaign to help us understand how much interest there is out there for this type of game, and of course how far you want us to go in realizing this project. We know exactly how to do it, and we're capable of going the whole way, but we can only do that if YOU - the global gaming market - WANT this type of game to be realized to the fullest extent possible.\nOther than what we established with Consortium, The Tower does not follow any specific formula or genre staple. Funding these kinds of projects using only traditional channels is difficult and would require us to make compromises, or at least oversimplify what we want to accomplish in designing this simulation.\nSimply put, we do not want to compromise on the vision of what we know can be accomplished.\nWe learned a lot from running the first Kickstarter for Consortium, and we feel more confident than ever that we can do this right on all fronts. The success of this campaign will quite literally Kickstart the production of The Tower and give us the means to fully produce it.\n70% of all money raised here will be spent on the salaries and invoices for the artists, programmers, designers, sound/foley folks and immense amount of voice production required to build this game. More money means larger workload, longer production cycle, and/or more employees to pay.\nThe remaining 30% will go towards all the various production and business expenses that are necessary, such as licensing fees, legal, accounting, development hardware / software, backer rewards and studio space. We have always been a partially-remote company, meaning we can hire from anywhere in the world, and employees are able to \"work from home.\" This in turn saves a lot on office expenses most companies pay a great deal for.\nWe built Consortium Game One over a long period, and on a budget that was very small considering what physically went into it. We've become very good at ensuring that everything goes where it needs to go in order to get the game made. This is a passion project for us, and so the game always comes first.\nWe do have various options for investors beyond what we raise here, but it really does entirely depend on the overall performance of this campaign to determine what kind of deal we can get. We want to make the ultimate version of this game, and therefore want its development budget to be as high as possible. No surprise there :)\nGiven our experience with making the first Consortium on an extremely tight budget, we are confident that we would be able to comfortably produce a great game with the minimum amount we're asking for here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike the campaign for our first game, this time around we are asking for a much larger portion of our total budget, and are therefore taking a bigger risk with launching this campaign. With the CONSORTIUM campaign we had already largely completed the game and required help to get us to the finish line (our CONSORTIUM Kickstarter goal covered about 10% of our total budget). With the larger scale of The Tower we are aiming for a larger total budget with a much larger portion of that coming from Kickstarter. \n\nWe already made CONSORTIUM. All of the core user interface, characters and game mechanics will be making a return in The Tower, albeit with a great deal of polish and improvement. This means that a significant amount of development risk is reduced compared to your typical project that has to make everything from scratch.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Interdimensional Games Inc\n3 created \u00b7 23 backed\nFounded by videogame industry veterans, iDGi is a collection of highly creative and driven individuals dedicated to advancing the art form...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "iDGi and Consortium in 2019...", "update_content": "Hi there,\nMany of you were interested in our project but did not follow us to Fig...just in you are still interested in our project...Consortium: The Tower is now available on Steam Early Access!\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/626250/Consortium_The_Tower/\nHere is the latest trailer for you all!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Consortium: The Tower NOW AVAILABLE", "update_content": "Greetings would-be KS backers of Consortium: The Tower:\nWe're one year into full production of the direct sequel funded by our successful Fig campaign, Consortium: The Tower, and we've made amazing progress!  \nHere is the video update:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Consortium: The Tower -- Project Update, June 2017", "update_content": "Hey folks,\nThere are just a couple of things we'd like to talk about real quick as we move toward our upcoming Fig campaign.\nInterdimensional Games Public Community Forum"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Last chance to support us and become a Super Backer!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\nWe've spent much of the past week recuperating from the first half of this crowdfunding effort, but we promised you all a full update this week on how we're planning on resuming this campaign.

With it, you can play hundreds of word games and card games. Instead of numbers, sets and runs, you use letters and make words.\nLetter Playing Cards are for all ages. Whether you\u2019re just starting out learning your letters and words in pre-school, or a scholar of the English language, fascinated by words. Whether you're a backpacker travelling light and meeting new friends, or a parent with too much luggage.\nIt's a whole new dimension on the phrase \u2018Let\u2019s have a game of cards\u2019.\nExtensively play tested, vowels and high frequency letters carefully balanced to make game play smooth. High quality, 310gsm linen cards, printed by MPC (www.makeplayingcards.com) - the world renowned custom deck manufacturer.\nHere\u2019s the short list of some of the more popular games you can play with Letter Playing Cards.\nWord Poker; Texas Spell \u2018Em; Rummy / Gin Rummy; Brag (3,4, 5 card or 9 card!); Patience / solo games; Hangman; Snaffle - the letter grab game; Old Maid; Murder (or Mafia); Word Black Jack; Letter Cheat; Word Speed or Spit; Go Fish; Hearts; Indian Word Poker; Moogle; Spoons; Letter Whist; Anagrams; Crosswords; Ghost; Flash Cards, Spelling tests, Word Bridge.\n\nAll backers will receive a pdf rule book of several games, to get them started. There are many more games you can play and learn. And as more people play Letter Playing Cards, more games will be invented and shared.\nThe Story Behind the Game.\nI'm Rafi Arkin, an award-winning games designer. I love playing card games. Playing cards are one of the most versatile, portable and universal games on the planet. Everyone knows a game or two, and a deck of cards brings people together.\nI also love word games too.\nI had a moment of inspiration last year, when making a set of flash card letters for my daughter: Letter Playing Cards.\nBringing playing cards and word games together as one. A deck of cards that anyone can play with and hundreds of new games just waiting to be created and shared.\nWhat are you funding?\nAfter the excitement of launching my first game, Foundation, in 2012, and winning Best Abstract Game of the year at the UK Games Expo, I\u2019ve caught the bug. I have so many more game ideas I want to share with the world. Letter Playing Cards is the first.\nSo I\u2019ve kept the funding amount as low as possible to enable success. The smallest viable print run, \u00a3200 (roughly $300) excluding postage to get going. This will fund the first edition print run.\nThe money raised will only go on printing, packaging and sending of the decks. (And any fees from Kickstarter etc.)\nNext Steps\nOnce we\u2019re successfully funded, it\u2019s simple. We press the button on the printing process, and start printing the decks of cards. So that everyone can receive their rewards.\nMPC will be producing the high quality playing cards. Linen stock, 310gsm. Poker size. They have produced some of the most successful Kickstarter playing card projects.\nStretch Targets: Get One, Give One.\nLetter Playing Cards is really about have a great time playing card games. But I want to give something back, if I can. So if we reach the stretch target of 250 backers, we\u2019ll unlock \u2018Get one, Give one\u2019.\nIt\u2019s a really simple concept. Once we hit 250 backers, every pack you get as a backer, we will give another pack to an organisation that could use these cards to help kids learn their letters through play.\nIf you are a school, or educational organisation from anywhere in the world, and would benefit from receiving free packs, then get in touch. As soon as we hit our stretch target of 250 packs, we can start sending decks out to people who need them.\nThis works because of scale. We\u2019re able to increase our first print run, and reduce the production cost/pack. Simple and transparent to you. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve kept delivery separate.\nTo reach our stretch goals, we will only just break-even on the funding vs. costs. And that excludes our time, design work, or prototypes we\u2019ve already paid for.\nRewards\nThere are really just two main rewards, with an early bird and normal backing amount, and savings on multiple packs if your backing amount is higher.\n1 x Letter Playing Card deck \u201cHearts & Spades\u201d\n1 x Letter Playing Card deck \u201cDiamonds & Clubs\u201d\nYou can play most games with just one deck. Some games you\u2019ll want more cards for more people, or to include all 4 suits in your game.\nWho\u2019s in the team?\nRafi Arkin came up with the game idea, and brought it to life. I\u2019m an award-winning games designer, and also works in marketing, developing strategy and running successful advertising campaigns for many successful brands.\nI\u2019d like to thank\nDarren Kisner, for his magical copywriting tips.\nShed Simove, the Ideas Man, for general motivational pep talks and top tips.\nVarious people, you know who you are \u2013 for play testing Word Poker and Texas Spell \u2018Em.\nIsabelle and Sophie Arkin \u2013 for play testing a number of children\u2019s word games.\nKickstarter \u2013 for allowing me to share this project on their wonderful website.\nMPC - For printing the prototype decks\nThank you\nIf you\u2019ve reached the end of the page, then we\u2019d like to thank you for your interest in the project so far.

We\u2019ll be working with Jacek Tuschewski, audio director and sound designer on League of Geeks\u2019 recent hit Armello!\nFIGS LOCALIZATION\nAll the stories within The Warlock of Firetop Mountain will be translated into French, Italian, German and Spanish.\nIn 1982, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, co-founders of Games Workshop and the first distributors for Dungeons and Dragons in Europe, wrote the first Fighting Fantasy gamebook - The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. In a time when videogaming and the RPG industry were in their infancy, the adventure gamebook allowed wannabe adventurers to journey to other worlds, engage with evil forces and decide the fate of themselves and the quest they were set upon.\nWith the success of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain came a whole series of Fighting Fantasy adventures, over 50 of them with supporting novels and tabletop role-playing systems. Tin Man Games has already developed and released 8 of the original books as digital gamebook apps.\nThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain is nearing the end of pre-production. This means that the story, tech, and design have been finished and we have a detailed plan for the rest of development. We need to implement the remainder of the artistic elements for the game itself, prepare sound and music, and finish design of the user interface. Should the Kickstarter exceed our initial goal, we will be looking to localise to several languages.\nWe've signed a deal with Otherworld Miniatures in the UK to use their range of pewter figurines in The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. \nTo replicate the handmade look and feel, we first 3D scan the figurines into the computer and then digitally paint them to replicate a similar style to physical miniature painting.\nFor the more unique denizens of Firetop Mountain, such as Zagor above, or for hero characters or creatures that do not have pewter figurines, we will be modelling and texturing these from scratch.\nDeep in the caverns beneath Firetop Mountain lies an untold wealth of treasure, guarded by a powerful Warlock \u2013 or so the rumour goes. Several adventurers like yourself have set off for Firetop Mountain in search of the Warlock\u2019s hoard. None has ever returned. Do you dare follow them?\n Wait... that's just one adventure. How about we try something different?\nFurious at the cowardice of your Orcish lackeys, you, the Orc Chieftain, decide to take matters into your own hands. You will single-handedly infiltrate Firetop Mountain and drive out those foolish dwarves. And you will do it for the glory of almighty Zagor!\nOr how about this?\nDeep in the caverns beneath Firetop Mountain, your dwarvern ancestors once made their home. However, they were drawn out by an army of evil Orcs, who have since taken over the mountain for themselves. Will you venture into Firetop Mountain and reclaim your ancestral home?\n\nIt looks like there are more stories to be told within Firetop Mountain than first thought...\n\nCombat has always played a big part in the Fighting Fantasy series. We have developed a new combat system, known internally as GridBluff, where both you and your opponent move or attack simultaneously. Enemies use different attack patterns and you must anticipate their moves whilst positioning yourself for the fatal blow.\nFor old-school Fighting Fantasy fans, we will also be including the option to use the standard dice rolling mechanics as found in the original books.\nThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain was the entry point to the Fighting Fantasy series and introduced readers to the world of Titan, in particular the notorious land of Allansia. We have a grand vision and want our version to do the same for a new digital generation of adventurer.\n\nFollowing the release of Warlock, we plan on expanding our reach in Allansia and will be adapting a number of classic Fighting Fantasy titles such as Deathtrap Dungeon, the trap-filled and monster-infested labyrinth of Fang where many heroes compete in the Trial of Champions, followed by Citadel of Chaos and City of Thieves.\nWe also want give players the opportunity to take digital miniatures from one story into another and further expand those locations. What would happen if Throm the Barbarian from Deathtrap Dungeon turned up in Firetop Mountain or Bigleg the Dwarf from The Forest of Doom decided to enter the Trial of Champions?\nTin Man Games was founded in 2008 and released their first title, Gamebook Adventures 1: An Assassin in Orlandes, in March 2010.\nA strong release schedule followed and in 2012, Tin Man announced they were working with Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson to produce titles from the Fighting Fantasy series. Eight FF adaptations have since been developed using the original Gamebook Adventures Engine, including The Forest of Doom, House of Hell, Starship Traveller and Caverns of the Snow Witch.\nTo date, Tin Man Games has released over 30 digital gamebooks across Steam, Humble, the App Store, Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. These also include licensed titles based on Judge Dredd, Ryan North's To Be or Not To Be, Gary Chalk's Gun Dogs, Zach Weinersmith's Trial of the Clone and Matt Youngmark's Choose-o-matic series.\nFrom left: KG Tan, Oscar Francis, Clinton Shepherd, Kamina Vincent, Ben Kosmina, Neil Rennison, Ed Blanch (not pictured: Emma Rennison)\nFighting Fantasy is a trademark owned by Steve Jackson & Ian Livingstone \u00a9 1982, 2002, 2010, 2015.

Explore a few scenes, talk to some people, solve a puzzle and guess which Murakami stories inspired us in this demo! Send your answers to BitByterz@gmail.com by 8th of November and the winner will be a character in the game.\nThree years ago I sat down with a friend to brainstorm for making a game. We both came up with the idea of a game inspired by short stories of renowned Japanese author Haruki Murakami. His work had inspired us profoundly and we thought that the vague, surrealistic reality of his fictional world would have a great potential for being turned into something visual and could lead to the creation of odd characters, an essential element in game design. After a while, my friend moved to another country, but I continued working on the idea. I wrote a script for the game, inspired by more than 20 stories by Murakami and started working on the game with a new team.\nWhat does memoranda mean? Memoranda is the plural form of Memorandum, which is defined as \"a short note designating something to be remembered, especially something to be done or acted upon in the future; reminder.\"\nMemoranda is a classic 2D Point & Click game for Linux, Mac and PC. It include more than 40 scenes, 30 characters and numerous puzzles. The puzzles are not always very easy to solve, but there are always enough clues in the story to solve them. This is the protagonist, who little by little realizes she is forgetting her own name. Interestingly, after working on the game for several years, we forgot to actually have a name for this character, and just use a nickname for her. But is she really losing her memory? Or is there something else that would explain the strange circumstances? We will find out as the story unfolds.\nThe story happens in a little town, where there are both laptops and bamboo water clocks. The town has a European-like architecture but that doesn't mean it belongs to somewhere in Europe. The characters include anything from a WWII surviving soldier to an elephant taking shelter in a man's house hoping to become human. But there's one thing that all characters have in common: they all are losing something. And that could be anything...it could be a name, a film reel box or someone's sanity! Our primary mission is to help the main character find her name back.\nMeet some of the characters, Look at some scenes and see how we animated the game:\nThe game's sound and music is still in process. To get a feel of the sound design listen to these three samples.\nWe have emptied our pockets during the first rounds of developing the game. To finish the development, which includes sound design, code optimization and debugging, and plug-in purchases, we need additional support. If we reach our Kickstarter goal, we will be able to finish the game in two or three months and release it on Steam website.\n Where the money goes? Please look at the pie chart below:\nWe have worked on this project for three years and we are confident that with additional funding we can devote all our resources to finishing the project in the next few months. Currently, we are working on the final stages of the development, namely debugging the alpha version of the game and working on sound design and music. Given that we have passed the biggest hurdles and are in the final stage, we are confident that the risk of not finishing the game is very small and close to zero.\nWho Are We\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSee below the bamboo clock!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "The iOS version is ready and will be available on the App Store on November, 1", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Anyone interested in localizing? :)", "update_content": "Hi All,  \nThe whole team at Bitbyterz wanted to thank you all one more time for helping us make this project happen.

Now I'm remaking the game for a younger audience.\nDraw a card! Read it aloud! Now do what it says... forever.\nThose are all the rules of the game! As the games go on you will balance cards on your body and contort yourself. You're In A Bind, but you still need to draw your next card!\nAll the while, you'll need to remember to do your 'triggered binds' on your turn, making animal noises and jiggling, patting or clapping.\npracticing reading\nlearning the names of basic bodyparts\nteamwork, as older children read the instructions for preschoolers\nmemory, for triggered binds\nco-ordination and dexterity, specially when drawing cards\nIn a Bind Jr takes around 15 minutes. It's best for 3-6 people but you can play with even bigger groups by combining decks and splitting into teams.\nEach card has an instruction. All are supremely simple alone, but the combinations are not!\nThe goal is survival! If you can't (or forget to) follow an instruction, you get a warning. 3 strikes and you're out!\nTeam-based mode: anyone on the team can draw, anyone can read the card and any one person on the team needs to follow the instruction.\nFor even more teamwork, try co-operative mode! Everyone draws, reads the card aloud, then gives the card to someone else. How far can you make it through the deck?\n\"A great ice-breaker for new members of the family.\" - a foster parent at a public demo\n\"Fun, zany, good times\" \"It could go over real well as an educational game due to its focus on different body parts.\" - Bower's Gaming Corner\n\"I think the game works really well.\" \"The rules sheet is perfect.\" - Imagination Gaming\n\"Always creates a fun atmosphere.\" - Rob Harris, organiser of Playtest UK,  Developer at Modiphius\n\"Genius idea!\" \"How does this not already exist?!\" - Andrew Smith, founder of Spilt Milk Studios\n\"The best game ever\" - Elzbieta Momola (attendee of the Edinburgh 'Crowdfun' event)\n\"The kids had a lot of fun, which is really the whole point of the game.\" - Bower's Gaming Corner\n \"My kids had a BLAST!\"\nTwo years ago, I started designing a game that had one 'physical' card. After the first playtest, I was encouraged to delve further into the physical aspect and within a week had created a game with challenges that forced folk to hop around tables, spin around, and make long noises.\nBy December 2013, I had simplified it manyfold and strangers at a UK game convention all enjoyed it. The concept was proven!\nOver the next few months, I continued simplifying the game, then tweaking the cards for maximum fun, ensuring it was difficult but never impossible.\nLate 2014, it was kickstarted and by June 2015, backers were enjoying their own copies. At this point, In A Bind is on sale in various shops around the UK and hundreds of people have enjoyed it!\nBack in January 2015, I attended the UK Toy Fair. One shop owner suggested that I make a children's version, something that's been suggested by a few more folk in the past few months.\nI have done my due diligence, testing and research. I've watched around 30 children and hundreds of adults playing this game. Younger children specially love the triggered actions and silly noises, whilst everyone enjoys the contortions of their friends and the physical challenges they overcome.\nI wish to present: In A Bind Junior.\nI took the best cards from the expansion, took away (or modified) cards that overly frustrated 4-year-olds and added more animal noises.\nIn A Bind Jr is simpler (and sillier) and has been proven to still be fabulous fun, even for adults!\nThis game is aimed at children from around 4-8. As long as one of the children is old enough to read, they should be able to play together without adult intervention.\nIf it's played as a family game, every generation will have fun - children, adults and grandparents.\nThis is the first edition of In A Bind Jr, and also (almost certainly) the smallest print-run. Each edition will feature all-new artwork, so if you care about 'limited edition' things, this will be the most 'exclusive'.\nFuture editions will be similar but different, tweaked based on feedback.\nA NOTE ON PRICE\nThese prices are calculated at 10% above my costs, based on a print run of 500. This is a venture, aimed at printing a small print run to test demand and get some feedback, rather than making profit.\n\nThe 'discounts' for buying more games is entirely due to the cost of postage.\nWhen this is sold after the KS, the RRP will be \u00a39.\nYou are getting a great deal, if I may say so.\nAll-new art. Watercolours. More fantastical creatures.\nRemoved left/right, modifying cards.\nRemoved cards that refer to specific fingers (e.g. index finger).\nRemoved 'one eye closed' as some younger children can't physically do this.\nRemoved some other cards (e.g. 'two arms touching') to lower difficulty/frustration.\nRemoved some other cards (e.g. 'this card in armpit') to avoid wear and tear.\nAdded 'triggered binds' that appeared in the expansion, modifying them to trigger once a round (not each turn).\nAdded a lot more animal noises (ducks, cows, lions, frogs\u2026).\nDuplicated some cards that ask you to put this card somewhere. They will still all have unique art, but the character will remain consistent, to help comprehension. One card - 'this card between 2 fingers' is duplicated 6 times, whilst 'this card on top of head' only exists once to make the game generally easier. There are still 55 unique cards with 40 unique instructions.\nAdd \u00a33 to your pledge and I will write a small dedication to you (or a friend) inside the lid. You can either tell me what to write (up to around 50 characters) or just give me the name(s) and leave the rest up to me.\nIf you are buying multiple copies, add \u00a33 for each copy you want signed and dedicated.\nIf you want to buy a copy of the original In A Bind + Expansion pack, add \u00a314 to your pledge for each copy you want.

As mentioned, I personally struggle to do just one thing. But as stated, I'll wait until the IAB Jr files are sent off to the printer so I can progress to the next thing with a clear conscience. Next time, I'll be more mindful of my need to switch projects from time to time and give myself the time and freedom to do so.\n\nYesterday, on a bus to Scotland, I put my new laptop to good use and finally finished the manual and card front PDF. The box art is also done, though I edited one picture this morning, so it must be re-rendered. The card back is the only thing remaining.\n\n\nI previously suggested you could mix IABJr with IAB cards. I forgot that Trefl and Cartamundi print at slightly different sizes. As such, they might be difficult to shuffle together.\n\nI'd known this going into the campaign and had mentioned this (under 'Add ons'). But I'm sorry for briefly forgetting and perhaps getting someone's hopes up.\n\nAnyway, I'm still going to go with a near-identical card back. I think that has more potential for hilarity and - since the fronts of the original IAB are all black and white - they're still easy to distinguish.\n\nAfter I redo the card back to fit the new dimensions, it's a case of uploading a few Gb of art files, getting it verified by Trefl (the printer I'm using) and then waiting for them to get it done. Most of this will require almost no input from me.\n\nI am going to run my next KS on Thursday.\n\nI think at this point, you should expect to get your games at the end of May/start of June, though this is just an estimate and it depends where in the world you live.\n\nI have not yet sent out surveys to get your addresses. I will do so soon, and then I will need you to fill that out at some point before I can post you anything.\n\nThis year, I actually have a stand at UK Games Expo - my first time that I won't be there as a volunteer but a trader! - and if you're in the UK, you could come over to grab your game, if you prefer that option.\n\nHaving attended for 5 years as a non-trader, I can say that it's a lot of fun.

Stop them by whatever means necessary. \nA single selector (phone number, email address, name) is all it takes for your team to surveil a target. It\u2019s your job to decipher the intel, and follow the trail to its source.\nBut surveillance has a price...\nIn the paranoid world of the NSA, anyone can become a target, and soon your friends are in the firing line. \nEveryone has something to hide, will you reveal it?\nWant a taster? Try the demo to get a first look of what the finished game will be like.\nNSA HQ, Fort Meade -where the story unfolds\nTop Secret is a narrative-driven game played by email. Fundamentally, it\u2019s an exploration of the complex issues raised by the Snowden leaks.\nBlend of fact and fiction: You\u2019ll investigate the journalists involved in the Snowden leaks and the methods they used to cover their tracks. Uncover real messages sent by Snowden at the time.\nNon-linear, branching narrative: You choose who you surveil and in what order. The direction your investigation takes is entirely up to you.\nShorter, richer: Numerous unchosen possibilities add depth to the story. You will only see a fraction of the game content in a single playthrough.\nDelayed consequences: Players are encouraged to roleplay rather than optimise strategy - choices will have significant consequences, but not necessarily immediate or expected ones.\nAsk more of players: The game will demand your curiosity and focus. But hey, you\u2019re leading an investigation for the NSA, it was never gonna be easy right?!\nReal-time story  \nThe narrative unfolds in real-time over many days. The player has time to reflect on their choices, and immerse themselves in the story.\nPlaying by email adds new dimensions to traditional interactive fiction. A delayed response can mean a character is busy, disinterested, or cautious. A quick reply can signify impatience, anger, or excitement. Top Secret injects meaning into both the contents and timing of a message.\nMaster the encryption methods used by Snowden\nPlay with the real encryption method used by Snowden\nReceive and decrypt enciphered messages at critical moments in the game. Use your ingenuity and crypto skills to uncover all of the secrets!\nFor added authenticity, Top Secret can be played with PGP so you can encrypt/decrypt every message in the same way Snowden did to hide from the NSA.\nAll you need to play the game is an email address!\nYou will receive and reply to real emails from the characters in the game. You read and reply to them just like any other normal email you receive, directly from your inbox.\nThe content of each message suggests various reply options to the player. Including one of the options in your reply continues the story. E.g. for the message:\n\u201cShould we do X or Y?\u201d\na valid response would be:\n\u201cLet\u2019s do X\u201d\nBut choose wisely! Your choices determine how the story progresses and can have unforeseen consequences.\nFor interactive fiction fans, Top Secret is more a choice-based (rather than parser) game. Email latency does not encourage much experimentation with replies, so the game tries to make valid options completely transparent. It\u2019s about the choices you make, rather than working out the possible responses.\nPlatforms supported\nBest played by email, Top Secret also supports offline play on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux\nTop Secret is best played in real-time by email and can be played on any device which supports email. The game will also be available as a digital copy for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\nThe digital copy is DRM-free and is completely playable offline. The content is identical to the email version, but messages are sent and received immediately from a fake inbox.\nAll reward tiers with the game include both the email AND digital copy.\nUntil now Top Secret has been entirely self-funded, but I need your help to finish the game.\nSo where will the money go and why I am asking for \u00a38000?\nYour support will cover the cost of the remaining programming and content creation. After fees and physical reward costs, the money is broken down as follows:\n- 70% will fund the writing and gameplay iteration\n- 25% will be used to improve the game tech and content-creation tools (both of which will be open sourced)\n- 5% will fund art assets for the reward tiers (poster, t-shirt) and promotion (logo, wallpapers)\nJust as importantly, I really need your feedback and knowledge to make this game the best it can be.

Top Secret is going to be a collaborative experience, I want you all to get involved!\nFailbetter Games Incubation\nTop Secret will be incubated by Failbetter Games! They\u2019ll be giving advice, support, and office space throughout the development of the game. \nExperts in game writing, Failbetter have successfully taken a game from Kickstarter to launch and beyond so know the best practices when it comes to developing a crowdfunded game.\nRead more about the incubation and what it means for Top Secret here.\nProgress\nI\u2019ve already been working on Top Secret for 10 months now and have a prototype. Emails are sent to the player in real-time, replies are received, PGP encryption is supported, and all the core gameplay elements are in place.\nBut the game is not yet finished!

I created this game by working backwards from that price point, figuring out the size and weight limitations to be able to mail it anywhere in the world at the cheapest possible rate, and then setting the leftover amount per game as my production budget.\nIn this two-player tabletop game, each person controls a starcraft carrier and its six squadrons of fighters and bombers. Players take turns launching their squadrons, dogfighting in space, launching torpedoes at the enemy carrier, and escaping back to their own mothership. There, they reload, refuel, and line up on the flight deck to launch on another mission.\nParts of the Game: Carrier Commander will consist of a board printed on a single 14 pt card, with the rules printed on the back and the counters printed on the left and right margins to save space and printing cost. The board, rules, and counters will all be available as print & play .pdf as well.\nEach side has:\n1 frigate - a support ship that maintains a defensive line against incoming enemy fighters and bombers, and can help recover damaged ships\n3 starfighters - starships that are purpose-built for shooting down enemy fighters, but can be used to torpedo the enemy mothership at need\n3 torpedo boats - heavy attack starships that are purpose-built for taking out the mothership, but can be used to shoot down enemy fighters at need\nBreakdown of Expenses: The minimum print run is 250 copies. Here is the line item breakdown of cost per game. Note: I collected quotes from 22 printers before figuring out how I could do this; this itemized list is as good as inexpensive as I can possibly make it. Here is the exact breakdown, using the heaviest and most expensive contents from the stretch goals. Obviously, if we don't hit those stretch goals, it will be a bit lighter and a bit cheaper. Also, as volume goes up, the per-unit cost goes down (except the postage and Kickstarter fees, which are fixed).\nKickstarter & Credit Card Fees $0.300 (0.000 oz)\n24 pt Board @ 4\"x9\" (102mmx229mm) $0.340 (0.445 oz)\n100# Rule Sheet @ 4\"x9\" (102mmx229mm) $0.171 (0.223 oz)\nInternational Postage for Letter @ 1 oz $1.200 (0.010 oz)\n#10 Tyvek Envelope $0.348 (0.110 oz)\nAddress Processing $0.380 (0.000 oz)\n2 mil Zip Lock Bag @ 4\"x9\" (102mmx229mm) $0.140 (0.110 oz)\nTOTAL - $2.879 (0.898 oz)\nSo if all stretch goals are unlocked, we'll squeak in under the weight limit (probably the single most important part of the whole project, as increased weight means higher postage cost) and the per-game cost will still be under the $3 pledge level.\nThis game requires one 6-sided die. Players roll the die on their turn and have a number of options available to them according to the result. Some numbers give you multiple options, so you'll have to choose which to do.\n1-3 Activate a Squadron - Advance a launched squadron this many spaces towards the enemy carrier. If the squadron is within this many spaces of the enemy carrier, it fires a torpedo at the enemy then turns and begins the trip home.\n3-5 Activate the Carrier - Advance a squadron one space in your own carrier. Squadrons need to be recovered upon arrival, then moved from the flight deck to the hangar bay to be refueled and rearmed, then returned to the flight deck for launch.\n5-6 Activate the Frigate - Move the frigate one space in either direction. The frigate acts as a support ship, shooting at enemy spacecraft and repairing damaged friendly spacecraft.\nIn this example of play, consider the following situation.\nEach starship counter is double sided. One side has a squadron at full strength, the other has the squadron damaged. Damaged squadrons cannot move or shoot, but they still occupy that space on the board. If your frigate can get to them in time, the squadron can be repaired and continue its mission. If any enemy gets a hit on a damaged squadron, it is destroyed and removed from the game. The first player to eliminate all enemy squadrons from the game wins.\nThe margin on this game is thin enough that I can't open up my other games as add-ons just yet. If I did, we'd run the risk of unlocking a stretch goal because of the funding level, but not actually being able to afford it because the money that would have paid for it instead needs to pay for other games.\nBut what Ican do is let backers add additional copies of Carrier Commander for $3 each. You can add any number of copies you want, it could be one additional game, it could be 21 additional games. This will effectively turn one backer into multiple backers, because the games will mail separately in individual envelopes. Unless, of course, I can find some newfangled way to squeeze multiple games into a single envelope and not go insane trying to keep thousands of backer incentives organized and accurate. For now, they'll mail separately.\nKickstarter Crowdfunding - Friday, September 4 - Sunday, September 27\nFunds Deposited - estimated Monday, October 12\nPrint Run Commissioned - estimated Tuesday, October 13\nPrint Run Shipped - estimated Tuesday, October 20\nPrint Run Arrives - estimated Monday, October 26\nIncentives Mailed - estimated Tuesday, October 27\nUSA Incentives Delivered - estimated beginning Wednesday, October 28 (In the past, 97% of USA incentives have been delivered within a week, but I've had USPS take up to 23 days.)\nForeign Incentives Delivered - estimated beginning Tuesday, November 3 (In the past, most European incentives arrived in 5-7 days, Spain and Italy in 6-9 days, the rest of the world 10-16 days; Australia and Canada can take up to a month, Argentina can take two months.)\nUNLOCKED! - Upgrade Board to 16 pt Cardstock: 14 pt is about normal for trading cards and card games, and a bit thicker than normal playing cards. But it's kind of thin for a board. When we reach this level of funding, I'll be able to upgrade the board from 14 pt to 16 pt card stock.\nUNLOCKED!! - Upgrade Board to 24 pt Card Stock: Now we're talking! I've got samples from the printer, and this is good stuff. Whereas the 14 and even 16 pt stocks can be difficult to handle, this card stock is thick enough that you'll be able to manipulate it, grip the edges, and flip it, unlike the thinner stock, where you sometimes have to push it to the edge or up against something to get a handle on it.\nUNLOCKED!!! - Upgrade to Separate 24 pt Board & Counters and 100# Rules Sheet: Having the rules on the back of the board saves money, but it can be a pain in the neck, until you've played a few games and have them more or less memorized. At this level, I can afford to have the rules printed separately from the board, and the counters, too. That means that you won't have to worry about messing up the board with a bad cutting job on the counters.\nUNLOCKED!!!! - Add a 2 mil Zip Lock Bag: Sometimes the local post offices aren't too careful with your mail. Sometimes it gets wet. (Too bad all the junk mail seems to arrive in perfect shape, though, right?) At this funding level I will purchase zip lock bags in bulk and all games will be packed and mailed in a bag for protection against the elements.\nUNLOCKED!!!!! - New Missions & Counters: At this funding level, the volume discount will make expanding the game affordable. Carrier Commander will grow from a single mission game (Carrier v. Carrier) with two teams of 7 counters to a three-mission game (Asteroids! Trench Run) with two teams of 15 counters, overlays to turn carriers into bases or freespace, and new options such as defense towers, asteroids, mines, dropships, space marines, civilian space trains, and AWACs. It also adds the ability to \"charge up\" your forces by calling Flight Quarters, Shields Up, or Admiral on the Bridge.\nThe new rulebook, with two new missions, options for advanced play, and solo rules.\nThe new counter sheet, with all the new units, overlays, and charge ups.\nUNLOCKED!!!!!! - Gloss Laminated Counter Sheet & Resized for DVD Case: At this level, I can upgrade the counters to a gloss laminated sheet. This will increase the longevity of your game and help protect it from the ravages of time and handling. The downside is that the board will be slightly thinner to make up for the weight of the laminate, but you handle the counters a lot more than you handle the board, so that's a smart trade, right? Also, the gloss will help those colors pop. Another great thing about this stretch is that by switching to the more expensive printer, it opens up different sizing options, including (drum roll) one that is just about perfect for a DVD case. I won't be able to mail the cases to you, but if you want to store your game in one and have an extra, here it is. I'll even work up a cover for you to print out and slip in.\nUNLOCKED!!!!!!! - Another $3 game!: This is where the heat-bonded lamination stretch goal breaks out of single digit cents and turns a profit in the double digits again. So if we hit this funding level, I will consider this both a creative success and a financial success, and I will commit to creating another $3 game. I don't know what it is, yet ... but I'll commit to doing another one.\nPocket Option Games was started by me (C. S. Ferguson) to revitalize microgames. Board games have had a colossal increase in size, weight, and price, so much that many people can't afford them. In 1977, Metagaming Concepts introduced microgames: a hex map, a counter sheet, and a rule booklet, all in a ziplock bag for $2.95. They were accessible, playable, and portable. Unfortunately, Metagaming went bankrupt after 9 years. Pocket Option Games picks up where they left off. $2.95 in 1977 adjusts for inflation to $11.62 in 2015. So I'm creating small, lightweight, fun games that can be produced and delivered worldwide for $11.62. Slip a game under the cover of a book, in the corner of a handbag, or into a jacket pocket. That's what makes these pocket options. Take a look!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) Project must fund. (duh) \n2) I must remain sound of mind and body.

Thousands of random characters are born, live and die as the game is generated, creating totally unique societies each time. When starting a new game you do so from your character's birth, choosing your parents and all your major life choices as you grow up. Your choices determine your personality, your friends, relatives, business contacts and your enemies.\nThere is no set story. The game generates thousands of characters, events and interactions to set the scene: as a player, you are born into this world and form relationships in it before the game starts. You\u2019ll then be able to create your own legend within this world: explore the known (and unknown) solar system, trade goods, run missions, leverage your contacts, and avenge members of your family as you see fit.\nHere's the core gameplay loop you'll experience when playing the final game (some features coming soon):\nYou land at London's space port and immediately head to the market to see if an old contact of yours, Caleb Churley, will still give you a good deal on your cargo. Whilst offloading your metal delivery, you discover through chatting to Caleb that he needs a parcel taking to Vikon on Venus. It's a bit of a distance, but you know they're short of water at the moment, so you buy all you can fit into your small ship. Caleb's grateful for the parcel delivery, so you get a good price on the cargo.\nYou drop by the bar on the way out, and discover that Rachel Holden was seen in Vikon recently. You've been meaning to try and track her down, as you've been asked by the local crime syndicate to keep them up to date with her whereabouts. This little trip is turning into the perfect excuse to handle some unfinished business.\nYou debate whether to take passengers to Vikon. Your ship isn't fitted with passenger cabins yet, but it's worth seeing who wants to go. In a local hotel you find three people keen to go: almost too keen. They're willing to pay way over the odds for transport, which means you're likely to have someone on your tail once you leave Earth's safe zone. We can run that risk, but in order to have space for the cabins on your ship, you'll need to remove your escape capsule. That means if the ship gets blown up it's game over for you. It's a huge risk, but you could really do with the money... plus one of the passengers is the son of Charles Heckler, someone you'd love to get an introduction to...\nSol Trader isn't just a concept: it's already in beta. This game is already real, and already fun, with all the features listed above (apart from those listed as \"coming soon\"). We are already greenlit on Steam.\nI'm on Kickstarter to raise awareness, to give people a chance to get in on the beta process early, and to help make the game awesome during the final few months of development. The money I've asked for will mainly go towards artwork and music costs:\nIf you back at the \u00a310 OWNER level and above then we'll send you a copy of the game on release. If you want additional copies, then just add \u00a310 to your pledge for each extra copy.\n\u00a310 was originally the early bird tier, but it seems unfair for people to get a better price just because they happened to check the site quicker than others. Therefore I've decided to offer everyone on Kickstarter the \u00a310 early bird price. The price will go up to the retail pre-order price of \u00a315 as soon as the campaign ends!\nBy backing this Kickstarter at the \u00a320 INSIDER level and above you'll get a access to new beta builds as they are released, right from the end of the campaign. You will be able to shape the game during its final months. Plus you'll get some great rewards, too :) INSIDER will still be available after the campaign ends but will cost \u00a325 instead of \u00a320 - don't miss the Kickstarter price!\nI have no plans to launch on Steam Early Access as it restricts beta access only to people using Steam. There will be a regular Steam launch on game release. The game will retail at \u00a315 on Steam.\nmore varied missions\ndifferent cultures\nmore planets to explore\na full weapon and ship customisation system\nmore artwork and sound\nIf we blow through our target, then I have more awesome stuff I'd love to add! See the Stretch Goals section below.\nThe preview demo only has about a third of the art content I want it to have on launch. Aamar Rana my resident artist has some cool concepts for some extra jump gates and there are many more planets and moons to create. Some of the money will go on commissioning this artwork, plus custom art for some of the rewards.\nI have commissioned a soundtrack from the awesome Andy Dollerson and he's done a great job of capturing the mood and feel of the game. We're planning four main tracks, with more as a future Stretch Goal. As a taster, here's the first preview track:\nThis roadmap is subject to change and reordering, but will give you an idea of what's left to do and what order I'll add new features in.\nAt the start of my career, I worked for four years as a professional AAA games programmer. I worked at Elixir Studios, working on Evil Genius, Republic: the Revolution and other unannounced titles.\nAfter this, I built a software service company from scratch to 12 people, creating and shipping lots of software projects for customers. I started programming 30 years ago and have been programming professionally for 16 years. I now train other programmers and blog and speak at conferences regularly on programming and team dynamics.\nVisit my blog for more about me \u226b\nI've been working on Sol Trader since November 2011.

You will also get a Steam key.\nAccess to the beta program: You'll get access to a special forum which I'll use to distribute new build of the game and to gather feedback. Builds will be released regularly and I will spend a good deal of time reading and responding to feedback and engaging with the community.\nA digital copy of the Sol Trader soundtrack: You will receive all the music composed for the game as a set of high definition music files.\nThe Sol Trader guide: you will receive a digital PDF book with hi-res art, all the schematics and images of the various ships and the history of the Sol Trader universe.\nAdd a name to the ancestor database: you may add one name and surname of your choosing to the database of ancestor names. A fixed number of these names will be taken at random when generating a new history. All names must be approved by me before being added and must fit into the game world.\nPrinted Sol Trader manual: We have a real treat in store for you here. We're producing a cloth covered hardbound version of the Sol Trader manual, with embossed silver leaf title. The book will contain both the regular game manual (distributed free with the game as a PDF) and the Sol Trader guide.\nLife time season pass for upcoming DLCs for free: you'll get a free key for every piece of DLC content I ever produce for Sol Trader.\nCoaching Conference calls: I work as a software team consultant for many different companies, teaching development, games, code, great team practice, testing, communication and leadership. I'm offering a one hour consultancy session on Skype where I can hear the issues you're facing, make recommendations, point you to other resources and help you avoid common errors.\nI've written a lot of articles at http://chrismdp.com - have a read for an idea of how I might be able to help.\nThe conference calls need be during UK office time and both be scheduled within 60 days of the Kickstarter closing.\nDinner in London: I'll take you out to a slap up dinner at a top restaurant in central London, where you can ask lots of questions about the game, pick my brains about game development, marketing, or chat about anything you like. We'll pay for food and wine, you pay your own travel costs. You must be available to come to London in early December 2015. This one is for over 18s only.\nName an in-game city: All names must be approved by Chris before adding :)\nDesign a ship: come up with a concept picture, name and description and we will add your ship permanently to the game. All designs and text must be approved by Chris before added and must fit into the game world.\nDesign a famous NPC: Your NPC will form part of the history of the game before the generation starts, and their story will be written into the history as printed in the Sol Trader guide and manual.

It's also possible that any stretch goals will cause this deadline to slip slightly, or I need to tweak game balance more than expected to make the end result better. \n\nIt's definitely coming out though. I've got this far. If there are any delays in shipping the game next April, I'll communicate promptly through Kickstarter updates.\n\nThanks very much for checking out my campaign: if you have any questions please do let me know.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Ealdorlight's Kickstarter is live!", "update_content": "Dearest Sol Trader backers,\nIt's the moment you've been waiting for - the Ealdorlight Kickstarter is live!\nVisit the campaign >>\nI decided fairly early on that I wanted to take Ealdorlight to Kickstarter.

It's both the game I had always wanted to play as a kid and a present for my daughter to enjoy today \u2013 for her to have fun, and perhaps even learn something in the process. In the 2 years I\u2019ve already spent on development, it would sometimes cross my mind that I should've just bought her some candy or a toy instead, but since I've gone so far it'd be rather silly to back out now. Encouraged by my cooperation with OhNoo, I want to finish what I started, in the scope that this game truly deserves.\nOhNoo: TSIOQUE is the next stage of our in-house engine we had created for our previous games. Aside from controlling the protagonist, you can also control the camera. This small element adds dynamic to the classic adventure gameplay. We're also developing a dynamic music system, changing moods and themes to fit the player's actions. You can hear the sample of it in the demo. It's the blend of dynamic music and rich frame-by-frame animation that makes the game unique.\nA 100% hand-drawn adventure with a unique atmosphere and a vivid, individual style, by the award-winning animation filmmaker and self-proclaimed genius Alek Wasilewski.\nStory with a twist \u2013 a clever storyline that may surprise you.\nHumor? Check. Darkness? Check. Suspense? Check! What more could you ask for?\nLOTS of 2D animation \u2013 all characters and items are hand-animated, frame-by-frame, old-school-style.\nA living, breathing environment, full of hidden interactions. Did we mention the game would have lots of animation?\nExceptional soundtrack by Edward Harrison (NEOTOKYO, LUCKY DAY FOREVER) and Elle Kharitou, dynamically illustrating the gameplay and adjusted to your every action.\nThe protagonist \u2013 a little girl with a talent for bringing chaos and destruction wherever she goes. Those who dare stand in her way are in for a lot of trouble...\nBeautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds.\nFully voiced dialogue tracks.\nNot just for children \u2013 a multi-layered tale, created with respect for both younger players and older, more demanding ones, which can be appreciated by everyone on their own level.\nYou can \"die\" in this game! - It's an adventure game, so explore, solve puzzles... but beware. You will not always have the comfort of infinite time for solving a problem \u2013 sometimes you may need to think fast! Other times, you may want to think twice before choosing a course of action, as the wrong decision may cost you your freedom... or worse!\nNon-episodic storytelling \u2013 you will find no \"Find out what happens next, pay more money!\" cliffhangers here. We are not particularly fond of episodic gameplay, so here, you get the complete experience \u2013 the story told from start to finish, from the introduction to the grand finale.\nA changing, mysterious and dangerous world \u2013 even before the Wizard's attack, the castle held many secrets. Now, bound by a powerful spell, the castle has not only become home to demons and magical creatures, but also, itself, has been affected by the evil power... It bends and shapeshifts, forming layers upon layers of transformation and illusion... It is an essential part of the plot and \u2013 especially later in the game \u2013 is tightly integrated into the gameplay.\nThe primary source of inspiration was inarguably LIFE, which always writes the best stories. But of course we do not live in cultural vacuum. While developing Tsioque, we couldn\u2019t help but be inspired by the things that amazed and captivated us in our childhood days spent in front of the pale glow of CRT monitors.\nThis surely included the clever, humorous storyline backed by striking, unique art style in DAY OF THE TENTACLE; the simple gameplay and serious approach to younger players in Ron Gilbert productions such as PAJAMA SAM; the beautiful, dark, dangerous world seen through a young boy\u2019s eyes in HEART OF DARKNESS, ; the wonderfully animated epic fantasy and its gruesome punishments for player\u2019s mistakes in DRAGONS LAIR, or INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS, an old Lucasarts classic with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and action, where carelessness could cost you dearly.\nALEK: I have extensive experience in running projects solo. Instead of knocking on hundreds of doors, spending my time trying to convince people my idea really is great, I often preferred to simply do it. I would then lock myself in seclusion and, forgetting about the world outside my workstation, spend months \u2013 sometimes years \u2013 chiseling practically every aspect of production, until it was done. I was prepared to make great sacrifices, because nearly all my projects were born out of passion \u2013 and this one was no different. Here, I also decided to do everything I could single-handedly... but after 2 years of almost constant work, a realization eventually passed through my thick stubborn skull into my brain. I am no longer the person I used to be. I've now become a loving husband and father. I have people in this world that I cared about and I have been hurting them with my total commitment to work \u2013 the work I was supposed to do for them. For my family, I finally had to admit to myself I couldn't do this on my own anymore. I need your help. We need your help.\nOhNoo: We're a small team of 3 enthusiasts, creating games at near-zero budgets. We keep raising the bar for ourselves and our games, and this is the result. TSIOQUE is an amazing game, with great animations, dynamic music and fully dubbed characters. It's a great next step for us, but we cannot finish it without your help. Among other challenges, we need more animators to produce a large amount of frame-by-frame animation, and this requires more funding.\nWe are still determined to complete TSIOQUE, even if it means doing it only with our own hands, at minimal cost, with bare-minimum outside help.\nHowever, with your support, we can invite more artists to the project and truly let it spread its wings. Everything would get done quicker, be prettier, more detailed \u2013 and, eventually, we could simply put everything we intended there, after achieving a certain stretch goal.\nThis would give a terrific boost to practically every aspect of the production, but especially ANIMATION \u2013 2D frame-by-frame animation is a painstaking task, which just happens to be the visual highlight of this project. We are not even dreaming of reaching a budget allowing us to fairly compensate such work \u2013 that is why most (or almost all) animation is still going to be done by Alek \u2013 but animators invited to collaborate do deserve half-decent pay for their effort.\nThe funds gathered would also be used to support the following:\nBACKGROUNDS\nSOUND DESIGN (music and sfx)\nVOICE ACTING\nTranslations (if the appropriate stretch goal is reached)\nPorting to new platforms (if the appropriate stretch goal is reached)\nOur initial and primary goal is to reach $35,000. If we are able to reach more, we'll be able to fulfill the folowing strech goals:\n35,000 \u2013 BARE BONES \u2013 the game is made and we don't starve in the process. Hooray!\n45,000 \u2013 MY HOMES ARE MY CASTLES \u2013 Android, Ouya and iOS versions + translations to Spanish, German, Russian, Italian, and French.\n\nOriginally, the game is being developed for PC in English and Polish. We would like to release the game on other platforms and in other languages as well.\n55,000 \u2013 EPIC! \u2013 The soundtrack will be performed by a philharmonic orchestra.\nYou have listened to TSIOQUE's soundtrack and thought it was impressive? This may be just a taste of the real thing. Release the true potential of Edward Harrison's and Elle Kharitou's music and make a full orchestral soundtrack a reality!\n70,000 \u2013 WIZARDRY \u2013 Additional mini-episode somewhere near the end of your journey. Become the Evil Wizard and discover the true motivations behind his evildoing.\n85,000 \u2013 LEGENDS OF THE KINGDOM \u2013 Delve even deeper into the world of TSIOQUE and uncover ancient legends \u2013 stories about ancient heroes and beasts, providing a richer background of the Kingdom's history. These will be hidden in dusty libraries and secret chambers in the Castle.\n99,999 \u2013 OOPS! \u2013 More animations for failures and wrong actions, all too common in adventure games. You think taking on a monster with a shoelace is a great idea? Try and see what happens!\nThe world of TSIOQUE is inhabited by creatures of all sorts \u2013 humans, animals, monsters, you name it. Do not let appearances deceive you: some seemingly nice people may not necessarily have the best intentions, and a terrifying-looking monster may not be all that evil. Fortunately, even in worst-case scenarios, Tsioque can always count on help from her friends, whom she will find in the least expected places.\nTSIOQUE - Our protagonist, the princess. While still just a little girl, she's not the type of princess who waits for Prince Charming to come rescue her. She's a warrior princess - strong, extremely stubborn, used to taking matters in her own hands. Her will is made of iron but her heart's made of gold. Her relentless curiosity constantly leads her to trouble.\nTHE WIZARD \u2013 Our main villain, the evil sorcerer who \u2013 taking advantage from the QUEEN's absence \u2013 claimed rulership of the Kingdom and imprisoned princess TSIOQUE. Powerful, cunning and full of insatiable ambition, he considers the Kingdom just a stop on the way to total world domination. A (quite literally) dark character, with a constant frown on his face, the WIZARD is filled with inner anger so great that it emanates from the top of his head with a flame of evil magic.\nTHE GOOD QUEEN \u2013 Princess TSIOQUE's mother, gentle and kind, but just as strong as her daughter. In the beginning of the story, she leaves to a faraway land to battle an evil PHOENIX threatening the Kingdom.\nIMPS \u2013 A small army of the WIZARD's magically created minions. With the WIZARD too busy plotting world domination, it is those creatures that stand between TSIOQUE and her freedom. They may seem bumbling and stupid, but they are not to be underestimated. The castle is crawling with them, and if they see you, you are doomed.\n...and much, much more.\nThe game is being co-created by OhNoo Studio and Alek Wasilewski, who assembled a team of independent artists to help his vision come to life.\nThis is just us, a couple of guys, and people who wish to creatively support our continued work.\nWe are not a big company. We do not have sponsors, publishers, investors or shareholders. We do not even have an office. This campaign is not a marketing stunt, a \u201cproof of concept\u201d supposed to coax our superiors into handing us millions of dollars. We really want to fund this project through this campaign!\nCall us naive, but we really count on your help.\nYou can watch Alek's latest film LUCKY DAY FOREVER below (warning: NSFW):\nIf you want more, visit his Youtube channel, and keep an eye on this website as well.\nHaving completed Amelia, we raised the bar and started working on a dark point-and-click adventure game \u2013 \u201cTormentum \u2013 Dark Sorrow\u201d. We raised funds for its completion on the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform. The game was released in 2015, and is available on Steam.\nBoth of our games were well received. \u201cAmelia and Terror of the Night\u201d got 5 stars on iOS and Android, while Tormentum has a 72 rating on Metacritic, as well as very positive reviews from players. Unfortunately, critical acclaim is not always followed by commercial success, and this is why we still need your support. One of the reasons is that we do not have a marketing budget. We are just good at doing what we love, which is making games \u2013 the rest is happening on its own. We do whatever we can to promote our work, but what we have learned is that without money for advertising, you really need a lot of luck to succeed.\nWorking on TSIOQUE, we use our experience in creating games for both older and younger audiences. If you want to find out the result, put your trust in us.\nAll backgrounds in the game are made by one talented illustrator \u2013 Micha\u0142 Urbanski.\nMicah\u0142 Urba\u0144ski \u2013 He is a translator by education and an illustrator by choice. Around 2013, he decided to pursue his lifelong passion and began a professional career in visual arts. Since then, he has cooperated closely with Alek Wasilewski and the OhNoo indie game studio as a background painter, and has done freelance work within projects by some of the major Polish studios, such as Platige Image or Juice.\nMusic is an essential element in any game, inseparably combined with the player's every move. Just as in movies, it can make \u2013 or break \u2013 the whole experience. TSIOQUE\u2019s awesome dynamic soundtrack is created by 2 artists: Ed and Elle.\nEdward Harrison: aka 0edit, is a composer, sound designer best known for the Neotokyo OST and for his previous collaboration with Alek on Lucky Day Forever. While he continues to develop his distinctive flavor of cyberpunk electronica on upcoming projects, he has relished the chance to return to orchestral composition. Tsioque is in many ways a dream project for him, as it was his childhood (and enduring) love for the classic LucasArts adventures of the '90s that inspired him to compose for games in the first place.\nElle Kharitou: Self confessed as utterly obsessed with music, sound and noise (and caffeine), Elle Kharitou, aka blissbox, is a classically trained composer and sound designer, specializing in complex, genre dissolving Electronic music. Her works have a unique and highly visual flavour which she is putting to use on a number of upcoming audio-visual projects. She is now drawing on her love of 20th century orchestral music to bring a rich and distinct quality to the world of Tsioque.\nBy helping us finish our game you will \u2013 of course \u2013 gain our infinite gratitude. But that is certainly not all!\nPerks with physical rewards have shipping costs included, so you do not have to worry about extra costs being added.\nHere are the backer rewards with brief descriptions. Do not hesitate, become a backer today! You know you want to!\nThe 2 perks below are inspired by the tradition of medieval sponsors, who \u2013 along with a piece of art \u2013 bought themselves immortality.\n1) Knight $300 (limited: 30)\nYour face will be found among the figures inhabiting a painting or fresco in-game. The final look may vary depending on the style of a given art piece, but it will unmistakably be you.\n2) PATRON OF THE ARTS $2500 (limited: 5)\nYour likeness will inhabit the foreground of a monumental painting or become the sole subject of a portrait. Set in an honorable spot in the game, your individual painting will be impossible to miss. Be depicted as a knight, magnate, princess, cleric, peasant \u2013 as long as such a person could have existed in medieval Europe, your imagination is the limit!\nA limited, signed physical version of the painting on canvas will be sent to you by mail.\nPerks\n(Click to enlarge)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with every undertaking, there is a chance of failure. The project is ambitious, the budget is very small, so maybe we are overreaching ourselves and we will not deliver on time.\n\nThen again it is more likely that the project will be completed, and its ambitious character will be a challenge and a constant source of motivation for us. We did not start yesterday \u2013 we already have a lot of assets completed, a working demo and the script for the whole game. We make a good team that always finishes what it starts. It is a matter of honor rather than just ambition. \n\nALEK: I have over a decade of experience working on micro- and zero-budget projects, wearing almost every hat possible. I also created and coordinated commercial projects. Regardless of the scale of the campaign's success (or even lack thereof), I have complete confidence that I know what needs to be done in order to lead TSIOQUE to successful completion.\n\nOHNOO: We know how to use every dollar we receive.

I've been commissioned to write an article on current affairs in the Chimeric Empire. I suppose if some horrific event befalls me, I can use it as fodder for my next poem. Provided I survive...\"\nA House of Many Doors is a 2D exploration RPG coming to PC in July next year. I want to make the kind of game I love to play: a game with narrative depth, compelling characters, and branching, nonlinear storylines.\nIn A House of Many Doors you are an explorer, poet and spy, traversing and mapping the House \u2013 a vast parasite dimension that steals from other worlds.\nYou explore the House in a clanking train with mechanical legs. You will discover bizarre civilizations, assemble a dysfunctional crew and level up your poetry, while clinging to life and sanity.\nI've already spent nine months developing A House of Many Doors, so I have a good idea of how much longer I need to complete it. The bulk of the programming is done, and the blueprints have been drawn. Now I just need time to build a House on that foundation.\nNot convinced? Why not try out the early pre-alpha demo?\nMy influences include Sunless Sea, FTL, Planescape: Torment, the works of China Mieville and H.P. Lovecraft, Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, and that feeling you get when you're very alone in a big dark house.\nThe further you travel, the stranger the things you find.\nIn A House of Many Doors, your main quest is to find an answer to one of three questions. What is the House's purpose? Who built it? And how can you escape?\nBut that's just the main quest, and it's only the beginning. Your irons will be in many fires.\nBandits and other predators will chase you down in the darkness.\nI want you to feel like a particular type of 19th-century polymath - a Richard Francis Burton or a Gertrude Bell. An absurd figure with absurd talents who propels themselves confidently into absurdly terrifying situations. \nIn the game you are both a journalist and a poet, and each of those careers comes with its own challenges to face throughout the game. The poems you write are procedurally-generated, and over time you will build up a proud canon of stirring titles: \"The Troglodyte Vomiting of the Mirrors,\" \"An Elegy on the Reluctant Hell of Grief,\" \"Ode to the Strangling Toad.\" Your poems and travelogues are your route to fame and fortune.\nA procedurally-generated poem.\nAnd of course anyone who travels to distant civilizations is going to be in high demand in the game of whispers. Play the espionage game well enough, and you might change the course of history.\nThe City of Keys. Dominated by an enigmatic Governor and a looming Factory only tenuously connected to reality. Art by Catherine Unger.\n As you explore the House, you will journey through a labyrinth of procedurally-generated architecture. \n It's not all procedural generation, though - your Navigator will guide you towards rooms in which you'll discover carefully-designed areas of interactive narrative. \nThese rooms are packed with quests, stories and lore - by \"lore\" I mean the House's intricate history, ancient secrets and complex politics, much of which will lurk below the surface and only be revealed in hints and half-truths. In these cavernous rooms you might find cities or ruins or ten-mile-high abomination gods made of inexpertly conjoined crows. \nThe adventures you'll have there are accompanied by the wonderful artwork of Catherine Unger. \nIn these rooms you tackle side-quests, gather resources, and plot intrigues before launching yourself once more into the dark.\nAugustus Ribbins: just one of the Pilots you can recruit. Art by Catherine Unger.\nA House of Many Doors focuses heavily on its characters. You recruit a rag-tag bunch of dysfunctional souls to accompany you on your expedition, and each of them has a secret or not-so-secret agenda. You must talk to them, build their morale, and uncover their secrets, if you hope to keep them both loyal and alive.\nThere will be dozens of characters to choose from, each with tons of dialogue and a well-defined arc - which can be abruptly cut short.\nDeath comes easy in the House, and the attachments you have formed with your crew will be at risk every time you fight. A character's storyline won't necessarily end if they're killed in combat, but it will certainly change to reflect their death. And you may well have lost a friend.\nExchanging artillery fire with another train.\nCombat is a real-time-with-pause system which relies on careful management of both your crew's placement in the train and the distance between you and the enemy. \nIt is generally a last resort - even after upgrading your kinetopede with powerful weapons and a thick hull, you should never expect to escape a battle unscathed. \nThe other vehicles you encounter within the House will be as bizarre and varied as the civilizations themselves - biomechanical flesh-wagons, gigantic beetles, the hollowed corpses of gods. That's just the start.\nSo what will I use your money for? What made me choose the \u00a34000 target?\nThe \u00a34000 will go towards a fantastic, atmospheric soundtrack - which is hugely important in a game that involves a lot of exploration - and to fund art by Catherine Unger, who has agreed to draw all the game's illustrations. \nThe rest of the funding for her art will come from my savings - unless this Kickstarter exceeds its target, in which case extra funds will go towards extra artwork!\nYou might wonder, given the above budget, how I\u2019m going to be able to work on this game full-time for the next year. I\u2019m very pleased to announce that Failbetter Games, the indie studio behind Fallen London and Sunless Sea, have agreed to partially fund the creation of my game! Their funding will be enough to pay for all the writing and coding - a.k.a my living costs for 10 months - meaning your money will only be going towards extremely cool art and lovely music!\nHere\u2019s a pie chart:\n (This is why I need an artist.)\nI'm seeding the House with dozens and dozens of hand-designed rooms - gems of narrative carefully scattered through a procedurally-generated world. The game is currently able to generate over 1 million rooms, each of them unique, but the hand-designed rooms risk getting lost if the number available is not limited. So, on release, there will be approximately 40,000 rooms to explore. This limit not only leads to a balanced experience, but also means I have the ability to add more rooms with ease. Unless the game fails this Kickstarter, or is a total commercial failure, I plan to continue to add new rooms and settings to the House as new ideas come to me.  \nThe game you play on release will be a complete game. But new content will constantly be added. New places to discover. New characters. Established content will be deepened. More and more branches will be added to existing storylines.\nFor \u00a35 now, you could have access to a game that will continue growing for years to come. And of course, I'll maintain my dev log all the while!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFunctionally, the game's code is nearly complete, bar some polishing. The only thing missing now is breadth: almost all of the systems are in place. Of course, for an exploration-focused RPG, breadth is extremely important!\n\nI've done enough work on the game, however, to know how long it will take to add the content I've planned. And my July deadline for release is based on a pessimistic estimate - bar some kind of personal disaster, I'm not worried about missing it. \n\nHere are the main risks or problems I can foresee:\n\n1) Feature Creep. If the game is commercially successful, I want to continue to update the game with free content, 'expanding' the House after release. But I mustn't do this during the development process! \u2018Feature creep' is a notorious problem in game development, and if I fall prey to it I might slip behind schedule. The fact that I'm aware of this risk will help to mitigate it - I just need to ensure that I stick to my plans, which are already ambitious enough.\n\n2) Data Loss. Losing data to corruption, burglary, or some other minor disaster has the potential to set the project back a great deal. To mitigate this risk, I\u2019m making regular back-ups online, as well as regular back-ups to a laptop and 4 different external USB devices.\n\n3) Compatibility. I've been testing the game on various different machines, from gaming rigs to laptops, and I've already found several problems only appearing on one machine that I've had to iron out. Towards the end of the development cycle, this could end up eating a lot more of my time than anticipated. To mitigate this risk, I've allotted a very generous period of time for facing this challenge in my schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "At last, an update: Sunless Skies is out now!", "update_content": "Imagine me lifting this Kickstarter from the shelf, blowing off the dust, rubbing away a spot of dirt with my sleeve.

The player finds a dialogue option which very clearly flags a potential romance. Ah, so this character is one of the Romance Options, the player thinks.

Players should know the rules of the game to play it. There is no AI or rules enforcement, but at the same time it has the freedom to play the game your way - exactly as if you were playing at a real table. However, we have done a lot to make each play for you a good experience: \nautomatic game setups, card dealing, drafting etc. \nplayer\u2019s turn control, timers, game phases indication \ninteractive zones on the table with predefined automatic actions \nintelligent counters for tracking victory points and many other in-game parameters \ncustom surfaces, game room wallpapers, sound effects advanced camera controls \u2026 and many other useful features!\nTabletopia is accessible from all perspectives.

Artem and Dmitry are the creators of Playtox and have a lot of experience in the gaming business. Tim is known in Russia for different projects in the digital field (Promo Interactive, Next Media Group), but also actively participates in a board game business (Igrology game studio and Tesera.ru main boardgame portal in Russia).\nBy spring 2014 Artem, Dmitry and Tim created a company named Tabletopia Inc USA and started the development. The team was quickly assembled, and the project has been moving rapidly since. The main development team is located in Novosibirsk, Russia, but there are more people working on the project from Russia, Ukraine, USA and Germany.\nWe have a lot of plans for Tabletopia, and we are constantly strengthening our team. Until now, it has all been financed by the founders directly. And now we need the support from the gaming community to make the project better, and to prepare for the international public launch (December 2015). We have a lot of plans - like advanced game tutorials, PBEM and Hotseat play enhancements, customizable visual effects for game objects and many other features.

The format varies from country to country, but the concept remains the same: you and your team face series of puzzles and challenges, and escape the room within 60 minutes. What we are creating is a whole new level for this industry.\nAbout us\nAfter extensive market research, involving traveling to 5 countries and playing 60 games, we realised that there is a huge room for improvement and innovation, and just like that, Enigma Quests was born. \nThe process of design and creation of puzzles\nWe call our games Live Quests. The general format is very similar to escape games: 60 minutes, small team, challenges. However, in every quest we design, you will have a much bigger objective than just escaping the room.\nThe objectives, as well as the puzzles, are designed to be part of the theme of the quest. We aim to challenge every team to bring out the best of their creativity, quick-thinking and teamwork. Once inside, you may be quite surprised at the hidden talents in yourself and your teammates! \nAre you ready for the challenge?\nThe Quests\nOur first quest is called 'School of Witchcraft and Wizardry', and is designed for every one of you out there, who always wished to have magical abilities. This will be your chance to prove everyone that even if you never received that letter from Hogwarts, there is still a little magic in you.\nA sneak preview from The School\nOur second quest will involve your team carrying out the biggest heist in the modern history. You will have to be very precise and organised. You will encounter the biggest challenge of your life, and will have to make tough choices. In the end, your snatch will depend only on your teamwork and attention to details. \nIn our third quest, you will be leaving the Earth and traveling across galaxies in search of new worlds. The views may be breathtaking, but the challenge is not an easy one. On top of that, there will be more obstacles for you to overcome together as a team and safely navigate the spaceship. \nWhy us?\nThis activity is very new and we wouldn't be surprised if you never heard of these games before. However we aren't the first one to launch in London, let alone in the UK! So what makes us different?\nWe believe that there are three most important aspects to a great immersive experience, be it an escape game or a live quest: quality, immersion and innovation. \nWithout quality, nothing stays for long. We design every puzzle and every prop to be of high quality material, and where we can't source what we want - we create it ourselves. \nOne of the handmade props for The School\nWithout immersion, it would just be another puzzle hunt. We love puzzle hunts, don't get us wrong, but to provide the highest possible value for money, we pay attention to every tiny detail to achieve deep level of immersion, until when the players lose themselves in the surroundings.\nWe design the puzzles with innovation in our minds, and aim to be very high-tech. There are no padlocks in our rooms, no hunt for numerical codes with tiring amount of numbers. Everything feels real and highly interactive. \nRewards\nWe believe that those supporting the businesses at the start should have access to exclusive discounts that are not available anywhere else. \nWe also realise that many would be reluctant to try a new activity that they never heard of. This is why we'd like to offer discounted tickets and a chance to get the full experience at the reduced price for all of you out there, who believe in us and would like to back us. \nThere is a limited number of Super Early Bird tickets providing the biggest value with up to 57% off from the full priced ticket - so grab these while you can!\nThere are also Early Bird Tickets, priced at only \u00a317 per person (down from \u00a330 pp in full priced ticket), including VAT, available for different team sizes.\nThe tickets will not have an expiry date, so you can pledge now and book your game whenever you want!\nBeta Testers\nWe also need the brave ones among you to come and help us with the final testing of our first room. By the time we deliver these rewards, the initial tests will be undertaken, but we want our Quests to be perfect, and we need your help to eliminate any and all mistakes.\nPlease note that we plan to host the Beta Testers before the general bookings start. If nothing goes wrong - lucky you for getting the full experience at this price! If a puzzle malfunctions, or we discover some imperfection in the room - please remember that this is the final testing and something is always bound to go wrong before it's ready. \nThe timetable for test slots will be released once the campaign finishes. Please book a time once you are sure you can make it. In case you can't come on the dates released, you will have an option of transferring the ticket to someone else's name, or being issued a voucher for the amount you pledged to be used in any future bookings, (with no expiry date), so you have nothing to lose!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhile our first room is already under construction, and the biggest costs like deposit and rent are covered, we still find ourselves a bit short of funds for the final push. \nIf we manage to hit our target, we plan to invest part of funds in making the props as we intended them to be while designing the quests. The rest of it will go to marketing and promotion, so if you can't decide your reward at this moment - you can still help us by sharing this campaign with your friends and spreading the word about us!\nMeet the Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest obstacle we have faced so far was securing the premises in the location we wanted at the price we can afford. We are now located in the heart of London between Liverpool Street and Moorgate stations, and are in the premises everyday to ensure construction is going as planned. \n\nIf we manage to hit our target, we are set to launch this September (the exact date to be released over the course of campaign). In case we don't reach our funding goal, we might have difficulties in some prop building and finding beta testers, which in turn will delay the launch date. In this case, we might run this campaign again and hope for a better response, or keep working on the room until we get it right ourselves. \n\nIf any setbacks do arise, we will inform our backers immediately and tackle the new challenges heads on!

Out of all the things we wanted to do, the biggest one was to collaborate! As a multi-billion dollar company, collaboration isn\u2019t easy. Everyone has to get on aboard and approve, not to mention the process is dreadfully long. Well with us indies, we are the IP owners. All you need is couple of people giving the OKs. Well we asked around and few of our fellow developers said YES. Introducing Popup Dungeon, Little Devil Inside, and Duke Grabowski.\nLittle Devil Inside Collaboration\nPopup Dungeon Collaboration\nIn Pirates War \u2013 The Dice King, you are a pirate captain competing with others. Like other \u201cproperty trading board\u201d game, you can buy land, build buildings, upgrade them and in the end the richest person will win each match. However, you don\u2019t have to just \u2018talk with money,\u2019 you can battle with one another and as a captain, you and your crew will have great effect on the battle ground. By setting up strategy and with luck your dice, anyone can become the Dice King.\nOn Islands of the Tiakoke in the Tricita Sea, one Amunnite miner finds a treasure filled with gold coins. In Tiakoke Island it was considered as local news that a miner became the richest man in town but for pirates overseas it was the news of the century. It turns out that the treasure was the looted goods from Captain Morgan. Jake Morgan was the greatest pirate known in history. He was considered the Dice King. He moved to 7 different continents and pillaged all that he could. It is said that its even enough to buy a country. He was famous for targeting only Royal Merchant\u2019s ship and he never stole from the common people.\nThe fact that Tiakoke Islands may be the spot where Captain Morgan hid his trinkets set a fire in the minds of every pirate in the world. And yes, they are all gathering to this land, one by one. Only by finding Captain Morgan\u2019s treasures, will it bring all fame, money, power and the title of next Dice King!\nOn April of 2011, Artist Ddaepil and Designer Gon met for a drink. Like any other day, they talked about usual mundane game topics until a breaking news appear on TV. It was about a Korean ship taken captive by Somalian pirates. In that moment, they wondered what would it be like to create a game about pirates. Obviously they didn\u2019t want to create a game where pirates take hostages and ask for ransom. Rather, they wanted to create a game based on their memories of pirates from childhood. Adventurous story about eccentric, witty and (somewhat) rough pirates. They wanted a world where animals, fish and humans co-exist, where Voodoo and ghosts were real. Most of all, a story, where all pirates with each individual stories gathered in one place for one purpose; to collect captain Morgan\u2019s treasure, hidden somewhere in the Islands of Tiakoke.\nWith that in mind, they began their development by creating characters one at a time. Lightning Beard was the first character they created. Duke was the second one but it was first non-human character. Later came Sowa based on Ddaepil\u2019s son and Ellie based on Gon\u2019s daughter.\nSince then, for a good 4 years, Ddaepil and Gon began designing characters. It was a slow process. They had their regular jobs. They created them one by one whenever they can, hoping that someday their dreams will come to a reality.\nNow shifting from Ddaepil and Gon. We focus on Sean and Donghyun. In 2012, they were developing PC games and the game industry began shifting from PC to Mobile. They watched the industry grow and technology advance. They believed that soon mobile games would be the next multiplayer and PVP arena for the gamers. By the year of 2013, Sean began his own project within his firm to create a multiplayer board game. However in months, due to \u2018internal reasons\u2019 (whatever that means), the project was scrapped. Sean didn\u2019t want to return to PC game development. So he left the company to create his game on his own and Donghyun joined him. On a bright spring morning of 2014 Sean, Donghyun, Ddaepil and Gon had a meeting where they shared their dreams. They realized their paths crossed. In a week, they decided to work together; thus Pirates War was born. Now, one year has passed, what once was a concept (idea) has turned into a game (reality)\n The game is simple. You move by rolling the dice and you can build fortress on your land. When you visit other\u2019s territories you can pay or choose to fight. Win and take their land.\n Landing can be bought and building can be upgraded. If you upgrade the building, the defense upgrades as well. Upgrading the building is important because each time you go around the islands of Tiakoke, you collect tax at the starting point. Upgrade allows to collect higher amounts of tax. REMEMBER LAST MAN WITH THE MOST GOLD WINS THE GAME.\nTax Collecting\nEntrepreneurs speak with money but we pirates speak with POWER as well! Win against your enemies and destroy their fortress. If you got the extra cash, take their land and build your own.\nIn-game Battle\n Some players are more fit for defense while others stronger in offense. Always size up your enemy before choosing to battle.\nNot all islands are there to build fortresses. Some bring you fortune but others like Kraken or the navy can destroy your game play. If a treasure island appears hold off all things and sail like the wind!\nWeather\nWeather greatly affect game play. When you meet a storm, your dice becomes less effective and you can move less. Watch out! When we create a new map the weather conditions will be added.\nStorm is coming\nBGM\nListen to the music and sail the Islands of Tiakoke. Drink up me hearties!\n    Captain Upgrade\n This is not your regular offline board game. One match does not determine everything. Just like your gameplay, your pirate evolves as well. As you evolve the competition will become more fierce. Few wrong moves can lead you to bankruptcy or few right ones can turn the tables around.\nShip Upgrade\n \nEvery captain has its own quest. Each mission you accomplish can reward you, some even give you crew members. Quest will be continuously added, bringing more diverse fun to the game.\n   We didn't choose the road that everyone takes. Instead we chose a road that has not been proven and is considered dangerous/reckless. However, the road that we chose was meticulously researched and thought out. We are working on our first title, board game for both Web/Mobile/PC/MAC, and we are targeting the North America & Europe. Yes, it may seem idiotic that a Korean company is working on its first title for a market that is not their native but we made this decision under democracy because it made sense to do so for everyone. We are Idiocracy.\nWe have been working on this game for quite some time now and we are beginning to see glimpse of its finish line. Never the less, it is still a glimpse. There is so much more that we wish to do; polish our game, add more music scores, voice acting, multi-language support and most of all, just add more content. We want additional systems like clubs or guild, and more characters. If we receive help from you (the community), we will have a \u2018bigger\u2019 game initial release and provide the game at a faster speed.\nAlso, being a small company which is just starting up we don\u2019t have any fan base and it\u2019s very difficult to receive genuine feedback from regular users. Kickstarter has the ability to give a chance to communicate with rich community who wants to get involved with our development and give us feedback.\nMost of us have played some sort of board game at one point in our life. It could be classic card games or property trading games and many experiences were great because you got to play with others and enjoyed the sheer thrill of victory.\nHowever as we get older our lives become much more complicated with obligations and it becomes much more difficult to play simple board games with friends. That is why people have \u2018board game night\u2019 or \u2018card game night.\u2019 On the other hand, technology has come a long way. Not only are we able to communicate with others from a long distance but the number of activities we can enjoy with each other grow everyday. With that in mind we wanted to create games that encompass all the factors mentioned above. We wanted to create a board which everyone can play with anyone they please at any time and any place. It\u2019s an ambitious dream, but it\u2019s a one we want to achieve with Pirates War \u2013 The Dice King.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we face is bringing the games to the multiple platforms. Nothing would make us happier than to release the game on Mobile, Web, PC and Mac on the Day One of official service. However, being a cross platform game that requires multiplayer and online connection makes it very difficult to achieve. At the same time, we still want to roll out to multiple platforms. Therefore, at initial start we might only have 1 or 2 platforms available but we will do our very best to bring our games to those said platforms.\n\nAnother challenge is something that all game developers face; delivering the game on a promised deadline. Our development team has great amounts of experience in developing games in both online and mobile games. However, even with all this experience combined, there is a possibility that problems may occur and we won\u2019t be able to meet our promised delivery date.\n\nHowever, should a case like this happen, we will never let our users catch the news off guard.

First you sit down and build your world, then you destroy it. You tell the story of a hero who tries to save their home. But in Downfall, the hero fails.\nThe game works in any kind of setting, from mythical fantasy to the real world to high-flying science fiction. It's made to tell a whole story in a single 2-4 hour session and doesn't require preparation, dice, or a GM. \nNew to story games? Check out this short documentary. The game they're playing is none other than Downfall.\n\"The magic of Downfall isn't that you build and destroy a world in a few hours \u2014 that\u2019s easy! \u2014 it\u2019s that it creates a place and people you actually care about, even as you lovingly take turns burning it to the ground\u2026\u201d -Ben Robbins, creator of Microscope, Kingdom, and Microscope Explorer\nYou build your setting together, creating a rich physical and cultural landscape to destroy during play. If you enjoy world-building, you'll love making a society in Downfall.\nYou begin by choosing a Flaw\u2014something like greed, complacency, or loyalty\u2014 to serve as the theme of your game. This long-ignored Flaw has finally surfaced to show its teeth. Though the Flaw has always been there, it is just now beginning to destroy everything it created.\nThen you create a detailed set of traditions, practices, and beliefs that your society holds dear. These are the pieces you will break throughout play.\n\"Downfall's unique approach to world creation sets players up with a rich web of referents and cultural artifacts at their fingertips. For relatively little effort at the outset, the crumbling society jumps into vivid focus.\" - Jackson Tegu, creator of How We Are Like The Storm\n\"Downfall is, hands-down, the best game I\u2019ve seen at giving you structured, step-by-step tools to build a culture that doesn\u2019t feel like an off-the-peg genre exercise, is fleshed-out enough to be navigable and intriguing, yet doesn\u2019t take the entire game to set up. It produces worlds that are genuinely unexpected, without requiring any vast leaps of creative brilliance.\"Sam Kabo Ashwell of These Heterogenous Tasks\nWe role-play to explore the collapse of the world, witnessing and shaping the destruction of our home through our characters.\nDownfall features phrase-based escalation in the style of games like Archipelago and Polaris, and one of my favorite things about the game is how smooth it is to go from narrating an intimate scene to executing bold actions and sweeping changes.\nPlay continues until the characters' home has met its downfall. Sometimes when the game ends you mourn the destruction of the world, but more often it's bittersweet\u2014you see how broken the world was and feel that it was better for it to have burned. Sure, it was awful for the characters, but it made a great story. \n\"I had no idea the story would get so creative and complex! It was extremely collaborative and we built on each others\u2019 ideas.\" - Kelly Michelle Baker, author of The Waters of Nyra\n\"Downfall's key phrases are awesome. With just a few words, you can unlock the innermost feelings of a character, add a hefty price tag to the Hero's brash action, or find out what comes of any move another character makes. They're tools that allow players of any skill-level to make the most of the game.\" - Marc Hobbs, creator of Eden\nI'm really interested in games that focus on a single cohesive story, and Downfall does a great job of delivering that by letting each person take turns playing the hero.\nThe game features a cast of three main characters, which are created collaboratively, and each character contributes something different to the game. The Hero is the protagonist, trying to save the world. The Fallen is the  antagonist, trying to corrupt the Hero and the world. And finally the Pillar is an average person, trying to stifle change.\nThe characters rotate. After playing two scenes you pass your character sheet to the player on your left. You were just the Hero a moment ago, but now you get to play the Fallen. \nCharacter rotation means you interact with all of the characters from different perspectives as you shift who you are playing throughout the game. It also focuses play on a single story\u2014the story of the Hero's failure.\n\"Downfall games were my most memorable play experiences of 2015. Sharing characters means the story trumps everything. It is *the* game to play if you have just three players.\" - Jamie Fristrom, creator of Energy Hook\nDownfall has been played at Story Games Seattle, Story Games Olympia, GoPlayNW, in countless cafes from Seattle to South Korea (and who even knows where else), and with people of all experience levels, from those who've never played story games to story game veterans. It works, and I know it works because of the numerous hours that have been put into play-testing it with a wide variety of people over two and a half years.\nI've got some crazy skilled editors on hand and a brain-trust of indie game developers to give me good advice, and I myself am a veteran story gamer (I've played a really wide variety of indie-RPG systems\u201477 by my current count! Wow!). I've made Downfall the kind of game that I love to play over and over again. \nWant to see the game in action? Check out this condensed example of play!\nDesigner/artist/architecture intern Audrey Gibson is doing the art and it looks awesome. The art is all about looking back at collapsed societies and seeing the ghosts of their buildings. She studied images of historical ruins and recreated them to be something a little more fantastic. I wanted someone with an eye for architectural design, and Audrey was the perfect choice.\nVideo Music: There's Probably No Time (Chris Zabriskie) / CC BY 4.0\nDownfall is a genre-neutral game, you can play it in any setting that you dream up.

We\u2019re out to shatter that illusion. \nCreative Commons (\"CC\") is a nonprofit dedicated to Open. CC licenses are free copyright licenses creators apply to their own works, enabling the public to reuse the work under certain conditions. Sometimes CC licensing is core to a business strategy, and sometimes it is simply a way to increase the number of eyeballs on a work. In all cases, CC brings an element of social good to the table. \nWe want to show the world the full spectrum of open business models made using Creative Commons. Our goal is to begin to answer what we consider one of the most important questions of the digital age: how do creators make money to sustain what they do when they are letting the world reuse their work? \nWe are starting this work by trying out our own open business model here on Kickstarter. We want you to both support us, and help steer this project. Ready? Read on...\n[main photo credit: \"Creative Beauty at Creative Commons\" by Kristina Alexanderson, used with permission but available on Flickr under BY-NC-ND 2.0.]\nHere's the plan: \nWith your help, we are going to identify and select a diverse group of two dozen businesses, creators, and organizations from around the world succeeding with business models made with Creative Commons. Then we're going to dig deep into how they work to show how using Creative Commons can produce economic and social value. \nOur goal is not to identify a formula for business models that utilize CC, but instead to gather fresh ideas and dynamic examples that will help spark new, innovative models that build on what is already working. \nWe want to spread this knowledge far and wide to inspire others to use what works for them. At the end of the process, we'll publish an ebook that puts together everything we learn and create an interactive online tool to help others build their own CC-made business models.\nNote: Creative Commons is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Your contribution is tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law. CC will issue tax receipts for all donations exceeding $250. \nWorking in the open\nThe book will be the culmination of a year-long learning/writing/listening/creating process. We'll be working entirely in the open, using Medium as our virtual sandbox.\nHere we'll share little nuggets of wisdom we pick up, our half-baked ideas, and whatever else is in our heads as we explore this work. Throughout the process, we will publish 6 polished, in-depth articles on Medium that consolidate what we\u2019re learning.\nThe point of all this is to work collaboratively with you. We definitely need your financial support, but we also want to borrow your brains. We don\u2019t want to create this book alone. We need insights, contributions, and ideas from you - our community.\nPut another way, this Kickstarter is itself a business model made with CC (how meta!). By using crowdfunding to engage a community, sharing by default as we go, and collaboratively building the final product, we\u2019ll be doing our own experiment with an open business model.\nVisual depiction of our business model for this Kickstarter\nWith the proceeds from this Kickstarter, CC will: \nCreate in-depth profiles of 24 successful CC business/revenue models based on your votes; \nVisually depict each business model and extract at least 3 high-level lessons for each one; \nDistill common strategies and patterns in the various business models and publish 6 long-form articles on Medium;\nCreate a lightweight interactive online tool that helps people design open business models; \nPublish an ebook (licensed CC BY-SA) that combines all of the profiles, analysis, and recommendations from this project.\nTimeline \nVote tally and results for business profile winners will be announced on September 1, 2015.\nIn-depth Medium articles will be released on the following schedule (shorter Medium posts to be published almost daily):\nSeptember 15, 2015\nOctober 15, 2015\nDecember 15, 2015\nFebruary 15, 2016\nMarch 15, 2016\nApril 15, 2016\nEbook and interactive online tool published by July 15, 2016.\n[Early drafts of articles will be distributed to backers for input to Kickstarter Co-Creators 10 days before publication.]\nHow you can get involved\nNominate! Anyone can nominate businesses, organizations, and creators you would like to see in the book. \nVote! Kickstarter backers can vote for who they would like to see profiled in the book.\nShare! All of you (financial supporters, or not) are invited to produce your own open business models using our tool available as a Google doc. You can post and share your models on our Google+ community to give and receive feedback from others in the community. We really want your input as we go, so follow along with us on Medium, and tell us what you think. \nCo-Create! Kickstarter backers can become co-editors of the project with us! We\u2019ll share early drafts, get your feedback, and work with you to shape the content we produce. \nReuse & Remix!

As an educator and serial startup specialist, Paul thrives at making visible the possible and bringing new possibilities to life.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo mitigate risks associated with editing, laying out and producing an ebook, Creative Commons plans to use a combination of do-it-yourself tools with do-it-for-you services from ebook service providers. \n\nBy using votes from backers to determine who we profile in the book, we hope to learn about new creators and businesses using CC in innovative ways. This process also creates some risk, however. To help avoid any possibility of being trolled or of having the book include only creators of one type, we'll publish parameters during the campaign. Note that backers only get one set of votes regardless of how many rewards they purchase. \n\nUltimately, the ebook will only be as good as the level of engagement by you, our co-creators. We plan to write it using a community-driven process, which means gathering ideas and contributions from all of you, collaboratively editing drafts, and thinking of the entire project as a work-in-progress. CC has plenty of experience with this; our legal tools are created in exactly this same way. But to do this well, we need your help.\n\nWe also want to ensure that this project produces something more than narrative success stories. Our goal is to create something that will be useful to others who are in the process of creating something or want to make whatever they do more open.

Reaching further goals will allow us to build more sets, more puppets and more models in order to produce the other two adventures. Obviously, these adventures were orginally produced for the audio medium only. However, we shall be adapting and embellishing these stories to create exciting new episodes for film. So yes, there will be explosions!\nWHAT ARE THE MINI-ALBUMS?\nThe mini-albums were one of the ways you could enjoy old and new adventures with International Rescue in the days before home video. Whilst many of the albums are narrated soundtracks from television episodes, three special stories were produced exclusively for audio.\nFAB - THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN\nWhen reports come in from the Himalayas of kidnappings carried out by the Abominable Snowman, International Rescue sends Lady Penelope to investigate. She soon reveals the dark truth and finds herself a prisoner of The Hood who will stop at nothing to get the secrets of the Thunderbird machines. Can International Rescue save Penelope in time?\nINTRODUCING THUNDERBIRDS\nThe prequel! In this story set before the first episode of the television series, Lady Penelope and Parker head to Tracy Island in order to discover more about International Rescue. There, they witness the Thunderbird craft in action for the first time. This is unashamedly a celebration of Thunderbirds' best technology!\nLADY PENELOPE INVESTIGATES... THE STATELY HOME ROBBERIES\nStately homes across England are being targetted for their precious jewel collections. The villains will stop at nothing to complete their task. Their next victim? Lady Penelope. Can she and Parker thwart their diabolical plan?\nREWARDS\nPledging money to this Kickstarter is the only way you can access our rewards and guarantee yourself a copy of our completed Classic Thunderbirds production and photo magazine. These limited edition packages will not be made available in shops or online stores.\n\nMULTIPLE REWARDS \u2013 If you would like to pledge for a number of rewards, or for multiples of the same reward, simply manually input your total pledge amount and drop us a message so that we can make a note of what you would like. Get in touch if you have any questions!\nIn addition to being offered the chance to purchase exclusive discs of the finished production (available region free on DVD and BLU-RAY and in both NTSC and PAL for DVD), we are also offering Kickstarter backers several exciting opportunities including:\nA 48 page, retro-style magazine crammed with rare and previously unpublished stills from the original 1965 series of Thunderbirds.\nTickets to our invitation-only celebrity premiere.\nProps and costumes from the production.\nA once in a lifetime opportunity to visit a working Supermarionation film set.\nAlthough any production can encounter slight setbacks, we hope to fulfil all rewards by Christmas this year. With a screening date already set, we'll be working hard to ensure that you'll have your rewards during Thunderbirds' 50th anniversary year.\nNOTE: Further reward levels will be unlocked once we reach our target and continue on to stretch goals!\nIf you have any questions about the rewards, additions, or changes, then please message us during the campaign.

Stephen has worked as a director, producer and writer for twelve years. Apart from leading the overall project, Stephen will also direct the first episode.\nANDREW T. SMITH - Associate Producer, Script Editor\nAlso a writer and filmmaker, Andrew was the associate producer, co-writer and co-editor of Filmed in Supermarionation. His current film, Cartoon Carnival \u2013 which he is producing and directing \u2013 unearths the early pre-sound history of animation.\nJUSTIN T. LEE - Post-production, Graphic Designer, Puppeteer\nJustin has worked in post-production as a visual effects artist and animator for many of the world's leading brands. A lifelong Thunderbirds fan, Justin left behind advertising to come and join us on Filmed in Supermarionation where he undertook no end of roles, including designing all the beautiful artwork that accompanied the film.\nDAVID ELLIOTT - Supervisor, Director\nDavid Elliott, who was a director on the original Thunderbirds, will be part of our crew! He will work in an advisory position, helping us to ensure authenticity PLUS, if we reach our stretch goals, he will be directing an episode for us \u2013 his first episode of Thunderbirds in 49 years!\nANDY ROLFE - Set Design and Construction\nAndy worked with Gerry Anderson on several projects and also worked on Filmed in Supermarionation, where he was responsible for some incredible recreations of the original Supermarionation sets. He other work includes beautifully detailed 1/3 scale props and sets for films like Wolfman, Casino Royale, and Skyfall.\nDAVID HICKS - Director of Photography\nFilming anything in 'Supermarionation' is a tricky art. Because everything is in miniature, everything has to be filmed in a very precise way to give it the necessary sense of scale. David was the Director of Photography on the puppet sequences for Filmed in Supermarionation and will be bringing his expertise to us again for this project. He will also be working on the next generation of Gerry Anderson shows, Firestorm.\nBARRY DAVIES and CHRIS KING - Puppet Construction\nBarry Davies is a master at producing studio-standard Supermarionation puppets. He learnt directly from Thunderbirds' Chief Puppeteer Christine Glanville, and his services were engaged many times by Gerry Anderson. Aside from building the puppets, Barry will also be creating and installing the mechanisms in the head. No radio control here - we'll be using 60s methods! The accuracy of Barry's engineering and artistry will add to the authentic feel of this episode.\nChris King is also an expert at producing Supermarionation puppets. Aside from his own creations which are indistinguishable from the original screen-used puppets, he is a master at restoring Supermarionettes that have survived from the 60s. Chris will also be creating characters for us - most notably The Hood. The original puppet is missing in action, but thanks to Chris we now have a beautiful sculpt indistinguishable from the original.\nMAMAS PITSILLIS - Model Construction\nMamas is an expert model builder and well-known to Anderson fans for his incredible recreations of the original studio miniatures. Mamas will be working to ensure that the models of the Thunderbirds craft we use will be as accurate as possible.\nJAMES FIELDING - Unit Photographer\nOur journey will be documented for Kickstarter backers by photographer James Fielding who also worked on Filmed in Supermarionation. James will be capturing much needed publicity shots to help make this a celebration to remember.\nAND...?\nMORE NAMES TO BE REVEALED DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN! THEY'LL BE WORTH WAITING FOR...\nPraise for 'Filmed in Supermarionation'\nWhat is Supermarionation?\n'Supermarionation' \u2013 a portmanteau combining the words 'Super', 'Marionette' and 'Animation' \u2013 was coined by Gerry Anderson in 1960 to describe his sophisticated puppets. Whilst other television marionette heroes were constructed of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, Supermarionation involved the use of characters with beautifully sculpted fibreglass heads (with multiple heads featuring different expressions to fit the mood). Most significantly of all though, these puppets could talk in time with the dialogue via a system that converted individual syllables into electrical impulses that allowed the characters' mouths to open and close.\nThe special effects unit were pioneers in their field. They developed their art of shooting effects entirely with miniatures until their efforts were the best seen on television and film. Many of the team \u2013 including Academy Award winners Derek Meddings and Brian Johnson \u2013 went on to produce the visual effects for motion pictures such as Superman, Alien, Star Wars and James Bond.\nWe will be embracing these classic techniques. For Thunderbirds 1965 we will have:\nReal puppets\nReal models\nReal sets\nAnd, of course, REAL EXPLOSIONS\nOh - and the proper tungsten wire they used in the 60s, just in case you thought we were going to use nylon as in the video!\nEvery element of the production will be undertaken by professionals who are experts on how the original show was made.\n

To do this, I have adjust my shipping discounts from previous projects. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 and/or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.   \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes. \nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a cooperative Tower Defense game Tiny Epic Defenders and a intergalactic dice driven/engine building game Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began January of 2013 on Kickstarter with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has sold a collective total of over 20,000 copies.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Kingdoms\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Defenders\nTiny Epic Galaxies, the third installment in the series. \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Galaxies Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nGamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future!

There are no separate Add-Ons during the project.  \nIf you'd like to add additional copies, or other menu items, to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you may do so within PledgeManager. \nDo not add to your KS pledge for add-ons, you will pay for them in PledgeManager.\nCheck out our exciting PledgeManager menu below:\nPledgeManager is a post-project service used to collect backer's shipping data and to provide additional product options.

It is prone to many opportunities for mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects from Kickstarter.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer we have used to create Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures, the GIANT Meeples, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders, and Tiny Epic Galaxies. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition will be our next!\n\n3. Professional fulfillment is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders and, the soon to be shipped, Tiny Epic Galaxies. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process, as to involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nI will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! Lets bring Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition to the gaming world!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS PROJECTS' STATUS: \nTiny Epic Galaxies is currently in production and within 1 month of its estimated delivery date.\n\nTiny Epic Defenders, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Fantasy Frontier, Dungeon Heroes, the Fantasy Gaming Figures and the Mini GIANT Meeple Project have all completed fulfillment successfully.

I'm very impressed. Hands down the best project I've backed on kickstarter.\"\nKS backer Robert H says \"Hey just got my game... Looks awesome, will break it out tonight! I have to say this is one of the most well run Kickstarters I've participated in.\"\nNow we're launching a new expansion! The Emma Expansion uses the characters and events of Jane Austen's novel \"Emma\" and puts them into a game of Marrying Mr. Darcy. \nMarrying Mr. Darcy is a strategy card game where players are one of the female characters from Jane Austen\u2019s novel Pride and Prejudice. Players work to earn points and attract the attention of available suitors. Our heroines do this by attending events and improving their characters, but advantage can be gained by the use of cunning. All of their efforts are in hopes of marrying well and becoming the most satisfied character at the end of the game!\nThe Emma Expansion includes 6 new Heroine Cards, 5 new suitor cards, and 60 new event cards all inspired by Jane Austen's \"Emma.\" Just replace your Marrying Mr. Darcy Heroine, Suitor, and Event cards with the new Emma Expansion and you are all set to play! You'll enjoy new Emma-appropriate activities such as Blunders, Interference, Gossip, and Revelations. Additionally, each new playable Heroine features a new \"lady power\" for variation in gameplay every time!\nWHAT IS INCLUDED\nThe Emma Expansion includes: 78 Cards (60 Events, 6 Heroines, 5 Suitors, 1 rules card, 6 player guides), 1 tuck box.* \n*Please note that you will need the base game of Marrying Mr. Darcy: the Pride and Prejudice Card Game in order to play the Emma Expansion. The base game is NOT included in some reward tiers. \nThe new playable Heroines are Emma Woodhouse, Jane Fairfax, Harriet Smith, Augusta Hawkins, Miss Bates, and Anne Taylor. The new Suitors are Mr. Knightley, Mr. Elton, Frank Churchill, Robert Martin, and Mr. Weston.\nLEARN TO PLAY\nYou can get a brief overview of the rules and how to play Marrying Mr. Darcy by this video, or by reading the full rules here. The Emma Expansion will simply have new Heroines, Suitors, and Event Deck!\n STRETCH GOALS!\n$10,000 The minimum amount needed to launch the Emma Expansion. WE DID IT!\n$12,500 We will solidify our \"Mash-up\" rules for mashing up Emma and Marrying Mr. Darcy cards and publish them online. Want Emma to marry Mr. Bingley? Now she can! See FAQ for details! WE DID IT!\n$15,000 We will include 3 cards in every Emma Expansion that will make it playable with the Undead Expansion. Because zombies. WE DID IT!\n$20,000 We will design a new expansion based on another Austen novel in 2016. WE DID IT!\n$25,000 We will make the new 2016 expansion (from the $20,000 stretch goal) Beta test version available to all Emma expansion backers as a free PDF Print & Play. WE DID IT! THANKS EVERYONE!\nREVIEWS\nStill not sure this is for you? Check out our reviews here!\nFAQ\nDoes the $15 reward come with a hard copy of the expansion? YES! If you pledge the $15 tier, you'll get a hard copy (printed cards in a nice tuck box) shipped to you in January! In addition, you'll also get a PDF version emailed to you in August. \nI want to add another copy of the expansion to my order. Can I do that? Yes, you may add ONE additional copy of the Emma Expansion to the $15 reward tier or higher. To do this, add $12 US or $16 international to your total. You must also indicate you've done this on your survey when the campaign ends.\nI want to add another copy of Marrying Mr. Darcy to my order. Can I do that? Unfortunately, no. That will make our shipping and pricing a lot more complicated, and we also have a certain number of games allocated for this Kickstarter. US customers can buy another copy from Amazon, and international customers should check out this blog. I'm sorry we can not accommodate that!\nCan't I just buy the base game now? Why is that included in some rewards? Yes, you can purchase the base game now by visiting here. However, selecting that reward tier will help us fund our new expansion. Additionally, while Marrying Mr. Darcy is widely available, there are some non-US locations where it is difficult to acquire. If you do choose the $45 reward tier, please note that everything will be shipped to you once the expansion arrives from the printer (estimated January 2016). \nHow far along are you in making this? The game design is complete, and we are about 95% complete with the art and graphic design. We will be completing the final proofreading during the campaign, and should be sending the files to our printer no later than mid-August. \nWhat's up with the $75 \"Your Own Event Card\" reward tier? You can create your own Event card for use in Marrying Mr. Darcy or the Emma Expansion. You can select a vintage graphic used on any of our Event cards and write your own personalized text! Want to gossip with Mrs. Your Name, or perhaps Sir Your Name invites you over for cards? Need to propose to your significant other? We will work with you to create a special and functional Event card.  We will ship you 5 printed copies of your Custom Event card. These cards will be printed at a different printer that can do small print runs, but we have found these cards match the game cards very closely. We will guarantee your Custom cards will arrive in time for Christmas 2015! If you also order a copy of Marrying Mr. Darcy, we can also guarantee that by Christmas. However, the Emma Expansion will be shipped separately (estimated Jan 2016). These custom cards will always be an exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nWhat's the deal with the $200 \"Your Own Hero/ine Card\" reward tier? Game artist Erik Evensen will draw your likeness as a Heroine, Suitor, or the Old Maid (your choice). You can select your lady powers or suitor preferences, customize text on the card, and use it to play either Marrying Mr. Darcy OR the Emma Expansion. You can see some examples of custom cards here. We will ship you 5 printed copies of your Custom card. These cards will be printed at a different printer that can do small print runs, but we have found these cards match the game cards very closely. We will guarantee your Custom cards will arrive in time for Christmas 2015! If you also order a copy of Marrying Mr. Darcy, we can also guarantee that by Christmas. However, the Emma Expansion will be shipped separately (estimated Jan 2016). These custom cards will always be an exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nHey, can I play a mashup of the Emma Expansion and Marrying Mr. Darcy? I want Harriet Smith to marry Mr. Bingley! Our first stretch goal is to solidify our \"mashup\" rules and publish them online. This will involve a description of how to set up a mashup game, as well as new marriage points assigned to characters from separate books. It should be noted that these games were really designed to be played as separate entities, encapsulating the feel of each individual book. However, if you are the adventurous type and agreeable to working through unexpected scenarios in a ladylike manner, you should have a fun time making all your head canon dreams come true. \nWill I eventually be able to buy this expansion in my friendly local game store? If we meet our funding goal, we will release the new expansion for distribution and sale online and in stores through our distributor after our kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled. By ordering the game on kickstarter, you help us fund the print run and will be one of the first to own the Emma Expansion.\nI'm a non-US backer and I have a question about shipping costs or VAT. I am using a US based company, Game Salute, to do fulfillment of this campaign. I have made a good faith effort to estimate weight of the game and packaging and charge the correct amount to backers for shipping. I understand shipping to non-US countries is expensive. Additionally, non-US backers MAY need to pay VAT when their package arrives depending on the laws of the country you are in. If you feel the shipping or potentially paying VAT is outside what you would like to contribute, we understand. I would encourage you to read this blog on buying Marrying Mr. Darcy outside the US for links to stores that carry the game and will potentially carry the new Emma expansion in the future. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPossible risks for the project include printing, production or shipping delays. This is a self-published indie game and I am not relying on a company to manage the project. I will have no direct control over the print run, delivery of games to the warehouse or reward fulfillment, which will be completed by third parties. As you can see, the game design, art, and file preparation are nearly complete so there should not be any significant delays related to game design. \nAdditionally, we are working with trusted game printer AdMagic who has many years of experience and has successfully completed and delivered three fantastic looking print runs of Marrying Mr. Darcy to the Game Salute warehouse. Game Salute will be shipping kickstarter rewards to backers, and they have fulfilled many successful campaigns in the past. I have made a good faith effort to calculate all costs accurately and estimate a reasonable timeline. \n\nI will make sure the files get to the printer, all the bills are paid, and follow up with AdMagic and Game Salute as necessary. We've worked together for the past 2 years getting Marrying Mr. Darcy into stores and so far so good!

Why? Because often they do not fit into the very narrow and uniform editorial policies of global media brands.\nCurrently a great swathe of the world intuitively understands that we are not seeing the full picture.\nThis is the role of Renegade Inc. to articulate what's really going on. Then give independent context, narrative and alternatives that you won\u2019t get anywhere else.\nToday the world is changing faster and more fundamentally than ever before. So now we need the opinions and ideas of many different thinkers, artists, economists and businesspeople who we feel should get more airtime. In fact, at a time when the world needs sensible alternatives, their opinions are vital.\nRenegade Inc. was founded by Ross and Megan Ashcroft.\nIn 2005 we began to realise that there was something profoundly wrong with the global economy. We didn\u2019t feel that it was an option to do nothing. We felt compelled to act so in 2007 we launched Renegade Economist.\nWe wanted to rethink ways of doing things. We read everything we could on banking, the economy and economics. We also watched conspiracy films and a slew of mainstream films that said everything yet left us unsatisfied. We thought we could make a contribution.\nOur first project was the award winning independent feature documentary \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d - released in 2012.\nWatch the full movie for free here\nThe film has been an international success. It\u2019s now been seen by many millions of people in cinemas and broadcast stations worldwide. It has over three million views on YouTube and has enjoyed more than three hundred Q and A sessions in seventeen countries.\nWe continue to receive weekly messages explaining how much the film has resonated, and asking \u201cWhat is next?\u201d\nThe answer is Renegade Inc.\nInitially the new media platform of Renegade Inc. will focus on three sectors:  \nEntrepreneurship or new business \u2013 which includes our already established commentary on the financial sector\nSelf-Learning \u2013 which we believe is a more accurate description of the education of the future\nThe Arts - recognizing that creativity is the driving force behind improving anything.\nWhen we toured Four Horsemen around Europe, we met Renegade Inc.\u2019s audience and noticed that they were a multi-generational mind-set - not an easily defined demographic. We called them \u201cCohort C\u201d as they wanted community, causes and to co-create. We couldn\u2019t help but notice that that Cohort C is a powerful new force in global citizenship who feel that mainstream media isn\u2019t fulfilling all their needs. \nWe feel that now is the time for an independent media platform that works in partnership with its audience. As this is better suited to our interconnected age than agenda-driven media that permanently transmits but rarely listens.\nAt Renegade Inc. we consider our audience our partners and encourage them to shape the content we make.\nWe do this by simply listening to our partners and creating the content they would like to see. Our partners will shape our content with suggestion of stories and editorial feedback.\nIDFA 2011\nEach week we will bring you a film and radio interview with array of guests (many of which our partners will have requested).\nWe will also begin work on a short documentary in partnership with Steve Keen and other leading world economists. This will highlight where next for the global economy so you can navigate the age of volatility.\nSome of our previous work with Professor Steve Keen\nWe will also begin to make a documentary on how the education system in the western world is faltering. To do this we will partner with our colleagues at Independent Thinking. This will allow us to offer solutions to navigating a system that values testing over student development.\nThe word has sometimes had mixed connotations.\nWe define a \u2018Renegade\u2019 as someone who - through their actions \u2013 peacefully and positively disrupts how people think and act. Not referenced by gender or background these people inhabit all walks of life and the their mind-set has quietly created a latent social revolution of enormous consequence.\nRenegade etymology is to switch allegiance from one system or set of values to another that better fits your worldview, life or values.\nWhilst making Four Horsemen our aim was to take seemingly complex ideas then simplify and share them. .\nOur next step is to create an international platform that does the same thing across a range of independent content.\nThis is the foundation of Renegade Inc. We aim to bring to the surface the \u2018hard to get at stories\u2019 which do not get airtime.\nWe also want to bring context from some of the most respected sources from around the world \u2013 as we have done with the financial sector.\nRenegade Inc. aims to leave its members better informed, more illuminated or inspired.\nTo date all Renegade Inc.\u2019s work has been funded from our own resources. That is how we have maintained independence.\nThis year we have already launched the new Renegade Inc. website in beta and posted all the work to date from the last years.\nIn all, there are over two hundred and fifty pieces of media content. All our Renegade channels have been consolidated under Renegade Inc.\nBut quality content is not inexpensive. We have now reached a point where we need proper funding for Renegade Inc. which will allow us to broaden our platform for those who think differently. We also need funding so Renegade Inc. can continue independently. We do not want to have go 'upstairs' for \u2018sign off\u2019.\nWe have the ideas, knowledge, experience, business management skills, contacts and excellent access. Now we need extra financial resources to unlock the potential.\nWe are asking for US$45,000 to build out the media platform and produce regular content.\nThis money will also pay for further development of our online presence, underlying technology including app development and partner platform, editorial staff salaries, rent and studio costs for the first six months.\nWe want to bring together the best talent and combine an audience who can partner with us to produce great work.\nRenegade Inc. will continue its recent accelerated production of new material on a weekly basis. We will add to the existing commentary - with regular interviews giving context and analysis. It will also produce content on topics that have received scant coverage but impacts our lives.\nIn 2016 we will examine further funding sources including launching a subscription funding model. We need our partners to support our correspondents so they can report on the \u2018hard to get at stories\u2019 that matter.\nHere are some of the perks you can get if you contribute to our Kickstarter.\nBrief Inc. Podcast, Field Notes, Buttons, and Polo\nSo Renegade Inc. has now arrived. It is a new independent media platform aimed at people who think differently. It is international. Its mission is simple: Create and broadcast content that informs, illuminates and inspires.  \nWe already have a track record of doing this. Broadening this in 2015, is particularly important when so much of the world we live in is in a state of flux. Our reaction to uncertainty must combine context and perspective. This is best done in partnership with you.\n We hope you will support this platform, in whatever way you can.

So partners can support us and influence our output. We will also look into working with sponsorship and advertising partners that fit our ethos.\n\nWith Editorial Suggestions we'll endeavor to follow through on your suggestions, but cannot guarantee that every person suggested will be available or able to take part in an interview.\n\nAnd of course in any production process it is common to encounter setbacks.

It's planned to be released for Windows and Mac via Steam. We've already got the all-clear from Steam to distribute with them. Yes, there will be controller support! This Kickstarter's goal is to fund the initial release entirely. Due to the amount of content and lore we want to show in the game, we have two expansions planned. But worry not! Backers that contribute $10 or more will receive all planned expansions free of additional charge!\nExploration and combat in Diluvion take place in fully 3D open-world zones.\n The world of Diluvion is an unforgiving place. Forced into the ocean by the Great Flood and now trapped under an impenetrable layer of ice, humanity hangs by a tenuous thread. By a twist of fate, you, an aspiring submarine captain, have been given the honor of commanding your first sub. With a brave crew at your command, you now venture into the unknown.\nA 2D cutaway view reveals the interior, where you can meet characters and manage your crew.\nDiluvion contains a mix of 2D and 3D elements. While exploring in your sub, you'll view the open world around you in 3D. When visiting towns and interacting with your crew, a cross-section view reveals intricately painted 2D interiors.\nThe cross-section view showing the interior of Dweller Colony 92.\nAs the captain of your sub, you have access to an array of weapons in addition to sonar and salvaging abilities. Sonar is essential for getting information about the world around you. However, it can be a deadly game of cat and mouse. By sending out a sonar ping, you also alert hostile subs in the area to your presence.\nSonar in action\nCombat in Diluvion is derived from the classic space trading and combat simulation genre. We drew inspiration from games like Wing Commander and Freelancer. The combat is fully 3D, and your sub has multiple weapon rooms which can lock on to enemies. There's a full arsenal of underwater weapons to master as well; bolts, torpedoes, mines, and railguns, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. \nThe swift Huron sub has a torpedo lock on two enemies.\n In the video below, Jacob talks about combat basics as he plays the pre-alpha build!  (Sorry about the missing thumbnail, youtube be trippin'.)\nWhile designing the subs, we put a lot of thought into what's inside. There's a great emphasis on the interior of your sub and the crew that operates it. Different Gunners will give unique firing bonuses, Helmsmen can increase the effectiveness of your ship with advanced maneuvers, and a good Sonar Tech can give you the edge in a long-range torpedo battle. Additionally, your crew can often function semi-autonomously. For example, your gunners can be told to engage previously designated targets while you're busy dodging a torpedo! \nThe more crew you have in a station, the more operational bonuses it will have!\nAs you progress through the game, you will naturally find yourself in larger submarines, and to operate them you'll need a bigger crew. There will be also be new job classes you'll discover as you advance.  In the video below, Jacob shows the crew mechanics and narrates the details.\nThe denizens of the flooded world generally fall into one of three factions: The Icers, the Royals, and the Dwellers. They each have their own culture and technology, but the biggest defining factor is their geography.\nThe Icers tend to live in colonies drilled into the ice or anchored near it. They have exceptional advanced technology and hope to one day finally drill all the way through the ice. The Royals live in great domed Old World cities on what used to be the surface. They see themselves as the rulers of the flooded world, and their Houses control immense military power. The Dwellers live in the darkest depths of the oceans. They survive by fishing and mining, and are the most superstitious inhabitants of Diluvion. In the murky darkness of the sea floor, they turn to their religion for guidance, worshiping the strange sea creatures around them.\nWe started on Diluvion as soon as we finished Ballpoint Universe in early 2014. We spent a lot of time developing the lore and technology that would exist in our sunken world. A good portion of 2014 was spent developing the visual style, and learning how to apply that to assets across the board.\nOnce the art style had been developed to a point we were happy with, we began developing a pipeline that would work well for our small team.\nIn early 2015, we completed our vertical slice which contains a majority of the key core gameplay elements including combat, docking, looting, crews, dialogue, and inventory.\nWe're working with Razer to create the highest quality in-game audio for Diluvion.\nWe are a proven team of developers who have shipped games to many platforms including Steam, Desura, Wii U, iOS, and Android. We were awarded the Indie DB 2013 Visuality award for Ballpoint Universe. Our team has a combined total of 19 years of game development experience, 12 years of programming experience, and 13 years of Unity game engine experience.\nLeo Dasso is guy from North Carolina who's been designing games since he was 16, and drawing since age 3.

It packs all the amazing game play and beautiful art of a trading card game in one little box at an unbelievably low price.\nEpic Card Game is funded! Thank you so much for your support. We'll be adding various stretch goals as we hit different funding levels, making this already awesome game an even more incredible value!\n  You don't have to add any additional shipping for the playmat, but be sure you include shipping in your order. If you pledge over the base $20 for the gamer set tier, you must manually add shipping. Shipping is $6 in the US, $10 to Canada, $12 to the EU, and $15 to the rest of the world. So, for example, if a US backer were ordering two gamer set tiers and two playmats he should pledge $20+$20+$25+$25+$6 = $96.\nWe designed Epic to provide great draft and sealed deck play right out of the box. If you are a trading card game veteran, you know what this means, and yes, it is every bit as awesome as you think it would be.\nIf you haven't played trading card games before, you are in for a real treat. Sealed and draft are incredibly fun! Unfortunately, with trading card games, they are also incredibly expensive (like $10-$30 every time you play). \nBut with Epic, you get the fun without that scary price tag. A single $15 box of Epic allows up to four people to play draft or sealed again and again with great game play every single time.\nJust that would be an unbelievable amount of game for the money, but there are more ways to play. By simply dividing up the cards by the four colors (yellow, red, green and blue) you will have four preconstructed decks, each balanced for play against the others.\nWith sealed, draft, and preconstucted decks, up to four players can play out of a single copy of the game. There is another way to play, called \"constructed,\" where each player needs their own copy of the game. In constructed, you build a deck at home using your entire Epic card collection to play against a friend who did the same thing.\nWhile Epic gives you the full trading card game experience at a tiny fraction of the cost, Epic is NOT a trading card game.There are no random packs or hard to get cards. When you buy the game, you get everything you need to play. You know exactly what cards you're getting. There will be expansions down the road, but they are optional. You can literally play and enjoy hundreds of games with just the base set.\nThe first war of the gods tore the world apart. Each god continually remaking reality was more than the universe could withstand\u2026 The great nothingness returned, leaving the gods to bicker in the void.\nEventually, a compromise was reached. The gods joined forces to create the universe anew, but this time there were rules that even they must obey. No longer could gods battle directly, tugging against one another on the fabric of reality. Now their wars are fought in the mortal world with mighty champions and devastating events.\nIn Epic, each player starts the game with a score of 30 health. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents by reducing their health to 0. Set up is fast. To play a basic game, just shuffle and deal each player a 30 card deck and you are ready to go!\nYou start the game with a hand of five cards, and draw a new card at the start of your turn. Your cards represent powerful champions that will fight for you or game changing events you can use to thwart your opponent.\nEach turn every player in the game gets one \"gold.\" Some cards cost a gold to play, others are free. This means you can play any card in your hand from the very first turn. There is no slow building of resources in this game. Epic starts at full throttle!\nA game of Epic might go something like this:\nOn your first turn, you play a Frost Giant and attack your opponent. Not wanting to take 8 damage, he plays a Surprise Attack and drops a T-Rex on the board, blocking and killing your giant. You Fireball the injured dinosaur finishing it off, then end your turn.  Your opponent draws a card at the start of his turn, then plays a Dark Knight and attacks you for 5, knocking you down to 25 Health. Then he plays a Blue Dragon, drawing a card and blasting you down to 23 health. You need some answers, so before your opponent ends his turn you play an Ancient Chant and draw 2 cards. Hmmm... What should you do next, wipe out the board with an Apocalypse or drop a massive Burrowing Wurm on the table? Welcome to turn two, Epic style!\nThe four colors of Epic cards each represent a different alignment. Yellow is good, red is evil, blue is sage and green is wild. Each alignment has its own strengths and weaknesses.\nLike in Star Realms, you can play cards of any and all colors in your deck. If you can match colors, your cards will frequently get more powerful.\nThe righteous, the honorable, protectors, healers, angels, saints, brave knights and benevolent kings. These are the forces of good.\nYour good cards will raise large armies of humans, protect your champions and increase your health. You will banish enemy champions to the bottom of your opponent's deck and launch devastating airborne assaults lead by glorious angels.\nSavage beasts, burning fire, terrible storms, instinct, aggression and rage. The wild don't have an agenda. They aren't good or evil, they're hungry... and your opponent looks like food. \nPlaying wild gives you giant monsters that can smash and stomp though your opponent's defenses. You'll hurl fire and lightning at your foes. Great storms, volcanoes and earthquakes will smash all that stand in your way.\nThe cruel, the murderous, vampires, assassins, demons, devils and zombies. These nightmares taken form are champions of evil.\nWith evil cards, you'll master death, killing champions in droves then bringing the dead back to serve a new master. Your vampires will shrug off mortal wounds and feed upon the forces of your enemies. Hordes of zombies and powerful demons will be yours to command, if you are willing to pay the price to summon them.\nThe wise, the clever, the logical, tricksters, scholars, illusionists, engineers, alchemists and wizards. For the sage, knowledge is power. Reason and logic will illuminate the path to victory.\nThrough sage cards you will master time, returning enemy champions to your opponent's hand. You will construct mighty engines of war and call upon powerful magic to transform or blast your enemies. You will mislead enemy armies, leaving your opponents defenseless and assuring your victory.

If you plan for every possible outcome, they'll come up with something impossible to try.\nConcept Cards are a compact, concise and creative solution to that problem, allowing you to instantly bring in new elements to your game when you plan for options A, B and C and your players choose 7.\nWith a full set of Concept Cards, you'll be able to fill out your game with interesting NPCs, describe the exotic locations your players visit, challenge them with surprising plot hooks, attack them with strange monsters, and reward them with unusual treasures, without ever needing to pull out a book.\nHow Do Concept Cards Work?\nConcept Cards come in two varieties. Each standard deck contain 56 playing cards (the normal 52, 2 jokers, and 2 oddities), each of which describes a concept with a thematic tie to their suit. The Epic decks are still 56 cards, but contain more high-fantasy concepts, and are thematically tied to the Major Arcana and Norse Runes.\nFor a full list of the past decks, and the details of how each works, check out this update\nMixing It Up\nIf you find that the 112 cards within a Concept aren't enough for you, you can create new combinations with ease. Simply draw 5 cards, and take the Clubs value from the first, the Diamonds value from the second, the Hearts from the third, the Spades from the fourth and the Secret from the fifth. \nThese combinations often take a little thought to put together, but the combination will produce something truly unique.\nPlaying Games\nEach of the Concept Cards decks comes with a game that makes use of the four-suited nature of the cards. Thus far each deck has had a unique game, and the Treasure and Creature cards will each have their own unique game too.\nIf we reach \u00a312,000 we'll create a 10th and 11th unique game, for the Epic Creature and Epic Treasure decks.\nThe rules sheets for all the current games are available to read for free\nFor a review of City Builder, the Urban Locations game click here\nWhat's New?\nThis kickstarter introduces Creatures (as seen above) and Treasures (below). We're also making a special box to hold all the decks in one place; which may come with extra documentation depending on what stretch goals we reach.\nEach of the new deck themes also comes with a new set of suit symbols, created by our favourite Spaniard, Marcos Hidalgo:\nThe Box\nWe are currently still discussing with the manufacturer the cost of decorations for the box, but the main structure is a wooden container with a sliding lid, and an internal divider, so that all 11 decks can be placed upright side by side without knocking around.\nAdd-ons\nIf we don't have a backer level that suits you, you can add extras to any of the physical pledge levels.\n+\u00a32 - Digital Deck - You receive PDFs for an additional deck, not just the new ones and those you have physical copies of. (See the FAQ for a full list)\n+\u00a39 - Extra Deck - Add one additional Concept Cards deck of your choice to your pledge. This includes the PDF version. \n+\u00a310 - Box It Up - Add the box and any extras it contains to your pledge. If pledging for less than four decks there's an extra \u00a34 surcharge to cover the cost of shipping.\n+\u00a3X - Double Trouble - Add the base cost of your pledge level again to get double that pledge levels goodies.\nStretch Goals\nThe \u00a32000 goal for this project is only the beginning. At that level we will making two new decks, and a 9-deck box, but we intend to expand our offering as funds allow, eventually reaching four decks and expanding the box to match. The stretch goals include:\n\u00a32500: All boxes include an extra booklet explaining some ways to combine the different decks - Reached\n\u00a33500: Another new deck \"Epic Creatures and Treasures\", containing a Major Arcana for each of those decks - Reached\n\u00a35000: T-shirts! We'll design Concept Cards T-shirts that you can pledge for as an add-on. - Reached\n\u00a37000: Who Needs a Roleplaying System Anyway?! We'll add a rules-light system to every box-set, and make the PDF available to all backers - Reached\n\u00a39000: Instead of \"Epic Creatures and Treasures\" in a single deck, we will have two separate decks, \"Epic Creatures\" and \"Epic Treasures\" - Reached\n\u00a312000: We'll develop and playtest separate games for the Epic Creatures and Epic Treasures decks, in addition to the new games for Creatures and Treasures.\nWho Are We?\nWe're just two guys trying to make it as game designers*: Loz Hensel and Ste Coffey.\n*With a lot of assistance from our friends and partners.\nWe started with \"Character Cards\" as an experiment in using Kickstarter, but it succeeded far beyond our expectations, and received highly positive reviews, so we've been following our backer's feedback and making a complete set of Fantasy Concept Cards.

We didn't spend enough time preparing ideas for the Kickstarter, and that meant that we didn't know how long each Plot Hooks card would take.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo. Brian was directly involved in the creation of all three The Bard\u2019s Tale games in the 80s, the first game launching his long and storied career at Interplay and inXile through the 90s to now.\ninXile has embraced the crowdfunding model fully, delivering the fan favorite Wasteland 2 (over 70,000 backers raising over $3 million), and following it up with Torment: Tides of Numenera (over 90,000 backers raising almost $4.9 million and still going). We doubled Wasteland 2\u2019s crowdfunded budget with our own funds, and continue to support it with the upcoming Game of the Year Edition, which will be released as a feature rich and extensive free upgrade to all PC backers and buyers.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is spearheaded by the same team that delivered the award-winning Wasteland 2.\nAs always, inXile Entertainment is proud to be a part of Kicking It Forward, pledging to spend 5% of our eventual profits back into crowdfunding projects.\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged at any tier $20+, you can include add-ons with your pledge.

The studio is in its 12th year of existence now, and has a proven track record for Kickstarter-produced games, having released Wasteland 2 to fan and critical acclaim and with a second project in production in Torment: Tides of Numenera.\n\nThe main challenge is indicating a fully accurate delivery date, which is not possible to do before we know how much funding we have. As funding increases, it allows us to increase the scope and depth of the product, but this will inevitably impact the release date. Our initial estimate is based on a $2.5 million budget game and we will openly communicate on changes to the release date as our project progresses.\n\ninXile has established revenue streams from its back catalog, including Wasteland 2, The Bard\u2019s Tale, as well as the upcoming Wasteland 2 Game of the Year Edition. This revenue is invested directly back into the games we\u2019re working on \u2013 we will be investing at least a matching $1.25 million should Bard's Tale IV fund.

In Elsinore you play as Ophelia, a young noblewoman of Denmark, who awakes from a terrible vision: in four days, everyone in Elsinore Castle will be dead. To make matters worse, the vision has inexplicably thrown her into a time loop. Forced to relive the same four days over and over again, Ophelia must learn to survive in Elsinore, doing everything in her power to change the future. \nElsinore is a point-and-click adventure game with time loops; at its core, it's Shakespeare meets Majora's Mask/Groundhog Day. We're experimenting with combining story-creation mechanics to produce something we feel is truly new.\nDynamic Story Engine: Elsinore uses a story simulation engine to determine which events occur based upon your interactions. Lie, forgive, assassinate, befriend, or destroy \u2014 the actions you can take at any stage are numerous, and the game immediately responds.\nIntelligent Character Behavior: Each character manages their own lives, schedules, needs, desires, and plans over the course of each time loop. Even the smallest interaction has an impact on the world around you.\nLearn from Previous Loops: Over the four days within each time loop, the player can explore dozens of different outcomes for even minor actions, each time learning new information.\nBecome a Diplomat: Understanding each character's motivations isn't just part of the story -- it's necessary for Ophelia's survival. Characters are complex and have long histories with each other; all of them are keeping secrets.\nLife-or-Death Decisions: In a Shakespearean world, most roads end in tragedy, and characters are quick to meet a grisly fate. Hard decisions and terrible trials force players to think on their feet.\nHearsay & Evidence: Instead of concrete dialog choices in Elsinore, the player is tasked with gathering bits of information -- gossip, rumors, stories, lies, journal entries, bloody daggers, bottles of poison, and more -- and using them to convince characters to act. By \"presenting\" a piece of Hearsay or Evidence to a character, that character will change their course of action. You have dozens of pieces of information at your disposal at any given moment, and each one is a valuable tool in the right situation.\nReal-Time Implications: As you use Hearsay & Evidence, characters adapt their behavior on the fly. A normally kind and generous character may be driven to murder, and a dangerous character can be persuaded to lay down their sword. The right piece of information can even stop an ongoing massacre in its tracks.\nSimultaneous Action: Lots of things are happening all over Elsinore Castle at any time of day -- but you can't see them all at the same time. Choosing which events to attend and which ones to pass up is an important part of gathering new information. \nTime-Loop Puzzles: Moving the surrounding story forward will require the player to deeply understand and manipulate the time loop. Giving the right piece of information to a character at the wrong time can have disastrous results. \n\"Hey, that doesn't sound like much money. Is this enough to finish Elsinore?\"\nOur budget may seem small, but it's exactly what we need. All of us have day jobs -- as full-time employees in the game industry, students, or freelancers. Our jobs allow us to eat and pay student loans, but they don't allow us to spend the amounts we need to bring Elsinore over the finish line at a level of polish we'll be satisfied with.\nBy funding this campaign, you're saving us from months (or years) of saving before we can afford to finish Elsinore. We sincerely appreciate it!\n1000 Backers: Alternate Costumes - If we reach 1000 backers, we'll include a set of alternate equippable costumes for the main cast (Ophelia, Hamlet, Gertrude, Claudius, Polonius, and Laertes) with the released game!\n$15,000: Basic Voice Acting - At this tier, we'll be able to record a set of Fire Emblem-like voice-over emotes and lines for each character, as well as pay an audio engineer to post-process the lines for maximum quality.\n$18,000: The Pirate Ship + New Character - Did you know there are pirates in Hamlet? THERE TOTALLY ARE! If we reach this tier, Ophelia will be able to join Hamlet in getting captured by pirates at sea. This area will contain content which ties back to the main game's storyline. All backers will also get to vote on a BRAND NEW character to be added to the game -- from a top-secret selection!\n$23,000: Additional Animation - At this tier, we'll be able to hire a professional animator to add to our staff of 1 artist and 1 technical artist. This will greatly improve the number of animations we can have in the game and add to the polish of each one.\n$30,000: Castle Town - Similar to the Pirate Ship tier. At this tier, players will be able to access portions of Castle Town - the town that lies beneath Elsinore in the Danish countryside. All backers will also get to vote on a BRAND NEW character to be added to the game -- from a top-secret selection!\n$36,000: Fortinbras' War Camp - Similar to the Castle Town and Pirate Ship tiers. At this tier, players will be able to access the Prince of Norway's war camp, located in a mess of swampland where Denmark and Norway are locked in a bitter conflict. Ophelia will be able to access previously-hidden information on both countries' diplomatic efforts.\n$45,000: iPad Version - At this tier, we'll be able to bring Elsinore to the iOS store for iPad players!\n$55,000 and above: Mystery goals - We'll reveal more about these stretch goals as we approach them!\nKatie Chironis - Team Lead, Writer (@katiechironis)\nKatie is a professional game writer by day, where she works on adventure games.

He burst onto the art scene in 2012 with his critically acclaimed exhibition 'Horrorgami'. \nArmed only with a scalpel, he painstakingly transforms an ordinary sheet of single A4 paper into a breathtaking piece of three-dimensional architecture. He also hates talking in the 3rd person but it makes for a better read.\nIt is with great excitement Marc is announcing his new project -\n'CUT SCENE: 12 Kirigami Models Inspired by Scenes from Star Wars cut from a Single Sheet of Paper'.\nkirigami - cut from a single sheet of paper\nThe 'Cut Scene' Exhibition\nAs a life long fan of the Star Wars saga, it\u2019s Marc\u2019s ambition to continue working in the realm of film culture. He aims to create a body of work inspired by scenes from their legendary narratives via his craft of kirigami. Like his previous exhibition 'Horrorgami' the work will be presented within light boxes. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe traditional gallery/artist set up is that the gallery takes a cut of the sales profits using a portion of this to produce the exhibition.\nMarc is not affiliated with Lucas Film or Disney or doesn't hold a license to sell official merchandise, therefore he will not be selling editions of the art.\nThis means the funds must come from elsewhere. His goal isn't to make a profit - it's simply to produce the exhibition so that Star Wars fans can enjoy seeing the unique kirigami models in their physical form. Every penny will go towards making a better gallery experience.\nTo date, Marc has financed his project alone, having already designed and made half of the models and had 2 of the display cases manufactured, but now must ask for help in raising \u00a316,500. With your support he can produce a truly magical exhibition and share his meticulously crafted Cut Scene collection with the Star Wars community.\nkirigami - cut from a single sheet of paper\nOnce the target is met any extra funding will go towards improving the exhibition, be it adding more pieces to the collection or even touring the show!\nkirigami - cut from a single sheet of paper\nkirigami - cut from a single sheet of paper\nHow it all Started \nMarc burst onto the arts scene in 2012 with his solo exhibition 'HORRORGAMI'. The show was a collection of 13 original kirigami models based on the famous buildings from horror films and TV. The exhibition attracted attention from respected news, arts & cultural magazines and websites such as the BBC, Wired and Creative Review. By the time the show was open to the public Time Out magazine placed Horrorgami at the top of the \u2018Hot List\u2019, naming it the \u2018best event to visit in London\u2019 that week. Since then he has gone on to create work for clients such as Samsung Galaxy, Procter & Gamble and Decorex International. In 2014 Marc was very honoured to be approached by the Terrence Higgins Trust (charity) to create a unique kirigami model to be sold as part of The Auction 2014 at Christies. The work sold to an absentee bidder for \u00a319,000.\nYou can find out more about Marc's work on his website: paperdandy.co.uk\nImages from the Horrorgami Exhibition\nThe Rewards\nImages of the rewards will be added soon.

Putting on an show in central London is expensive stuff, even with a target set at \u00a316,600!\n\nHiring a gallery space that is easily to get to, will do the work justice, invigilation (the people who work look after the show), signage, promotion (so people know about it) - approximately 25% of the funding will go there. I have a space in mind already, however if the target is surpassed I'll aim to move it to a slightly more central and bigger space.\n\nEach of the lightboxes are bespoke made and approximately 25% of the finding will go on that. Because of the (hopefully) huge amount of generosity shown by pledgers, 20% of the money will go towards making the rewards. I'll be especially keen to direct more funding towards making better quality rewards if the target is surpassed.

Thanks for your support.\nYooka-Laylee is an all-new 3D platformer from the creative talent behind the Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country games. We\u2019ve come together to form Playtonic Games and create a spiritual successor to our most cherished work from the past!\nOur new heroes, Yooka (the green bloke with no pants) and Laylee (the wisecracking lady-bat with the big nose) were conceptualised from the ground up for stellar platforming gameplay, created by the same character artist behind the rebooted Donkey Kong family and legendary N64 heroes Banjo and Kazooie.\nUsing an arsenal of special moves like Yooka\u2019s tongue grapple and Laylee\u2019s tactical sonar blast, players will explore \u2013 and expand \u2013 gorgeous 3D worlds drawn up by esteemed environment artist Steven Hurst (Banjo-Kazooie series, Viva Pinata) and through skill discover the plethora of delicious collectibles hidden within.\nWe did this in 3 months. It took me almost that long to write this page.\nHeroes Built for Fun: Our new buddy-duo were dreamed up specifically for entertaining platforming gameplay and exceptional colour coordination. We think we've captured the spirit of our past heroes while introducing our most inventive moves yet.\nAn Arsenal of Abilities: Sonar blasting, tongue whipping, sky soaring\u2026 a move roster built for platforming fun \u2013 and unlocked with added freedom. Additionally, there may or may not be a move involving a giant fart bubble.\nYooka regretted filling out that PPI claim.\nA Dream Soundtrack: David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) and Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) combine in what's sure to be a melodic masterpiece! Seriously, clean out your ears - they're in for a treat.\nCollect-em-up 2.0: A roster of shiny collectibles with gameplay progression at their core (as well as other, more valuable materials). Every collectible type in our new game will expand gameplay in a meaningful way. Yes, we employ the man responsible for DK64's myriad of trinkets, but we've had a stern word. Our main collectible, Pagies, are used to unlock and expand new worlds in Yooka-Laylee.\nExpandable Worlds: Experience more of the playgrounds you love by spending collectibles to expand your favourites into bigger, more challenging worlds.\nTake (musical) note: our new collectibles are work in progress.\nA Cast to Last: A huge cast of memorable characters to meet (or beat) brought to life by the art and audio teams behind Banjo-Kazooie and destined to endure in future games as part of Playtonic Universe. Expect all manner of grunts, squeaks and squawks.\nIntroducing Play Tonics: Discover these unique gameplay modifiers and use them to customise gameplay to suit your style. Will you run faster, hit harder or fly further? Also, are they named after our studio or vice versa? We'll never know.\nArcade machines: Each world hides at least one secret arcade game encasing old-school gaming goodness. Complete its retro-tastic challenge to claim your Pagie!\nYou can expect accurate bat physics.\nDuring their adventures Yooka and Laylee will complete challenges to unlock and collect Pagies. These golden collectibles are the main currency in the game, used not only to unlock new worlds but expand them too.\nIt's snow joke, this world's going to be cool.\nIn the jungle world showcased in this Kickstarter for example, new islands containing advanced features and challenges will become available once you\u2019ve decided to hand your Pagies over to the world-building construction crew.\n\nDon\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s? Spend your Pagies elsewhere. If you desire, world expansion can be ignored entirely and you can hop, skip and roll your way through the standard worlds towards the final boss lurking in his or her mighty keep. And once the pivotal villain is nought but ash on the pavement, you can still opt to explore the expanded worlds with your full moveset post-credits to hunt down those leftover Pagies.\n\nYooka-Laylee will feature a truly mouth-watering (ear-leaking?) soundtrack created in collaboration by three of gaming\u2019s greatest composers, the legendary David Wise (Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing), equally esteemed Banjo-Kazooie composer Grant Kirkhope (Viva Pi\u00f1ata, GoldenEye 007) and Banjo sound effects supremo Steve Burke (Kameo: Elements of Power). \nThis is one musical performance you definitely won\u2019t want to miss! Don't believe us? Listen to the early excerpts below and tell us you're not excited. Go on, we dare ya.\n'Jungle World' (working title / progress) by Grant Kirkhope:\n'Jungle Challenge' (working title / in progress) by David Wise:\n  What's more we've already had Chris Sutherland - part time programmer, full time voice actor extraordinaire - locked in the recording booth to bring his iconic 'gibberish' style to the characters (and googly-eyed objects) of Yooka-Laylee, ensuring a genuine audio treat. You might as well play it with your eyes closed, to be honest.\nIf our initial Kickstarter funding goal is reached, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team will deliver a complete and satisfying game package. However, given the opportunity and additional resources required, we have a list of \u2018dream\u2019 additional extras \u2013 and release structures - that we\u2019d love to deliver in order to make Yooka-Laylee an even better game.\nIf funded, Yooka-Laylee will be released for Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Wii U. However, the exact release timing and scope of each version will be determined by the success of this Kickstarter campaign and specifically, our stretch goals.\nWe\u2019d love to be able to guarantee a simultaneous, day-one release on all platforms in order to satisfy every Yooka-Laylee backer. In order to do this we\u2019ll need to significantly expand our resources and budget, and if we can reach the funding number required we\u2019d be excited to do so.\nAny extra money will of course go towards improving the game. Below is an example of some of the extra features we\u2019ll be able to fulfil by reaching stretch funding goals:\n What the Bleedin\u2019 Norah is a Toybox? Our Toybox experiences are designed to deliver hands on time with Yooka and Laylee before the game even comes out. You can be the first to take our heroic duo for a spin (literally, if you press X) but we promise this self-contained plaything won\u2019t spoil the full game: It\u2019s built from in-game assets arranged specifically for this experience. There won\u2019t be any objectives to beat, just a controllable duo, nice music and a few surprises too\u2026 !\n Toybox ++ The Enhanced Playtonic Toybox? Well of course, sir. A fine choice. I\u2019ll prepare the improved play space, advanced props and special moves right away. Oh I\u2019m sorry, are those sports shoes? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\n   It'll look something like this: (work in progress!)\n     [Updated 08 June] The concert will be in Stuttgart, Germany at the Hegel Saal on October 30th 2016 \u2013 David and Grant are confirmed with more details to follow soon\u2026!  \nThe Playtonic Team, composers and our backers will meet up in Stuttgart \u2022 You will be our VIP guests, we\u2019ll all sit together at the concert and dinner and discuss the potential reasons why Grant talks so fast \nYou may want to know more details before pledging, so please get in touch with us on kickstarter@playtonicgames.com or check out the organisers Facebook page here; https://www.facebook.com/rareconcert/info?tab=page_info\n    Playtonic was formed in 2014 by veterans of Rare Ltd. Between them, the seven-person Playtonic team has over 100 years of combined experience working on blockbuster franchises such as Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pi\u00f1ata and Kameo: Elements of Power \u2013 and using this Kickstarter we intend to grow our talent even further! Allow us to introduce the team (so far)\u2026\nOur plan is to have Yooka-Laylee ready to ship on PC, Mac and Linux by October 2016. Console versions will follow shortly after, dependent on resources and the performance of this Kickstarter campaign. However, if our crowdfunding is a big success and stretch goals met, then we will look to secure the resources required to pull off a simultaneous, day-one release on all major console platforms alongside PC, Mac and Linux.\nIn order to finish Yooka-Laylee we will need to expand our team to an \u2018N64 size\u2019 roster of around 15, which we\u2019ll look to do immediately upon reaching our funding goal. Therefore the vast majority of our budget will be allocated to wages and office space, plus the cost of outsourcing sound, testing and version creation. \n\nYooka-Laylee is a real passion project for the Playtonic team and we\u2019ve all made financial sacrifices to get it this far. We\u2019ll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter doesn\u2019t succeed, but the game will be bigger and better if it does! \n                                                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development can be a harsh taskmaster, with time and financial constraints often providing unexpected challenges that can ultimately lead to changes and delays. Fortunately, the Playtonic Games team has collectively been involved in more than 30 different games across more than ten different platforms and has great expertise in the 3D platformer specifically, with a strong track record of shipping some of the genre\u2019s greatest hits. \n\nSo not only do we have extensive experience delivering quality releases within this genre, but we\u2019re also well versed in working under the pressures of strict deadlines, budgets and high expectation. We\u2019re very confident we can deliver a game that lives up to fan expectations, on time and on budget.\n\nAnother challenge is to find the perfect balance between our own ideas for Yooka-Laylee and the expectations of the community. We\u2019re well aware that many fans are deeply, passionately attached to our past work and in some ways probably understand and adore its intricacies even better than we do. That\u2019s why over the coming months \u2013 and during this very Kickstarter campaign \u2013 we\u2019ll be consulting the community on some design issues and then ultimately making the final decision within our development team on the absolute direction.\n\nIn the past our most famous games have been single-platform releases. However, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team already has the necessary experience and channels to deliver a multiplatform release, and if certain stretch goals are met we\u2019ll recruit in this area to deliver different versions of our game to an even smoother deadline.

Early Access will be PC/Mac only.\nFeatures:\nA vast, merciless, uncaring universe: It's filled with bloodthirsty fauna, enigmatic aliens and mysterious ancient artifacts, in a setting reminiscent of classic sci-fi games like Star Control II and Master of Orion.\nA motley crew with unique traits and talents: Recruit and train a crew of characters whose idiosyncrasies can mess with your plans, unlock story events, challenge your patience, or delight you with their special combat abilities.\nHard decisions and tough battles: Deep tactical combat for both fleet and ground combat means you'll need to use all your strategic thinking and your officers' special abilities to gain an advantage.\nExplore, expand, exploit and exterminate (sorta!): Inspired by classic strategy mechanics straight out of your favourite 4x games: rebuild your starbase, construct facilities, research tech, explore star systems, mine resources, build ships and fight to survive.\nEmergent storytelling: Tons and tons of storytelling embedded in the game system. Whether you want wacky, lighthearted events or intense life-or-death situations with high stakes, Halcyon 6 is going to have it all!\nBase Building: Spend resources to build station facilities (modules) to enhance your production and technological capabilities, or build ships to help you control more territory.\nExploration: Assign your fleets to other locations in the galaxy, where they can handle emerging enemy threats, do missions for alien factions or secure bonus resources.\nCrew Management: Assign crew to station facilities to greatly improve their output efficiency, or to ships where they can contribute in unique ways to combat, missions and events.\nCombat: Engage in tactical fleet or ground combat to resolve hostile events, create a foothold in the sector and ultimately defeat the enemy mothership!\nStory Events: Based on game criteria (station modules constructed, alien diplomacy scores, officer traits/skills, etc.), the game produces story events that lead to combat, bonuses/negatives, officer attribute changes or any number of crazy in-game scenarios.\nFULL RELEASE\nHalcyon 6 full release will be available for PC (Windows), Mac and Linux. The PC and Mac version will be released first with Linux following. We're aiming for a Steam release as well as DRM-free download.\nEARLY ACCESS\nEARLY ACCESS will be released on Steam only. Early Access will be available for PC initially and Mac will follow. Linux version will only be available at Full Release.\nDRM FREE Option\nWhen the FULL GAME releases, all backers will have the option to choose between a STEAM key or DRM-Free download. (EARLY ACCESS will be STEAM ONLY)\nOther Platforms\nWe are considering other platforms (Xbox One, PS4, PSVita, 3DS, iOS, Android) and some will appear as stretch goals depending on the success of this campaign and interest level. \nUnlimited Replayability: Each playthrough has players dealing with a new randomly generated derelict station, surrounding galaxy, crew recruits, and alien factions.\nMotley Crew: Each crew member has unlimited potential for acquiring unique behaviours, traits and abilities, for better or for worse. Making the best use of your dysfunctional crew will be one of the keys to success. Who should be your main Science Officer: the insomniac that works insane hours, but has an addictive personality or the agoraphobic mad genius?\nEncounters of the Weird Kind: There are currently five alien factions in Halcyon 6 and they are all quite different with varying objectives and personalities. Only your wit and your crew\u2019s skills will help you navigate the diplomatic waters to gain key allies and valuable trading partners.\n Others\nApart from the primary race factions, there will also be a collection of hostile units that are itching to tear your officers\u2019 faces off.\nWhether it\u2019s crazed ancient robots or mindless deep space fauna, there\u2019s going to be tons of terrifying monster encounters for the player to deal with.\n Why Are We Using Square Enix Collective?\nWhat\u2019s great about the Square Enix Collective program is that it gives indie developers like us a nice boost in marketing, something that is harder and harder to do as a small team these days.\nTo be clear, we\u2019re not getting any money from Square Enix. They are purely helping out on the marketing and PR side of things.\nThe only requirement was to have a game and a team that passed their Team Assessment review.\nThankfully both our game and team passed with flying colours.\nOllie Sykes from Square Enix said this about our team:\n\u201cMassive Damage are a smart and ambitious team with a proven track record not only in developing and delivering games, but in engaging with their community. With an engaging visual style and deep and rewarding gameplay, Halcyon 6 looks like it has all the ingredients to make a splash once released.\u201c\nIf you\u2019re interested, you can read the entirety of the Team Assessment report here.\nAll of us at Massive Damage would like to give a hearty THANK YOU to the Square Enix Collective team for running such an awesome program for indie game developers!\nThe Halcyon 6 team is made up of six seasoned game developers (plus one LA-based film composer) at Massive Damage, a Toronto based indie game studio. We started the studio 4 years ago with a hit location-based zombie MMORPG called Please Stay Calm and have released 4 more games since.\nMassive Damage's hit game, Please Stay Calm, was released to critical acclaim in 2011. Please Stay Calm has been downloaded over 2 million times and won the Editor's Choice award from 148apps.\nKen Seto\u2019s our fearless leader, and the CEO/Co-founder of Massive Damage. In the last 7 years, he's started 2 mobile companies, designed and launched over 5 apps and 7 games.\nPeter McLaren is the lead designer, producer and writer. Peter has done art direction, writing and design for over 4 games including Please Stay Calm.\nLucky Bremachandra is the lead developer, expert in all things Unity 3d. A veteran game developer who's worked at Koei and Gameloft, Lucky has led development on over 8 games.\nJeff Elliot is the chief technology officer, and assists with technological planning, problem solving, and a lot of game design. Jeff is an old school software engineer with decades of experience building large complex systems.\nLinda Tran is our UI Designer/Office Manager superstar. Part artist, part designer, part office Mom, all awesome. Linda has worked on over 7 games and led design on 3.\nJuan Carlos Solon is the lead artist and pixel master. You can see more of his beautiful artwork in these games: Zombie Puzzle Panic, Dragon Kingdoms and Please Stay Calm.\nSteve London is a successful film composer living in LA.\nAdd Ons!\nIf you want a couple of extra copies for friends that can't pledge, you can do so easily by following these instructions.\nDuring checkout, add the amounts manually to your total pledge. If you've already backed us, go to \"Manage Pledge\" and add the appropriate amount (or more) to your total. Be sure to keep your original pledge tier the same. \nAfter the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you and you can specify your desired add-ons based on the extra amount added. Extra copies of the game are treated the same as the Crewman tier.\nAdditional digital copy of the game: add $15 \nOriginal Halcyon 6 Soundtrack (download only): add $10\nEarly preview by Steve London: https://soundcloud.com/steve-london/sets/halcyon-6-game-music-ideas\nHalcyon 6 T-shirt: add $40 (worldwide shipping included)\nDesign an additional officer (similar to the 'Design A Character' pledge reward from the $99 Captain tier, but for those who wish to add a family member or friend to the game): add $75\nAdd your last name to the generic officer name generation tables (we'll have highly-randomized, generated officers to fill in the gaps between backer-designed officers. With this addition you'll have the ability to add yourself to their list of names, which means there would be a small chance that your name might appear in any given playthrough): add $10\nWhy We Need Your Help\nOur earlier success with Please Stay Calm really helped build up our company, giving us the opportunity to put together this unique, exciting game concept.\nBut we can't do it on our own. As you can probably tell from this campaign, we have HUGE plans for Halcyon 6, and the only way for us to get there is with YOUR HELP.\nThe core H6 team consists of six people, and we know we can make the main game with this team. However, with a larger group, we could start working on our big, ambitious stretch goals sooner, which would really kick the project into high gear.\nThank you again for your interest and your support. All of us at Massive Damage can't wait to collaborate with you on this one-of-a-kind project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeyond catastrophes on a global scale (\"the internet stops working forever\", \"the world is consumed by a black hole\" or \"zombies\"), our game is going to be made. \n\nThat being said, game development is hard, and unexpected setbacks can fall on your head at any minute. We've been in the business long enough to know that servers can fail, funds can fall short and 3rd party delivery mechanism changes can sideline the plans of tiny and huge developers alike.\n\nBut we're a dedicated, scrappy group. We work long hours, fueled by the passion we have for this project. We have multiple devs on staff who have spent their entire professional lives designing and implementing highly complex systems similar to the ones we're building for roster management and event generation. Our front-end team is hard at work, and our combat prototype is ahead of schedule.\n\nThank you again for your interest and your support.

The Confrontation is a turn-based strategy game pitting two players of Light and Shadow against each other with asymmetric forces and hidden units. Players craftily maneuver their characters into strategic locations to exploit weaknesses in their opponent\u2019s position and initiate battles or play special cards to learn about enemy characters. Drawing from a limited hand of cards players try to win each battle while leaving valuable cards for future battles. \nFor Light to be victorious, the player must sneak the Prince to the Shadow Stronghold. Shadow, on the other hand, is tasked with finding and defeating the Prince (Or moving 3 characters into the Light Capital). \nLike many of Reiner\u2019s other designs, The Confrontation can be played casually between beginners or as deeply as master level chess: it\u2019s up to you and your opponents!\nThis is a computer adaptation of a game by Reiner Knizia and will be available for PC, Mac, and iPad, featuring local AI opponents and realtime online multiplayer. A limited beta will begin for desktop platforms immediately after this Kickstarter with an iPad beta to follow thereafter.\nCan the Shadow forces find and defeat the Prince?\nWhat card to play when the Nightmare confronts Durion the Slayer?\nWe've also started the Steam Greenlight process. All desktop backers will receive Steam keys when the game is approved!\nThe aim of this campaign is to get additional funding to allow us to work on an expansion of the game. We will introduce 18 additional variant characters and 4 additional special cards. These will be available after the initial release as purchasable Downloadable Content (DLC) and all reward tiers from Squire and up will include both standard game and expansion. The Confrontation is one of our absolute favorites of Reiner\u2019s designs and we would love your support in turning this into a great gaming experience. \nWhile the standard game is super fun, we\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll want the expanded world that these 18 variant characters provide once you\u2019re familiar with the basics. We don\u2019t want players to have to wait a year for something that we know they\u2019ll want right away.\nTo immediately get started on this expansion, we\u2019ve set our basic funding level at $6,000 with some stretch goals to build even more great features.\nWe've come a long way from our early concepts!\nWe\u2019re also very excited to work with the board game and Kickstarter community! There will be opportunities for backers to participate in a limited beta where their feedback will have a direct impact on the final product as well as the co-design of some variant characters to help make the extended version of the game an amazing experience.\nThe Hill Giant ignores the Shadow player's battle card but has 9 strength!\nConlan Rios.

But NEXT TIME\u2026!\u201d - Rich Sommer\n\u201cI enjoyed the game and it felt like my decisions mattered.

Long story short: the support and exposure of this past month has been inspiring, and we'll continue development on Cadence as a smaller, tighter project funded by pre-ordering from our Noodlestarter page -- secure this project's future by feeding us noodles!\nYour first moments together with Cadence will be about exploring the simple mechanics which lie at the heart of the game. By making connections between nodes, you create pathways in an effort to solve puzzles. Solutions are correct once they form a loop or cycle that can continue forever.\nWhilst playing Cadence, one of the things you will notice is the simple elegance. Minimalist design cues and finely-crafted controls banish distractions and allow you to lose yourself. The rules start out simple, but as you\u2019re drawn deeper a wonderfully complex set of possibilities emerges. You'll soon realise that problem solving can lead to entirely novel outcomes, allowing simple scenarios to yield multiple solutions.\nIf you're a Youtuber or press (no matter how small) you can request a copy of the game by emailing info@madewithmonsterlove.com\nThe gameplay in Cadence is already incredibly rewarding, but when combined with sound it creates one of the most astounding qualities of the game. Every element in the game generates a tone, so by solving puzzles in novel ways you're essentially building music!\nCadence wants you to have as much fun as possible with the sound you create. We've borrowed heavily from electronic music -- in fact, synthesizers are baked right into the game. This means that you can effortlessly shape and manipulate the sound while it\u2019s playing. Drums and bass also enter into the mix, rounding out the options available to you.\nWe've poured a huge amount of effort into making a great game, and while we\u2019re not quite there yet, we're proud of the results so far. It's the best of Peter\u2019s vast sound and programming knowledge, and Rodain\u2019s experience with making great puzzles (as with his last game, Desktop Dungeons). But the whole time we've been working on the project, there\u2019s been an ambitious question gnawing away at us.\nWith all the elements in Cadence, might it be possible for us to build an entirely new way of making music? Could Cadence be a creative tool that anyone can use -- novice or maestro?\nAs a first step, we need to make it possible for you to create your own levels and compositions using Cadence. And of course, creating anything means that there needs to be an easy way for you to share that with the rest of the community ...\nBeyond this, we've got several ideas on how to include more music theory and production without losing the intuitive appeal of Cadence. And as for what sounds and synthesizers might eventually find their way into the game, that really depends on how involved you want to be!\nBy participating in the Beta you\u2019re helping us make Cadence the experience you want it to be. Seeing what you make will help us figure where to focus our efforts and discover how deep this rabbit hole goes. We thoroughly look forward to being part of a spirited community of creators, and being inspired in ways that we never could have imagined.\nBreakdown of funds:\nPeter spent half a decade as a studio-rat recording music and working with sound gear. He then accidentally fell in love with programming, and has since spent his time making games and other digital things, ultimately founding indie studio Made With Monster Love. \nRodain joined the crew in 2014 to judge Peter and loom over his shoulder while incessantly asking questions about music theory. Rodain has background in game design, having created the IGF award-winning Desktop Dungeons.\nWhite screen print on charcoal grey fabric. Please note the final product might be slightly different front what appears in the image. \nThe design of the poster has not been finalised yet, but we've commissioned the ultra-talented Jeanne Fourie to help us out.

And as with anything of sufficient complexity, the biggest risk is that the game will simply take longer than we anticipate. It's almost certain that there will be unknown pitfalls and gotchas that we only discover once they've already made themselves known, and these are very difficult to account for even though we make provisions for them. We've been wrong before on how long Cadence would take, not to mention the fact we are but two humans working on this. \n\nHowever, we've been working on Cadence for a long time now. This means that the pool of unknown variables is much smaller than it used to be. We have an intimate knowledge of where the pitfalls might lurk, a clear vision for the game we think Cadence should be, and most importantly an idea of the path we need to take to get us there. This makes us confident that even if the worst happens (what if we DON'T have a complete game by the end of our Kickstarter funds?), we'll be in a very healthy place to start with early access and continue earning the money necessary to get us across the finish line and make Cadence a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Made With Monster Love\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nMade With Monster Love is a two-man indie studio at the bottom tip of Africa in the creative hub of Cape Town.

Starting out with just a simple trick and a handful of helpers, you will embark on a journey to become the greatest illusionist alive.\nInspired by movies like the Prestige, Now You See Me and the Houdini mini-series, we created a world where magic and illusion are part of people\u2019s everyday lives. Most of the magic tricks in the game are part of the repertoires of real world illusionists, past and present, but a pinch of supernatural was also added to the mix \u2013 just so you can never be sure whether those Spiritual tricks are really merely illusions...\nEach turn, you will visit Magoria\u2019s various Locations \u2013 the Downtown, the Market Row, the Dark Alley and the Theater \u2013 to expand your team, learn more and more intricate magic tricks, get components for them, and prepare them in your Workshop. Each turn concludes with a Performance phase in the Theater, when players may perform a breathtaking magic show for Fame points and money. After the sixth Performance phase, the player with the most Fame points wins the game, and becomes the next Legend of Illusion.\nThe four starting characters are all inspired by great illusionists of the golden age of magic. You can read their story at trickerionboardgame.com.\nThanks to you helping us fund in less than 24 hours, we will add four more Magicians to the game! \nBoth the Illusionist and the Legend Box will ship with 8 Magicians to choose from instead of the original four, with four additional double-sided Magician cards and four additional Magician Poster Cards.\nThe four new Magicians will be revealed in this section as the project moves forward, so check back often!\nMore Coming Soon!\nTrickerion is a massive game, but its length and complexity is yours to decide!\nThe base game is very easy to grasp and takes 60-90 minutes, but for a truly epic battle of wits, feel free to enhance the game with the Dark Alley and the Magician Powers built-in expansions.\nThe Dark Alley expansion is included in both the Illusionist and the Legend Box.\nThis expansion adds a whole new Location to the game. It also comes with 60 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 20 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.\nThe Magician Powers expansion is included only in the Legend Box.\nYour Trickerion Shards gain a whole new gameplay significance with this expansion: They will unlock Power Card slots that allow you to customize your Magician by learning diverse abilities to enhance your game. As there are 90 different Power cards available, it will open up a multitude of new strategies and adds even more replayability to the game!\n\u201cThis is a rock-solid worker placement with a bunch of really, really cool evolutions.\u201d\n- Rahdo Runs Through\nTrickerion is a worker placement game at its heart, but we've added many new elements to spice up the formula and create a fresh gaming experience for even the most seasoned tabletop game fans out there.\nBefore placing their characters, players secretly and simultaneously plan their turns using Assignment cards, reducing player downtime during the placement phase, and letting you adjust your strategy according to your opponents\u2019 plans \u2013 if you can see through them!\nLocations in Trickerion have several Actions to choose from, each costing a number of Action Points. You are unlikely to get fully blocked out of a Location, but the number of Action Points you\u2019ll get to spend on Actions strongly depends on when you get to a Location and who you\u2019re getting there with.\nEach turn concludes with the grandiose Performance Phase, when the shows prepared during the turn are presented to the awestruck audience. The way these performances shape up is entirely up to the players: from a single trick gig to 6-trick blockbusters, Thursday to Sunday, you can even co-perform with others for greater rewards \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\nEnglish Rules\nFrench Rules (translated image captions here)\nCzech Rules\nCheck out our latest, formatted rule book for detailed rules of the game.

Please Note: The \u00a365 Pledge IS NOT LOCKED! \nSet in the year 2065, Thunderbirds follows the exploits of International Rescue: a secret organisation committed to saving human life, secretly founded and funded by the millionaire Tracy family. International Rescue has a host of technologically advanced land-, sea-, air-, and space-rescue vehicles and equipment ready to launch at a moment\u2019s notice.\nTo bring the ultimate Thunderbirds experience to the tabletop, Modiphius has partnered with Matt \u201cBrains\u201d Leacock, designer of the hit games Pandemic, Forbidden Desert, and Forbidden Island. \nWe have been designing the game since the Spring of 2014, we have the sculpts and graphic design for all the components and after extensive playtesting the game is almost ready to go into production. We are now raising funds to pay for the print run and to help cover the cost of the expensive plastics tooling for the cool ships and characters in the box. Since we are so well prepared the game will go into production in April. \nThe Thunderbirds the Co-operative Board Game will then ship in August 2015 and be released in retail in September to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the cult TV show. The game will feature the detailed plastic models of the iconic Thunderbirds machines and a high octane world full of disasters for players to come to the rescue.

This Add On will include a rulebook and card deck plus counters for use with the contents of the base game. The GM will use cards to layout the scenarios for International Rescue - these will introduce specific problems and plot complications for them to overcome with a combination of story telling, card and dice driven mechanics. Players will use the game board to move around Earth in the Thunderbirds models, but once at a location will have to deal with each disaster in a lot more detail plus the GM can introduce all kinds of complications and side plots as the face the Hood's evil organisation. Challenges will use the roll of two Thunderbirds dice from the core box, with the double Hood result being particularly bad for International Rescue!

Meanwhile, your arch nemesis, The Hood, is threatening to trigger terrible disasters around the world in an effort to learn your secrets. If you can foil his scheme while completing your missions, then you and your fellow players win the game!\nEach person plays different character in the game, for example, you might be Scott Tracy or Lady Penelope. All the different characters can operate any of the different vehicles. You might load up the Mole, fly Thunderbird 2 to Tracy Island, then hop into Thunderbird 3 with Alan and dock with Thunderbird 5 in Geo-stationary orbit. You\u2019ll use all of the vehicles to complete different missions around the world and in outer space. And you\u2019ll be continually weighing the threat of any of these individual missions against the overall danger of The Hood\u2019s scheme.\nMatt Leacock has decided to try out a little experiment.

It was produced using a combination of marionette puppetry and scale-model special effects, which was dubbed \u201cSupermarionation\u201d. Two series, totaling thirty-two 50-minute episodes, were produced, along with two films using the same techniques. Check out the trailer. \nRacing to the rescue from a secret island base beneath the luxurious home of the Tracy family somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean, International Rescue defies enemy spies and criminals who want the secrets of their incredible machines for their own. To combat this threat, Lady Penelope, International Rescue's aristocratic English secret agent, and her chauffeur Parker lead a network of agents to uncover those behind the disasters caused by deliberate sabotage\n\nA criminal mastermind known as \u201cthe Hood\u201d, operating from a temple deep in the Malaysian jungle and in possession of strange powers, often engineers events to allow him to spy on the Thunderbird machines with the goal of selling their secrets to the highest bidder.\n\nThe iconic Thunderbirds are designed by the Tracy family\u2019s close friend \u201cBrains\u201d and are assigned to each of the five Tracy brothers:\nThunderbird 1, piloted by Scott Tracy \u2013 a hypersonic rocket plane used for fast response and rescue-zone reconnaissance, and as a mobile control base.\nThunderbird 2, piloted by Virgil Tracy \u2013 a supersonic, VTOL carrier which transports their major rescue equipment in detachable pods.\nThunderbird 3, piloted by Alan Tracy \u2013 a single-stage, vertically launched spacecraft\nThunderbird 4, piloted by Gordon Tracy \u2013 a utility submersible for underwater rescue, launched from Thunderbird 2\nThunderbird 5, manned by John Tracy \u2013 a space station in geostationary orbit that monitors calls for help from across Earth.\nFinally, Lady Penelope has the iconic FAB 1\nFAB 1, driven by Parker \u2013 a pink, amphibious car\nThunderbirds\u2122 and \u00a9 ITC Entertainment Group Limited 1964, 1999 and 2015.

Aviary Attorney will be launching on Steam this Summer!\nYou can also follow our twitter or our developer blog for regular updates.\nThe year is 1848. Paris is on the brink of yet another revolution, and the prisons are overflowing with guilty and innocent alike.\nIn the dusty and neglected Aviary Attorney legal offices, Jayjay Falcon and Sparrowson receive a lucrative offer. Bourgeoisie kitten Caterline Demiaou has been accused of murder, and the Demiaou estate are willing to pay a sizable sum for a defense lawyer who can claim a Not Guilty verdict. Falcon will surely take on the case, but is somebody conspiring to stop him?\nMonsieur Falcon takes on a total of four cases during the events of Aviary Attorney. Although the circumstances of each case are wholly unique, there is a pattern to the gameplay...\nClick for full album\nAfter taking on a client, Falcon finds himself outside of court, where he is free to explore the landmarks of Paris. He does not have much opportunity for sight-seeing though, as there is only a small amount of time before each trial! Making smart choices about where to go, who to talk to, and what to say is vital to uncovering the most evidence in the short amount of time.\nClick for full album\nInside court, Falcon has to think and act carefully to prove his client's innocence. By scrutinizing testimonies and by presenting evidence at opportune times, Falcon deals blows the witness's credibility and gains favor with the jury. But mistakes can add up, tipping the jury's opinion towards a Guilty verdict.\nEven after losing a case, the story continues - albeit, a little darker than before...\nThe idea for Aviary Attorney came about after we discovered the beautiful but mostly forgotten artwork of J. J. Grandville. After having to abandon traditional newspaper caricatures due to government censorship, Grandville moved towards creating more whimsical and surreal lithographs for fiction writers. Among other works, he produced the bizarre drawings for \"the Public and Private Life of Animals\".\nThe Jayjay Falcon in his natural habitat\nWith careful scanning and animation, we were able to give life to Monsieur Falcon, Sparrowson, and all the other characters through Aviary Attorney. In fact, nearly every part of the game is drawn from or inspired by the public domain. The backgrounds and items have been borrowed from a range of 19th century illustrated books. The music takes the form of transcriptions and adaptions of French romantic composers, most notably Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. Even the font is over 100 years old!\nWe hope to do justice to all the source material, as well as to present the original works in a new and interesting light. With two experienced developers on the team, we have no doubt that we can produce a meaningful and interesting game by June of 2015!\nWhere exactly will the Kickstarter money go?\nApproximately \u00a34500 of the money will be used to fund the living wages of the two active developers - Mandy and Jeremy - during the development period. We have to eat!\nApproximately \u00a31500 of the funds will be spent towards acquiring high quality music software and digital instruments necessary for producing a satisfactory soundtrack. Although free alternatives exist, we do not consider them to be of a satisfactory standard, especially given the high quality of the compositions involved.\nThe remainder of the money (\u00a31000) has been reserved for the purpose of administrative costs. This includes the fee needed to apply to Steam Greenlight, the cut taken by Kickstarter and VAT, and any operational costs that may be incurred as a result of running the business.\nIn the fortunate event that this Kickstarter far exceeds its goal, we have prepared stretch goals to ensure that the money is put to good use!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe feel that the greatest challenge will be to provide a compelling narrative experience.

Sol Trader will return...\nIt's been quite a ride, and I really appreciate all the thoughts, feedback and encouragements I've received over the last few weeks.

I'll definitely be back!\nWhilst I'm obviously disappointed not to get funding this time round, I truly believe in the game idea and want to see it released. Therefore I'll keep plugging away at the game whenever I can. I'll post updates to the campaign so that you can keep track of what's going on, and will run another campaign to raise funds for a big release at the end of the project's development.\nHow can I support this project anyway?\nThere will be a few ways of doing that in the future:\nPlease vote on Steam Greenlight if you haven't already!\nYou'll soon be able to fund Sol Trader directly via the website.\nThere will soon be a Patreon page (might not be live yet)\nThanks again for all your support!\nChris\nOriginal description follows:\n\"If you don\u2019t want to play Sol Trader when you've read [the Kickstarter], I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t be friends anymore. That\u2019s just the way it is.\" - Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"Incredibly in-depth.\" - Indie Gamers UK\nI've replaced the main Kickstarter trailer with the new one: here's the old one for reference:\nHello: I'm Chris Parsons, a former AAA games developer turned software consultant and entrepreneur. I've recently come back home to my love of making indie games, and I'd love to introduce Sol Trader to you, the game I've been working on for the past three years in my spare time.\nSol Trader is a space game for PC and Mac. It combines the immersiveness of Elite and the fun of Asteroids with the depth and intrigue of an RPG and the generated histories of Dwarf Fortress.\nIt features a complex procedural history generator, inspired by the adventure and legends mode in Dwarf Fortress. Each new game is already two centuries old, with a living history full of characters that are born, live and die before you even exist.\nWhen you create a character in this world, you face the same choices as all the computer-controlled citizens did. The decisions you make in your character's early life set your starting skills and attributes, and your family connections and business contacts. The game generates two centuries of characters, events and interactions to set the scene: as a player, you are born into this world and form relationships in it before the game starts.\nYou'll then be able to create your own legend within this world: explore the known (and unknown) solar system, trade goods, run missions, leverage your contacts, and avenge members of your family as you see fit.\nWhen playing the finished game, you might find yourself:\nSpeeding through a dangerous asteroid belt to avoid pirates\nMeeting the President of Earth's Old Federation\nPainting your ship the colours of your pirate band\nBlackmailing an official for valuable information\nBecoming a double agent for two different governments\nTrawling the city markets for the best deals by day\nHitting the bars at night to network with important contacts\nGetting a friend to repair your ship for a discount\nOutfitting your ship with extra powerful engines to escape pursuers\nMining asteroids for rare metals with specially equipped lasers\nCollecting satellite and ship debris for a paltry fee\nRunning out of fuel and calling a rescue ship\nAvenging the death of a family member\nGaining lucrative missions from the senate due to your father's political connections\nCollecting samples from a far planet for a scientific mission\nExploring the Sol Trader Universe\nThe game universe stretches to the far reaches of our current solar system. All of the major planets and moons are included, which means players will be able to fully explore 20 huge distinct regions in the base game, all full of planets, moons, asteroids, space debris, pirate hangouts and other ships going about their business. Travel between these regions is through a network of jump gates, allowing players to hop from region to region to travel large distances to trade valuable goods or mine rare minerals from asteroids.\n\nRegions are very large, and with powerful scanner equipment installed on your ship, you never know what you might find far from the busy jumpgates. In certain regions travel is very unsafe: pirates are known to hang out near the major gates, and discerning traders are well advised to travel with hired escorts.\nThe Politics Of Sol Trader\nConcept art for base male character\nControl of regions are divided between four main factions. The regions and factions start each game with the same setup, two hundred years before you come on the scene. The history generation will then take these factions and create organisations and individuals within them. Individual actions trigger inter-faction events which cause the relationships between factions to thaw or grow colder, and forms the unique universe which you are then born into.\nThe Old Federation: The remnants of Earth's original government control the four inner planets, with Earth as the capital. Ancient and proud, they see themselves as the true guardians of human culture and civilisation.\nThe New Order: The Order rebelled from Federation control about 300 years ago due to the imposition of heavy taxes and a catastrophic breakdown in relations. Despite enormous losses in the Century War with the Federation, they remain powerful and a force to be reckoned with. They control the most important moons of Jupiter, with their influence stretching as far as the Uranus Rim - beyond this is uncontrolled and largely unexplored space.\nThe Galileo Alliance: Disillusioned with the broken promises and the gradual dilution of the once strong ideology of the New Order, the Alliance seeks to form a new egalitarian partnership of equal governments. Many of the moons of Saturn have joined the Alliance, but due to the lack of a strong navy their power to exert control on their territory is limited.\nThe Pirate Belt: The long asteroid belt which forms the gateway between the New Order and the Old Federation was long deserted and ignored by both governments after the bitter and inconclusive war resulting from the New Order's indepedence. Between the rocks, gangs of those rejected by both of the great empires, began to gather, and today exert much power and influence. It's hard to escape their influence should you wish to travel from the inner to the outer system...\nShip Equipment\nYou'll be able to purchase a variety of ships in Sol Trader, and be able to own more than one at once.\nShips can be fitted with a variety of equipment, depending on what their hulls are designed to take. Weapons will come in all shapes and sizes, from standard bolters firing depleted uranium shells, to tracking missiles, to powerful mining and attack lasers. You can defend your ship with power hungry shields or by buying special armour coated hulls. Ship scanners of various types are available, with different sensitivities to smaller and larger objects.Equipment and engines must be powered, and a player is free to choose the types of reactors used to provide power to the ship: choose from a range of types, from responsive yet inefficient fission engines to solar panels which provide a weaker steadier power supply.\nYou can purchase a regulator which allows you to adjust power to certain ship components whilst in flight. This allows you to boost shields to ram enemy ships, weapons and maneuvering thrusters in a dogfight, and redline your main engines when it's time to leave...\nDifferent components receive damage and can be repaired by mechanics that you will meet on your journey. Making friends with a good mechanic will make all the difference when you return half-alive from the Callisto salt run.\nCan I Mod Sol Trader?\nYes, the game will be fully moddable. It's already possible mod all the art and the solar system layout, rewrite the whole AI and retune all the ships and components.\nWhy A Kickstarter Now?\nThe game is currently playable and in late Alpha. Whilst it has come a long way, there are several large pieces I need to finish:\nMissions\nAI conversations and interaction\nAsteroids and Mining\nOnline scoreboards: compare your story and achievements with others! \nMore weaponry and equipment for ships\nSound effects\nThe ability to buy new ships\nEconomy balance and expansion Inter-faction politics\nThis is the game I always wanted to make. I've been working on various versions of it since childhood, musing, honing and perfecting the ideas, drawing influences from other games that I've played along the way.\nI've been live streaming development on Twitch: here's a recent video from just before Christmas:\nI built lots of momentum in 2014. I was able to manage my finances to the point where I was able to spend a day a week focused on the game for six months. I used part time contracting to fund myself last year, but I want to commit as much time as possible from the remainder of the project to focus on it and give it the dedicated attention a project this rich and deep deserves, and keep up the excitement and momentum.\nThat's where this campaign comes in and your pledge makes this possible. Will you support me and join the adventure?\nWhy Should You Back Me?\nI have lots of experience working on games and large software projects:\nI worked for four years as a professional AAA games developer. I worked at Elixir Studios at the start of my career, working on Republic: the Revolution, Evil Genius and other unannounced titles.\nI've always loved making indie games. I sold my first indie title 25 years ago: I wrote a version of \"tag\" and sold it to my school friends for \u00a30.10 at the age of 11. I care deeply about seeing this project through.\nI built a software service company from scratch to 12 people, creating and shipping lots of software projects for customers.\nI started programming 30 years ago and have been programming professionally for 16 years. I now train other programmers and blog and speak at conferences regularly on programming and team dynamics.\nI've already built much of the game, as you can see in the video. Apart from paying for some artwork, I've already got three years of part-time development done entirely on my own.\nHow Will You Spend The Money?\nTaking into account UK Corporation Tax and VAT on any purchases and the extra artwork that I need to finish the game, here's a provisional breakdown of where the money will go:\n\nI'll update this as we get closer to stretch goals, as they will require additional costs.\n\nPress coverage\n\nDangerous dealings - Rock Paper Shotgun\nSpace Game Junkie podcast - 80 minutes of game tour and Q&A.\nIndie gamers\nPower Gamer\nLady WASD\nCliqist\nStretch goals\n\u00a330,000: LINUX SUPPORT\nThe game is currently building and working for Windows and Mac. The libraries I'm using are all available for Linux, too: it just needs some time invested in getting it working. I'd love to be able to support Linux: help make it happen!\n\u00a340,000: COMPOSER\nWe'd love to get a great composer involved in the project. We have an idea of who we'd like to approach, and if we come close to hitting the stretch goal we'll reveal more details about this.\n\u00a360,000: ALIENS\nThe technology discovered in 2060 which led to jump gates didn't just usher in a new age of fast travel through the solar system: it unknowningly opened up a pathway for those far distant to learn and interact with our solar system. Most of humankind has no idea that there are those who have known about our fledgling race for three centuries, and are biding their time...\nWant to interact with alien cultures and technology? I have plenty of ideas to bring more richness to the world in the form of secret Alien subterfuge - this goal gives me enough time and money for artwork to make it happen!\n\u00a3100,000: MULTIPLAYER\nMultiplayer is the holy grail of a game like Sol Trader, although I never want it to compromise the single player game, so it would need carefully thinking about. It would be amazing to have friends alongside you interacting with the world and working together to complete missions and help each other. Or you could compete to see who can amass the most pirate kills, or the most credits! It's technically challenging but perfectly achievable given the time to make it work.\n\u00a3250,000: GROUND MODE\nIf there's enough demand, I'd *love* to allow players to walk around planet surfaces, cities, their own ships, and the interiors of space ports and space stations. Actually meet other characters in seedy bars, overhear conversations and learn information. Walk on the surface of the planets and moons, explore caves and find rare artifacts. Board huge drifting space wrecks and salvage valuable cargo. This is a large piece of work and will require a lot of artist time, which makes it a big stretch goal. It's definitely achievable though.\nMore information\nThere's more about the game at our website and social media accounts - check them out!\nhttp://soltrader.net\nhttp://twitter.com/soltdr\nhttp://facebook.com/soltrader\n\nThanks for considering me!

Also I want to thank the games press for giving this little project some coverage- especially Rock Paper Shotgun and Kotaku.\nA mock-up image of 'night mode', one of the stretch goals now reached!\nConcrete Jungle is a new take on the city building game that swaps micro management for deck-building and extra servings of strategy.\nThe game combines the simple but satisfying mechanics of a tabletop deck-building game,\nthe intricacy and accessibility of an indie title,\nand the variety and depth of a collectible card game.\nTopped with the isometric stylings of classic 90s management sims!\nYou use cards in your deck to place buildings, clearing city blocks to give yourself more room to build. As your city grows you'll get opportunities to hone your deck, but the game also gets harder.\nIt started off years ago as a sequel to my indie game 'MegaCity' from 2011. Although still a successor to that game, it's come so far I thought it had earned a shiny new name.\nThe game is being developed for PC but I'll also be porting to Mac. Ports to Linux, Android and iOS may also be possible further down the road.\n*sound of traffic*\nYou have a deck of selected cards which you can use to place buildings. Each building will affect it's surroundings in different ways. The aim of the game is to clear city blocks by gathering the required number of points from your residents, giving more room to build.\nAs the city grows, you choose bigger and better new buildings to add to your deck!\nAs you get opportunities to hone and refine your deck, residents will demand more from you, making the game harder. You'll find yourself inadvertently creating zoning puzzles- playing against your own past planning decisions!\nAlso in the works is a competitive game mode where 2 rival city planners face off in a city planning dual. Incredibly tactical- your building placements and deck building skills matter more than ever here.\nIs their new apartment building raking in tonnes of points? Place a landfill next to it to screw them over! It's like building a city through playing chess- if chess was much, much meaner. There will also be AI to play against in this mode.\nThe game does not feature free-to-play mechanics or micro-transactions. There will be plenty of unlocks, but you'll have to earn them!\nPlanned features:\nOver 150+ buildings! 50 more in a free update after release.\nSingle player story mode with 6 unlockable characters! 2 more in a free update after release.\nVoice acting for the characters!\nOnline High Scores system!\nCompetitive mode with challenging AI!\nLocal competitive/co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players (1 vs 1, 2 vs 2)\nSoundtrack featuring DP Kaufman, Mokhov & Xerxes and original music.\nA night time mode- see your city lights at night! (Will also be in the free update).\n\nCombo buildings together for maximum points.\nBuild your deck as you build the city!\nAlthough I have a functioning build I'm really happy with, it only represents the beginning of what I want this project to be.\nAs the sole developer and artist, I can operate for next-to-nothing (but not quite nothing). The kickstarter funding will secure me enough time to implement the features listed above, as well as provide enough money to license the ideal soundtrack for the project.\nI've organized the project for minimal risk- all the game mechanics are in place- what's left to do is add content and balance. Both of which are time consuming, but also in the grand scheme of things, relatively straightforward. That's not to under-estimate the challenges up ahead, but I'm fully confident I can deliver on this!\nEarly access funding is/was another potential route. However, as a gamer myself, I'm a little wary of this model. I feel it diminishes the release of the actual finished game- it's hard to keep track of a game when there's more than 1 release date!\nOffering a preview build in a kickstarter campaign is a great comprise as it's limited enough to not deaden the final product, while giving you guys something cool to play in return for supporting the project.\nThe preview version of the game is already completely playable on PC and features 44 buildings. It's what I'm using to demo the game. You can get it right away after the kickstarter ends, along with a copy of the full game on release if you pledge just \u00a35 or more!\nThe other backer rewards are filled with ways you can actually be in the game! There will be a large pool of random building names which will be assigned to every building each game. To add your name to the building databases, choose one of the pledges detailed on the right.\nThere are different databases. One is the citizen database, this will just use your or a name and apply it to a residence. Eg. 'Frank Callahan's House'\nAn example of your building names in the game!\nThe next is the city building database, which is unique for every other building. I'll sort out your submitted name into the correct category. For example, you could submit 'Frank's Firework Factory' and I'll make sure it only applies to factories. Or have a hospital named after you, eg 'Franklin's Hospital for Severe Burns'.\nThere is also a neighborhood database. In the game this applies to a group of buildings- real life examples would be the neighborhoods of SoHo or Tribeca in New York. This could be pretty much anything. 'The Firework District'.\nLastly, there's also a database for landmarks, which are top-end buildings. Think of them as statues or monuments. Eg 'The Frank Callahan Memorial'.\nFor the top tier rewards, I will get in touch with you to create your buildings/character!\nI reserve the final say over what makes it in, but if I have a problem with your submission I'll get in contact to request a new one from you or suggest alternatives. I'm going to ask we avoid blatant advertising, submissions of bad taste etc. Names are fine. Puns are encouraged!\nThe campaign has had an incredible response! So much so that we're already funded & greenlit! So what now?\nI asked the backers to vote on how the extra funds should be used (if you're a backer, check update #4), and the favorites were expansion of the game (more buildings and characters) and more visual effects (night mode, weather etc).\nSo I'm going to be putting the extra funding towards those- details further below.\nI've also had a lot of advice relating to stretch goals- adding more content inevitably takes more time. I want to do what I can to meet my original planned release date and get a finished project out there for you. \nSo my plan is to complete the game to the standard above, release it, then use the extra funds to expand it for free. I'm also going to be using some of the money to hire people to help with the workload in the meantime.\nThis is the best of both worlds as you guys will get the game on time, and you'll get the extra content later on for no cost!\nSo this is the content I'm looking at adding after release, for free:\n+50 more buildings! Every time we break a new \u00a3500 barrier from 8k onwards, I'll add another 5! (I'm going to have to cap it at 50 though folks, I'm running out of building ideas!) GOAL REACHED!\n+2 new characters!\n+Night mode! It's a nice visual change, and it just looks cool! It's something I've wanted to include since the start but involves a lot of work as each building will have to have a 'night time look' created for it. I've done a quick mock-up of how I want it to look above. GOAL REACHED!\n +Other VFX: I'm going to look into doing some rain effects, and I'd like to get some people on the streets. The only thing stopping me from promising this right now is I'm not sure how it will impact performance on the engine I'm using. Will do this if possible!\n+Language support: I'm already going to put some of the extra money to making sure the game supports some other languages. Details will be confirmed towards release. French, Spanish & German at the minimum.\n+Expanded soundtrack: As well as the aforementioned licensed tracks, I'll also be adding some original music to the game in the form of a 'main theme'. Guaranteed @ 11k!\n+Voice acting: I think this could be really cool (especially for a tutorial and the story mode). Consider it guaranteed if we pass 12k!\n   Here are the best ways to follow the project (aside from through kickstarter of course):\ncolepowered.com or concrejunglegame.com\nDeveloper's Twitter\nConcrete Jungle Twitter\nFacebook\nIndieDB\nGreenlight Page\nIf you are a member of the press, you can find a presskit here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI want you to be able to back my project with confidence. That's why I've minimized potential risk by holding off on launching this campaign until I had a preview version playable and ready.\n\nI want to give you something to play now that's worth your money in its current state and will only get better towards release. It's not just a promise of a project- there's a lot here to play already.\n\nI've also tried to make the funding goal as reasonable as possible. I'm able do this because I'm the sole developer, and there are very few additional costs- the main one being music licensing.\n\nI've currently got a release penciled in for May 2015. It's possible that the project will be completed before then if everything goes smoothly, but I'm trying to plan for everything. As a backer, you will be notified of any delays or hiccups.\n\nAlong the way I'll be sharing with you as much of the development process as possible.

Make a Map. Find Adventure.\n\"Worldspinner is the online worldbuilding tool that gamers and authors have been waiting for.  It will give your world a solid foundation upon which your own imagination has limitless room to expand.\" - Philip Athans, best-selling author of Annihilation and The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction\nWorldspinner makes it easy to create your own richly detailed fantasy world in minutes, including continents, mountain ranges, cultures, kingdoms, cities, and more. Then, delve as deeply as you like into customizing your world. You can create beautiful maps without spending hours with paint tools, and without needing to be an artist. \nWorldspinner is a tool, not a game. It doesn\u2019t replace your creativity, but multiplies it. It is hosted online, so you don\u2019t need to download anything and it is available anywhere. The technology is almost complete; the maps and screenshots you see below are all real examples from the working system. \n\"Worldspinner is going to be huge for everyone who loves creating fantasy worlds.\" - Wolfgang Baur, Publisher, Kobold Press and author of Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding\nYou can quickly create a world by selecting from a list of themes and letting Worldspinner figure out the details, or you can carefully control the world creation steps yourself. \nCreate the physical world. Every world is approximately the size of the Earth, and has its own topography: continents, islands, mountain ranges, oceans, lakes, and rivers. Geophysical processes are used to model climate and biomes, so forests, deserts, tundras, and other biomes end up where they make sense. \nPopulate your world and watch history unfold. You choose which cultures you want in your world: Celtic, Persian, Dwarf, or a dozen others? If you\u2019re particularly fond of one, you can even order physical coins for it (courtesy of our partners: Fantasy Coins LLC and Conquistador Games). Then watch as a history simulator fills in the backstory of your world, charting the rise and fall of nations, and populating the map with cities. \nCities & Points of Interest. Each city is automatically named based on its culture. You'll never again have to say \u201cthat city to the West\u201d if you aren\u2019t feeling inspired at the moment, or lose track of the name of that little market town that\u2019s on the road to the capital. The world also contains points of interest such as \"dragon's lair\" or \u201cKing Aethelwulf\u2019s Tomb.\u201d You can influence which things show up by choosing the themes you want to highlight in your campaign.  \nExplore your world and make it yours. Worldspinner creates an entire world with incredible detail, and no two are the same. Explore your world to make sure it aligns with your vision and imagination. You can move, delete, rename or create new points of interest and cities. It\u2019s your world, after all, and you have the final say.\n\"Not since the work done by Judges Guild and Harn in the late 1970s has there been such a great product for fantasy mapping. The ability to generate adventure on a strategic scale, as well as populate it with cities, encounters and other adventure material is awesome.\" - Bill Webb, Frog God Games\nOnce you have created your world, you can define the areas you want to print as maps. Maps can be anything from world map down to details of a specific kingdom. Just as with Earth, a single world can fill thousands of maps. \nSizes. Members can print 8.5 x 11\u201d maps for free at home, which is handy when you need one for tonight\u2019s session. But maps are definitely one of those things that get better as they get bigger. So we\u2019ll print and ship maps in three larger sizes:\nStyles. Worldspinner automatically creates high-quality maps in a range of styles to suit your tastes.  Here are a few examples:\nPolitical\nAged parchment\nIllustrated - click for 4000 pixel wide version\n                                 \"An elaborate temple compound, and rumors of a dark plot?  Whatever.  Let's go check out the pirate islands instead!\u201d - Druk Khalborg, 3rd level Rogue\nSound like your players? No problem! In addition to great maps Worldspinner gives you information and hooks to make it easy to come up with adventures on the fly.\nCities full of Plots. Plots help address the question of \"what do we do in tomorrow\u2019s game?\" If you keep your laptop open to Worldspinner during the game, you can click on any city and see a list of potential plot hooks such as \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the mayor\" or \u201cQuest for a lost book.\" Selecting a plot will bring up more information on a possible adventure to be had, anywhere from a few sentences to a page or two.  \nVisit Points of Interest. Delve into your world to find the most interesting places for your players to explore. If you click on a point of interest, such as a fishing or trading port, Worldspinner will provide you with information about that port. For example, the port was part of a Norse nation founded 450 years ago, but was created 715 years ago by the Elves before they left this part of the world. This helps to provide a consistent backstory for the game, should you wish to use it. \nTrack progress with the Notebook. Worldspinner provides a logical place to keep notes on what\u2019s happened at a given place, or what you have planned there in the future. If the players come back to a town they set fire to a couple years ago, the locals are going to remember \u2014 and so will you.\nThis is the coolest thing I've heard about all year.\" - Ian Irvine, author, Three Worlds\nMost of the rewards for this project include multiple parts. Here\u2019s a comparison of the reward levels and a little more information on each part.\nOne Year of Worldspinner Membership - As a Worldspinner member, we will store up to five worlds for you, with all your notes, for one year. You can also print as many letter-sized (8.5 x 11, or A4) maps as you like on your own printer.  Memberships are automatically extended each time you buy a new map.  If you want to keep using Worldspinner a year later without buying more maps, that's fine... another year of membership is expected to be $9.95.\nAlpha Access to the Website - As a reward for early backers, some of the rewards grant access to the Worldspinner website before it is opened to the public. During this time, you'll be able to generate your world, order your map(s), and help the Worldspinner team prioritize future features.\nHero of Kickstarter - Great heroes leave their marks on history. When one arises, they can break a century-old stalemate to expand a kingdom\u2019s boundaries. Maps are dotted with cities, rivers, even nations named after these great leaders. As a backer at the $30 level or beyond, you can elevate your favorite RPG character to a Hero of Kickstarter. Such Heroes have a chance of appearing in the worlds that others spin, and leaving their names* across the maps.\nLegendary Heroes* - The mightiest heroes become figures of legend. Our artist will create a bust of your hero based on your description, and we (in collaboration with our partner Conquistador Games) will strike coins in their honor bearing their likeness and name*.

For cultures: you pick a historical or (non-copyrighted) fantasy culture, and we\u2019ll implement it \u2014 including the history simulator and name linguistics.  You and everyone else can use these on your maps, and you get major bragging rights!\n* Personalized rewards are subject to our approval; we may reject and refund for any cause at our sole discretion.\n\"Creating a fantasy world is an act of the imagination...

The Computer is your friend!\nImagine a world designed by Kafka, Stalin, Orwell, Huxley, Sartre and the Marx Brothers. \n* Listen to designer James Wallis discuss the new Paranoia Here! *\n* Paranoia Playtest Session Here! *\nParanoia is a roleplaying game set in a darkly humorous future. In Paranoia, a well-meaning but deranged computer desperately protects the citizens of an underground warren from all sorts of real and imagined enemies. You play one of The Computer's elite agents. Your job is to search out and destroy the enemies of The Computer. Your worst fear is that The Computer will discover that you are one of these enemies. \nParanoia: A light-hearted game of terror, death, bureaucracies, mad scientists, mutants, dangerous weapons, and insane robots, which encourages players to lie, to cheat, and backstab each other at every turn. \nIs that fun? Trust us.\nParanoia Rebooted\nThe all new, rebooted Paranoia box set has been designed to be played almost immediately from opening the box. It offers fast, manic game play through the use of streamlined mechanics and substantial components including Computer Dice and high quality cards to represent equipment, mutations and much more!\nParanoia now offers a thoroughly modern roleplaying experience, allowing you to get into the game even quicker:\nStreamlined, simple rules with new card play that allows maximum carnage while allowing you to concentrate on the action (and survival).\nA 21st Century approach to Alpha Complex - Terrorists have taken their proper place as the greatest threat now but Commies are still lurking in the background, and the Computer's benevolent surveillance capabilities are as all-encompassing as they were envisioned in 1984 (Paranoia's original release!).\nThe principal designer is James Wallis (Baron Munchausen, Once Upon a Time), the most celebrated designer of story-telling games (the Computer says so), assisted by original designers Eric Goldberg and Greg Costikyan, and Violet-level High Programmers-to-be, Grant Howitt and Paul Dean.\nMinimum effort, maximum fun - with the simplified game system and card decks, you will be able to get into Paranoia within 10-15 minutes.\nAnd shipping is free, worldwide!\nParanoia is better. Other games are not better. Back Paranoia.\nThe original Paranoia was a product of, well, Cold War paranoia. Today, we have no need to be paranoid! The NSA and GCHQ work tirelessly to ensure that we are all safe and secure against the pervasive threat of Commie mutant trai.... Uh, I mean, evil, crazed terrorists. \nEvery good citizen knows that you have nothing to fear, if you are a law-abiding citizen! Only evil-doers will be seized without trial, waterboarded, and force-fed.\nRest assured that real-world Troubleshooters are toiling unceasingly even as you scan these words to ensure that the traitor Snowden receives his just desserts for unnecessarily evoking Paranoia in a world that needs it not at all!\nUniversal surveillance is almost here! Tens of thousands of cameras have already been installed in cities worldwide to ensure the continuous monitoring of the activity of all citizens, ensuring our safety from malefactors. Hard AI is on the horizon, and its creation will be an inevitable boon for all of humanity! The Computer is almost here! Utopia is just over the next horizon!\nThe real world is rushing to meet the promise of Paranoia.\nParanoia is subversive and traitorous. It slyly uses humour to induce treasonous thoughts, inculcating an un-mutual sense that authority is not always correct, and that submissive obedience to authority is questionable. Such questions must not be asked!\nJoin today \u2013 your clones will thank you. And remember...\nStay alert! Trust nobody! And keep your untested prototype weapon handy! \nParanoia is one of the RPG 'greats' with players having been blasted, vaporised, and otherwise terminated for the past 30 years. It demonstrated that adult/sophisticated/black humour themes could be brought to roleplaying games, it won the Best Role-Playing Game of the Year award in 1984, and was inducted into the Origins Awards Hall of Fame - one of only ten RPGs to ever gain that distinction.\nAnd now, it is time for a brand rebooted edition, including all your old favourites but with bang up to date game play. \nBox Contents\nDeveloped by World Famous Games Designer James Wallis and his minions, the new Paranoia arrives in a swanky box set, piled high with goodies. All Paranoia books are printed in high quality full colour, and you will receive the following in your box set with a Green-level pledge.\nA brand new Player's Guide safely separates Red clearance rules from those things players are not meant to know.\nThe Games Master's Guide contains all the diabolical tricks, traps and general nastiness needed to run Paranoia successfully. \nThe Missions Book features several brand new scenarios to get you started as Troubleshooters in Alpha Complex.\n100 full colour cards covering everything you need to play from character creation and mutant powers to combat and the latest equipment from R&D. \nThe special Computer Dice, a six-sider with the symbol of the Computer to let you know when things really have gone pear-shaped...\nSix wipe-clean (allowing you to wipe away pen marks - or Troubleshooter's blood, as the case may be) Character Sheets, so you will never have to use a ragged print out ever again! \nTruly the Computer has rewarded its most loyal servants. \nAll of this is wrapped in a one-off Ultraviolet level box set - this is available to Kickstarter backers only. When the retail release comes about in 2015, it will come in a standard Red level set. \nThis is in addition, of course, to the stretch goals we hope to unlock...\nPledge Levels\nThere are several pledge levels with which you can support the new Paranoia. The Computer, of course, is not gauging your commitment and loyalty by the pledge level you choose.\nStretch Goals\nThe planned Paranoia box set is perfect. The Computer says it is perfect. With stretch goals, it will be even more perfect.\nCapitalist Consumption\nThe Paranoia box set contains everything you need to live, thrive and survive in Alpha Complex. The Paranoia box set is perfect. You can make it even more perfect by adding extra Computer-approved items.\nThe following may be added to the Paranoia goodies you receive simply by adding the appropriate amount to your pledge, and we hope to add more choices throughout the Kickstarter process.

They include 'Supermarionation' puppet series like: Supercar, Fireball XL5, Stingray, Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet, Joe 90 and The Secret Service. Live action shows like Space: 1999, UFO, and Space Precinct. Carrying on with his incredible creative ethos, we want to bring the next Gerry Anderson project to the small screen...\nLet's Make 'Firestorm' in Ultramarionation!\nThis project's aim is to raise enough funding to make the necessary models, sets, and puppets, and to pay for the production of a minisode of Firestorm  - in all its Ultramarionation glory!\nAs part of development we put together this brief puppet POV teaser trailer, which is just a hint of things to come...\nFirestorm was originally conceived and developed by Gerry Anderson in 2001 under the title 'Storm Force'. The series was eventually bought by a Japanese production company and developed as an anime series. By the time it reached the screen it was quite different to the original series Gerry Anderson had envisaged, and we want to go back to those original concepts and develop them as a true Gerry Anderson production.\nFirestorm will see a return to several elements that we think are essential for a real Gerry Anderson project:\nPractical effects - yep, that's REAL explosions\nPhysical sets\nBeautifully detailed miniatures\nand yes... puppets!\nHarking back to the wonderful world of Thunderbirds, we're calling this updated combination of elements: Ultramarionation.\nBASE & STRETCH GOALS\nOur base-level goal for this project is for us to produce a minisode of Firestorm - to introduce you to some of the characters, and the story and to show potential distributors and investors what the show will look like. Beyond that we hope to make a pilot episode, or even a full feature-length pilot if we manage to reach one of our top stretch goals.\nThe equipment and personnel carrier Tornado delivers its cargo\nOur milestone funding levels are to produce:\n1) The Minisode - a 5-8 minute minisode introducing some of the characters and storyline\n2) The Pilot Episode - A full 22 minute pilot episode setting the scene for the rest of the series.\n3) The Feature Pilot - A 45 minute pilot episode where we can get to know the characters, expand on the background and story of the Firestorm universe and show off some incredible effects and fantastic miniatures!\nRather than jumping directly from one stage to another our stretch goals will allow us to add new scenes and characters - so every penny really does count for this campaign, and will be used to make an even better episode.\nThe Story\nBy the end of the 22nd century mankind has pulled itself up by its bootstraps. The wars and political disputes that were so common throughout the 21st century are long behind us, and man has finally taken responsibility for his own actions. The Earth in 2200 is very different from the one we worried about in 2014 - environmental, social and humanitarian crises are a thing of the past, and things have been that way for nearly 50 years. But in 2202 a new threat emerges.\nTerrorist activity surfaces on several continents. At first the world governments deal with them quietly, without any real public awareness but the activity becomes better and better co-ordinated and more widespread. Soon the Continental senates decide to take action, and they invest vast amounts of resources into forming Storm Force - an organisation designed specifically to investigate and neutralise this new threat.\nSupplied with the most advanced technology available Storm Force begin operation Firestorm to bring down the terrorist group known as Black Orchid. But as the 9th division of Storm Force (SF9) begin to make progress, they discover that Black Orchid is only a very small part of the picture, and that they themselves have had to make an impossible choice...\nThe start of another mission for SF9's Tornado as it launches from Ocean Storm\nFilmed in Ultramarionation\nUltramarionation is a brand new method of filming based on the foundations of the Supermarionation techniques developed by Gerry Anderson and his pioneering teams through the 1960s, used in series like Supercar, Fireball XL5, Stingray, Captain Scarlet, and the iconic Thunderbirds.\nWith Ultramarionation we are taking the very best aspects of those incredible shows - the physical sets, marionettes, breath-taking model work, and practical effects and tying them together with modern film-making technologies.\nThe Puppets\nThe characters from the classic 1965 Thunderbirds have become iconic, and these new puppet characters are a true homage to the beloved Gerry Anderson style. They will be built in the originally engineered proportions that were seen in productions like Fireball XL5, Stingray and Thunderbirds, but with a new degree of complexity and technical ingenuity that was unavailable in the 1960s.\nThree of our heroes (L to R): Sam Scott, Nagisa Kisaragi, and Drew McAllister\nTo undertake this important part of the project we are working with Mackinnon and Saunders - a company known throughout the world for their stunning puppet work.\nAn early sculpt of one of the heroes - Sam Scott\nThe Miniatures\nAs part of the return to physical and tangible film-making, we'll be producing incredibly detailed miniature vehicles which will populate the Firestorm universe. You'll also see a return to the functional complexity which is such an enjoyable part of shows like Thunderbirds.\nAn early maquette of Ocean Storm by Bill Pearson\nEffects\nExplosions are cool. Really cool! There's something magical and fascinating about watching something being blown to smithereens - and knowing that the set was actually built for that purpose. So Firestorm will see a return to the practical effects of those pioneering days in the 1960s and 70s - originally created by Derek Meddings, Brian Johnson and their talented teams.\nBoom! There's nothing quite like a real explosion!\nThe Production Team\nA team with a passion for all things Gerry Anderson\nWe're very lucky to have some amazing people already involved in this project, and this is just for the initial phases. We're hoping that even more people will join us as we move into the next stages of production.\nThe crew selection for Firestorm is based primarily on finding technical and artistic crew who worked closely with Gerry Anderson on past productions, or those who have a true love and understanding of those aspects that made his productions so special. A high degree of devotion to the legacy is a must for creative staff on this project.   \nSteve Begg - Effects Supervisor\nBAFTA award winning effects supervisor best known for his recent work on the Bond films (Skyfall, Casino Royale, Goldeneye), Wolfman, Tomb Raider, Batman, Batman Begins, and Aliens but also a long-time Gerry Anderson regular - working on everything from Terrahawks to Space Precinct and New Captain Scarlet.\nSteve is the original concept artist and designer of almost all the craft in Firestorm, and we're thrilled to have him on board.\nEric Chu - Concept and Design\nBest known for his beautiful redesigns of the spacecraft and Cylons in the new Battlestar Galactica, Eric has become part of the Gerry Anderson fold with his excellent poster designs, digital paintings and concept work for new Gerry Anderson productions.\nMike Tucker - Model Effects\nBAFTA award winning, and Emmy nominated model effects artist, best known for his work on Doctor Who and Red Dwarf.

He went into effects because of his love of Gerry Anderson shows, and was model designer on Gerry's 1994 series Space Precinct.\nMackinnon & Saunders - Puppets\nWith over 30 years of experience Ian Mackinnon and Peter Saunders\u2019 talented team have had the privilege of bringing some of the world\u2019s best known animated characters to life - from Bob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fifi and the Flowertots, to Tim Burton\u2019s Corpse Bride and Wes Anderson\u2019s Fantastic Mr Fox. \nTheir Gerry Anderson connection runs deep - Ian Mackinnon had his very first paid job working on the 1980s pilot show Space Police, and the company was also responsible for the puppets in Gerry Anderson's Lavender Castle.\nFrom concept maquettes, mould making and armatures to costume, hair and paint, their team will always go the extra mile to ensure the characters that are produced create the maximum impact on screen.\nKen Palkow - Puppet handheld props\nKen is an incredibly well-known and respected Hollywood prop maker - known for making weaponry and handhelds for movies like X-Men: Days of Future Past, RoboCop, Elysium, Man of Steel, Star Trek Into Darkness and Oblivion. Ken's attention to detail and artistry is second-to-none.\nMark Woollard - Director\nMark worked with Gerry from the early 1980s right up until his last project (New Captain Scarlet - 2005) and beyond - working with Gerry to develop his new ideas until Gerry's Alzheimer's Disease stopped him working in 2011. Mark's Anderson credits include Terrahawks, Dick Spanner, Space Police, Space Precinct, and New Captain Scarlet. Mark is also an experienced animation director - recently directing Little Charlie Bear for Annix Studios.\nDavid Elliott - Consultant Director\nDavid Elliott reads an early minisode script and inspects some concept art\nOne of the original members of the AP Films team - best known for directing on Thunderbirds - David Elliott returns as a consultant on the Firestorm project.\nSteve Kyte - Character design\nSteve's name is inextricably linked with Gerry Anderson productions, and in particular Firestorm. His work includes strips and covers for Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet and many more. He was also the original character designer selected by Gerry Anderson in 2001, and we're thrilled to have Steve back on board for the new series.\nMichael Okuda - Visual Consultant\nBest known for his contributions to the Star Trek Universe (The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager) - Michael is the man behind LCARS - the famous fictional computer system used throughout the Enterprise D and other Starships.\nAndy Rolfe and Peter Seymour-Howell - Set construction\nAndy is a lifelong fan of Gerry Anderson's work, and worked with Gerry on several projects. Fans may have seen his work on Captain Scarlet: SIG, and the recent documentary - Filmed in Supermarionation - where Andy was responsible for some incredible recreations of the original Supermarionation sets. He has also built incredibly detailed 1/3 scale props and sets for films like Wolfman, Casino Royale, and Skyfall.\nPeter has over 20 years experience building highly detailed models/sets and SFX for TV and film including many blockbusters such as Bond, Event Horizon, Harry Potter and Wolfman. He has experience working in various roles from senior model maker/technician/engineer to buyer to Art Director. Peter remembers enjoying the original Gerry Anderson shows as a child and is looking forward to being involved in bringing that magic back through Firestorm!\nJustin T. Lee - Post production (and teaser production)\nJustin led the unit that produced the fantastic Firestorm Teaser Trailer, and his work will be familiar to anyone who has seen the beautiful graphics features in Filmed in Supermarionation. He's a post-production genius, and will be leading post-production work on the minisode.\nPeter Greenwood - 2nd Unit/Additional Voices\nPeter is another lifelong Anderson fan, As a voice artist he headlined the Thunderbirds radio campaign in Australia in the 1990's previous to that he worked for Disney on \"The Rescuers Down Under\" and recently \"The Pirates Of The Caribbean\", as well as voicing a number of the key monsters for \"Power Rangers\" and \"Big Bad Beattleborgs\".\nPeter was also the driving force behind taking Firestorm to Kickstarter in the first place. So, thanks for that, Peter!\nDave Low - Design & Brand\nDave has been tied to all our recent projects - from the 2013 Gerry Anderson rebrand (and its iconic A logo) to Gemini Force One, and beyond. He's a massive Space: 1999 fan, and works closely with me to get the right look and feel for our projects.\nAnd of course, yours truly - you can read a bit more about me in the creator bio section.\nThe Voice Cast\nNick Tate - Best known as Alan Carter - hero Eagle pilot from Space: 1999 and son of John Tate who voiced multiple characters on Thunderbirds. Nick is making his return to a Gerry Anderson production for the first time since 1976.\nNicholas Briggs - Nicholas will be familiar to many as the voice of the Daleks and Cybermen in Doctor Who. A lifelong Gerry Anderson fan, Nicholas joins us as the voice of Ocean Storm's AI system \"REMUS\".\nShane Rimmer (Scott Tracy - Thunderbirds) and Matt Zimmerman (Alan Tracy - Thunderbirds) have also confirmed they will be making cameo appearances in the pilot episode!\nShane Rimmer\nMatt Zimmerman\nAll voice cast announced so far have committed to Firestorm, but of course their appearance in the pilot is subject to their availability and other factors beyond our control.\nMore of our voice cast will be announced during the campaign.\nNew Firestorm vs Original Firestorm\nThe Firestorm series produced in Japan in 2003 was heavily adapted for the Japanese market, and produced in anime - a style which limited its potential success in the Western market, and was of course voiced in Japanese.\nThen and now: Sam Scott in the 2003 anime series (left) and in puppet form now (2014)\nFor the new Firestorm project, we are reverting back to Gerry Anderson's original scripts, series bible and story outlines. We're also using a team that Gerry would have used himself, and using techniques that are entwined with the Gerry Anderson universe. We couldn't make it much more of a genuine Gerry Anderson production without the great man himself being at the helm.\nWe're very lucky to have the blessing of those involved with the original production in Japan, as well as being rights owners of the new series. That means nobody else can interfere with what we're doing. Like Gemini Force One - we're able to keep this project pure and true to Gerry's original vision.\nRewards\nOur rewards will be produced and despatched in 2015. We're aware that some of you may wish to purchase additional items as gifts for friends, or as extra items for yourself. To help with this - at the end of the campaign - backers will receive an email from BackerKit. BackerKit allows you manage your backer rewards, and allows backers to add individual items to rewards packages. \nIf you have any questions about the rewards, additions, or changes, then please message us during the campaign. We're here and we're listening!\nA selection of the rewards available for our backers. Designs are not final and are subject to change before release.\nHow will the money be used?\nAnderson Entertainment have already spent a considerable amount on development to get Firestorm to its current state. This means that we are ready to enter pre-production immediately at the end of the funding period. The graphic below shows estimates of how funds raised during the campaign will be spent, but whatever happens, we will use the funds to make the best possible pilot episode we can.\nEstimated spend breakdown\nWhere do we go from here?\nFrom experience (with last year's Gemini Force One project) we know how powerful an influence a really successful Kickstarter project can be for a Gerry Anderson idea!\nAfter Gemini Force One was successfully funded, we were able to sign a global 3-book publishing deal with Orion - and that was due almost entirely to the incredible support the project received from Gerry Anderson fans all over the world. Firestorm will be no different.\nIt's our hope that through sheer weight of numbers and a public show of support we will be able to show financiers, distributors and TV execs all over the world that a new Gerry Anderson TV show will be overwhelmingly popular - and will entertain new generations of viewers for decades to come.\nOnce the campaign has ended you can keep up to date with progress via the backers-only production blog, the Firestorm page on the Gerry Anderson website, and Jamie Anderson's blog.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA few members of our crew are very busy, and so their availability may be an issue depending on timing. They've all very kindly agreed to do their best to fit this project in if they are busy on other projects, but if they are unavailable they will be replaced by another, equally skilled and talented industry professional. As such our cast and crew are correct at the time of publication but may change.\n\nAs with all projects of this nature, it is possible that there could be some delays during pre-production, which could have an impact on delivery times for the minisode and associated rewards. We'll keep all of our backers up to date, and do everything we can to minimise delays. However we're confident in our abilities to deliver after the successful funding and completion of our 2013 Kickstarter project Gemini Force One.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 376, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1717674777/gerry-andersons-firestorm-filmed-in-ultramarionati", "project_name": "Gerry Anderson's Firestorm - Filmed in Ultramarionation"}}, {"backer": "Scurra", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THANK YOU TO ALL OUR BEDLAM BACKERS!!

Dozer - Stretch Goal\nUpdate #30 BEDLAM Boss Battle - Stretch Goal\nBEDLAM is a strategic single-player roguelike turn-based role-playing game, created for the PC and Mac utilizing 'The Banner Saga' engine.\nThe player is cast as the mysterious Mechanic, the last known member of a once-thriving guild of brilliant inventors, intrepid travelers and operators of the rolling fortresses called Dozers.\nAs the Mechanic, you are in charge of commanding your crew in battles, managing your resources, improving your Dozer, interacting with various characters, and protecting your passengers while navigating through the post-apocalyptic wasteland known as Bedlam.\nThink you have what it takes? Then grab the controls, equip your Dozer, load your passengers, assemble your diverse battle-ready crew and prepare for your journey to a new destination on the far edge of Bedlam!\nRemember \u2013 One chance and one crew to make it through!\nOur unique blitz battle system! Turn-based combat with swift play, over-the-top animations, action point based movement and attack system, environments and battles that gradually affect your team, crew-buffing Dozer upgrades, and tide-changing Dozer weapons!\nBattlefield Equalizers that affect overall movement and attack strategy.\nRandomly generated world! Unpredictable environments!\nRoguelike influences and RPG features, including randomly generated encounters and discoveries, meaningful permadeath, three different supplies to manage, crew veteran rankings and incredible replay value.\nDozers, the gargantuan rolling fortresses covered in armor and weapons to protect passengers and crew during the journey through Bedlam.\nFour class-based crew member types: Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle and Melee all with their own strengths, weaknesses, movement and attack ranges.\nFour unique enemy factions: Marauders, Mutants, Cyborgs and the A.I. - all with their own appearances and behaviors.\nEvolving Crew -- battle survivors will evolve into Elite and Veteran units!\n\u201cDouble-Down\u201d (a New game+): Travel back through Bedlam for the opportunity to defeat merciless overlord King Viscera and his minions for untold riches... or the sacrifice of everything!\nYour goal is to travel from the futuristic metropolis of Bysantine through the chaotic realm of Bedlam to reach the rumored utopia of Aztec City with as many of your passengers and crew intact as possible.\nYou will constantly consume supplies as you travel across Bedlam. Meat, Metal and Crude are what you will need to keep your passengers fed, your Dozer repaired and your engines running. These critical resources can be collected through random events, salvaged from defeated enemies, or received after completing quests or prevailing in battles.\nBut keep in mind that all territories, Points of Interest, NPCs and events are randomly generated at the start of each new game, encouraging multiple playthroughs for a fresh experience each time! We want to focus on the fun of finding something different in every game. The unpredictability of Bedlam is both its biggest challenge and its greatest appeal!\nIf you successfully navigate through Bedlam, you will be given an option to \"Double-Down\". This is the BEDLAM version of a New Game+ (unlockable video game mode), offering a chance to transport your crew and Dozer (with all upgrades and weapons) back across Bedlam for subsequent journeys - but remember, it's double-or-nothing!\nUpdate #10 goes into detail about the gameflow of BEDLAM!\nCheck out these jaw-dropping, ear-melting BEDLAM tunes composed by none other than Kevin Riepl (GEARS OF WAR)!\n* Hit play and continue reading to get the whole BEDLAM experience!\n\"Drifters\" by Kevin Riepl\n \"Marauders!\" by Kevin Riepl\nOur battle system is called blitz because the battles are swift, aggressive and intense \u2013 it\u2019s an all-out attack from the very beginning! Opposition beware!\nThe battles in BEDLAM will offer plenty of depth and variety! A battlefield is similar to a chessboard, with an isometric view and each opposing side taking turns. Battlefields can be a variety of sizes and many special battles will take place on larger or irregular-sized boards. Certain battlefields will also feature protective cover, making every battle different!\nDuring a turn, each side has two action points to expend. Because there is no forced character turn-order or action order, these action points can be used in many ways. During each turn, you will decide which crew member(s) to move and/or attack, or which Dozer Upgrade or Weapon to use. Each turn gets you closer to ultimately destroying the enemy and overcoming that territory!\nYou also have the option of retreat! It just depends on how much of your crew and resources you are willing to risk versus the possible rewards you could acquire!\nA significant strategic element during combat is the inclusion of battlefield Equalizers! These items and objects are randomly inserted onto battlefields and can take many forms: atomic waste barrels, dead creatures, scrap containers, vendetta contraptions, or even packages of coveted resources! Some Equalizers can be used as temporary cover, but you\u2019ll need to be cautious as they can also be destroyed by incoming weapon fire, resulting in the loss of any valuables they might hold!\nIn order to gather the riches that may result from various Equalizers, you will need to maneuver a crew member to that position -- which means weighing the risk of those rewards against coming under attack from foes. The caveat is that you must collect these bonus items BEFORE each battle ends!\nYOUR BATTLE CREW\nYour Battle Crew is the first and last line of defense against the hostile enemies that roam the wasteland trying to claim territories throughout Bedlam, threatening the progress of your Dozer and the safety of your passengers. Your crew can be deployed in teams of up to six members, including one Elite or Veteran.\nCrew member death is permanent! Those who survive will gain higher levels of experience and status, allowing them to equip deadlier weapons against the ferocious enemies in Bedlam!\nCREW MEMBER CLASSES\nFrontliner (Melee)\nThe Melee class is both the sturdiest and most agile combatant, ready to dash directly into hand-to-hand combat and inflict punishment as well as absorb it. Another strategic use of a Melee combatant is to treat them as a human shield for more vulnerable Rifle crew members.\nTrencher (Shotgun)\nAs the close-combat weapon specialists on the Dozer crew, the Shotgun class is fairly resilient and packs whopping firepower when the enemy is near, but is much less effective at a distance.\nGunslinger (Pistol)\nThe Pistol class is a great balanced soldier with moderate endurance, movement and weapon range. These hand-cannon hotshots are also the only class with run-and-gun ability.\nDeadeye (Rifle)\nThe long-distance engagement expert in your crew, the Rifle class has the lowest health and movement range but also deals the greatest damage at the furthest distance. These sharpshooters are integral to any good battle plan and should be protected!\nELITES\nA variety of Elite characters from various Factions can be discovered and recruited during your travels through Bedlam... or they can be promoted from existing crew members through in-game events.\nOver time, as crew members survive brutal battles and toxic environments, their bodies may show signs of heavy physical damage or radiation effects. These are tracked by meters on each crew member, and when the corresponding levels reach a certain plateau, you will have a chance to convert that crew member to an Elite class as a Cyborg or Mutant!\nCyborgs are considered a \u201cHeavy Weapons\u201d class, which has greater health and inflicts more damage. Mutants are the \u201cMega Melee\u201d class that can deliver a tremendous amount of melee brutality, but also has access to powerful grenades and healing abilities.\nIf you decide not to convert your crew member into a Cyborg or Mutant, they will remain human and have the opportunity to reach the coveted Veteran Status... if they can survive long enough!\nVETERANS\nThese tried-and-true crew members have survived more battles and seen more horrors than they\u2019d care to remember. They have shunned ALL cyborg enhancements or biological improvements and have embraced their own humanity as the strongest weapon in their arsenal. These rare and legendary characters live by their own rules, and can help turn the tide of battle in an instant!\nYou can usually only have ONE Veteran or Elite crew member on the battlefield at any time, so choose your team wisely!\nDOZER UPGRADES\nDozer upgrades are technologies that can be purchased through NPCs, discovered by exploring locations, or acquired after successfully negotiating a hostile situation. You never know what you'll find on any given playthrough!\nDozer Upgrades (like the Dreadhound Kennel above) can be used during battle with major effects, giving your crew members various buffs and powers, calling in reinforcements, or even raising the dead! Possible upgrades and technologies include an Alchemist laboratory, robotic research department, nuclear engines, science facility, cloning vats, agricultural center, meat processing plant and sick bay.\nUpdate #3 has more information about Dozer Upgrades!\nDOZER WEAPONS\nLast but not least are the devastating Dozer weapons that can be discovered during your journey through Bedlam. Only a single weapon can be installed on your Dozer at a time, and each has a specific impact and recharge timer. Spin up the Gatling cannons to deal vicious area-of-effect damage, or trigger a laser strike to blaze a lethal line of light across the battle board! \nDuring your navigation through Bedlam, these primary Dozer weapons can also unlock inaccessible areas if you have the proper tool for the job -- with lasers equipped, you could cut through a crashed spaceship's hull to search for extraterrestrial technologies, while missiles could demolish that landslide blocking your path, revealing a new route through Bedlam.\nWhile forming a battle strategy, you must factor crew member positions, relative health of all friend and foe combatants, control of key battle board areas, crew-impacting Dozer upgrades and, of course, the primary Dozer weapon.\nIf you plan your battles effectively, triumph is assured! On the other hand, a few wrong choices could result in grisly death... and once a crew member falls in combat, they are lost for the remainder of the game (\"permadeath\"). The wasteland is a cruel and unforgiving place!\nSuccessful outcomes in battle earn resources that can be used for barter, upgrades, or Dozer improvements. However, enemy victory can result in game failure \u2014 a Dozer is defeated once its armor is obliterated or when all passengers and crew are eliminated, sending you back to the beginning for a fresh start.\nThe realm of Bedlam is the result of the catastrophic clashes of black science that caused the Barren Age... and the impact of those terrible wars still linger after centuries.\nCivilization survived and ultimately flourished in the spectacular walled metropolis of Bysantine... but as this technological marvel begins to fall victim to overcrowding, class distinction, corporate conflict and organized crime, there is a new hope in the distant utopia of Aztec City!\nYour travels through Bedlam may take you into tachyon mists that can distort time before your very eyes, hallucinogenic squalls that can present literally unreal threats, alternate-dimensional bleeds that can drop legendary parallel-reality champions into battle with (or against) you, or ancient necrotech that can reanimate the skeletal remains of long-fallen warriors... with a vengeance!\nThe unpredictable environment can even affect battles. Because of Bedlam's constantly fluctuating climate, your combatants may have to fight during blinding blizzards of crimson ash, near patches of homicidal vegetation, or in confounding fields of X-ray wavelengths. Or a corrosive enzyme cyclone could suddenly swirl through the middle of an encounter, which may prompt the enemy (or your own crew) to flee or risk molecular degeneration!\nTemporal anomalies, freak storms, bone soldiers and deadly apparitions? It's no exaggeration to say that anything can happen in these bizarre lands -- Bedlam truly earned its namesake!\nRandom Events\nYour path through Bedlam will take you through a series of Faction-controlled territories, and your Dozer traverses each of these areas by navigating and visiting separate Points of Interest.\nArriving at a Point of Interest may lead to a Boomtown -- settlements like Gluttonhold and Trudgefoot dotting the charred domain -- or you could be sent immediately into battle with the dominant Faction of the territory. But it could also initiate a Random Event, delivered to you via NPCs through the Dozer's Communications Window.\nKing Viscera\nThe massive and merciless tormenter who proclaims himself the overlord of Bedlam, King Viscera is known mostly for his fearsome blood-streaked armor and complete lack of compunction.\nThough he rarely handles matters personally, he dispatches his infamous (and particularly vicious) patrols to eliminate his competition, harass the denizens of independent Boomtowns, and generally disrupt any semblance of peace. All the while, he scours the blackened sands of Bedlam for valuable artifacts to help him gain the dominating power he seeks. During your journey through Bedlam, you will become keenly aware of King Viscera's notoriety. And there's a very good chance you will encounter his scouting parties, because despite the expanse of Bedlam, it would be all but impossible to hide your rolling fortress from his attention... and it's just the kind of thing he would desire.\nBut will you also have the opportunity (or misfortune) to actually face him? Even the mighty Dozer may not provide protection if you cross his path or draw his wrath!\nSimply put, we want to be completely in control of both the design and execution of the game! We at Skyshine have all spent years working at large companies, which in turn have large publishers behind them - and it is always the same story. The publisher will flex its muscles and insist the game design bends to 'current trends', while demanding the game ships on their schedule (even when it's not ready) just to meet quarterly numbers. Been there, done that! Now it is our turn!\nBut... we need your help! So we are asking you for your support in raising enough money (or more) to escape the metaphorical shackles and bring to market our vision of BEDLAM!\nKickstarter also empowers us to go directly to you, the gamers who love to play role-playing games, to get your support, input and feedback that would normally be impossible.

However, when you waken you are weak and must lurk in the shadows to avoid a return to your demonic slumber.\nThis is where That Which Sleeps deviates from the typical turn based strategy formula. Rather than directly affecting the world by building or training troops, you use your power to indirectly influence the world utilizing uniquely designed Agents who can infiltrate the nations of the world, terrorize outlying farms, and perform esoteric rituals to create the perfect situation for your return.\nThe player must balance an aggressive approach utilizing his considerable power and eager hordes with the need to remain unknown to the Champions and Heroes of the world. This allows for multiple play styles and various meaningful decision paths - all made more unique and re-playable due to the large cast of available agents and awakened demons aka \"Ancient Evils\". In addition, the world is customized at the beginning of the game as you explicitly lay out how you were sealed away, and what methods you used to manipulate the world in your slumber.\nThe priority of our stretch goals were voted on by the community, and we couldn't be happier with the final ordering of results!\nMinion Art Pack - ACHIEVED - A responsibly rendered minion is a happy minion, and with this art pack we'll be able to create the thematically consistent look for the less celebrated tools of the Old One that they deserve.\nGods and Religion - ACHIEVED - The Gods have returned in all their fractious glory! Cultures can be polytheistic, monotheistic, or shamanistic - and of course none of the religions will be on friendly terms and even inside the Pantheons themselves you're bound to find friction, just the thing that a conniving Old One like yourself can capitalize on. In addition to the Gods themselves as AI entities, you will be able to start a religion yourself and present yourself as a savior to the gullible masses. Cults round out the feature set representing splinter groups that fixate on one particular aspect of their religion and pursuit it all costs.\nReligions will become an integral part of the game, but just like guilds you can set the number and relative importance. Take on a world dominated by a single monotheistic faith or find your agents embroiled in a religious war with several fronts. Rally your strength by recruiting The Apostate, and prepare to confront three new hero types based around the Priest archetype.\nRival Old Ones - ACHIEVED - You think you were the only Ancient Evil set to slumber? Whatever occurrence caused you to rouse from your sleep has brought others to consciousness as well, and you must contend with their motivations. Not to worry, they aren't all bent on world domination like you are - but their oft times ineffable logic may frustrate your ambitions. Work with them if you'd like, or even better position yourself as savior of the world and join the Alliance to stop a great evil. Then you... well... you know what comes afterwards.\nConfigure the amount of Old Ones on a game by game basis to fill the world with foes or have a solemnly terrifying time to yourself. Set up Kingdoms ruled by Mythical Creatures from your age that have remained in the world while you slept and teach them that they have merely been stewards of a world that yours alone. Finally, you can enable randomized events that spawn lesser creatures of ancient power that jealously wish to usurp your throne.\nEndless Simulation - ACHIEVED - Get ready for the long haul. A plethora of engine changes to enhance the simulation aspect of That Which Sleeps. By reducing dependencies on fundamental assumptions of the engine we can make the world and AI more independent, and the benefits of these changes flow down into the modding world.\nWhat does this mean for you? It means a game with less limitations - play an endless world where your rise to power is simply another event. Survive wave after wave of insurrection while you solidify your control and remake the world in your image, or ride the wings of fate on a new dynamic prophecy system that rewards you for obtaining obscure results in the game world.\nProcedural Generation - ACHIEVED - An infinite amount of replay! Genealogical generation of a sprite based map that will itself be used as a basis for a dynamically created scenario. Instead of making decisions \"after the fact\" with our current Scenario Generation, you will observe a world as the cultures start as tribes and push forward into a civilized state. Use your limited power to interfere at key moments and alter the shape of the world and its peoples. Choose to begin your game at any moment in the world's development and then do what you do best.\nThis will give you an infinitely re-playable world with vastly different dynamics in every game. You may find yourself a lost God amongst primitive tribes during an age of colonialism, or you awaken just after your defeat to a world fresh with desire for revenge. Environmental effects will become more powerful as you raise volcanoes to choke the world with ash or flood it from its rivers.\nLife Goes On - Achieved - At least that's what people tell themselves, and with this Asset Pack it becomes easier than ever to determine which pieces of the world are flourishing and need your corrupting presence. Trade routes will now be illustrated by caravans that ply the roads and sea, farmers will tend their fields, and workers will labor on new buildings in capitals - all modeled at the proper resolution to be able to be identified without obscuring other more salient pieces of data. This and a suite of other changes will make the world feel more alive than ever before.\nThe Horrors of War - ACHIEVED - Now that we've drawn the world at peace, let's give it a more appealing aesthetic. Refugees will cry in terror as they emerge from their burning homes, armies will drill beyond city limits, and your Terrorizing Challenges will emerge onto the map before you. In addition, all POIs will gain a graphical indicator of their defenses and you'll see your progress as the walls crumble.\nRitual Impact - ACHIEVED - After laboring for fifty turns to finally be able to raise a fortress into the sky, it can be a little disappointing to only see an icon on the map. We'll be taking some of the most potent Rituals and rendering them the way they deserve - lord over the world in your flying citadel, see the forbidden outlines of The Horror as it draws madness from the populace, or watch the Colossus laboriously pound the walls of your enemies' castles to ruin.\nFor information on our latest Stretch Goals please check out our update.\nFeatures\nCorrupt, conquer, charm, and manipulate - with a fully realized world driven by thematic AIs that follow their own interests you can pursue multiple paths to victory.\nCustomize the world with your choices at the beginning of each scenario, choosing an Ancient Evil and selecting his origins and what dire deeds he has wrought on the world.\nMake difficult choices with limited agents, choosing to send your Prophet to rouse the orc hordes or beset Kings with maddening dreams will greatly change the flow of the game.\nDisrupt the Balance of Power by creating famines in the farmland, stoking the flame of old vendettas, or recruiting pirates to the sea.\nWatch the fame of your Agents rise and heroes will begin to hunt them down. Let them fall as scapegoats and keep your name secret, or imbue them with dark power and take the fight back to the heroes.\nEach action you take leaves clues behind that cunning heroes can decipher, eventually leading them to the truth. Kill or corrupt them before they find a receptive ear at court\nA fully functioning in-game Editor that allows you to create your own scenarios, old ones, heroes, artifacts, and even agents\nLocalization supported for multiple languages and character sets\nThat Which Sleeps is based around configurable Scenarios, each of which is a hand-crafted experience designed to maximize the strategic and thematic potential of the game mechanics.  Populating this world are complex AI entities ranging from heroes who wander the world pursuing their goals (generally being meddlesome) to Kings who must weigh their personal desires against the best interest of the country. \nThe AI is designed in such a way that you will never feel like you are playing against the nations and heroes of the world, instead they often work at cross-purposes.  Leave them alone and they may fight wars, wound one another in duels, and pass discriminatory laws against other cultures.  Give them a little nudge in the right direction, and the fireworks really start to fly.\nPoints of Interest (PoIs)\nThe building blocks of the map are Points of Interest (PoIs), which are highly detailed nodes that serve as cities, villages, ruins, and other more diverse landscapes.  The PoI system allows us to make sure that every point on the map is richly detailed, consisting of cultural and social breakdowns and containing the potential for epic quests and clever stratagems.  You may find yourself burning the farmland of a village, infiltrating the local Mage's Guild, or excavating ancient tombs to find more powerful rituals for your reconquest.\nGuilds, Orders, and Cabals\nWhile Nations remain the primary methods of AI agency we have several institutions that exist outside of national borders and spread their own agendas regardless of nationality.  While many of them are detrimental to your cause as they promote order and development, most are just a short \"change of management\" away from being a useful tool for spreading corruption and chaos.\nThe player takes the role as an Old One - an extremely powerful demon that has been sealed away from the world for generations.  Some of these creatures are unknowable eldritch abominations of mysterious origin and intent, others are men fallen from grace as they ascended to the ranks of true power.  Each fundamentally changes the way the game is played, with ability trees that are devoid of \"fluff\" or redundancy.\nMeet Azlan - the Dreaming God, He Who Lurks, the Disembodied Titan, the Twilight Confessor, the Usurper of Dreams, the King in Gold, the Severed Tendril.  All of these names are associated with abilities and legends inside the world, that the Heroes will pursue and attempt to decipher.  If they learn them all, you will find your ability to battle them greatly reduced as they gear up and prepare to defeat you.  When we say \"The World Has Forgotten Your Name\" we mean it.\nDream Host - Azlan's body was torn asunder in the ancient past, but his spirit ascended to the world of dreams.  He wields the power of this surreal existence to alter reality itself, and as he grows stronger he will eventually bridge the gap between the two remaking the world in his twisted image.\nThe Night Whispers - In the night man drifts into the world that Azlan calls home, and as prisoners they listen to his ravings.  The most defining ability of Azlan comes from this tree, allowing him to tag a certain number of Heroes, Leaders, or other AI entities and over time adjust their personality.  Drive the Pious High Theocrat to abhorrent behavior, or make the brave King of the Cylarians a coward.\nBelial the Deceiver is a coward, a lurking evil that festers in jealousy, greed, and the desires that turn man against his fellows - but their is strength in small things and power to be found in whispered secrets.  With a wide range of Agents to recruit and abilities that augment any play-style you pursue, Belial is the natural choice for a versatile game.\nAbilities\nWill over Fate - Belial sees deep into the pools of time, at first you will be limited to simply perceiving events before they occur but as you waken you will be able to take control of fate and bend it to your will.  Force an earthquake to strike the walls of a besieged city, or turn a stray arrow to a King's throat.\nDwelling in Darkness -  Belial finds his ways into the darkness of all creatures, twisting them to his will. While you stir only carrion feeders and other beasts heed this call, but how far is man from beast in the end?  Ravens will be your eyes in the far corners of the world, and in time the cowardly will fall to your will.\nPower drew Sisyphus on a noble path, a hero destined to save the world - but like so many before him he found in his own uncompromising ideals a nightmare of benevolence, a world frozen in imperfection.  Sisyphus is tormented by his failings but will try, eternally, to create the perfect world of his dreams - he will look to The Chosen One to uncover the flaw in his character.\nAbilities\nOf Mortal Birth - Born of man but ascended to the ranks of the Ancients, Sisyphus strives to erase all trace of his mortal past. That past still defines him, in his life and even more so in his death.  He gains abilities based on choices made during Scenario Generation and by interacting with The Chosen One.\nThe Price of Victory - The quest for peace lead Sisyphus to Godhood and the world bled for his dream. Those who serve him will sacrifice as well and lend strength to his divine designs.  Your imbues are far stronger than the other Ancients but they come at a cost, useful for pursuing very particular strategies.\nKarth the Scarred saw the rest of the Primal Entities fall as the Old Ones claimed the world for their own, but war is an eternal truth beyond even the designs of the Ancients.  Struck down by the Old Ones, from his blood the children of his rage emerged and their fires would engulf the world.  Karth wakes quickly and is a powerful figure on the map - it can be hard to maintain a low profile with such an occurrence but Karth isn't one to pursue a subtle agenda.\nAbilities\nWar Without End - Karth is the last surviving Primal God. Time tempered and made anachronisms of his peers but in every Orc battlecry, in every scream of the slaughtered, therein lies praise to Karth.  War is hell, but with Karth around it becomes so much worse - expect more wounds in combat, more attrition in battle, and tempers to rise in the halls of power.\nCall of the Horde - The heirs to Karth's legacy lay scattered through the land, but their time has come.  As you stir you will only be able to bring orcs and goblins to rise, but as you waken all of the creatures that thirst for battle will come to your call, from the furthest corners of the world.\nLimos howls and screams at the abomination that is life.  Tortured, he has been kept at bay by the Ancients and before them the Primal Powers, but now his time has come and he can bring an end to the motion and sound that engulfs his every moment of awareness.  Choose Limos if you want to bring a true end to the world, but it may be difficult to draw the living to your crusade.\nAbilities\nThe Gift of Death - To Limos even the Undead are reprehensible, but still they are better than the living.  He is able to easily raise the dead to his legions and bestow the eternal gift on Agents and Heroes, bringing them to a more sympathetic view of his position. \nEnd of Days - Limos is the end of all things, and in his hands the apocalypse will come in every form that man has feared.  Choke the healthy with plagues, raise the seas and poison the rivers - you will put the world to the test and see if they can come together to put an end to your rise before it is too late.\nA mysterious Old One whose Crystal Towers slowly covered the earth emitting a sickly luminescence draining both color and spirit from the world around them.  Her minions scoured the world drawing out those of their choosing to the mysterious depths of the Towers.  Still, there were those who made the Sojurn to her lair and returned - a tale of wonder on their lips.\nReflections of Grace - Seraph descended as light, and created for herself a home to magnify her form and splendor.  From it the seeds of crystalline growth are spread, and within the bounds of her magnified light she can easily manifest - projecting her will into solid crystal.  As she wakens her light shall grow stronger, and her powers within her expanding domain as well.\nCelestial Artifice - Much of her light was lost in the shattering of her palace, and the pieces of its ruin scattered across the world.  Recovering these shards will return Seraph to her full strength, and utilizing the remnants she may grant her followers rituals and artifacts of celestial strength, or craft crystalline forges to create golems to bolster her forces.\nWeak and bound still to your terrestrial prison, you rely on those of dark inclination to serve you.  At first only the soft minded will rally to your cause, but as your power and influence grows you can call powerful demons to your side, exhume ancient allies, or bend to your will the Lords of the world. \nAgents move about the world beneath the gaze of armies, kings, and even heroes unless their fame rises too high or their activities are dangerous enough.  They infiltrate cities, terrorize farmlands, muster military units, cast ritual spells, and even excavate ancient ruins.  The possible actions an Agent can make are bound to their skills and traits, which they supplement by recruiting minions from the areas they've corrupted around the map.\nYou may only have a certain number of Agents active at a time, so choosing the proper Agent to supplement your strategy is critical to victory.  All Agents are valuable, even though some of the later Agents are more ostensibly powerful each has their role to play.  In addition to their skills and abilities each Agent has a unique Scheme that only they can use, proper usage of which can change your fortunes.\nThe Peddler\nThe Peddler is one of your early agents, a weak-willed failure whose dependence on the bottle makes breaking his spirit easy even in your weakened state.  He is uniquely suited for low level espionage and fails to raise warning flags at villages due to their acceptance of the traveling merchant.  He is able to sell cursed items and poisoned potions to unwitting Heroes.\nScheme - Prey Upon Fear - It isn't just wares that the Peddler deals in, but also rumors and information.  Knowing just what to say at the right moment can turn a tranquil marketplace into a ready and able lynch mob.  Turn the crowd against magic, and see that pesky sorcerer Hero strung up before nightfall.\nSpeaker of the Dead\nEarn the respect of one of the necromantic cabals and you may be able to recruit their leader to your cause.  The Speaker is a rough hand at infiltration but is second to none at terrorizing the countryside and turning a few isolated undead groups into a horde that can upend a kingdom.  Failing that, you will find no other Agent who can so easily extract information from Heroes, dead or alive... preferably dead.\nScheme - Scorn the Grave - The Speaker can bind a deceased Hero, gaining access to his skills, abilities, and knowledge.  This ritual is considered a horrible affront and you can expect other Heroes to come try and free their tortured comrade.\nHordemaster Drall\nFrom the moment an Orc Tribe joins your forces you can recruit this beast of an Orc.  A skilled commander and an even better recruiter, Drall is the cornerstone of any good Orc Horde.  Expect to see his star rise quickly, he often makes a useful scapegoat to avoid arousing suspicion of your return.  Prop him up as the Great Conqueror, let him fall, and move along to your next plot.\nScheme - Lessons in Bone - The ultimate tool in Drall's arsenal, by sacrificing an Elite unit Drall can give that Elite's special ability to another Elite.  The humans think they counter your Goblin Fanatics with their Heavy Cavalry, just wait till they see them ride into combat on Ogres.  Seeing that look of surprise is what makes Drall get out of the bed every morning.\nHeroes\nWhile your agents and minions are out pursuing your agenda doing nefarious deeds, there are a host of heroes in the realm going about their activities as well - questing for their liege, searching for treasure or artifacts, and hunting monsters.\nWe first previewed heroes in our development blog HERE.\nHeroes have their own set of traits and goals that guide their activities during the game.  A sage may seek out tomes or lore to create a magical spell or artifact, while a warden may seek to root evil out of the nearby wilderness.  In addition to following their archetypical interests, they have desires they seek to fulfill.  Some heroes may seek gold, others to join an exclusive Order, or maybe just to be the greatest warrior in the world.  The personality traits derive from culture, so when you see an Errus Warrior you can guess that he's not going to run away from a fight.\nThings change as you interact with the land - heroes may begin to pick up clues to your existence and begin to either seek out your agents or find prophecies or artifacts that will help defeat you.  Decreasing the potency and frequency of  the release of dangerous clues by not calling on your Ancient Powers will mitigate the danger, but also lowers your efficiency at pursuing your goals.  Striking a balance between the two is an uncertain task.\nEvents\nAnother major way the player interacts with the world is through a series of branching and interconnected events.  We draw our inspiration from great games such as King of Dragon Pass and Expeditions: Conquistador.  \nWe understand that striking narrative paired with varied decision paths that directly influence both short reaching and long reaching game states can really create memorable situations and really immerse the player into the game.\nWe have already created hundreds of unique events and the supported mod tools allow players to create countless more.\n Combat\nCombat is the crisis point of the challenges Agents face, and the decision of whether or not to stand and fight will always be a difficult one.  Our mechanics for combat are primarily to reinforce the idea of meaningful sacrifice and long term strategy vs short term gains.  The battles are, even in their smallest skirmish, consequential and evoke the type of boss battles often encountered in RPGs, except this time you're the boss.\n Music\nThat Which Sleeps boasts over 45 minutes of unique, custom made music produced by the extremely talented Paul Giangregorio, or Gluglug as he is known to his League of Legend Parody fans.  We couldn't have asked for a more evocative soundtrack.\n Everything you see in the scenarios were developed completely inside That Which Sleep's in-game editor.  We are firm believers in modding as a requirement for a game to call itself a real strategy game, and we are confident that the tools we have in place will not disappoint.  I expect to see some pretty amazing community contributions once the game is released.\nYou can make new Old Ones, Agents, Heroes, Events, Campaigns, Guilds - the list goes on and on.  All of it from inside the game engine, and if you really want to do some modification of the files they are all in standardized XML.  Each class has an XML Serializer helper class to facilitate our mod support that checks for localization information, override folders, and image substitutions. \nWant more than 1 copy of the game?  Just add an additional $10 per copy to your reward tier!\nThat Which Sleeps has been in development for over a year and has been entirely self funded up to this point.  We have a stable working game engine and what we feel is a fun and engaging concept, we just lack the art resources to bring the visuals to the next level.  \nWe have a full time coder and all the major game systems and are in place and successfully implemented.  We do not, however, have an in house artist - so we'd be using your funds primarily to cover graphic updates, and animation.  We think with responsible use of your funds we can overhaul several of the major art assets - including portraits, heros, and agent sprites & animation.\nAny additional funding will go directly into stretch goals.\nKing Dinosaur Games was founded by two friends who have known each-other for over 15 years.\nCombined we have not just the critically important design and development experience to create a game of this scope, we also have the discipline to properly budget and execute in an efficient and timely manner.  Mix that with the overwhelming passion we both have for creating innovative, fun games and we like to think you have a recipe for success.\nWe have been chronicling the design process on IndieDB since June.  We have several blogs posts and over an hour of video logs for you to check out HERE.\nWe've also been actively discussing design decisions, and taking feedback directly from fans on Bay 12 Forums, RPGCODEX, and on our Reddit Forums.  Check them out and participate in the discussion!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy waiting until we have a fully functional and working game engine we feel like we successfully mitigated the most common risks that many games on Kickstarter face.

We're all done!\nGoblin Quest is like Itchy and Scratchy crossed with The Animals of Farthing Wood. It's like the first level of Dungeons & Dragons crossed with Paranoia.\nThis goblin is pretending to be a cleric and hoping that no-one realises that it can't, actually, read\nI stand firm in the belief that, daft as it is, Goblin Quest is the greatest game I've ever written. But it needs a killer rulebook packed with art to do it justice. That's where you come in.\nSet in a fantasy world full of monsters, it uses a really simple system focused around improvisation and rationalisation to build madcap, slapstick scenes that quickly spiral out of hand. All you need to play is a pencil, a sheet of paper, and a handful of six-sided dice; you don't even need a player to be the gamesmaster. Everyone can embark on the quest together.\nRINGING ENDORSEMENTS\nI've been developing and writing Goblin Quest for nearly two years, and groups all over the world have playtested it for me. Here's what they've said about the game:\nFun fact: Most goblins only bathe as part of a ruse. This one seems to enjoy it, though\n\u201cGoblin Quest is the RPG I'd design if I was younger, better-looking and had more energy.\u201d - James Wallis, Games Industry Overlord, creator of The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Once Upon A Time\n\u201cGoblin Quest is so funny I almost spat ice-cream out my nose whilst playing it.\u201d - Malcolm Ryan, who is an actual Games Design Lecturer who teaches at an actual University\n\"We had to steal a Wizard's magic book, so to cause a distraction, I peed in a guard's face.\" - My nephew, Jonah, describing the very first turn of his game of Goblin Quest\n\"GOBLIN QUEST has held a solid appeal to me since I first read about it. It's both simple enough, and open-ended enough, to allow for maximum hilarity.\" - Sean Smith, Stage Mentalist and Word Magician\n\"My group's quest was to make an omelette. 16 goblins died.\" - Andrew Harvey\n\u201cHilarious, entertaining, streamlined, fun; what more could you ask for?\u201d - Nick Jewell\n\u201cThanks so much for writing such a fun game! We had a lovely time trying it out.\u201d - Brian Rinkoski\n\u201cWas it fun? If riding a burning donkey-cart straight towards a brick wall is your idea of fun, then yes.\u201d - Magnus Nordstrand\n\u201cKeep making games like this, and I will keep playing them.\u201d - Alex Winfield\n\"I didn't play RP games until trying some Grant designed. Since then everything is disappointing in comparison. Not just games: it's hard to get through the day. You thought you knew fun before Grant's games? Your life is grey veils and ash.\u201d - Lydia Nicholas \nHere's a link to the (very) brief playtest rules.\nWHAT YOUR PLEDGE COVERS \nThis is Howltooth, Jon's favourite goblin, rocking out on his Lute of Awesomeness +1\n ART. This is the big expense \u2013 I want to pay my artists properly, and I can't afford to do that without your support. The lead artist for the project is Jon Morris \u2013 who inspired this project after sending me an awesome drawing of a goblin. We've got a couple of other artists on board, too, who'll add their talents if we hit our stretch goals.\nLAYOUT. I've contacted Alina Sandu, a professional graphic design and layout professional that I've worked with in the past, and she's super-keen to make the rulebook look as good as it possibly can. I want to give her money to do that. \nWRITING. The core book is finished, but I want to design more ways to use the system \u2013 mobs of kobolds designing ridiculous death-machines, brave investigators losing their minds as they pry into the Cthulhu mythos, and bands of loosely-affiliated Swordmasters avenging each other's deaths. If we hit our stretch goals, we'll put these in the game as bonus content. \nPRINTING. Bulk printing, as opposed to print-on-demand, lets us save money on physical copies, but we need some cash up-front to make the order. We also need some capital to pay distributors to ship out books to you guys.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThis is from Jon's Guide to Goblins, some of his previous work, so you can see he's got proven Goblin Experience\nBreaking our KS target is just the start. Here's what we've got in store. Bear in mind that all of these rules-hacks will be part of the final physical book, not just in the PDF!\n- PASSED! - \u00a32500: KOBOLD QUEST.

All backers at DIGITAL and above will receive MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA JR., an illustrated rules-hack that puts them in control of a school of elite swordmasters obsessed with avenging past misdeeds and, eventually, each other's deaths.\n- PASSED! - \u00a34000 \u2013 YES, GOBLIN OVERLORD!

All backers at DIGITAL and above will receive REDSHIRTS, an illustrated planetary exploration rules-hack set in the far future. You play one competent member of a starfleet ship and four clueless ensigns, and must explore a hostile alien world using your ensigns as cannon-fodd- sorry, research assistants - along the way.\n- PASSED! - \u00a38000 - NEITHER SUPER NOR HEROIC. When the chips are down, the government calls on teams of specially-selected superheroes to save the day. But they're all dead, or busy, or not answering their phones, so... you'll have to do.

Wells and Jules Verne, Ironcast is set in an exciting alternative history; a time when refined men and women in top hats and bonnets commanded gigantic walking war machines, laying waste to the enemies of the British Empire!\nPlayers take control of a 7 metre tall walking vehicle called an Ironcast. They must face off against an invading force of enemy Ironcast in order to defend 1880's Victorian England. \nBattles are fought by generating resource nodes which in turn drive the Ironcast's various weapons and systems. Players must choose how to spend these nodes wisely, either offensively in order to cripple and destroy their opponents, or defensively, if they suspect a barrage of incoming weapons fire is due.\nThe Light Cannon shreds unshielded armour with ease.\nFeatures:\nTurn based strategy combat set against a rich and interesting alternate 1880's history. \nRoguelike campaign mode where death is permanent but with persistent rewards from one game session to the next. Drive back the invading forces and press forth for victory!\nCompletely hand painted art style.\nInspired by the steampunk genre and Victorian science fiction.\nLoot new technology and upgrade abilities from the wrecks of fallen enemies. \nCustomise your Ironcast with a range of unique weapons and defensive systems. Over 50 different unlockable items will ensure an almost limitless number of combinations.\nPassive boosters allow players to augment and tweak their Ironcast's weapons and abilities. \nFor PC, Mac and Linux. \nThe year is 1886. France and England have been at war for over a decade, both sides commanding gigantic walking war-machines known as the Ironcast. Each towering construct bristles with advanced Victorian era weapon systems and electrical shields. \nFrench forces cross the channel, supported by huge Naval fleets and airship bombers, landing to do battle in the burning, ruined streets of 19th century London.\nAlthough designed for military purposes, the British army does not own the patents or designs for the Ironcast. The war-machines are instead built and operated by a private group of supremely wealthy businessmen and women, collectively known as the Consortium of Merit. Sick of the duration and bitterness of the ongoing Anglo-French war, the Consortium developed and manufactured advanced models of Ironcast in order to break the stalemate and declare a victor, once and for all.\nThe Consortium resisted the pleas and threats of the beleaguered British Government to hand over their designs, but instead agreed to join the war as a powerful supplementary force, on one condition; each Ironcast would remain separate from the British Military, and would be commanded by a lady or gentleman of the highest calibre. Their pilots, gunners and support crew would be chosen by the Consortium of Merit and none other. \nWar on the streets of London.\nSmartly dressed and devoid of the usual rough qualities found in fighting troops, an Ironcast commander is a whole new breed of tactical genius, eloquently directing their crew in battle from the comfort of their elaborately decorated and baroque Ironcast cockpits.\nThey are an elite fighting element in service to Queen Victoria and Queen Victoria alone. The newly formed Ironcast Dragoon League has become the bulwark of England\u2019s defence and the spearhead of their eventual offensives into France.\nThe campaign sees the player take the role of one of the few surviving Ironcast Commanders, the majority of which were killed by a devastating attack on the English command centre, The Spire. They must organise the surviving British forces into a coherent fighting force, repel the French invasion of England and finally launch a counter offensive directly into the heart of the French capital; Paris. \nIt is a desperate time for the Ironcast dragoons and the Consortium of Merit; a time in which the player's efforts will be greatly appreciated!\nPlayers must match coloured nodes from a grid in order to gather energy, ammunition, repair tools and engine coolant. They must then use these resources to unleash a torrent of cannon, laser and missile fire upon the enemy in order to cripple their systems and ultimately be the last walker standing. \nA typical battle scene in Ironcast.\nPowered by a mysterious energy source called Voltite, the Ironcast are supremely advanced by Victorian standards. However, such powerful war machines are not without their flaws. \nEvery action the player takes during battle - whether that's firing their cannons or powering up their energy shields - generates a vast amount of heat. Players must ensure that they keep enough coolant supplied to their systems else they risk overheating and taking additional damage! \nThe game is turn based. Players can only make three complete matches from the power grid per turn, but can activate any mech abilities or fire any weapon system that has the required resources without ending their turn. A match must be at least 3 nodes of the same colour, but there's no upper limit on how many nodes are linked in a match, as long as each node is touching another.\nEach ability or weapon system can be activated several times per turn, although most abilities have a \u201ccool-down\u201d period before they can be fired again (measured in turns).\nThe opponent's systems can be targeted specifically; enemy heavily protected by strong shields? Target and disable their shield systems first. Enemy crippling your evasion systems? Take out their strongest weapon first. It's up to the player what they target first and how they plan to win the battle! \nFinally, damaged systems can be repaired by matching repair nodes. Players can spend these nodes to restore health to their disabled systems, but resources are limited and they should be careful in deciding which system to give a valuable boost.\nThe weapons in Ironcast's version of the Victorian era are a curious mix of explosive projectile cannons, missile launchers and energy weapons. \nThe light cannon fires a rapid-fire stream of explosive shells, able to tear through heavy armour with ease. However, it is fairly ineffective against energy shields due to the relatively low damage of each shot.\nThe heavy cannon fires a twin payload of 6\" shells. Each shell causes a medium amount of damage, ensuring it's always able to be partially effective, even when enemies have shield protection.\nThe energy lance fires a high power beam, able to cut through armour and shields with ease. However, as it only fires a single blast each time it is activated, it is susceptible to missing if the target currently has a high evasion chance. \nThe missiles fired from the missile launcher strike a single location for a fairly high amount of damage, but cause a smaller amount of \"splash-damage\" to all other systems too. \nThe shock coils energy weapon can be fairly unpredictable. It has lower single target damage output than the Energy Lance, but has a 25% chance to strike the enemy a 2nd time. This can occur several times in a row if you're lucky!\nPlayers can equip a multitude of different components and systems that will help protect their mech from damage. The primary defensive system is a sophisticated energy barrier, capable of deflecting projectiles and absorbing laser blasts alike. We call these barriers shields. \nMatching orange energy nodes in order to power shields.\nShields completely block a fixed amount of damage from each shot that strikes the Ironcast. If a shot's damage number is higher than the shield's protection number, a portion of that damage will punch through and strike the intended target. \nIn addition to shields, Ironcast mechs can also increase their movement speed in an attempt to avoid incoming damage altogether.\nThis Ironcast is walking, which means that it'll avoid 20% of incoming attacks.\nThe standard evasion chance is only 5% (to represent the natural inaccuracy of Victorian targeting systems), but this can be increased significantly by diverting energy  nodes to the evasion system, causing the mech to walk and potentially avoid 25% or even 40% of all incoming shots!\nIroncast's campaign mode is a roguelike experience, featuring character levelling, numerous mech systems and weapon upgrades and randomised loot and mission content. Most missions will be procedurally generated from a set of pre-made components to give maximum variety from one play session to the next. The only exceptions will be boss missions and specific story missions designed to push the narrative of the game along. \nThe goal of the campaign is to repel the invasion of French forces before they reach the capital, London. Players have 14 days (which is the equivalent of 14 missions) to prepare themselves before the boss encounter, gathering experience points, cash resources and War Assets. \nWar Assets (WA) represent hundreds or even thousands of ground troops, air support and friendly armour that will engage and weaken the bosses before the player has to fight them. The more WA the player has before a boss encounter, the more likely it will be that they defeat the boss. We say more likely, but it'll never be easy. This is a Roguelike, after-all...\nPlayers can choose the difficulty of the mission they wish to undertake. The more difficult the mission, the more scrap, XP and War Assets they'll obtain. However, failure brings them nothing!\nFor example, if the player has 500 WA before the first boss, they could expect all enemy health and effectiveness to be reduced by about 25%, bringing it down to a potentially beatable level. However, if they only managed to secure 100 WA, this reduction will only be about 5%. A small difference and likely a disastrous battle for the player. \nPlayers also earn scrap materials and experience points from matching yellow nodes and defeating enemies throughout the game. They then spend these scrap resources on Ironcast upgrades, weapons and defensive systems. It's important that players try to keep ahead of the curve where possible to ensure that they'll be strong enough to survive the boss encounters.  \nNew systems are built and fitted to the Ironcast in the Hangar Bay. Players can also equip new Passive Boosters and Abilities, earned by levelling up their Commander.\nDue to the difficulty and long term progression you see in Roguelikes, the player will be highly unlikely to get far into the game on initial play attempts. However, there is a certain amount of persistence from one gameplay session to the next, with players unlocking the chance that more powerful items and components will drop from destroyed enemies on subsequent playthroughs. \nThe whole campaign is expected to last around 60 minutes for an experienced player. Perfect for a lunch break. \nAt the beginning of every new campaign, players choose from a selection of different Ironcast frames. \nIroncast mechs have varied statistics such as health, ammo and energy capacity and starting weapon load outs. In addition, they also come with a unique Active Ability, which is exclusive to that Ironcast. \nThe Dunraven is a sturdy Ironcast, that benefits from larger than average ammunition stores. This means that they can effectively fire their weapon systems more often than other Ironcast, as long as the player is matching purple nodes efficiently enough, that is. \nThe Arundel is a lighter Ironcast. It's still built to withstand serious punishment, of course, but what it lacks in overall protection, it makes up with larger energy stores. The Arundel can store more energy nodes, and therefore can power larger shields and evasion systems, for longer. \nThe Warwick is a titan of an Ironcast. It's built to take some serious punishment, and not overheat whilst it does so. The Warwick has larger coolant reserves than the other Ironcast in addition to it's higher overall health, making it a tough beast to put down. \nOnce a player has chosen an Ironcast, they must then pick a Commander to lead it into battle. \nEach Commander comes with a powerful Signature Passive Booster, which augments the player's experience in interesting ways during battle.\nWe aim to have three playable Commander characters. Here are the first two:\nAeres Powell and William Beechwood, Ironcast Commanders.\nAeres Powell \nOwner and chief technician at Powell Energy Co. After losing both of her sisters to a French bomb at her home town in Wales, Aeres turned her attentions to the development of energy weaponry. She is a brilliant scientist, with arguably the greatest knowledge of Voltite technology in Britain. \nSignature Passive Booster: \"Electrical Gift\" - Matching 5 or more energy nodes reduces the cost of activating the next energy based system by 1 (to a minimum of 1). The heat cost remains unchanged. In addition, the ammo cost of firing all energy based weapons is reduced by 1.\nWilliam Beechwood\nThe owner of Beechwood Munitions. Having already acquired a wealth beyond imagination from his company, Beechwood now seeks something else to occupy his time. He looks to the glory of victory on the battlefield to build his legacy. \nCritics call him vainglorious and dangerously selfish in his war manoeuvres, but one thing\u2019s certain; he always gets the job done, whatever his true motivation.\nSignature Passive Booster: \"Master of Munitions\" - Matching 5 or more ammo nodes awards the player with a bonus of 2 purple nodes. Matching 8 or more purple nodes boosts the damage of the next projectile attack by 10%. In addition, all projectile weapon damage is increased by 5%.\nLinking nodes together generates resources and awards the player with Experience Points (XP). The longer the chains, the more resources the player has to spend and the quicker they'll gain levels for their Commander. The best players will always be looking ahead before they make their matches, to see what new, longer patterns could be formed.\nBut why include match 3 mechanics at all?\nWe believe that matching shapes, colours and patterns is an integral part of the human brain. It's incredibly satisfying and addictive; a good reason for why many casual puzzle games are so appealing to so many players; they're really good fun!\nA huge part of what make Ironcast so exciting to play is strategically taking your opponent apart piece by piece until they're ultimately destroyed! Disabling their strengths and exposing the weaknesses of their Ironcast set up is fantastically rewarding, but it takes a tactically minded player to pull off perfectly. \nWe also wanted a resource generation mechanic that would compliment that planning but without being too heavy; there really is such a thing as too much thinking! A mechanic that would be instantly gratifying but would also allow players to get better at with time; a bit of skill to go along with the strategy. Match 3 was the perfect... match!\nMatch 3 games don't have to mean \"casual\". There are excellent examples of deep and compelling match 3 games such as Puzzle Quest and Dungeon Raid. We just think that there aren't enough of them!\nIroncast is a deep and exciting strategy game, complimented by an accessible and addictive resource gathering mechanic.\nIroncast was designed from the start to be a project that could be finished inside of a year. We've been careful to select only the features which we believe are essential for an exciting and compelling game. Anything else had to be put to one side in the \"wouldn't it be great if...\" pile. \nThis dedication to clean, uncluttered game design comes from a great deal of experience working within the games industry, where some projects languish for several years before they finally see release (or are never released at all!). This is not how we believe game development should be done. \nHowever, it's not always easy to work this way. It means that tonnes of genuinely awesome ideas and content simply won't be made without additional funds or time. This is where Kickstarter, and you, come in. \nThere are only 3 full-time developers on the game, with a number of part time contributors supplying animation, audio and video. This is why we've set a deliberately low goal of \u00a310,000 ($16,600) which is the required amount to ship Ironcast with the following feature set within the year of 2014:\n3 core Ironcast mech designs, with attached signature abilities\n3 Commander characters, with attached signature passive boosters\n4 background environments (one of which you can see in the trailer and images above).\n30+ missions, with dozens of randomly selected modifiers to keep them fresh and challenging.\nA mid-game and endgame boss to test your commanding skills.\n8 core weapon systems with multiple upgrades, tweaks and passive boosters, making for hundreds of possible combinations.\n30 or so passive boosters and active abilities.\nHowever, there's so much more that we wish to put into the game! With your help, it can be done. With enough backing from you, the public, and a little bit of luck, we'll be announcing realistic stretch goals early on. Expect more Commanders, more Ironcast designs, more locations and missions, perhaps more platforms, and of course, competitive multi-player, to be on the list. \nWe won't be pushing back the launch date for these stretch goals, however, as we've already got a clear cut plan for how to get to launch. Instead, we'll be patching the stretch goal content in at a later date, so you can all enjoy Ironcast while we continue to work on new content for the game. \nIroncast is being produced by a brilliant and creative team of developers, each coming together to pour their love and talent into the project. \nDaniel Leaver - Designer, Dreadbit. @rovient\nDaniel is the designer on Ironcast. He's responsible for thinking up the crazy weaponry and creating the missions and content that make up the game.\nDaniel's been a professional game developer for more than 8 years. He was a senior designer at Media Molecule, and was a core part of the team that developed the BAFTA winning LittleBIGPlanet games. He designed and built levels and gameplay features for all of Media Molecule's titles, more recently Tearaway for PlayStation VITA. \nHe's also run a business before, as one of the co-founders of Ambient Studios, producers of Monster Meltdown on iOS.\nChris Butler - Programmer, Polygon Hearts. @avalix\nChris is an experienced programmer with 5 years of industry experience. He is responsible for taking Daniel's ideas and Amber's art and bringing them to life!\nHaving starting his career working on AAA titles, Chris gained his experience working on tools and engine code for console and handheld games, and was a core part of the team that brought Need for Speed: Most Wanted to the PS VITA.\nHe then moved onto providing coding services to the indie scene, working on a range of titles such as Monster Meltdown, Hohokum and Super Exploding Zoo.\nHe is also active on Twitter and up for a chat!\nAmber Blade Jones - Artist. @eyecager\nAmber has been a part of the video game industry for 3 years. She worked in-house for 2 years as an artist for Escalation Studios and on the side worked on Skullgirls. \nNothing excites Amber more then seeing robots full of character!\nPhysical rewards:\nFull game pre-loaded on custom USB drive:\nThe drive will come with a DRM free copy of the game pre-loaded onto it (although you'll still receive any digital download codes on launch day so you can get right into the game straight away!). \nI'm assured that the drives are made from recycled materials, so are as eco-friendly as any physical technology can get. They're a great alternative to a plastic box with a DVD inside!\nThese USB drives will not be available after the Kickstarter ends, so they'll be a collector's piece of sorts.\nThe Steampunk Jetpack:\nWe're extremely proud to present the Escape and Evasion Rocket Pack (E.E.R.P), a life-sized, one of a kind steampunk prop, created by the wonderfully talented metalworker, Kruki99. It is completely unique in the world and can only be yours if you opt for our highest pledge level; Grand Iron Admiral.\nThe jet-pack is a non-functioning replica of the type of escape method utilised by many Ironcast Commanders once their steed has been crippled beyond repair. It has been meticulously hand-crafted by Kruki99 using reclaimed materials such as brass, leather and glass. There are no resin or \"metal effect\" components; it is a solid, quality piece of art. \nImagine wearing this to your favourite steampunk or gaming event! The E.E.R.P is the ultimate accessory in steampunk cosplay and fantasy dress-up.\nFor more photos of this incredible pledge reward, please visit Kruki99's Flickr page, here. You can even see some photos of the man himself sporting the piece. \nFinally, a few words about how your money will be spent. \nKickstarter fees: First off, Kickstarter will take an estimated 10% of the funds through Fees, and VAT on those fees.\nDevelopment: We'll require funds in order to pay for audio and animation outsourcing work. Any additional funding over the goal amount will help to pay the core development team and improve our quality of life. \nTaxes: Putting aside up to 15% for UK taxes on funds. \nQuality assurance and testing: A big chunk of the funding will be required to bring in an external QA team for a few weeks to help us squash bugs and fix issues. Obviously this is a fixed amount, so will become a lower percentage if we're lucky enough to receive more pledges than our goal amount. \nMarketing: This doesn't just mean advertising, but also just getting the game onto digital distribution platforms like Steam.\nLegal: as with all businesses and products meant for sale, there will be contracts, solicitors and legal fees to pay. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see from our trailer video and GIF images, we're already pretty far along with Ironcast's development. We're confident that we can produce the rest of the game in the next 2-3 months with your help. \n\nHowever, experience has shown us that it's often the finishing process that proves to be the most difficult part of the project. Going through quality assurance (QA) and testing phase is one of the toughest times for any development team, especially one as small as ours. \n\nTo combat this, we plan on using some of the Kickstarter funds to hire competent and proven testing outsource team to ensure that Ironcast is as bug free and polished product as you guys deserve. Although costly, dedicated QA testers are vital for ensuring an excellent player experience.\n\nWe're also building the game using Unity, the excellent 3rd party development software package, which should also help to reduce the number of bugs relating to the wide variety of gaming PC hardware. If a PC can usually run Unity titles with no issues, then they should be able to run Ironcast at the same level of stability.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Ironcast wooden USB sticks shipped", "update_content": "Hello backers! \nThe Ironcast Kickstarter exclusive wooden USB keys are being sent out today.

Your choices each become part of the myth, joining your tribe's pantheon of heroes. How will you be remembered by your tribe in generations to come?\nMoon Hunters is a 1-4 player action RPG with a rich, ancient world that's different every time you play. Build your mythology as you play, solo or with friends, every action and choice contributing to your legend.  \n  An ancient, occult world: the gods and their creations yet walk among us, and our prayers do not always go unanswered, for better or for worse. \nLocal co-op like never before: playing alone is fully supported. But if you invite your friends, you won't just be bashing enemies, you'll be creating legends together. \nBuild your mythology: Your actions show if you are more of a Trickster or a Saviour or something else entirely. At the end of your journey worthy heroes become a constellation in the night sky, your deeds recounted for the ages. \nDifferent worlds, persistent myths: Seeing one aspect of the mystery in its entirety only takes a couple of hours, but to truly understand what's happened, you'll need to play a few times. Meanwhile, each time you play, the constellation of your character's legend carries over, as part of your tribe's developing pantheon.\nYou could describe the game as \u201cLegend of Zelda meets Castle Crashers\u201d, or maybe \u201cKing of Dragon Pass meets Gauntlet\u201d. We empower players to experiment with their personality through the reputation and tribe-management, while combat challenges punctuate the journey as chances to prove their skill.\nWe already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC and Mac, due to our previous success with Shattered Planet. A DRM-free version will be available on the Humble Store. We're hoping to release Moon Hunters in Summer 2015. If you want to be notified of Moon Hunters updates and development progress, sign up here!\nIf you're a little confused, you can also try out Dungeons of Fayte, by Brent Ellison and our designer Tanya Short, available for free download. It has the co-op action RPG and town-management components. We're taking the Dungeons of Fayte design as a base, adding mythology/reputation and a randomised world as icing on top, like a delicious RPG cake!\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nEach \"journey\" takes only a couple of hours, allowing you to explore one small aspect of the story. Upon completing each journey, if you're worth remembering, your hero will be remembered as a constellation in the night sky, symbolising their contribution to the world's history.\nAlong your journey, your decisions show your personality and create your reputation. Donating blood to a dying stranger shows you are Selfless. Flirting shamelessly with everyone demonstrates you are Flirtatious. And so on -- we will support over 50 different personality traits in the final game, each of which has its own effect on the world around you.\nIn the real world, as in Moon Hunters, legends are rarely about merely defeating villains. More often, folktales are the story of the Clever hero that tricked the gods into giving humans fire. Of the Loyal hero that ventured into the underworld to save a loved one's soul. Of the Brave hero that declined a god's advances, and suffered for impertinence.  \nYour choices determine how you are remembered, and what you embody to those who hear your story in ages hence. The reason why you do something can be as important as the act itself.   \nIn the world of Moon Hunters, the holy Moon is the source of all life and good, worshipped by every tribe as the central goddess of the pantheon. When the Moon does not rise one evening, heroes across the land take up the search, hoping to uncover the truth before the evil Sun's power grows too strong.\nThe world of Moon Hunters is randomly generated every time you play, but there are certain key elements of the setting and lore that are constant.\nFor example, while the individual members and conflicts of the Dustfolk village will be different depending on your generated world, the Dustfolk will always be the tribe of the sands. Learning their general beliefs and customs will give you an advantage in negotiations.\nThere are three major biomes (desert, mountains, and forests), and one minor (cave systems), each with their own local tribes:\nThe Dustfolk tribe keeps turkeys and camels when prosperous. The deserts are unforgiving, but the Seeker's Blood magic mastery helps the tribe find life-giving water.\nThe High Tribes live in wind-blown canyon country, looking down on the rest of creation from their high vantage point. The mountains are desolate but rich in minerals.\nThe Wolf Clan is the most secretive of all tribes, closely guarding their knowledge of Wild magic, so as not to lose the trust of the creatures they ally with.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Celestin are nomadic traders, following the rivers from source to mouth and back again in annual patterns. They are said to have over a thousand rituals to govern their decision-making, but most are invisible to outsiders.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Reefwalkers follow the Moon's tides and bring a wide variety of ingredients and goods to trade from their distant island homes.\nCalled the First People by some, the Silkhood are the only non-humans in the world of Moon Hunters. Although they welcome visitors, their customs and hierarchies are nearly incomprehensible at first.\n All player character classes wield all of the elements, but start with an affinity. You can customise your character's name and colour palette from the start. As you play you'll discover new special attacks to choose between.\nThe Witch trains under the Dustfolk Seeker in the ways of Blood magic. Blood is the element of life and death. When the world was created, the blood of the Goddess flowed to form the rivers and oceans.\nThe Witch has a basic melee attack and a high-damage ranged attack, making her useful in just about any situation.\nThe Spellblade learns the art of Bronze magic from a High Tribes expert smith. Bronze magic allows the shaping of metals, following the rhythm and grace of war as technologies develop. When the world was created, the bones of the Goddess broke to form the mountains and metals.\nIn combat, the Spellblade is a fierce melee fighter and has the highest endurance.\nThe Occultist's connection to Shadow magic allows her to bend the fabric of space and time to suit her whim. Somewhere between math and poetry lies the truth of the human condition. When the world was created, the Goddess's hair draped over the world, darkening the night sky.\nThe Occultist is a long-range, quick fighter with the most control over enemy positioning and movement.\nThe Druid is the prodigal child of the Wolf Clan, who closely guard all secrets of Wild magic. Wild magic is the primal knowledge from before fairness and language, back to the laws of instinct. When the world was created, the Goddess told stories and from her words, all of its wild creatures sprang forth.\nDruids are the most flexible fighters, sometimes even shape-shifting to meet the unique demands of each encounter.\nStretch goal unlocked! As an initiated priestess of the Moon, the Songweaver understands each of the elements, bringing together Wild harmonies, Blood rhythms, Dark dissonance, and Bronze strength. When the world was created, we invented music to remember and mourn.\nThe Songweaver is a complex support class. It is not technically impossible to play as her alone, but without a friend, you're in for a challenge.\nAs for non-player-characters, Teller Roa is the most widely-respected priestess of the Moon. It is she who decides whether your journey's tale is worth keeping for future generations, and what role you play in the legends of our time. Moon worship is a largely oral tradition, depending on the telling of stories to keep its ancient knowledge alive.\nMeanwhile, self-appointed \"King\" Mardokh believes he has seen a greater Truth than the Moon has to offer, and his fine writings have caused chaos in nearby territories. \nThe music is nearly as important to us as the art style, and luckily, we have some unique talent lined up. The soundtrack will be an all-original collaboration by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron, combining orchestral compositions with delicate vocals and a wide variety of percussion.\nThe trailer offers a sneak preview of the main theme song, \"G U I L T Y M O O N\": \n If the embedded track above doesn't work, or you want a more permanent bookmark for continuous repetition, here's a Soundcloud link!\nIn our latest update, we also included two more track previews.

Both we and Square Enix were happy that it went on to earn over 1,000 Yes votes, with an 83% approval rating.\nFurther, following a thorough Team Assessment conducted by Square Enix, they concluded: \"Kitfox Games is a small and vibrant team with passion and drive, matched by a high level of ambition. They seem to be hard-working, diligent and professional and Moon Hunters looks engaging, unique and accessible.

Essentially, we want to make a game, and we want to make sure that the people who would love it get a chance to hear that it exists.\nIf you are into RPGs and/or mythology and/or old-fashioned co-op fun, Moon Hunters is the game for you. \nWe are four upstarts that, despite our modest successes in the game industry, don't have savings to fall back on in times of need. To put it bluntly, we're poor, and Moon Hunters is our dream game to make. We can't do it alone. \nPhoto credit: Belziir Photography\n We need your help to make Moon Hunters the best game it can be. We'll use your money to develop the game's programming, art, music, and design for longer and with more help than we could normally dream of affording. Besides, if nobody likes it and we don't get funded, we might be heartbroken, but at least it saves us from spending a year eating cans of beans making a game that people don't want! Win/win! \nThis is also a great opportunity to get feedback and input from players that would normally be impossible. We look forward to working with enthusiastic fans to make the game of our dreams together. \nWe try not to let the Canadian winter keep us down...\nSo, if Moon Hunters seems like the kind of game you might want to play, please consider chipping in and spreading the word! \nWe're still in the prototyping phase of production, so there's a lot of game left to make. But we're covering most of it! We decided to take the sales money from Shattered Planet and our company savings to help cover licenses, software, traveling to conferences, and most of the core team salaries, if this Kickstarter succeeds. \nThe money will be spent as follows:  \nFirst, 5% goes to Kickstarter, 3% goes to Visa/Mastercard/Amazon, and 19% goes to Quebec/Canadian taxes.\nThen, 5% goes to Square Enix. \nWe estimate it will take between $5000 and $7000 to handle production and shipping of all of the backer rewards (depending on which tiers are more popular), or about 12%\nThat leaves us the remaining $22,000 or so to spend on audio, more art, a content designer, and additional programmer time.\nThe core team members of Kitfox are the same core team from developing Shattered Planet, which was developed from idea to release on four platforms in 13 months (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). It received praise from The New Yorker, CNET, and others, and remains highly praised on Steam. It was also chosen to be at the Indie Megabooth at PAX Prime 2014!\n And who are we? We're Kitfox Games!\nThe limited edition T-shirt design is on charcoal grey cotton and features a Spellblade design.\nClick to view a higher-res version!\n We're offering 4 different 12x18\" poster designs, signed by the core team for a limited run, unique to this Kickstarter.\nClick to view a high-res version!\nIf you purchase a fabric print, you can choose from one of five different 10x13\" designs (one for each character class and a cloth map representing one possible world configuration), printed directly onto Belgian linen. They are safe to wash, though we don't recommend using them as a BBQ bib, okay?\nThe Digital Art Book will include the concept art of Moon Hunters. You will get a hand-picked collection of beautiful watercolour artworks in a neatly designed PDF file. It includes some exclusive early concepts that we haven't shown to anyone!\nHere's a visual guide to all the tiers and rewards in their pixel glory:\nIf you can't find the perfect tier, why not build your own?\nDuring checkout, add the following amounts manually to your total pledge. If you've already backed us, go to \"Manage Pledge\" and add the appropriate amount (or more) to your total. Keep your original pledge tier the same. After the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you and you can specify your desired add-ons.\nAdditional digital copy of the game: add $13\nCopy of the original OST by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron: add $8\nLimited edition \"Moonblade\" T-shirt: add $45 (shipping included)\nPoster print, design of your choice: add $30 (shipping included)\nThe Digital Art Book of Moon Hunters: add $14\nDigital copy of Shattered Planet: add $10\nBlack Cat familiar: add $5\nIf there's something you're desperate to ask or tell us, please do let us know!

Sienna Storm puts you in this game.\nCHOOSE YOUR ADVENTURE. Sienna Storm is an evolutionary leap for interactive animated graphic novels. Most novels are linear, where Sienna Storm is complex, branching, replete with interesting choices that change the outcome of your story.  \nImagine a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style book where, instead of reading a wall of text, you interact with gorgeous, hand-drawn, animated scenes. Exploring and discovering action points within a scene lets you progress through the narrative. Will you decide to rescue your informant, or to cut him loose to avoid putting your whole team in danger? The choices you make have direct impact on the evolving story, and can change your reputation with the characters you meet.\nGATHER INTEL. Sienna Storm features dozens of non-linear dialogues, similar to Alpha Protocol\u2122. You can interrogate, manipulate or charm people into doing things your way, revealing closely guarded secrets, or offering up useful items and equipment. Through dialogues you can earn or lose influence with characters, and win cards to help you succeed in the Card Game. \nTAKE ACTION. There's a time for talking, but when things get down to the wire, you spring into action via an easy to learn, but hard to master, Card Game. This mechanic is adapted for combat, infiltration and hacking, and is based on a system of dynamic events, triggered by your actions or overall situation on the field. \nFor example, if you weren't able to defeat an enemy within 5 turns, backup arrives to make the situation more perilous. Your enemies are intelligent, and they have contingencies. So if you lower your enemy\u2019s health, he may change his tactics, forcing you to also change yours.  \nActual in-game art with UI hidden\n Sienna Storm is a unique interactive comic-style video game. Every scene is a hand drawn, animated work of art and there are multiple actions points the player may select to progress the game. \nDialogues are rich and non-linear, and choices you make throughout the game not only have consequences, but also influence your standings with certain characters and involved parties   \nDialogue gameplay showcase. Work in progress\nWHAT DECISIONS WILL YOU MAKE? Lets look how the gameplay for \"choose your adventure\" part unfolds. London. Night time. We have a situation where Mark is on the run and simultaneously being contacted by an unknown caller. He hears an unknown voice in his helmet warning him that there is an ambush ahead. Mark needs to decide whether to ignore the warning or listen to it. \nThis is the decision and consequence system in its simplest form. What will you decide?\nActual in-game picture. Work in progress\n   There is a fair amount of challenges to resolve such as combat, hacking computers, and tailing an enemies. When you enter these challenges, you play a short strategic card game using a customizable deck.\nAt the start of each card match, you can modify your deck to best suit the situation, even adding in new cards you've earned over the course of the game. This allows you to pick a strategy \u2013 trickery, gadgetry, or straight-up violence \u2013 that works best for the mission and your personal play style. But watch out! The matches are full of dynamic events and based on the story, so you never know what new enemies, old allies, or dramatic plot twists are in the cards to keep you on your toes!\nActual in-game picture. Work in progress\nWhat made the black ops unit Sienna-1 unique was that it was run by a private contractor, and rented out to the highest bidder. Before too long, more than the unit's own firm decided that this was a bad idea. Sienna-1's commander, Mark, and his team were resettled under new identities. Records of the unit were destroyed.\nHowever, Sienna-1 was not forgotten. One day, Mark is jolted out of his quiet private investigator life by a warning from a former commando, who suspects a murder plot against the unit's veterans. He soon discovers that the conspiracy is much bigger, and the commando who warned him is a woman he shared an intimate history with named Annette. She is an asset as unpredictable in the field as in life, and somehow mixed up in the web of mystery and deceit.\nMark is framed for a terrorist attack he didn't commit. A fugitive cut off from the last of his friends in law enforcement, he must decide where to turn. To Annette, the one most able to have done this to him? To MI6, the agency he once dreamed of joining but which now hunts him? Or should he go solo and hope he can unmask the conspirators in time to clear his name?\nActual in-game art with hidden UI\nAction packed spy/thriller that will immerse you in its world and characters\nAn engaging non-linear story set in modern day that has a variety of outcomes based on your decisions and actions.\nMulti-branched dialogues that influence your reputation standings with different characters and involved parties\nBeautifully hand drawn environments and characters.\nReplay value. If you think you saw everything, think again. Your decisions will open and close many paths along the journey.\nA unique card game mechanic that enhances gameplay in action-packed scenes\nActual in-game art with hidden UI\nFor now, we are focusing on a PC version release of the game. We do, however, have plans creating a Mac version as part of a stretch goal reward!\nIf you are a fan of Deus Ex\u2122and its sequel, Invisible War, then you are familiar with the work of Sheldon Pacotti as a lead writer for these titles. \nHe has over a decade of experience writing for video games, and he teaches game writing in the University of Texas. \nAfter his work with Deus Ex, he designed an indie title named Cell: emergence. Sheldon's experience as a writer is crucial to the narrative success of Sienna Storm.\nTony has over 15 years of experience as a game designer. His impressive background includes working with powerhouse companies such as Bioware\u2122 and Obsidian Entertainment\u2122. \nHe is best known for his design work on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II\u2122, Torment: Tides of Numenera\u2122, and Neverwinter Nights\u2122 2: Mask of the Betrayer.

Not only is he a musical master, but Alex has done a fair amount of work in voice acting as well. \nHe currently owns a studio in Texas called Funky Rustic that specializes in production for voice over, music and sound design for video games, film, television and radio.\nIf you are unfamiliar with Alex's work, we encourage you to listen to one of his tracks:\nBest known for his work in the Fallout\u2122 universe, Chris Avellone has an undeniable presence in the video game industry. \nHe is also no stranger to the Kickstarter realm. Chris has contributed his creative skill to Wasteland\u2122 2, The Legend of Grimrock movie treatment, FTL: Advanced Edition, and inXile's Torment: Tides of Numenera\u2122.

As you can see, we project that the majority will be going to the artists and programmers. Because Sienna Storm is hand drawn, a lot of time and energy is poured into each picture. As an example: an estimated 1300-1500 pictures must be created to showcase a game that is more than 30 minutes. That is a ton of work, and it is being done for little money. Creating one scene can take up to 3-4 hours. \nThe remainder of the budget will go toward hiring a small out of house company (primarily based in the US) for additional programming, animation, audio effects, QA etc... \nSienna Storm will be dubbed in English and will be accompanied with English subtitles.\nAs stated above, if we surpass the second stretch goal, Sienna Storm will be fully voiceovered in English.\nOther languages and their respective subtitles are to be determined as the Kickstarter evolves, but we will be listening for your wishes and feedback!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDigital Knights is a small company; however, that does not stop the drive of an incredibly talented team. Sienna Storm has come a long way already, but in order to make it a success, funding is needed. A lot of personal time and manpower is allocated into Sienna Storm\u2019s unique hand drawn world. \n\nThis is our first Kickstarter. That is a challenge in itself as there are learning curves and tons of feedback coming in from the community. We are not a company that is closed off from those who support it, so we are reading and listening to everything being sent our way. We want to express that we care about our current and potential backers, but we cannot guarantee that we will change the project based on every opinion. The things we can change and fully believe will bring a better experience to our backers, we will implement. Hence, the added reward tier. \n\nOne challenge that is common with many indie game companies is not having the benefit of all team members in one office. Time zone differences (not just in the US) can put a damper on time and production, but our project manager is dedicated in making deadlines and ensuring everyone is on task. Everyone on the team wants Sienna Storm to be a success. Backers will receive updates from the team to show our progress. \n\nWe want to produce something that grabs gamers, that entertains them and encourages them to play it again and bring others along for the ride. \n\nThere aren\u2019t many games like Sienna Storm readily available, so what will be the public\u2019s reception of it? Will gamers love it? We know so.

It provides two-way communication and the SBrick also keeps the mobile app informed about the battery conditions. You can use it to control the direction and the power of motors and the intensity of lights, allowing precise control over your creations.\nThe current design of the SBrick\nThere are three connector holes and one power source port located on the underside of the SBrick. The electronics and the identifying LED are in the middle. The top has four PF control ports.\nDon't have one? You can buy one at the LEGO\u00ae store.\n                                                                                               The App\nThe app supports Android, iOS and WP8 devices.\nThe SBrick is more than a just controller for LEGO\u00ae Creations. It creates the connection between the internet and your LEGO\u00ae, making it possible to keep constant communication between the community and the individual players. The SBrick mobile app can be used to control the bricks simultaneously in a programmed manner. There is no interference between different remote controllers, hence the ability to have races and tournaments with multiple players. Join social.sbrick.com and suggest more features!\nThe social features of playing with your LEGO\u00ae should no longer be something you do on your own. Challenge your friends, compete against them, post the results online, take part or be an organiser of the next local SBrick race or LEGO\u00ae exhibition. We\u2019ve integrated all the tools you need to put together a great afternoon for your community. Beyond event management, the SBrick mobile app allows for direct interaction between players. It is the platform for sharing MOCs and SBrick integration descriptions and enables the sharing and hosting of multimedia content relating to the world\u2019s favourite building blocks.\nSome pictures from the APP\nMy Sets screen on the left.

Here are a few examples...\nGyro steering and acceleration.

His MOC uses eight motors controlled by two SBrick.\nHow it works?\n Current Status\nOver the last 5 months we have put tremendous effort into bringing SBrick to you. We have had over 20 different people working on different aspects of SBrick to get to the point where we can say now IT'S READY.\n\nOur team has contributed 70% of the funding for the engineering work while the rest was donated by our close family and friends. Now we only need to raise the last 30% for the final step of the process.\nSupport us to bring your LEGO\u00ae creations LIVE!\nYes, there is one thing left - mass production. For this there are only two parts we couldn\u2019t cover already, this being the tooling for the connectors and the tooling for the plastic moulds. Even though this sounds rather straightforward, it requires considerable equity to produce the best moulds (see more in \u201chistory\u201d and \u201crisks and challenges\u201d).\n\nA small picture which represents the last six months of our hard work. :)\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe short answer is that without financial backing we can\u2019t afford to cover the production costs for the SBrick. By putting this project before you, our aim is twofold; not only to raise the funds needed to bring the SBrick to market, but also to gain your valuable feedback about the product itself. The SBrick is our labour of love, but like any technology we know it can be improved and fine-tuned, so we really want to hear from you. \nWe are currently in the phase where, depending on the feedback you give us, we are still able to make changes to the product and can adapt our production line to ensure we ship you the very best SBrick possible.\nWe also love the fact that Kickstarter is a no-risk way for you to back the SBrick and is a fantastic way for us to gauge how desirable the SBrick is.  If we reach our funding total, we hit the ground running with the best SBrick we can make. And in the unlikely event we don\u2019t, you haven\u2019t wasted a single penny. We see that as a win-win for you (and for us).\nHow can you help?\n\nPledges. This is the essential part of this Kickstarter campaign. We need your support, so take a moment to see which pledge level suits you the best. We\u2019ve thought up several pledge options, so please have a look and see how you can contribute. Please add three pounds for international packaging and shipping. The more you give, the quicker we can develop the SBrick! Finally, the SBricks will be sent out in order from the highest pledge on down, so the more you give, the quicker you'll get your SBrick! Everything counts.\nChoose your favourite!\nShares. We want to get the word out about SBrick to as many people as possible. The more people that hear about the SBrick the better.  Chances are, if you believe in the SBrick you\u2019ll have friends who think the same way. So please share this page through your favourite social media and let people know where you stand on the SBrick!\nSuggestions. Do you have an idea how to make the SBrick better?  Is there something you think we\u2019ve missed? Let us know! Right now we\u2019re at the stage where we can still tweak the SBrick and take your suggestions on board.  We want to hear from you - after all, we\u2019re making the SBrick for you. Your feedback is invaluable.\nLet's kickstart this project!\nOur Testers\nWe have put considerable efforts into making SBrick better. We\u2019ve launched a public testing campaign and sent out numerous bricks to respected fans around the world.

See the pledges!\nBe the first from your country!\nOur story so far - problems and challenges\nSBrick was created after countless long nights of playing with LEGO\u00ae and experimenting with add-ons to enhance gameplay. We are no different than other adult friends of LEGO\u00ae. We might be software engineers, but we like to build and we like to play and SBrick makes both of these activities so much better.\nAt first, SBrick was a Bluetooth remote controller for our LEGO\u00ae Power Function devices and a simple mobile app. But it has quickly become something much more. We have made it programmable; the remote control app can be customized easily to suit the set you\u2019re playing with. Today SBrick connects us with fellow players and even helps us organise events like races. Of course the SBrick connects our game and our play to the internet.\nWe see that in the near future SBrick will help you organise and race in a national tournament with your custom LEGO\u00ae creation. If you have a SBrick, you will get your old LEGO\u00ae bricks from the attic and will start to build again as new challenges await. Now you can race and be stronger, faster and more agile. We give you yet another reason to play together with your son or nephew.\nThe first prototype\nEverything started with a completely different project involving the BlueGiga BLE112 chip and a smartphone. Then L\u00e9n\u00e1rd got a nice present for his birthday, a new LEGO\u00ae set. He started wondering: how cool it would be if that set could be controlled with a smartphone through a BLE112 chip. Could this even work?\nYes, it could - answered Tam\u00e1s, and immediately presented improvised plans for a solution. Just a few days after the parts had arrived in the mail, the very first prototype was ready. It wasn\u2019t too smart, it wasn\u2019t even a brick, but it worked.\nAndroid app protos, latency, reliability, protocol\nThe first Android app was created over the course of a single day. We didn\u2019t care too much about the UI or even usability. The goal was simply to prove to ourselves that this idea was worth working on. Even with this rudimentary remote control, it was possible to control our model with reasonable precision.\nThe first surprise was how well it worked given the amount of resources we had put into the overall design of the system. Latency and reliability wasn\u2019t really an issue, despite us using a simple, na\u00efve protocol.\nHowever once we tried to increase the distance, or install the app on other devices, problems started to show up, and we knew it wasn\u2019t easy to fine-tune the communication parameters and handle all the corner cases.\nImages from the first Android test application.\nThe first SBrick powered MOC\nThe project badly needed a shape, some kind of plastic enclosure that would contain the electronics. We tried to make this as small and as thin as possible.\nThis model was the first that used an enclosure. The electronics were glued into the insides, and everything was soldered together with wires.\nThe thing looked gorgeous already and we desperately wanted to show it to our friends and strangers.\nThe first PCB prototypes, thermal and power issues\nDuring the early tests we quickly discovered several serious problems with the first version of the SBrick. The motor driver chips we\u2019d been using were obviously too large to fit into the enclosure conveniently. They took up so much space we couldn\u2019t properly fit even the new, smaller BLE113 chip onto the board, and got nowhere close to the promised 100 metres range.\nThe prototype also consumed way too much standby current, almost as much as a freely running M motor. Besides wasting the battery, this also meant excessive heating. The first bricks felt lukewarm even after few minutes of use.\nLEGO\u00ae IR compatibility, case ideas, connector problems, LEGO\u00ae design and copyright\nIt quickly became apparent that if we wanted our customers to replace their IR receivers, we needed to build the SBrick so that the shape of the enclosure made it possible to simply remove the old receiver and snap a SBrick into its place.\nWe also needed to design a PCB and an enclosure so that they would be easy to manufacture, allowing us to offer the end product for a reasonable price.\nSeveral enclosure versions were designed and printed as we searched for both the best material and form for the prototypes and the final version. We bombarded our partners with quotes for various versions of moulding tools, connector pin hard tools and PCB / assembly solutions.\nWe showed the housing prototype to some hardcore LEGO\u00ae fanatics, who encouraged us to change the layout of the electrical connectors: before they sprouted from two sides of the brick, but after taking their advice on board we changed the layout so that all the connectors sprout from one side of the housing, making it far easier to build with it.\nExperimenting with different materials\nWith your support we can produce SBrick in different colours. See the pledges!\nThis is how we arrived at our current design with the three holes on one side, the four-connector stair-top, and the bottom connector. Because of the current arrangement, the manufacture of the electrical contacts will be more expensive than what we hoped. This is a compromise between price and usability that had to be made.\nDuring the design phase, one very important criteria was to come up with a unique, and useful design. We never wanted to just blatantly copy the LEGO\u00ae elements. Doing so would not only draw serious legal consequences, but surely would receive deserved disdain from the LEGO\u00ae community. Now we are proud of our solution that is distinctively different in looks from a LEGO\u00ae toy, but still compatible with the Power Functions devices.\nSome nice hand made prototypes.\nFuture of the SBrick\nThe SBrick is the first step we\u2019re taking towards introducing a larger family of SBrick products. We have plans on adding other peripherals like the CamBrick, which will provide full HD low-latency video. This will act as your eyes and will allow you to see things in real time and it will open up a whole new world of augmented reality.\nOur hope is that our products will be endorsed by the LEGO group - we believe in thinking big!  Our plan is to invest any profit from the SBrick into further development of the SBrick and associated peripherals.\nPotential of the URC\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the buzz phrase \u201cInternet of Things\u201d being bandied around. SBrick is a true Internet of Things device in that it can be used not only to control LEGO\u00ae creations, but basically anything else that you can think of.  The URC (Universal Remote Controller) platform we created is made up of four distinct units; the hardware, app, community services and the diagnostic data warehouse.\nHardware: a really small, Bluetooth, low-energy enabled electronic device, which allows for secured two-way communication with the devices to which it\u2019s connected.\nApp: a smart remote control engine with security features and modular components for controlling the hardware, together with a fully customizable user interface. And all this, integrated with cloud-based online services.\nCommunity Services: we have created a community platform where users of any given product can link up with like-minded individuals to share their experiences, help one another, and of course, take advantage of customer support.\n Diagnostic Data Warehouse: if you want to opt-in to this service, the device will communicate with the DDW. Why is this a good thing? It will allow device-makers to see how their products are functioning, whether all systems are healthy and most importantly to diagnose any problems before they become too serious. This will make it easier to produce better devices for the marketplace and improve the user experience and service support.\nOne platform what will support all of your electronic devices!\nWe are looking to you for suggestions as to how else you\u2019d like the URC platform to be used. No idea is too small and no dream too big - if you have an idea about other applications, we want to hear from you.\nOf course, everybody loves it!\nSBrick is not made by the LEGO Group. It is a product of our love and appreciation of playing with LEGO\u00ae bricks, with our ambition of adding value to the world matched with our dedication to excellence. LEGO\u00ae is a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse us. It does not endorse, sponsor or authorize this product. We have developed it relying on the basic idea that innovation should be open as referred to in many articles about the success story of the LEGO Group. We will do our best to certify SBrick and we ask for your help in achieving this.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- Moving from 3D printing to injection moulding is one of the most\nimportant steps in mass producing the SBrick. It will greatly cut down\non the production costs, as creating the right moulds is also the most\nexpensive step for us. We will not be satisfied with anything less\nthan achieving the standard you have grown accustomed to whilst playing with your favourite building blocks. We are in the lucky position that the standard for the\nmaterial properties of these blocks has already been established - we only\nneed to improve them a little to be able to deliver the perfect\nSBrick.\n\n- The electrical contacts need to be properly designed, tested and\nmass produced. The hard tools used for manufacturing these are also\nquite expensive and we need to order large quantities to be able to\nget a good price. Because of the stair-top design, we need three\ndifferent cutting tools, and there's a chance we have to redesign the brick to employ uniform electrical contacts in order to cut the costs on\nmanufacturing and assembly.\n\n- Sourcing the BLE chips: we plan on producing 2000 units in\nthe first 30 days, but can only place our order for the chips once\nour campaign meets its initial funding goal. We\u2019ve spent the last six\nmonths building a close relationship with all our suppliers to meeting\nthis challenge.\n\n- One of our greatest challanges is to ensure that our product matches the highest standards set by LEGO Group.

Not to worry! Slacker backers (people who weren't quite on time) can go and back the project at the Catlateral Damage website.\nNotes on stretch goals  \nSteam Workshop integration means that we'll release all of our developer tools to the public so that the community can easily modify the game and share their creations with other fans. As a player you'll have access to lots of user generated content!  \nYes, there will be other animals in the pet store. What kind? Let's hit this goal and you can find out!\nThe PlayStation 4 version of the game will come out about 6 months after the Steam and OUYA versions, likely in summer 2015. All backers will be able to choose between EITHER the PS4 version or the Steam + OUYA + DRM free download version. Alternatively backers can get all versions by adding an $3 extra to their pledge (the PS4 keys cost us $3 each).\nCatlateral Damage is a first-person destructive cat simulator where you play as a cat on a rampage, knocking as much of your owner's stuff onto the ground as possible. It's a highly original, experimental concept that was born out of a game jam last year. Oh, and it's based on a real-life mischievous cat!\nMy childhood buddy, Nippy, in real life and in-game.\nSee the world from the perspective of a cat! Like other first-person games, you can walk and look around, jump, and crouch. Unlike other first-person games, your primary weapons are your two cat paws, which you can use to swipe at and knock objects onto the floor.\nCatlateral Damage garnered a bit of attention back in January (see the What People Are Saying section below!), and lots of people have asked to play a full game with more feline destruction. In fact, the demo was so popular that it was Greenlit on Steam after only 8 days! So now I'm making the full game, which will come out on Steam (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), OUYA, and as a DRM free download. The anticipated release window is Q4 2014.   \nIntrigued? Go play the demo now, in case you missed the big flashing yellow button surrounded by cat paws up top.\n YouTube Features & Let's Plays\nLet's talk about all the new features and content that will be going into the game thanks to your support! In Catlateral Damage you will be able to:\nChase (or ignore) mice. You can play with or catch them! \nSit in a box, lie in a sunbeam, or both at once \nChase a laser pointer and completely freak out \nHack up a hairball. Why not? \nFind long lost cat toys under the couch and play with them \nExplore/hide underneath the bed \nTrip out on catnip \nStand at a doorway and be indecisive about going in or out \nMeow using state of the art, cutting edge meowing technology \nAct indignant because you are the higher species \nKnock over this TV:\nHere's a more thorough explanation of where the game will be going.\nYour goal is to reach the fancy mansion down the street and destroy the super secret, super valuable object hidden within its locked safe. You start in your home apartment, traversing and trashing various houses on the street until your reach the mansion. In each house, you start in a locked room and make messes in rooms to unlock adjacent ones. Once all rooms are sufficiently sloppy, you nap in a box (yes, really) before moving on to the next house. Each residence is larger and contains more valuable possessions than the last. You may even encounter special locations on your journey...\nProcedurally-generated gameplay: Every time you play the game will be different as all houses, rooms, and challenges are procedurally generated. As you play the game more you'll unlock different cats, with different special abilities.\nMore cats and special abilities: As you progress through the game you'll have to make choices about which cat to use for which level, because cats have different special abilities! Some cats jump higher than others, while other cats are stronger and can knock over heavier objects. Some cats prefer to destroy plants, while others hate electronics.\nCollectibles and power ups: What cat doesn't like to collect things? Hunt around for secret objects (or maybe just cat toys you have previously lost?) which can help unlock new abilities. And power-ups enhance your cat's abilities, like catnip which temporarily makes you a super-powered furball of terror!\nTons of polish: I'll focus on getting the controls as perfect as possible, so that moving around really feels like you\u2019re a cat. I'll also spend lots of time focusing on the user interface and experience so the game feels as great as possible. It sounds boring but you'll appreciate it! I'll also add in achievements, leaderboards, and Steam trading cards. \nLots more content: Tons of new objects to topple! A glorious soundtrack, fun sound effects, and more! This messy room is a merely a prelude to the destruction you'll cause as a cat.\nTL;DR \u2013 There's gonna be a TON of new stuff, and I'm going to make this feel like you're a cat as much as possible.\nA sincere thank you and access to backer updates and newsletter. I may occasionally send you a cute pictures of cats. Not too frequently though.\nTHIS IS NOT A TIER! It's an add-on - if you increase your pledge for any of the below tiers by $10 then you'll get an extra copy of the game! You can get as many extra copies as you'd like, just increase by the appropriate amount. If you back the HIPSTER CAT tier or higher then the extra copies will also be early access! ADD-ON COPY does not work with the KITTEN tier, nice try!\nA DRM-free digital copy of the game for PC, Mac, or Linux (and/or Steam key and/or OUYA key) when it releases later this year and full game soundtrack.\nA DRM free copy of the game PC, Mac, or Linux (and Steam key and/or OUYA key), full game soundtrack, and you get your name in the game credits! I'll also send you a special backer-only digital book (PDF) with special cat pictures and developer commentary. It will be awesome.\nYou get special early access to the game before it comes out! Play the game early, give feedback, and tell your friends how great it is before it goes mainstream. Note that early access will be for PC, Mac, and Linux and only available with Steam keys. Includes the BACKER CAT tier.\nThe HIPSTER CAT tier plus games from friends of ours! Includes Steam keys for Goat Simulator, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, The Stanley Parable, Go Home Dinosaurs, and Slam Bolt Scrappers.\nTHIS IS NOT A TIER! It's an add-on - if you increase your pledge for any of the below tiers by $50 then you get to put another cat photo into the game! You can add as many cats as you'd like, just increase by the appropriate amount. All of your photos will be displayed together in-game as a set.\nMake your cat famous! Send us a photo of your cat and it will appear as a framed poster or picture in-game. Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier.\nMake your dog famous! This is just like the LOLCAT tier, except just for dogs. Because this is a game about cats you have to pay an extra dollar for this, and I expect you to submit an unflattering, silly picture of your dog. Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier. \nThe best of both worlds! Get your cat (or dog) in a framed poster or picture in-game, plus we'll send you Steam keys of our friends' games (Goat Simulator, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, The Stanley Parable, Go Home Dinosaurs, and Slam Bolt Scrappers). Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier, and an extra second copy of Catlateral Damage for a friend!\nA game for you and one for your cat! Your cat can't play the video game, but he or she will LOVE this sweet Catlateral Damage laser pointer. You also get a snazzy Catlateral Damage t-shirt (we haven't figured out the design yet, but trust me, it'll be snazzy) plus the GAMER LOLCAT tier for you. Add $15 shipping for non-US addresses.\nPlay as YOUR cat in the game! Your cat will be famous, and appear as a playable character, complete with name and fur color. Includes LONG CAT tier. This was originally $400 but it sold out, so I've put up a second round of 10 slots. Once this is gone that's it, I can't add a third round!\nBUSINESS CAT tier, and you get listed as a \"Fat Cat Producer\" in the credits, which includes a picture of you and/or your cat as opposed to just your name. You also get to have lunch with me and the folks at Fire Hose Games to give feedback on the game, talk about cats, or discuss quantum mechanics - whatever floats your boat. You have to provide your own travel arrangements, or you can Skype in. You'll also get 5 extra copies of the game for your best friends.\nDo you love cats? Are you not messing around? Then this is the tier for you! Eitan (Fire Hose Founder, helping me with this game) will adopt a cat for each person that pledges this tier! There is no limit! Troll him and make him adopt 20 cats, he'll have to do it! Eitan will periodically send you pictures of the cat, and you are invited to come and hang out with him or her when you are in Boston. Includes FAT CAT tier, with a total of 10 copies of the game to share with your best friends.\nI started creating Catlateral Damage last year. I had a full-time job working as a video game tester, and would spend nights and weekends on this game, pursuing my dream to become an indie game developer. In March of 2014 I lost my job, which allowed me to start working full-time on the game but also came with the burden of not having an income. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, I'll be able to continue putting all my effort into creating the game and releasing a great, polished experience for you to play!\nI've been developing video games for about 8 years now and I've been a gamer for the majority of my life. I was also partially raised by cats, so I have extensive experience with feline behavior. Catlateral Damage is truly something I was meant to create.\nIf you want to learn more about me, check out this interview on Gamasutra. You can also check out my website for some other projects I've worked on. Feel free to follow me on Twitter, too!\nI\u2019m not working on the game alone, either! I've been given the opportunity to work alongside Fire Hose Games as part of their indie accelerator program. They will be providing marketing, additional development, and other resources on top of the work I'll be doing on the game. They\u2019re the guys who made Slam Bolt Scrappers and Go Home Dinosaurs. They\u2019re also big time cat lovers so it was a natural fit. Eitan (the founder) has spent way too much time at my place playing with my cats.\nWhen they aren't sleeping or wrestling with each other, Wil & Lyn help out with the research and marketing aspects of the game's development. Wil is a 1-year-old orange tabby and Lyn is a 4-1/2-month-old polydactyl manx.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is actually very low risk! The main challenge with creating this game so far has been working as a solo developer. However working with Fire Hose Games has given me the extra support that I need to make this happen so I\u2019m not alone in a bubble.\n\nAnother risk with this game is underestimating how long it may take to add certain features and content to the game. Features may be delayed due to bugs or unplanned content might need to be created. Luckily the game isn't especially complicated (no online multiplayer). We've planned for some amount of bug fixing and unexpected problems in the schedule so we\u2019re not too concerned.\n\nIf anything were to happen to me due to an Act of God or other such event, I believe the game is in the dependable hands of Wil & Lyn, the fully-capable feline game developers featured in the video. If for any reason they are unable to continue the project, I'm sure the team at Fire Hose Games can handle it!\n\nFinally, we're participating in the OUYA double our funds program, which will reduce our risk even further and help us to get the game on console. Here are the details.\n\nDouble Our Fun(ds)!\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA console exclusive for a period of time.

But we can tell you how your adventure starts:\n Your name is Franklin Fargo. You're a former physics professor. You live a lonely and quiet life after the death of your fiance. Day after day, it's the same routine, filled with bitter memories of the life you lost. But when you wake up today, it's different. You have a headache, feel dizzy, and have trouble opening your eyes. You quickly glance around you and you start to panic. You're locked into a room that's so small that it's barely big enough to keep from suffocating. You take a deep breath, remembering what happened the day before. You were on the couch after eating your TV dinner. You were about to go to sleep. Then a blinding light burst forth throughout the whole room. You cried out in shock. This is the last thing that you remember.\nSuddenly, a voice says: \n\"Franklin? Franklin, can you hear me?\" \nA shiver runs through you. Oddly enough, you aren't overcome with panic. But you do have an unpleasant, uncomfortable feeling that won't go away.\n\"Don't worry,\" the voice says.\nYou look around you and see a hologram light up, and the logo: \"Hexatech Labs\". That's when you realize you have every reason to be worried . . . \nMain Character\nSubject 13 is a third-person 3D immersive adventure game. You'll be directing Franklin as he explores various locations to resolve the mysteries surrounding them. To do this, you must think hard, use the available objects, and resolve several puzzles. You'll also get to choose dialog to make certain decisions. These answers will determine how you can collect more information on the main storyline. \nExploration\nSubject 13 has many different locales to explore. Each location has several interactive zones and secrets to discover!\n New WORK IN PROGRESS screenshots revealed: \nManipulating objects  \nThe game's puzzles are based on this mechanic. You'll have to turn them over and observe them in every nook and cranny. You'll even have to combine them to discover all the secrets. The most common place of objects could turn out to be full of surprises!\nOne-off puzzles\nThere will be several occasions where you'll have to tackle several puzzles to unlock access or specific objects.\nGraphics and soundtrack\nIt was crucial for us to work on the ambiance as much as possible. This piece of science fiction is presented as an adventure game, with the story and narration playing an important role. What better way to create this ambiance than working on the graphic and sound identity? \nWe conducted much research on the graphics to portray the oppressive and mysterious ambiance of Subject 13. \nTo make sure that you'll totally plunge into the adventure, we've planned some great voice acting. We've also carefully chosen a soundtrack for the title. \n Technical\nWe'll be using the UNITY game engine. With this engine, we'll be able to put the game on various targeted platforms. The engine's integrated editor offers major tools and advanced functions: \nMulti-platform management\nDynamic rendering of lights and cast shadows\nIntegrated static light calculation tool that generates directional lightmaps\nPhysics and collisions via the Nvidia PhysX engine\nSpecial effects and particle system with the Shuriken module\nAudio 3D management and integration of reverberation zones\nCamera Mapping\nTo show extremely rich and detailed environments to players, and to allow them to navigate within these backdrops, we'll be using a technique that is often used in film, but rarely in video games: Camera Mapping. This technique can animate a camera within a photograph, a pre-generated or drawn image. The process models enough information in 3D in the scene to reconstruct the parallaxes produced by the camera movement.\nImage-Based Lightning\nIBL is a dynamic lighting technique that involves capturing lighting information in a cubic texture and then reconstructing this light on objects in real-time. For more realism, HDR (High Dynamic Range) images may be used for higher light rendering resolution. Some AAA games use this technique for living room consoles (Forza Motosport 4, Need for Speed). We'll use this technique on object close-ups to obtain quality and very realistic rendering. \nPlateforms : PC/Mac, iOS, Android\nLanguages : Voice EN Only, EN, FR, DE, SP, IT\nRelease (estimation) : October 2014\nWe have tons of awesome rewards for our valued backers!

The game began by trying to represent a continuously changing city that adapts and morphs to each unique user. The design of the city has been in our minds since we were children; a city that is fantastical with a cyberpunk edge. We want it be as sublime as possible, mixing nostalgic suburban landscapes with futuristic urban boroughs.\nThe city is situated on an inverted sphere, providing an endless playing field without the traditional environmental tropes that stall one\u2019s exploration. Traditional mapping is impossible as the city is always reforming, the only way to unlock the secrets of the city is start an adventure and explore.\nCity + Location\nCities change every day. In HomeMake the environment will constantly change at an unnoticeable rate.  The concept of progression works on multiple scales. The overall scope of the game is one of progression, as the player evolves their understanding of the world and narrative, the city morphs and adapts, creating an ever changing cityscape. The totality of the system is never fully understood as a constant state of progression is maintained.The game will be set in Galaxy SEED (Stellar Earth Evolution Designer) Sumimoto. The main character lives on the inside of Sumimoto in the suburbs of the city sprawled around the inner surface. An inverted planet, the player travels along the interior surface of the sphere, providing a continuous playing field with no obvious boundaries.\nThe existence of the urban fabric as an inverted planet creates a variety of unique moments. Although the city development and types of spaces vary widely throughout, the constant factor acting on all structures is the gravity. Radiating from the center, buildings must thrust inward. Available air volume decreases as buildings grow. Negotiations and tensions arise and create architectural problems as buildings begin to bump into each other. The nature of the street, and the views of the city above are in constant dialogue with the battle happening between buildings as they clash in the sky.\nThe complexity of the views coupled with the sublime understanding of motion and relativity caused by the centralized gravity results in challenging platforming elements as players travel across the city hunting new goals.\nCity + Identity\nOur desires to explore such a city lead to the mind transfer game mechanic. We wanted to understand what it felt like to inhabit our city but not just from our own point of view. Every resident of a city has a unique take on the environment, with their own personal biases and experiences coloring their understanding, a wholly unique version of the same city lives inside everyone\u2019s heads. In exploring our city, we often found ourselves changing our characters attributes to gain a different perspective of our city through a new method of interaction. We want our game to explore these subjective understandings of space and how they related to the individual character.\nAs a result, Sumimoto is littered with multiple avatars, each with distinctive abilities, desires and biases. This causes multiple body swaps as one traverses the shifting cityscape. This piqued our imagination as we began to speculate on the possibility of multiple perspectives; our city is experienced a lot differently between different avatars. Playing as either a robot, a plant, or a hippo, not only will the city change to match your characters unique abilities, but perceptually the city will be represented in a new way, reflecting each character\u2019s take on the environment.\nCity + Desire\nGameplay revolves around perceptual based puzzles that require body swapping to unlock the secrets of the city. Different bodies provide different platforming advantages. Some run faster. Some see sound. Some talk smooth. The changing urban fabric encourages the player to swap bodies in order to address the immediate landscape around them.\nRegarding to the platforming elements, the constant changing of the city creates an ever expanding series of challenges that arise as geometry shifts and varies. It is at the player\u2019s own discretion that they determine the best character and exploration technique required to advance through the city.\n City + Sound\nOur music making experience is rooted in DJing. We want to add this experience of nonstop DJ mixing to the game, providing a continuous soundtrack to compliment the endless environment. As indicated by our opting for an essential mixtape, there will be no set OST for the game, instead different musical parts will blend into an endless tapestry based on environment and gameplay. The musical pieces move through genre from blues to jazz to funk to hip-hop to glitch, creating a hybrid sense of nostalgia and future.\n  The Duo\nFranklin Cosgrove (Cory) + Archgame (Matt) are architecture students by day and video game designers by night. The city in our game has been building in our minds since we were children in the Midwest, where vast urban fields are still fantasy. Franklin Cosgrove is a comic aficionado and animator, likely found at your local comic book shop every Wednesday. Archgame is a computer programmer and DJ, still preferring analog vinyl control when mixing his music digitally. \nAs architecture students, our two man team has extensive experience designing environments and 3D modeling.Our architecture has always been influenced by our experience in the digital environments of video games, now we\u2019d like to reverse this and create a video game that draws on our experience as architects.\nKigi\nKigi is our main robot. Gameplay wise, although he can\u2019t jump very high, he can run fast, see sound, and shoot light. An excellent skill to have when trying to navigate those congested city streets or when you\u2019re in some trouble with the local bullies. He hasn\u2019t always been so functional, however, and your first objective in HomeMake is to sneak out of the house, find all Kigi\u2019s missing parts and piece him together.\nSandwiches\nAllow us to introduce Sandwiches the fox. That's right. Sandwiches. Unlike Kigi, Sandwiches, is our most recent addition to the HomeMake cast. The idea came to us when thinking about a character who had to somehow navigate the city using a different sense other than vision. Unfortunately for poor Sandwiches, he is completely color blind, unable to enjoy the poly chromatic city around him. He doesn't seem to mind though as he has a keen sense of smell and a quick pace to make up for it.\n\nIso\nNext, we wanted to introduce you to another one of the main characters, Iso. For the most part, Iso is just a normal kid. You're already seen his pet fox, Sandwiches, and his robotic friend Kigi. Generally speaking, Iso is quite limited in his methods of exploration. He can't run too fast, he's not the best climber, and will therefore have to rely on the abilities of those close to him. Where he excels, however, is in his ability to talk his way out of problems. If you ever need choice information from the inhabitants of Sumimoto, Iso knows how to get it.\nHabo\nThe next character we'd like to introduce is Habo. We show this guy a little bit in the trailer but he is a hint at some of the more dangerous aspects of the city. All places have those spots you don't really want to be at a certain time of day and Sumimoto is no different. He may be a boss but who knows, maybe you'll get to know him first. He could just look scary. I mean, he can't be all bad right?\nCheck updates for more character bios!\nWebsites \nhomemakelovesyou.tumblr.com \narchgame.tumblr.com \nsoundcloud.com/archgame\nMedia\nCheck out some of these interviews and articles about HomeMake!\n\"A Gorgeous Disorienting Videogame Designed by Architects\" - WIRED\n\"Harvard Architecture Students turn Tokyo into Brain-Melting Digital Playground\" - KILLSCREEN\n\"What would happen if a builder\u2019s brain exploded?\" - ROCK, PAPER, SHOTGUN\n\"HomeMake features a clean, stunning art style, creative level design, and a unique concept that takes a metaphor for city architecture and lets us frolic in it.\" - CLIQIST\n\"HomeMake is as much a spiritual exploration as it is a physical one\" - INDIESTATIK\n\"In a world of brown and grey shooters and sword-swingers, bright and beautiful games like Homemake are a breath of fresh air\" - GAMESINASIA\n\"A constantly-changing city that\u2019s as much of a protagonist as the character you\u2019re playing.\" - THE BIT PULSE\n\"The game looks absolutely stunning.\" - FIST FULL OF POTIONS\n\"The first thing of the game that attracts me is it\u2019s aesthetics and the idea of the hollow world\" - PIXELFLOOD\n\"complexity of the views coupled with the sublime understanding of motion and relativity\" - WARPDOOR\n Budget\n20% Hardware\n60% Software (three dimension animated games are expensive)\n10% Rewards\n10% Fees\n Many of you have inquired about stretch goals, platforms/consoles and how our Kickstarter success will impact the game's design and distribution. We are more excited than ever about HomeMake's design and encourage everyone to continue sharing this project with as many people as possible.  \nWe disagree with the idea that there's direct correlation between quality and scope in a project like this. Our original funding goal was the bare minimum and maximum we needed to complete the game as we originally designed it. Recently we've seen a lot of games go beyond their original scope and end up spreading themselves too thin. We have no desire to make the same mistake.\n However, platform/console development does require additional resources outside of the game's original design. The more money we have, the better we can invest ourselves into working on HomeMake unencumbered and release the game to as many platforms/consoles as possible. We are artists first and foremost, so for us it is more important to get HomeMake into as many people's hands as possible over financial success. Currently we hope to release HomeMake on PS3, PS4, Wii, WiiU, and Xbox One, with Sega Dreamcast as a bonus. All extra funds will be put towards as wide a distribution as manageable. We know this seems ambitious, and therefore, we encourage everyone to continue sharing the game and supporting it. This way, we can share HomeMake with as many people as possible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith no previously published games, we understand we play the underdogs in this story.

A pistol, a mobile phone and a contact at The Agency are your tools. Use them well. Keep a cool head and maintain your cover, or the next hit could be on you.\nThe Hit is an original, multiplayer first-person stealth-shooter with a strong focus on procedural systems, emergent gameplay and dynamic narrative (Article on the player-driven dynamic narrative system I'm creating alongside The Hit)\nEquipment\nYour primary weapon will be a 9mm pistol. Suppressors will be available, but the emphasis will be on realism, so you'll never be as silent as you are deadly.\nAll agents carry a smartphone, which will be your only way of contacting the Agency when you're in the field. It comes with a smart map and a camera, which you can use to photograph other people in the city, and even call your own hits!\nMore equipment will be added if the stretch goals are met, including more weapons, explosives and a modular equipment system that will allow you to create a huge variety of specialist tools and weapons, turning your agent into a regular James Bond.\nThe City\nThe City is your hunting-ground, a sprawling metropolis populated by thousands of people. Anyone could be your prey, be they an office worker, a taxi driver or a rival hitman, controlled by an AI or even another player. Whoever it is, be fast and clean, and remember: the Agency is watching.\nNPCs are also watching, and may notice if you have your weapon drawn. They could even phone the police or panic and alert other players in the area, so keep it out of sight until you're ready to pull the trigger.\nThe Story\nThe game opens as your train pulls into the City. It's a cold winter, and the night is drawing in as you exit the station. Far off across the silent city, you can hear the sound of screaming above electropunk rhythms, and the voices of a thousand fans screaming back. Good, that means the streets will be empty, of people, police, distractions. Your phone bleeps an announcement. It's your contact at the Agency: \"Find a place to stay. await further instructions\" she orders, and you start off down the street, looking for a cheap hotel.\nIn The Hit, you play a recent recruit to The Agency, a powerful and shadowy covert-operations organisation. Over the course of the game, you'll ascend through its ranks, gaining new equipment, meeting new contacts, and making discoveries about the Agency's true agenda.\nThe Look\nI'm developing The Hit with an 100% focus on gameplay, and on making every player feel like a total badass. I'll carry on refining the graphics to make it look as good as I can, and if I reach the \u00a360,000 stretch goal, I'll be able to hire an artist to work with on developing the style further. The visuals are designed to make it easy for players to read complex situations. I've considered using more realistic graphics, but rejected the idea because it would slow down the gameplay and make it harder to read.\nThe current city environment is placeholder art, and will gradually be replaced as I improve the auto-architect and scene maker tools. The aim is to have unique interiors for every single building (and every floor, every room) in the city, and I'm optimistic that I'll be able to deliver that before launch day.\nThe Remix\nWith a powerful set of tools, you'll be able to create your own 'mix' of the city, and personalise streets, buildings, interiors, signs, the various factions which operate within the city, as well as the rules the city operates by. Every image in the game, from the Agency logo to license-plates will be editable with a simple image-editor. You'll be able to make buildings, complete with interiors, with the auto-architect tool, and it'll be possible to make your own items and weapons with the object creator.\nIf I can hit the \u00a360,000 stretch goal, I'll be able to include the Scene Maker tool, which I'm developing as part of the dynamic narrative system, and currently looks like this:\nbut I'll bring it in line with the rest of the game before launch. I'm working on adding editable textures, and more variation in the types of pieces available to build with. Objects can be tagged with smart labels, which will enable integration with the narrative and AI systems, basically making a set of coloured shapes behave like a gun, telephone, door, explosive briefcase etc. \nThe Technology\nCrowds\nTools and techniques developed specially for The Hit mean that crowd scenes with thousands of NPCs are now possible. Hits can take place in densely-populated environments like concerts, rallies and demonstrations. Riots and parades can fill the streets, providing cover and confusion for quick-thinking agents, and gameplay you've never experienced before.\nDynamic Destruction and Interiors\nDynamic, data-driven pseudo-voxels allow for realtime destruction and damage. Explosives can open doors, crack safes, destroy vehicles and provide well-timed distractions. Crashing vehicles will be able to destroy walls realistically, providing further gameplay options.\nThe same technology also allows for the creation of building interiors, with a dynamic level of detail. \nPlayer-Driven Dynamic Narrative\nThe Hit is being developed alongside a new player-driven dynamic narrative engine, and an ever-expanding set of authoring tools will be available to craft your own games, and tell your own stories. In The Hit game itself, I'm aiming to deliver a new kind of narrative, halfway between an authored narrative and an emergent, player-directed experience (Gamasutra article). \nWhy?\nThe idea for The Hit initially came to me back in 1993, when my teenage self was hooked on Bullfrog's Syndicate and fantasising about videogames of the future. I imagined a fully-dynamic city with reactive citizens and traffic, seen through the eyes of the agents: my friends and I playing together in complex, multi-stage missions. It seemed obvious that videogames were moving in this direction, and I'd be playing games like this as soon as the technology made it possible.\nAnd then AAA videogames happened, and first-person shooters became an industry staple. But with their 'corridor' structure and non-interactive stories, they weren't the games I wanted to play. Open-world games came close, but a design philosophy which valued accessibility over depth meant those games were more collections of simple minigames than a deep exploration of a possibility space. So I waited...\nThen, a few years ago I encountered Tarn Adams' incredible Dwarf Fortress, and the Unity Engine (and especially the Unity Asset Store), and I began to see how it might be possible for one person to make the game I was waiting for, and I started to plan and design in earnest. I also started to reskill. I've been coding since I was 11, but I needed to know every part of the process if I stood any chance of making The Hit. So I left my job and began to learn as much about game design as I could.\nThe Hit has been in development since January 2013. In that time, I've prototyped most of its features, and developed a data-driven workflow which will accelerate development on the rest. There's still a lot of work to do, but I'm confident that I can complete the core development by December 1st 2014, which gives me another year to recruit a team (stretch goals permitting) and make the game I've been wanting to play for two decades.\nI hope you'll join me.\nRewards\nA variety of rewards are available in addition to the game, including the Remix Kit, soundtrack album, 'Making of The Hit' art book, t-shirts and CDs (\u00a3100 tier and upwards) and a set of tools for Unity developers.\nT-shirt designs are not final. Backers will have a choice of at least three different designs.\nPlatforms\nThe Hit is being developed for Windows, Linux and Mac, I'm not ruling out a console release, but right now I'm focused on making the game as good as possible for these three platforms.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Hit is an ambitious project, and relies heavily on a number of original tools and techniques, any one of which could be a development risk. But it's also the game I've been wanting to play for the last 20 years, and nothing is going to stop me making it.\n\nSo, in order to make The Hit a possibility, I've spent much of the last year and a half designing, developing and refining the tools and techniques I'm using. All of the core gameplay mechanics, and most of the advanced features I'm planning to add to The Hit have already been built and tested, and a few of them have already made their way into some small games and prototypes. \n\nEverything so far has been created as a solo project, and if this Kickstarter is successful, I'll be able to finish the project as I started it. I've planned out the final stages of development, and I feel confident that I can release the alpha version in December, followed by the full game a year later.\n\nIf I can meet some of the stretch goals however, I'll be able to step up development a notch or six. Each goal will allow me to add more members to the team, and build upon the systems which have already been designed and prototyped. Most of the remaining work will be optimising these systems and refining the gameplay.\n\nI have a plan. I have the tools. If this Kickstarter succeeds, I'll have everything I need to bring you The Hit.\n\nThanks for your attention.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dan Stubbs\nFirst created \u00b7 54 backed\nHi, my name's Dan Stubbs, also known as aDFP on numerous online forums.

In each 20 minute game, players build a footballer's career. Compete to become the biggest name, using football to mock football in a silly and rather random way. You really, really don't have to know anything about football to love this game, but there are some hidden gems for the true fan. Embrace the madness and pledge today!\nNowadays, a successful footballer isn't merely human, he's a brand. But what makes a good brand? For starters - a celebrity wife - although you'll probably need to be at a good club to get one of them. After all that, you must remember she is only as valuable as the promo deal you use her to leverage.\nIn Next England Captain, take control of your career. Starting with nothing except promise, you gain points as you move to bigger clubs, and increase your on-field stature, your cash value, and your off-field respect. The ultimate ambition being not just to play for, but to captain England!* \n*Any ambition to actually win the World Cup while captaining England is beyond the scope and credibility of this game. Next England Captain is a satire, not a fantasy.\nGameplay Overview from Boardgames with Family\n Next England Captain builds stories about footballer's lives. Every time you play cards from your hand onto your mat you use up one of your five career tokens. If you don't like the cards in your hand you may discard instead but you're forced to take and play the top card from the deck which might result in a dramatic change of fortune.\nAll cards in the game have a value and are played into stacks of the same colour, but only the last card you play on any stack scores at the end.\nYou can't just play any card at any time. It (normally) isn't possible to get married without first having a girlfriend, for example.\nUse your career moves wisely, playing a maximum of one card per colour per turn, unless 'this is your year', and mastermind your unfolding career.\nCome on board and bring your friends. Unlike actual football, everyone can easily pick up and play Next England Captain. No special clothes or skills required!\nPremium Cards: The cards will be printed on 310gsm Ivorycore cardstock. This is 15% thicker than standard cardstock, more durable, totally opaque, and has a great snap.\n Wooden Components: I respect the economic decision to place plastic components in games, but for me the feel of wood is unrivalled.\nDurable Mats: The four player mats are 300gsm, and are printed on the top side. They have a matte varnish applied for durability and water resistance.\n Rules: Next England Captain's ruleset is tested and complete, you can take a look at it here. Professional typesetting will be finished before production.\n This Kickstarter is all about the game. Almost every reward and add-on involves a copy of it. In addition to this, there are a few tiers that not only get you the game but get you in the game. I took all the photos for this game, and any photos taken for these rewards will be my work.\nThe Pundit: In Next England Captain, there are many cards with quotes. For a small fee, you can find your name randomly allocated to a quote in the game. That's a little like being famous, I imagine.\nThe Gaffer: Not enough? Want to say something specific? Then you're the gaffer and you get to claim a quote of your choice. (quote allocations at 'the gaffer' level are first come, first served)\nThe Assem Allam: Don't know who he is? Within reason, and profanity permitting, name a rank '5' club in the game. (This would rate them as big as a mid-level Premiership team, in real world terms).\nA Celebrity Baby: I will take some photos, and a photo of your child will be placed into the game. You will also receive the DVD of the photoshoot with high resolution images. (examples of my work)\nThe Banned Agent: I will stalk you, take a clandestine photo of you, and subject to approval, place it into the game as the photo for the \"banned agent\" card. As with Celebrity Baby, you'll get a DVD, but the pictures will be less cute.\nWhether you want the game or want the world, there's a tier for you.

Say you are in the UK and pledge \u00a322, but select 'The Player' tier (valued at \u00a312).

I answered these two questions: \"What is a fair price for my game?\" and \"How many copies will I need to buy in order to make that price realistic?\". The first one was easy to answer: I asked a load of people their opinion and their most frequent answer agreed with my own feeling so I stuck with it.\nThe second question was harder. I obtained quotes from China and the UK for production runs from 250 to 10,000. Once I factored in all the variables (from import duties to distribution) I discovered that the smallest amount of money for which I can get one copy of Next England Captain to your door for \u00a312 is \u00a38,000.\nWhat, no profit? TheNext England Captain Kickstarter is not designed to turn a profit directly. It will, however, enable Too Much Games to purchase and distribute a number of extra games at a far lower cost than otherwise possible. This campaign is designed to deliver a great price for you and a great opportunity for us.\nIntroducing Panda GM: I have agreed manufacturing costs with Panda GM. They are not the cheapest manufacturer out there, but they have a great record of delivering Kickstarted games. When making board games, you pay a bit more, go with the good guys, and sleep well at night.\nI don't have \u00a38,000 under my mattress: I have loved Next England Captain since I scribbled it out on blank business cards and spent an afternoon playing it. I want to bring it to the world, and this is the only way I can achieve that. So what I'm saying is \"Help make my dream a reality and I'll throw in a game. And possibly a t-shirt.\".\nEarly Bird Prices: As a thank you to backers, Next England Captain's Kickstarter price (\u00a312) is a 20% discount off the retail price (\u00a315).\nReward Availability: We're producing enough add-ons to meet the demand of this campaign. Once the campaign is over, so is your chance to buy them.\nWe Need You: We have built the game and created the art and design, but without your help, we can't bring Next England Captain into people's homes.\n The project is being led by J-P Treen, founder of Too Much Games and serial creator of games. I am running the campaign and will be responsible of the delivery of your games and your add-ons. I am, however, not alone!\nNext England Captain is co-designed by Simon Farid, an artist currently specialising in identity. He's also a closet football trivia expert, and I think he's the only person in the world who gets every single reference in the game.\nThe beautiful graphic design has been created by Simon Wadsworth, who doesn't really care about football at all, yet heroically found the time to help me out, all at the same time as starting up Wraptious, a rather lovely art and design website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I've backed and researched other Kickstarters over the past year, I've learned that while having a finished product in-hand is a great start, a truly successful campaign needs a lot more. I've identified several common failings of board game Kickstarter campaigns that I have taken special account of when building the Next England Captain campaign.\n\nDelivery On Time: Some kickstarter projects have delivered very late on their promises. The top priority for Next England Captain is to deliver a quality game on time. To this end, we already have the game finished, we have a shipping solution in place, and we're using a well-known, high quality manufacturer.\n\nShipping: We plan to ship Next England Captain using 'Fulfilment by Amazon'. This is a low-cost, high-reliability solution that saves the project money and removes a lot of administrative overhead from the creator (me). From your perspective it means that shipping will be quick, and any problems with your deliveries will be handled swiftly by Amazon customer services.\n\nCosting of Rewards: One of the major threats to a Kickstarter campaign is the deliverability of its own rewards and add-ons. Unless very carefully planned, a project can fund succesfully but lose money and sometimes not even ship because some of the tiers either haven't been completely costed or too small a margin has been allowed for. This creates a funding total which is based not on game sales but on add-on sales, and leaves a project creator unable to purchase both the games and the add-ons without a financial loss. All rewards in Next England Captain add value to the campaign and have been costed so that no matter which reward tiers are most popular the project will achieve sufficient funds to ship all rewards as promised.\n\nDelivery of Artwork: Incomplete art can delay games beyond their estimated shipping date. The art for Next England Captain is complete and the game will ship as it is. No delays are anticipated due to this.\n\nThe Photographic Tiers: This is the only element of game production I have limited control over. If the project funds I will do my very best to schedule photo shoots swiftly, but the majority of my backers must come first. If a photographic tier is taken by a backer and for any reason a photo shoot has not taken place by the 31st of August I will refund the individual backer their money and the game will be produced without their image.\n\nPrototyping Delays: Next England Captain is finished, and complete. This does not mean it is perfect. Prototype cards have been received, and as a result, several tweaks to the card art have already be carried out. I anticipate two more rounds of revisions before locking the cards. The rules, while written and tested, have not yet been handed over for final graphic design. The box art is a work-in-progress, and I have not yet secured a barcode. I estimate it will take five weeks from the end of the campaign to get the game finalised for production.\n\nManufacturing Deliverability: Panda GM is a top Chinese manufacturer with an excellent reputation, well known for manufacturing many successful Kickstarter games. I have used them before, and trust their quality control and reliability.\n\nManufacturing Delays: The entire manufacturing process - including prototyping - is scheduled to take no longer than 155 days. Assuming Kickstarter releases funds by the 30th of July, and everything goes to plan, the game will arrive in the UK for distribution by the 1st of January 2015.\n\nProject Timescale: It's reasonable to expect delays and allow time for distribution. I allow a calendar month for unexpected delays and two weeks to facilitate UK distribution. I anticipate all UK and Western European buyers to receive their copies of the game by the end of February 2015.\n\nI'm sure there will be a few other hiccups in the process, but we believe we have ample time, ingenuity and perseverance to overcome them.

We would like to reflect the different things you might find in nature, not just leaves.  We are sticking to one colour at the moment to keep the costs down.  \nThe game will be presented in a small branded cotton drawstring bag. Standard tuck-boxes look great, but we've found that for small hands they're not always practical. Our user testing revealed that children found it easier to put the cards back in the bag after the game rather than a box. The bag size is still small enough to fit into a coat pocket, making this the ultimate travel game.\nHow to play the game\nGame play is flexible to fit with the number of players you have and how adventurous you're feeling and there are only two rules.\n1. No living things! a worm might well make you say 'yuck', but it probably feels the same about you! Best leave it in the ground.\n2. Leave growing flowers for the insects and other people to enjoy!\nThe following are ways you can play the game;\ngofindit fast  - Deal five cards to each player (or less if you have more than 6 players). It's a simple race to be the first to find objects that fit each card.\ngofindit first - Give the pack a good shuffle and turn over the top card. Everyone looks at the card and then the race is on, the first person back to the base with something that matches the card wins that round and keeps the card. Turn over the next card on the deck and go again. The person with the most cards at the end of the pack (or pre-agreed amount or time) wins the game.\ngofindit fantastic fit - Each player gets dealt three random cards. The player must then find one item that corresponds to all three cards. For example a player who picked 'soft', 'round' and 'yellow' could find a yellow flower. The first player back to the base with an item wins. \nAbout us\nWe work for Sensory Trust, a charity based in Cornwall, UK.  We are passionate about nature and the outdoors and we work to break down the barriers that prevent marginalised groups accessing the outdoors. See examples of our work. Last year we set about designing games, activities and resources to encourage children of all ages and abilities to get outside, discover nature and have fun.  When we created and started testing gofindit we knew we'd hit upon something special.  Children of all ages and abilities connected with the game and started suggesting ways we could improve it and make it more fun and challenging.  Over the last six months we have been tweaking, testing and improving the game until we have something that we want to share with the world.  This is our first time at crowdfunding but we have ran lots of successful projects connecting a wide diversity of groups with the outdoors.  Check out our national project Let nature feed your senses.  Your support will not only help us to produce our game, but also enable us to continue our work with people who lack the opportunity or the means to get outside and have fun.\nThe rewards\nA gofindit cotton drawstring rucksack - the perfect companion to any outdoor adventure, featuring the gofindit one colour logo. (Note: this is just a mock-up of what it will look like)\nThe poster (84.1 x 59.4cm) will be printed by a local specialist printer just 10 miles away from our HQ. The poster will look great in any bedroom, classroom, Scout hut,  outdoor ed centre etc. We will only be making 50 posters and each one will be numbered and signed by the designer. Posters will be shipped in a protective tube.\nGet your name (or dedicate it to someone else) on our rule card with a massive thank you for supporting us.  Space is limited; so are the rewards! \nBecome our ultimate fan and get your (or someone you love's) face drawn onto the back of every card.  Below is an example of what it could look like.  The final card will have 6 faces on and 4 of these are up for grabs.\n         Why we need your help\nWe have finalised the rules and 90% of the artwork, but we need a cash injection to take the next step of actually putting the game into production. 100% of funds raised from this Kickstarter will go into production of gofindit. Post Kickstarter we would like to get gofindit into national retailers and educational catalogues.  \nReview of gofindit\nKickstarter review site Pixelated Sausage have made gofindit one of their picks of the week. Check out the review.\nEnvironmentalist Mark Avery mentions gofindit on his blog\nStretch goals\nHelp us to unlock our stretch goals and give you an ever better product!\nNote on currency conversions\nWe know that not every one works in \u00a3s so we have indicated the $USD equivalent for pledges to help our lovely international backers.

Whether you're running a quick one-shot to hook some rookie players or a run-from-hell for some seasoned campaigners, this deck can help you put together the bones of the dungeon in seconds so you can focus your time on the flavour and details that'll make every room truly epic.\nEvery card features a single trap or treasure which an adventuring party might find in any random dungeon room. Flip a card and learn your party's fate, it's literally that easy. Will they find glorious treasure or a measly 10 gold pieces? Will they step simply over a basic trip wire or face the terror of the dreaded Custard Pit Trap (which might sound funny but when you plummet into a hard surface and then find yourself sinking into its cloying depths, much less amusing, except for you as the GM of course!)\n(Please note, all card designs are not final. The dice in the corner frame, in particular, will be changed for the final product to ensure fair distribution of their respective rolls across the deck)\nNot every treasure is amazingly helpful\nBut most of the traps can and will be deadly!\nThe deck is multi-functional, also working perfectly well as just a nice and amusing deck of playing cards, and also featuring a full set of dice in the corner so you can use the cards to deal out your dice rolls (particularly helpful for bringing in rookie players who might not have brought their own dice). As we go through the process we're also hoping to add a number of other functions to the deck, including random room sizes/shapes to help you deal out the structure of your dungeon as well as its contents, and several other ideas we're hoping to bring into the final version of the cards.\nThe Cards will be printed in the UK on high quality materials, to ensure they look great and last a long time. \nThe box has been designed to look reminiscent of a treasure chest, which as we all know can often be trapped\nAbout Lawlock Games:\nLawlock Games is the brainchild of Richard Law, a veteran DM who's been running games in all sorts of systems for years. He also creates and runs the children's game every year at the UK Games Expo and has been thinking up ideas for games since he was a child. For years Richard's had more ideas than he knows what to do with, but it wasn't until he met freelance illustrator and animator Graham that he finally found an outlet for his plans.\nGraham D. Lock has been a professional freelancer since 2010, paying the bills by drawing, designing and animating just about anything for clients around the world. Working for everyone from one-person start-ups to blue-chip multi-national corporations, he's an experienced drawer-of-many-things and after years of drawing his own characters from the weekly roleplaying game he enjoys (DMed by Richard of course), Richard's finally found something useful for him to be drawing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the risks have hopefully already been addressed, with printing and distribution of the decks already sorted and most of the pre-production work already completed. The only real pitfall is in creating the full complement of cards themselves.

As an experienced freelancer he's confident of his timeline for production so there shouldn't be any delays providing we meet the funding target.\n\nObviously, though, this is our first Kickstarter project and there may well be the odd teething problem along the way.

It\u2019s a papercraft version of an enchanted board game with tactical, turn-based RPG gameplay in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics.\nPopup Dungeon is as vast as your imagination. You can jump right in with pre-made characters, weapons, and abilities, or create it all from scratch.\nKey Features\nRoguelike: permanent death, quick gains, procedural dungeons, and a mixture of handcrafted and procedurally generated loot\nTactical Turn-Based RPG: fast-paced, strategic game play\nInfinitely Extensible: Users can easily create: weapons, abilities, characters, and enemies.\nPapercraft: We hand-fold every pixel to ensure every dungeon is fresh and lively for you!\nMultiplayer: Hot Seat or Online Coop (Versus mode is a Stretch Goal)\nFlexible Party Size: Dungeon Crawl alone or with a party\nVariable Challenges: Choose the dungeon crawl that's right for your schedule, from single-seaters to infinite descents.\nPersistent Gains: Charms awarded by The Wizard after a run are permanent and give every character under your control a bonus. They are quite magical. Collect and combine them to achieve curious effects.\nExperienced Team: Made by Triple.B.Titles, an independent studio that has previously taken a game from Kickstarter to Steam.\nMORE THAN JUST DUNGEONS\nPopup Dungeon will include many other tile sets in addition to the basic dungeon. Backers at the Juror level and higher will be able to vote on which we'll make.\nHere's a video of our Haunted House tile set still in its early stages:\nDUNGEON MASTER SYSTEM ADDED\nBy popular demand, we've shifted development priorities around to include the Dungeon Master system. Read more about it here!\nCLICK TO VIEW IN HIGH-DEFENITION\n  Thank you for your support!\nCreation is a key part of Popup Dungeon. Users can create and customize every aspect of their heroes from their look and theme music down to their weapons and abilities. Build your heroes using our extensive library of assets or import your own and make something truly unique.\nYour weapon is your source of power! But there's no auto-attack in Popup Dungeon. Instead, think of your weapon as a focus or power-source for all of your abilities. Melee weapons can boost a short-range slash attack as well as a heal, while longbows and sniper rifles may favor long-range abilities: it's all about the range modifier, which you yourself can customize!\nAs with armor and other pieces of gear, players can earn weapons by defeating enemies, opening treasure chests, destroying props, or purchasing them from the Vendi-Machine.\nThey can also create original weapons that will be added to the list of possibilities they may encounter throughout their journey. Here\u2019s how:\nImport an image (use transparency or a color key background)\nA weapon's potency is automatically assigned by level\nChoose a range modifier:\nRange modifiers add potency to abilities aimed at targets that are a specific distance from you\nChoose from a list of available damage types; your weapon will add extra potency to abilities using this damage type\nSelect a bonus (extra potency, additional damage types, extra range modifiers, and effects such as chance to stun, critical, or even add custom flags to targets like \"Fishy\"). These flags can enhance or modify the effects of skills.\nOne of the most fun aspects of game design is dreaming up cool new abilities, but mathematically balancing them and implementing their AI can be difficult and tedious. Popup Dungeon takes care of all of the boring stuff, unleashing your imagination as a creator!\nAbility creation is fast, fun, and easy!\nHere\u2019s how you can create your own ability in just minutes (these steps can be performed in almost any order):\nCustomize look and name\nChoose from hundreds of effects\nAdd Experience Points\nDetermine Activation Cost\nSet Range and Area of Effect\nOptionally: Add Negative and Conditions to enhance the ability's potency of positive effects\nFor more detailed information and to learn how to create your own ability in about five minutes, watch this video:\nEver wonder how a space marine would deal with goblins and dragons?

In Dungeon Master mode, one player acts as the Dungeon Master, manipulating the environment, using special DM abilities to alter the course of an adventure, and controlling the legions of enemies pitted against other players or a party controlled by the AI.\nNow that you've created your weapon, ability, character, or enemy, you can share and compare it with your friends and other players. Using the Steam Workshop, browsing user-generated content will be fast and friendly, putting a nearly inexhaustible source of new characters, items, and challenges right at your fingertips (and making sure your creations are seen too!)\nThe game play is something like Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com meets a Dungeons and Dragons board game. It's turn-based and the movement is handled on a simple grid. While Popup Dungeon will not be \"twitch-based\" or require lightning reflexes, we hope to make the action as lively as possible, with fast-paced, decisive combat.\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nEach run will play differently. The gear you receive and the type of enemies you encounter can present radically different challenges. And with the option to automatically download user-generated enemies and bosses, you never know what lurks in the shadow!\nPopup Dungeon will feature all manners of game mechanics you can expect from games like these, and maybe even some you don't expect! The extensive customization and user-creation system will allow players to put nearly any strategy they can imagine into effect (within reason!)\nPopup Dungeon is flexible. You can go on a lone quest with a single character or control an entire party. We will be play testing and accepting feedback to determine the maximum party size. Our goal is to strike a balance between turn-duration and clutter in relation to flexibility and allowing you to play with larger groups of friends.\nThe dungeon will scale in size, increase in enemy population, and adjust in difficulty according to how many party members you use.\nEach party member can be controlled by a different player via Hot Seat or Online multiplayer. You can play the entire game coop if you'd like or control the entire party yourself.\nThe gear you'll find crawling the depths of our dungeons features a blend of handcrafted and procedural elements. For instance, a weapon's primary statistics and effects are determined by its creator, the potency is determined by its level, whether or not it includes its bonus is determined by its quality, and it also has a chance to include an extra, procedurally selected enhancement.\nThe inventory is simple too! Replace, drop, or turn items into gold on the spot. There's no digging through bags, going to town, or playing Tetris with odd shapes in an inventory screen.\nWin or lose, The Wizard grants you a parting gift: your choice of three prize capsules, each containing a magical Charm. If you don't like the first one you pick, you can always choose again, but the empty capsule remains and the three are shuffled. Choose an empty capsule, and your prize is an abject lesson in the woes of gambling.\nThe deeper you've delved into the dungeon, the more powerful the charms will be, and more powerful charms enable you to go further than you ever have. How deeply will you bury yourself?\nAnd hardcore roguelike players may like to know that the game will feature \"uncharming\" achievements, which can be won only by facing the dungeon without the aid of any Charms.\nYou don't HAVE to make everything. In fact, you don't even have to find everything. You can always buy your way to greatness. After all, it's The Wizard's gold, and he wants it back.\nEncounter various \"vending\" machines scattered about the dungeon depths, allowing you to purchase equipment, upgrade items, reclaim your experience points, and more using in-game gold you collect from your adventures.\nPortals of Fate are optional, high-risk, high-reward, passages that can make or break a run. You never know what lies beyond the portal. It could be a horde of treasure, a vending machine room, an extra-tough boss battle, a whole other dungeon level, or a room of wall-to-wall minotaurs!\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nOur hope is that Portals of Fate will help keep every run fresh and unique by providing game-changing gear and challenges.\nPremise\nLong ago or yet to be, a Wizard from another world stabbed his tower into the side of the Earth like an immense dagger. It pierced into stone and time, deeper than anyone can ever dig. The only way in is through portals scattered around the world. These portals are disguised as enchanted board games, and they come with an invitation:\n\u201cCome, morsels. Your bodies do not interest me; it is human imagination which I invite into my domain. Only the greatest of you will reach the high spire of my lair, now buried deep in the roiling rock. And I will be waiting, fork in hand, to devour the banquet of your creativity with a side of wits.\u201d\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nArt Style\nVisually, Popup Dungeon is an enchanted board game, sort of like a cross between Jumanji and a Dungeons and Dragons board game. The dungeon unfolds, sometimes literally, in front of your character as you explore. It is presented in a papercraft style, but our goal is to make it as lively as possible, with rich animations and particle effects.\nThe papercraft style makes user-created content much simpler. You only need to create a 2D rendering of a weapon, for instance, and the game will take care of the rest. It\u2019s also worth noting that these 2D images are not treated as flat \u201csprites,\u201d but rather as cut-out pieces of paper with thickness.\nCLICK TO VIEW IN HIGH-DEFENITION\nMusic\nThe soundtrack we\u2019re aiming for is rich and orchestrated, featuring epic heroic themes, atmospheric tracks, and jaunty medieval tunes. It will be conducted and realized by the very talented Gabriel Lefkowitz.\nCharacters with Character\nPopup Dungeon will contain a wealth of colorful characters with loads of abilities and customization, so if you don't want to take the time to create your character from scratch, you'll be able to get going with one of these.\nCLICK TO VIEW HIGH-DEFENITION SCREENSHOT\nYou'll be able to organize your collection of characters into their own neat little boxes that you create, like Favorites, Cameos, New Downloads, Classic Games, Comics, etc.\nWe hope to have all the fantasy staples, but we'd like to include plenty of unexpected characters as well. Backers ($29 and up) can vote on which optional characters we create.\nHaunted House Tile Set\n Our Kickstarter trailer only shows the dungeon tile set, but the final version of the game will include many more tile sets, depending on this Kickstarter project's success.

Our previous Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded in 2012, allowing us to complete Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages, delivering all promised content and then some!\nIf this Kickstarter is successful, we predict it will take us about 2 years to reach a \u201creleased\u201d state. We hope, however, to have beta and early access long before then, as gathering information and feedback on balancing is key to Popup Dungeon\u2019s success. Fans of Ring Runner will attest to the fact that we really and truly listen to our players\u2019 feedback, at times implementing ideas and changes mere days after they were proposed. Obviously, we can\u2019t include everything, but that won\u2019t stop us from trying!\nWhy $80,000?\nWe estimate Popup Dungeon will take us about 2 years to complete. After software expenses ($10,000-$12,000), the cost of generating the soundtrack (amount not disclosed to protect our composer\u2019s privacy), taxes and Kickstarter's take, and of course, all our debts and ongoing payments this is the minimum that we can realistically live on for that time without having to take on extra jobs. That and because we're suckers for round numbers!\nBut in all seriousness, it's very important to us to have Popup Dungeon finished in a timely fashion. For two main reasons, one financial, the other personal.\nFinancial\nIt took us about 5 years to develop Ring Runner because we were going to college during this time, working other jobs (some part-time, others full-time), and learning the trade. If we would've completed Ring Runner in the two years we initially set, we might've not needed to return to Kickstarter again to ask for your help, but divided schedules and long development cycles can really hurt games and a small studio's ability to legitimately make them.\nIt's almost impossible for us to guess what the state of the gaming industry will be like in 5 years. For instance, XNA seemed like a good choice for Ring Runner's development when we started, but it was discontinued before we were even finished with the game.\nPersonal\nMy wife, Courtney, and I (Enrique) live in a house just outside of Dallas, Texas with my brother, Paul. Prior to Ring Runner's release, I was working and studying at the University of Texas at Dallas along with my brother.To this day, my wife has been working a full-time job to supplement our income from Ring Runner's release last year. She comes home at night after 9 p.m. every day.\nSince I met Courtney during the course of Ring Runner's development, it's been her dream to be able to dive heart-and-soul into making games with us. She's the artist responsible for all the lovely characters and enemies you see -- and frankly, we need her!\nMy dream is to make her dream a reality -- to let her work 10-12 hours, 7 days a week like we do, but on something that makes her proud, happy, and takes full advantage of her talents. And hopefully, we'll be able to afford a home of our own after Popup Dungeon's release, so we can raise a family.\n\nInspirations and Special Thanks\nFinal Fantasy Tactics - A True Classic\nXCom - Whose creator, Julian Gollop, has a Kickstarter running now!\nMini Dungeon Adventures - To Jim Bowen, David Carico, Brad McElwee, John Cliett & Jared Lohr.

We want to create a game that is just as unique as it is entertaining; something that will always keep you coming back for more. The Universim aims to unleash you upon the universe with the powers of a god to begin forging your galactic empire in the stars. The ability to play as a god gives you unparalleled power, but unlike other god-games, you cannot interact directly with your population in the game. However, you can influence their decisions and change the way in which your civilization evolves. It is up to you to decide which technology path they follow and what kind of research they undertake-you have the power to shape their future. Instead of taking control of a static game world that awaits your every command, life will go on as you would expect. You are effectively taking control of a living simulation. Like a ball of clay on a potter's wheel, the world will keep spinning, but you will be there to mould it to your liking. Although, the ball of clay may or may not slap your hand away at times. \nCan't back through Kickstarter? We Support PayPal! \nPledged Via PayPal: $12,123 \n(updates once every 24 hours)\nYour civilization will begin in the Stone Age and steadily progress, advancing beyond the modern era, then moving into the age of intergalactic exploration and colonization. The game will feature a similar evolutionary path to the human race, but players will have the tools to shape their civilization\u2019s progress. You will need to think carefully when making decisions about things such as their research path. Some things may be far more important than others, depending on the situation and era. Even though you may think that fancy new gadget is worth dying for, you will also need to consider how it could be used while your people are slowly turning into fossils.\nBuildings and society will evolve as you progress from era to era; certain special buildings will become available once you research a particular technology. Buildings will begin to spring up around what we call The Epicenter, the central heart of every city in the game. You can place an Epicenter in any feasible region on the planet that supports cities, and buildings will begin developing around it as your population grows. The buildings are constructed by the AI and thus are built dynamically around the Epicenter, meaning you cannot select where they are built. However, you can still place special buildings wherever you want to! Buildings will grow dynamically based on the conditions around your Epicenter. In certain environments, your population and buildings will grow faster, but in cold environments, deserts, and other rather inhospitable areas, food may be scarce and therefore will hinder development. \nIn The Universim, resources play a major role in the game; they govern the integrity and growth of your civilization. Resources can be used in various ways: to create new technologies, to expand your empire, to research exciting or life-saving inventions, and to help your civilization\u2019s advancement through the ages. This is what makes intergalactic exploration so much more important in the space-age! \nThe space era will be the culmination of all your hard work. All of the choices and decisions you have made will truly begin to bear fruit, and reveal their consequences, if any exist. This is when you will begin to discover all of the beauty and mercilessness of alien planets. Whenever you discover a mysterious new planet, it will be an exciting experience... \nEvery planet you encounter in the game will be as unique and vibrant as the last. You will come across planets with varying temperatures and environmental conditions as well as a wide range of characteristics that make them incredibly special. Planets will also undergo the changing of seasons which can affect the many environmental biomes on the planet. It can cause rapid changes in temperature and conditions. This can have a major effect on the gathering of food and resources as well as the development of buildings. The game will keep track of the time and date, and will change the seasons according to the in-game timeline. Summer offers the best food yield and growth period due to its favourable weather, while winter can bring many negative effects. Some winters may go by quickly, while others will drag on. Fortunately our in-game News System will inform you about upcoming winters. So you better prepare for long winters by storing food in advance. Failure to do so may starve your civilization to death over the course of the season.\nColonizing a planet requires a little preparation beforehand. The Go button is not the miracle button, unfortunately. There may be a few issues that will need to be resolved first. If adequate research about the planet is not done, it may result in the untimely demise of your colonization team.  It can be rather difficult to walk on molten lava while fending off giant space mosquitoes with nothing but a can of sunblock! Particularly while wearing the previous mission's sub-zero equipment. \nIn order to keep track of all of this information and help you to explore the universe more easily, we came up with a simple way to manage your galactic endeavours; by clicking on any star in the sky, you can utilise our intuitive GUI to quickly navigate the various planets represented by the stars and reveal extensive details about them, like how far away they are and what kind of conditions you can expect to find. This will allow you to discover new planets and colonize them if you have the right technology. There will also be a number of unlockable and upgradeable options available here. For example, you can research an all-terrain Rover that can be sent to recon a new planet. The Rover will be able to provide more details about the planet\u2019s conditions, environment, and the various resources it possesses. This can be incredibly helpful when deciding whether or not you want to colonize a planet or move on to the next. \nThe Universim is driven by dynamic events. Natural disasters, alien visitors, diseases, war, famine, riots, and so much more can be thrown at your civilization at any time. All of these factors and how you play the game, contribute to population growth and development. When something like the plague strikes, it is up to you to quickly strategize on how you will help your civilization overcome this disaster. The way you are able to fight certain disasters changes from era to era. Cavemen do not exactly have P.H.D's in science and the knowledge to create cures, for instance. However, you can trigger disasters if you are displeased with your civilization\u2019s choices. With every action they perform that goes against your wishes, you generate wrath, which can then be unleashed upon them at any time.\n\nWe are planning to have up to 12 different viruses in the game that each have unique qualities and effects. It is probably a good idea to prepare new variants of antibiotics in advance to counter future viral outbreaks. Certain viruses will spread slowly through your population, but will be difficult to cure. Others may be easier to cure, but will spread faster and possibly cause more damage if not caught in time. You may even encounter types that fly completely under the radar and spread throughout your cities and colonies by sneaking aboard planes and interplanetary shuttles. Pay attention to the in-game News System for early signs of a breakout!\nEvery now and then, something mysterious may fall upon one of your planets. You can then prepare an expedition to investigate these rare occurrences, if you so wish. Expeditions can be organized at any time, assuming you have the resources. The further an Expedition needs to travel, the riskier it becomes and the more resources it will require. Fallen material can be incredibly valuable to your civilization. It may be a new technology that will boost the well-being of your civilization dramatically, or it could be a meteor containing some kind of valuable resource that will open up more research options. Then again, it could also be an unprecedented disaster waiting to happen; such as an explosive compound that upon disturbing, wipes out part of the planet, or a deadly virus lying in wait. It can be seen as a high-risk, high-reward kind of system. \nOne more feature that we are really excited to implement is the Dynamic News System. It will not only inform you about important game events, but it will also have a few incredibly humorous stories to tell. We hope to eventually give players the ability to write their own stories and events for any particular time period and share them with the community. Of course, this will be moderated. We can\u2019t have the world invaded by inappropriately named extraterrestrials after all! These stories will be displayed in-game for everyone to enjoy. You can even construct an actual mission-based storyline for players to follow. You can also select the exact age and type of event that will trigger your news headline, or the new story campaign. With this system, every time you play the game, there will always be a seemingly infinite supply of entertaining stories in the News System. You can choose whether you want to follow someone\u2019s storyline or simply enjoy the stream of news in Sandbox Mode. This community system is called The Universim Live News System.\n\n The beauty of this kind of game is the huge amount of freedom that we have to experiment and continue to add amazing new content before and after its launch. That is what makes all of the hard work worth it! We have only scraped the surface of what we can accomplish with the information and features listed here. With the community by our side, we can undoubtedly transform this game into the best planet management game ever created. We are always willing to listen to what you have to say. We take your feedback seriously and want to ensure that we are spending the budget responsibly and on the features YOU want to see in the final game. \nIn-Game Object Editor.

It plays a huge role in creating the perfect atmosphere and we are investing a lot of time and effort into communicating the mood of the game with the player not only through visual design, but with a dynamic music system that will adjust to your play-style and in-game events. Planets will breathe with the essence of sound, from ambient city sounds to ear-popping disasters and explosions. Almost every object on the planet will produce its own audio. Music in The Universim will also be a great addition to our messaging system. You will know something has gone wrong when intense music erupts from the wake of a disaster. Otherwise, you will enjoy soothing, motivational tones when everything is going smoothly. With the help of an incredibly talented composer, The Universim will not only look outstanding, but it will sound amazing as well.\nThe Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Magic\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Light Universe\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Fantasy Dream\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Mystery Space\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Dense Atmosphere\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Legacy Of The Future\nWe have high hopes of getting the game out onto as many platforms as possible. At the moment though, we are focusing primarily on PC, Mac, and Linux for the initial release of the game. Like many developers, we are also excited about the possibility of developing for the new generation of consoles. We are also immensely interested in seeing how something like the Oculus Rift and other VR devices can add a whole new dimension to gameplay. If the game is successful, we see no reason why we wouldn't try to shoot for the stars and get the game out on as many platforms as possible for players to enjoy. Do not fear, though! We will ensure that we deliver the best possible experience on every platform we develop for and try our best to make use of the strengths of each one to the fullest. \nWe want to deliver a challenging and innovative gaming experience in an independent capacity and therefore Kickstarter is the best way to make that dream a reality. Because a game built by gamers with a budget supplied by gamers just seems to be a formula for success! \nWe want to forge an amazing community and give them the freedom to be creative, interact and meet new friends, and help us to develop the best game we possibly can. We have been receiving a few offers from some amazing publishers that love the concept and design of The Universim, but we are declining all of them as we wish to remain creative and open-minded. We want the community to be the driving force of this game, and the best way to do that is to remain independent. That is why we need your help!\nWe wish we could share even more details about the game with you, but even Kickstarter has its limits. Character limits that is! Please feel free to ask questions, leave comments, and interact with the dev team and community on our forums. This is our first project and we want to be as transparent as possible (without ruining some surprises of course!).\nCrytivo Games is a small team of enthusiastic dreamers from around the world. We are a diverse, multicultural team of talented individuals working together to create something truly beautiful, driven by a singular goal. Our team consists of some incredible designers, 3D artists, developers and sound engineers. Now, without further ado, meet the crew!\n What's the funding used for?\nWe will be pouring every last cent we receive directly into the development of The Universim. Most of the money will ensure that the team can create the best experience possible for the player. Every additional bit of funding we receive will be used to improve the game in various ways. From gameplay right down to the smallest of details. With the right amount of funding, it could be possible to add entirely new features to the game, such as the Multiplayer component.\nBut we mustn't forget about the various taxes and costs that will take quite a large chunk out of our funding. We also need to make provision for the costs of all physical goods and shipping for certain reward tiers. There really are a lot of things we need to burn through before we can safely begin using the budget for the game itself. But fear not backers, everything has been taken into account. Whatever support you can offer will help us enormously in the long run, no matter how small!\nSocial Links:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA game of this scale is not going to be easy to develop. We will need to hire many more talented developers in order to get it to the quality that the community expects. We also need to work very carefully with the budget. Complications always spring up during development, we have made provision for this, but it can still spiral out of control. We will do everything in our power to avoid this. It can also go very smoothly if fortune favours us.\n\nAnother problem is the matter of the final game's release date. We would love to have it out by the end of 2015, but that may be delayed with the inclusion of new features such as Multiplayer, or other community-suggested features. That is why we are releasing the game in stages, beginning with the Alpha phase, moving into Early Beta, and eventually hitting final Beta where the last touches will be made before release. From then on, we will begin working on additional free content and any patches if they are needed.\n\nBeing independent has its ups and downs. We are effectively on our own as far as things like publishing, marketing, and legal stuff are concerned. We hope to release the game on Steam and other digital distribution services as well as our own, which will be linked to our site (and will be completely DRM free). One more thing that might hinder development is the inability to acquire a trademark for our game. It is unlikely that King.com trademarked the word \u2018The,\u2019 but we cannot rule out any possibilities!\n\nThere are many other risks and challenges that may crawl out of the woodwork, but we believe that we will be ready for most of them.

Those have sold out, and are no longer available.\nThose first edition decks proved far more expensive to print and post than the 54 card decks we're now using, due to their non-standard size, so we've decided to produce a new 54 card version of the character cards deck, to enable future reprints.\nInternational Shipping Costs\nAs we get so many orders from the US we've managed to arrange discounted shipping for US backers, so there's no extra charge. For international backers within the EU we'll need \u00a33 extra on your pledge and for those outside the EU we'll need \u00a35 extra (however many decks you pledge for).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and we've learnt a lot from each previous project.\n\nThe major complications in our first project were two-fold: \n\n1) Producing custom large-print decks for a small number of backers. We tried to do this at a price point the backers could afford, but in doing so we ended up losing money on each of those decks.\nThis taught us that we needed to be more careful when taking suggestions from our backers; we have to thoroughly check the costs and work out every step required for anything new we want to offer.\n\n2) Postage costs: We used \"squeeze goals\"; squeezing more cards into the base deck, to fuel the growth of the first kickstarter. This produced an 80 card deck, which turned out to be twice as expensive to deliver to backers as the original 56 card deck would have been.\nIt's for that reason that we now produce multiple 56 card decks. The delivery costs stay lower for longer, allowing us to keep offering good value and yet end up with our balance sheet in the black :-).\n\nIn the second kickstarter the largest mistake we made was actually right at the end: When sending out the surveys to gather people's addresses, we failed to confirm which decks they'd backed for. This meant a mad scramble of private messages to gather those important details before our shipping process could be completed.\nWe've learnt from this that we need to write the survey questions ahead of time. Fortunately, Kickstarter have now added the ability to save surveys, making it far easier for us to do so :-).\n\nWe know that we'll encounter some new problems in this kickstarter, but we also know that we've shown, time and again, that we have the wherewithal to deal with whatever issues arise, and the strength of will not to give up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "44 hours left for Shards Worldbuilding Zine", "update_content": "Shards: Worldbuilding Zine is our current ongoing project, as part of Kickstarter's Zine Quest.

When a murdered detective is 3D printed back into existence, he reopens his last case to uncover what he missed--a hunt that reveals AI corruption, corporate espionage, and the conspiracy that may have led to Earth's doom.\nCheck out our prototype design for our EXCLUSIVE BACKER T-SHIRT ($100 reward tier):\nBack at the $75 level to receive this custom-embroidered, exclusive, MARSTOPIA RESIDENT patch and to get your name in the game & credits!\nLAST LIFE is an epic story told in three engrossing episodes.  Our first funding goal will enable us to deliver Episode One.\nGameplay is inspired by modern point and click adventure games like Kentucky Route Zero and Telltale's Walking Dead series.  Like them, LAST LIFE focuses on atmosphere and storytelling, while also challenging the player's detective skills of interrogation and deduction.\nYou are Jack Parker, recently slain P.I.; Earth was destroyed 11 years ago; and no one is having a particularly good day on Mars. Yet, here you are: back for 4 hours.\nRace your way through the glittery mean streets of MarsTopia as Jack Parker hunts down his own killer.\nWrangle deadly secrets out of an enormous cast of bizarre characters using whatever works: charm, bribes, or something less pleasant.\nUncover the inner workings of the squeaky-clean United Corps, which run the planet like clockwork.\nDrink DNA-enhanced brewskis\nBreak robots.\nGAMEPLAY PROTOTYPE\nThe following scene is ripped right out of the middle of the game. It was originally created to test the adventure game systems such as dialogue, camera movement, and character animations. In it, Parker is trying to find Misty, who has the money he needs to extend his life on MarsTopia.\nEleven years before our story opens, all life on Earth was ended.  Now, only a few million humans still exist, scattered throughout the remaining civilized colonies of the solar system--forever exiled.  \nP.I. Jack Parker was one of the lucky few to have escaped Earth's tragedy.  \nOn that infamous day, he just happened to be working a case on MarsTopia, the crown jewel among these colonies on the red planet.  He survived on that destination resort development, but half-wished he hadn\u2019t.  The echoes of the life he left behind on Earth\u2026a life lost forever\u2026grew louder every hour.  Until, that is, the day 11 years later when he was gunned down and killed.\nBut here\u2019s where Parker gets lucky and our action begins.  The next day is MarsTopia\u2019s annual Dead Man\u2019s Party holiday.  Following custom, Parker and all the other recently deceased in MarsTopia get a nice perk: they are each 3D printed back to life in a new body and given just enough time to enjoy the gala.  But Parker has no intention of politely resuming his death after the party wraps.  He has just four hours to break out of the 3D lab, pick up the leads in his troubling case, and find his own killer.  And, rushing against time he actually doesn\u2019t legally have, perhaps uncover what triggered Earth\u2019s demise.\nJack Parker is a professional investigator who lives for little more than his next swig of Glenfiddich 18 to blot out the past.  His clients? That nervous breed of MarsTopia Corpexec who worry about cheating spouses\u2026 and backstabbing underlings\u2026 and the existential question of where your soul goes after you die.  For the right price, Parker finds them answers--to the first two, anyway.\nMisty Sheridan is perhaps Parker\u2019s only true friend. She, too, lost everything when Earth was destroyed...her sister had taken Misty\u2019s baby back to Chicago to visit their parents. But everyone on MarsTopia had a story like that, and Misty was a survivor. Running The Vapor Lounge, she tries to play by New Shanghai City rules and regulations\u2026 up to a point. There are clients who will pay a premium for privacy and security and Misty doesn\u2019t ever name names.\nKasper \u201cTiny\u201d Gutman is the mastermind behind the MarsTopian underworld gang, the Black Birds. He stays well back in the shadows, but like any fine puppet-master, knows how to pull all the right strings. Whether by means of blackmail or Tiny\u2019s sheer eel-like slipperiness, the authorities have never been able to touch him. While certainly not a man to be trusted, he and Parker have been of mutual benefit on several occasions. Tiny is as charming as he is deadly-- and the 300-pound behemoth is no one to cross.\nFor a long time, I've dreamt of creating a game that explores transhumanism.  In it, one's individuality is tested, the dark parts of one's soul are exposed to the light, and yet hope and a chance at redemption may be just around the corner. Add to that my fascination with stories that build mounting suspense and evoke a pervasive creep-factor (think: Twin Peaks), along with introducing nuanced witty characters.  And lurking amongst them\u2026I have hidden Parker\u2019s killer.\nThe game\u2019s landscape isn't some airless and desolate dystopia; it\u2019s a prosperous domed off-world community, packed with vibrant people, dark corners and luxurious bling.  Here, deadly secrets are waiting to be discovered as you venture out into the glittering MarsTopian night with the clock ticking, ticking, ticking down on your very last life. \nLAST LIFE is being developed by Sam Farmer (Rocket Science Amusements).\nPrior to starting Rocket Science Amusements, Sam was Lead Game Designer for BBC Worldwide where he developed PC games based on several top BBC television series. Before that, Sam won two IGF awards at GDC 2010 for Paper Cakes and Spectre. Then, his design work on Blink (project supervised by Sony Santa Monica), allowed him to create compelling stories within the context of a AAA action/adventure title.\nRocket Science Collaborators:\nThe Tone Ranger, who played in the bands Desire, The Results, and Kitty Kitty, has created our soundtrack.\nArt Center phenom Ivan Louey is creating concept art / refining character designs.\nJerrilyn Farmer, bestselling author of 8 mysteries (Wm. Morrow) and TV game writer of Jeopardy! and Supermarket Sweep is writing our script.\nAdam Howard is the voice talent that gives Jack Parker his cranky charm and deadpan resolve.\nAfter studying music at U Edinburgh, Jacob Pernell is bringing LAST LIFE's SFX to life. Mars and Scotland sound more alike than anyone realized.\nThe brilliant co-anarchists at Glitch City are our creative sounding board.  They have released and/or kickstarted the following acclaimed indie games: Threes!  Hyper Light Drifter.  Nidhogg.  Thirty Flights of Loving.  Skulls of the Shogun.\nAs I created the story, look and feel of this world, I was joined by some amazingly accomplished artists.  It is really a huge bit of luck that a few of them happen to be members of my own family, crazy enough to jump on this dizzying ride without a lot of questions.  As the game's story grew, several more friends volunteered to come aboard.  Literally, my high school drama coach came over to my garage to record Parker's VO.  Like that.  Yet now is the time to put it out there.  I know I need the help of a larger community in order to realize the dream of producing Episode One of an eventual 3-part Trilogy.  \nI am dedicated to making LAST LIFE the most amazing adventure game I know it can be. To do that, we\u2019re going to have to give it the time and provide the resources it needs. The funds from Kickstarter backers will allow the core team to maintain our focus, and enable us to bring on others to help us create character art for our expanding world, concept additional scenic designs and a map,  and all of the other expenses that crop up when you\u2019re dedicated to producing an exceptional game experience.  The independence that funding will give us is more appreciated than we can express.\n And now here's one final track from our game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been exhilarated by half a year of planning, writing, drawing, debating, revising, programming and finally of prototyping this concept. And yet, I'm certain there will be great challenges to overcome in the future--such is game development.\n\nLuckily, I will not be facing this challenge alone. Through the combined wisdom, support, and guidance of Double Fine and the Glitch City community, I now have a support network of developers, designers, and artists with decades of experience building and releasing independent games.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. All along this journey, I have had unfailing friends ready to offer honest feedback. Now, with launch of this Kickstarter campaign, I hope to extend this tradition to you, the backers. Let's build an incredible community of our own around LAST LIFE.\n\nIf you have read this far, you are either my mother or my new friend for life.

Slowly eating his body and soul, the Rot twists him deeper and deeper into madness. In response, Armello's Great Clans have called forth their Heroes to claim the throne of Armello; and this is where you start your adventure, Hero. \nAs a 'Hero' from one of the Great Clans of Armello, you'll quest, scheme, explore, vanquish monsters, perform the Mad King's royal edicts and face off against other players with one ultimate end goal in mind \u2014 storming the palace and becoming king or queen of Armello!\nWill you gain followers, powerful treasures and hone your martial skills to challenge the King in combat and take his throne?\nWill you seek the healing powers of the Spirit Stones and quest across the kingdom facing Perils and danger?\nWill you defend the King and position yourself politically to be named his successor when he finally falls to the Rot?\nOr will you succumb to the Rot yourself, leave horror in your wake and claim the throne in the name of darkness?\nIn Armello, players use action points to move their hero across the board. During a turn you'll complete quests, capture settlements to raise your income, encounter followers, explore dungeons for treasures, vanquish the horrific Banes, and battle other heroes using our unique dice-based combat system!  \nPhysics based dice bring that magic tabletop feeling to our unique combat system!\nThere's no boring down time in Armello. After you hit the 'End Turn' button you'll be busy equipping items, recruiting followers and purchasing talents in your hero's unique talent tree. Maybe you're playing cards to the board as Perils for other heroes to stumble into or perhaps you're playing cards to strike up temporary allegiances... they're always temporary.\nDynamic questlines with multiple responses tailored to your hero.\nArmello uses a unique night and day cycle to shift the dynamics of play; the decisions you make will be affected by your hero's preferred time, whether adventuring bravely through the darkness or exposed in sunlight. Night time brings about a host of dangers; terrifying Banes erupt from dungeons to stalk victims and heroes await in ambush, concealed in the darkness. Dawn brings little respite; the King's Guards patrol the kingdom looking for traitors while the King himself slips deeper and deeper into madness, his edicts and demands becoming more outrageous as the game progresses. \nWhether you take the throne or not will depend entirely on how you navigate all of this and the other heroes on the board. Do you have what it takes to become Armello's next king or queen?\nEasy to Pick Up but a Challenge to Master - Combination of Card, Dice, Hex and Symbol sets makes it intuitive to play, yet deep with combinations and options.\nFast & Thoughtful - Adventuring in Armello is fast-paced swashbuckling fun, but also filled with tactical and political complexity, requiring meaningful decisions and forethought. \nMultiple Playable Heroes - Each unique hero possesses a special power, a personalised skill tree and customisable load-outs via Amulets and Signet Rings.  \nAnimated Cards - Over 100 beautifully illustrated and animated cards, from artists all over the world.\nTrue Tabletop Feel - We spent months making sure we cherry-picked the best parts of the tabletop experience, like our custom physics-based dice system! \nLocal & Online Multiplayer - Play with your friends on multiple tablet devices or PCs, or jump online and be matched up with players from the Armello community. \nEngaging Single Player - Your friends are busy?

Each hero features their own tailored A.I., making each hero a special challenge.\nDiscover Your Play-Style  - No \u2018class\u2019 system, modify heroes as you play to adapt to each individual game.\nDynamic Questlines - Explore, vanquish, fight, or scheme your way to the throne. In Armello, each clan has unique questlines that change every time you play.\nLiving World - Procedurally generated 3D hex map and fully animated 3D characters.\nTurn-Based Day/Night Cycle - Gameplay is impacted by the time of day and players can continue to perform actions during their 'off-turn'.

Here's a little sneak peek at the Armello OST, the track, Wyld's Call. \nWhilst prototyping Armello on paper, the precise moment that we started to feel the real magic of adventure was when heroes entered the game. You, a hero from one of Armello's Great Clans, setting forth on your very own epic journey! \nBefore each game players choose a hero. Armello's heroes all have different stat spreads and each has a unique game-changing ability or power. After selecting a hero, players then equip both a Power Amulet and a Clan Signet Ring, augmenting the Hero's build to your liking. \nPlaceholder Character Selection Screens\nEach hero has their own unique talent tree and game-changing power, but there are no classes in Armello. Just you, your hero, their power, Amulet, Signet, and then the path you choose to carve for your hero in-game. \nArmello will initially ship with four heroes (one from each of the Great Clans) with more to come post release.  \nHowever... should you back Armello at the 'Bandit' tier, this clan of charming ruffians will be available to you from day one! What's your type? Is it the nimble thief? The dark butcher? The affable rogue? Or perhaps it's the bulky berserker? \nShunned by Armello's great clans, this rag tag bunch of miscreants are out to claim the Kingdown for their own! Can you lead them to victory?\n...and remember, there are plenty more heroes on their way!\nNew Heroes Now Stretch Goals!\nFor every one of these stretch goals we hit below, we'll give one of the second set of heroes from Armello (currently planned as DLC) to EVERY BACKER FOR FREE upon release of that hero. \nAll Stretch Goals met! The above heroes are now unlocked for all backers!\nFrom the very moment we started developing Armello we knew that we wanted deep and strategic card play and not just layered over the top of the board game experience, but integrated into every part of it. \nFollower cards are powerful characters you'll meet on your travels.\nWe're proud to say we've achieved just that. Card play is fully integrated within the mechanics of Armello. You'll play cards to equip items, recruit powerful characters (Follower cards) to your party, heal yourself, cast epic spells, trade and much more. Cards also have other strategic abilities; for example playing them to the board as Perils to thwart other players, or using them in combat to better your odds.\nIn Armello, players all draw cards from a common deck, just like in a board game. No pay to win mechanics or need to keep buying cards. You and your friends start with everything you need to play. :D\nOh... and did we mention that Armello has over 100 unique cards and they're all animated! \nUse Trickery cards to inflict your political prowess across the board.\nYou can play cards during your turn or during other people's turns. There's no down time in Armello! You'll get to refill your hand at the start of your turn by selecting cards from three decks; Items, Spells, and Trickery. \nThe Spell, Items and Trickery decks.\nItems: Items can be consumable single use cards (Throwing Axe, Wyldsap, etc) or equipped to your hero for permanent effect. \nSpells: Spells typically have short range, but get close to a strong caster and it can be devastating. Spells can be played as Perils (traps) to the board or onto a hero for immediate effect. \nTrickery: True power has no limit and so Trickery cards can be played anywhere on the board and flex your influence within the Kingdom. Trickery cards can be played as Perils (traps) to the board or onto a hero for immediate effect. \nTreasure cards are some of the most sought after cards in the game.\nThere are also two decks of cards that players don't draw from, but if they're lucky will happen across during their journey throughout Armello! \nFollowers: Colourful characters from Armello that players can recruit to their party for powerful effects and an edge when questing. \nTreasures: Extremely rare items that can be found in Armello's many dungeons, or perhaps discovered on a mighty quest.\nOne of the biggest challenges of bringing a board game to life is the board itself! We've spent a large part of development on the most minor of details just to make sure the world of Armello truly felt like a living breathing place.\nNo two games of Armello are ever the same!\nThe board of Armello is anchored in the middle by the Royal Palace, home to the King of Armello. In each corner of the board are the Clan Grounds; the point where the clan's territories border onto Armello. This is where each hero starts their journey (and respawns should they perish). \nThe rest of the board is procedurally generated every single game. There are seven tile types in the game and they all provide different effects, should that be stealth, exploration, danger, defense, etc. Using our special algorithm the board is populated before each match, ensuring a balanced, but completely new dynamic to each game of Armello.\nInspired by great war games and tabletop epics, Armello is a game of tactics and strategic positioning, played out as heroes move across Armello, fighting and vying for settlements and advantageous ground.  \n\"Nature rules Armello, both nurturing and cruel.\"\nThe Kingdom of Armello is a vast, beautiful and untamed wild, teeming with ancient mysteries and natural wonders. The locals, typically a very superstitious bunch are diverse and many. From the hardy, cold Wolf Clan nestled in the snowy peaks of the Northern Needles, through to the sophisticated Rabbit Clan and their majestic burrow cities under the Great Southern Plains. \nWe've grown up loving and immersing ourselves in adventures like Red Wall, Watership Down, The Dark Crystal, The Labyrinth, Star Wars, Princess Mononoke and other Studio Ghibli films. Real adventure tales where something truly personal is at stake. To these inspirations we've added our fascination with real world mythologies and traditions, such as the earth magics of the Celts, and our respect for the beauty of the natural world . All of these together have merged to form the Kingdom of Armello.\nWe've set out to create a place of wonder, courage and magic, but darkness and danger lurk around every corner and Armello is the type of place where walking through the woods at night nets you the true Brothers Grimm style ending. It's a world filled with hope and heart, and real consequences.  \nClans feud and scheme, heroes truly are heroes, ancient magical druids walk the earth, and witches and beasts of bane hide in the shadows. There is adventure, fame and fortune to be found in Armello, but take the wrong step and it will most likely be your last.\n Well, we sure have a treat for all the audiophiles out there!\nAs lovers of incredible soundtracks and grand soundscapes, we knew the sonic vistas of Armello had to be extraordinary. The team we've got on board are not only incredibly talented, but also world renowned stars. Michael Allen from his chart surfing pop songs to moving soundtracks and Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance, Gladiator, Samsara, The Insider) whose voice and composition have created some of the most heart moving music ever created.\nThe soundtrack and sound effects will be produced and mastered by Armello's audio director, Jacek Tuschewski, who has shipped over thirty games and worked with internationally acclaimed virtuosos like Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams, Jeff Rona, Klaus Badelt and Zbigniew Preisner on Academy Award winning films, theatre productions and sound installations.\nHere's another sneak peak. This time it's the track, Intrigue Burning. \nFor the final game the music will be mixed in real-time and responsive to player actions and game events, ensuring a tailored audio adventure that enhances each game. Every playthrough will be a unique sonic experience. \nWith your support we hope to also have a high-resolution format (lossless 192kHz/24bit and DSD) for all the audiophiles out there. The soundtrack will be mixed in a state of the art vintage analogue studio straight to DSD128 Double-rate Direct-Stream Digital.\nGame audio rarely gets this kind of attention or attains this level of sonic excellence. At League of Geeks we aim to change that forever.\nWe don't see Armello as just a game. For us it's a world, a universe, brimming with infinite possibilities and countless stories still untold. For over two years now we've been collaborating with our talented friends at 12 Field Animation Studios in order to help us tell some of these stories in the form of incredible animated shorts.

However, this time, we\u2019re rewriting the playbook. Creative freedom and independence is at the core of League of Geeks and is made possible by a unique production model specifically designed to bring together talented collaborators from all over the world.\nFor the past two years, almost all of LoG's contributors have been working on Armello for a share in the game's profits. The LoG structure of distributing a project's profits to the developers means every single team member working on Armello is invested in making the best game possible. \nThe Armello team is filled with seriously talented folk from multiple industries and mediums. Renowned veterans to bright upcoming talent. From trailers, feature films, audio and special effects to art, games, production and design. Armello's team members have worked on licenses the likes of Warhammer, Darksiders, the Bioshock series, Pokemon, Puzzle Quest and many, many more. \nThis spectrum of creatives have come together purely because they believe in the project. No one is collecting a weekly pay check and just showing up because its a job. This is a project of real collaboration, of creative freedom at our personal bests. This is our passion project.\nWe've got what it takes to do this. You won't be disappointed. \n<3 LoG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTESTING PERIOD: \nWith a game like Armello, you can never know how long the game will have to remain in beta for. Although we can be quick on our feet, good testing and implementation of feedback takes time and the more you rush it, well... the shittier your game will be. For backers, a final release may not be so bad, as the majority of you will be playing the game from beta onwards, but if you're waiting for the full release there is the chance that due to illusive issues or stubborn design challenges the game may remain in beta for longer than expected. \n\nNEW STUDIO, NEW GAME:\nA lot of us have been working together for multiple years, and most of us have spent ten plus years in our respective industries, however... we\u2019re still a new studio making its debut game and working in an unprecedented way. So make no mistake, there will be bumps along the way. Game development is tough. Always. You have our word though, this game is getting made and it's going to be incredible.

A land with influences from man, elf and dwarf alike. The geography ranges from plains, to marshes, to woods, hills, and mountains. Notable cities and towns are Thunderhold, Modron, Tegel Village, Ossary, Lightelf, Sea Rune, and more. Forces from the City State engage in the Pirates up and down the River Hagrost, the Orcs of the Purple Claw, the Skandik Raiders of the East, and others.\n#2 Barbarian Altanis: The area known as Barbarian Altanis is home of the nomadic, red-skinned Altanians. Their ancestors were more advanced technologically, but their civilization had crumbled long ago leading to tribal feudalism. Now they wander the wastelands of the fathers. The ruins of the Kingdom of Kelnore are found in this regions as well. Mostly uninhabitable due to the thick wooded terrain, dense jungle, hills and mountains, there are very few outposts from the Invincible Overlord found here and there. Strewn across the region are many isolated villages of tribes and cults, Skandiks and orcs, and even a few pirates. \n#3 Isle of the Blest: Wilderlands Campaign Map XII: Isle of the Blest details the southern part of the Pazidan Peninsula and the Isle of the Blest. The fingers of the peninsula are known as Oricha, ancient home of the Orichalan Dragon Kings before the Altanian Barbarians killed all but few. The Isle of the Blest contains the City State of the Sea Kings, Rallu (on Campaign Map XVII: The Silver Skein Isles). The seas in the area have many traders going to Tarantis or Rallu, sometime even Tula, the City State of Mages. As with any place where traders are about, the seas of the Isle of the Blest are rife with pirates! The populations tend to be a mix of Alryans, Altanians, Tharbrians, and the occasional Antillian. Isolated settlements of Dwarves and Halflings are here and there as well. Navigating the hundreds of islands can be dangerous without proper equipment, navigators, and charts!\n#4 Ghinor: Land of sea storms, dangerous reefs and shoals, jungles teeming with feral dwarves, and the City State of Chim. This City State is located on the Devilstongue Peninsula. Long ago, this area was the Ghinorian Successor States, originally belonging to the Kelnorian Empire until a prince granted himself autonomy from the empire. Chim had sat empty for many years but has been settled by a tribe of dwarves.\n#5 Silver Skein Isles: Campaign Map XVII: Silver Skein Isles details Rallu - the City State of the Sea Kings located at the tip of the Isle of the Blest, Tula - the City State of Mages located along the coast of the Southern Reaches, and the actual Silver Skein Isles. The population is mostly Ghinorian men who often oppress the fairly small Karakhan minority. There are 6 large and 28 small islands that make up the Silver Skein Isles. Rallu and Tula have been in a power struggle for a while. Rallu is home of the Kelnorian descendants known as the Sea Kings, and Tula is home to many of the famed Schools of Wizardry, and the Chromatic Mages. Aside from the Rallu-Tulan War, there is an even longer enmity between the religious powers of the Silver Skein Isles.\n#6 Isle of the Dawn: The Isle of the Dawn has been of religious significance to the followers of Apollo as they believe here is where his Sun Chariot, Helios to the Ghinorians and Hyperion to the Skandiks, originates in the sky. Most of the human settlers here have lost touch with their peoples' history. No major political power is present in this region because of the vast distances of sea between islands. Whaling vessels are pretty common here. Dragons, Mer-elves, Suh\u00e4gin, schools of glowing fish, and dolphins are about!\n#7 The Ebony Coast: The Ebony Coast is a peaceful region rich with coal, crude oil, and peat. This land is wet in spring and early summer causing some swells and minor flooding. Mild winters are often accompanied by rain in the lowlands, but heavy snows in the highlands. Merchant and political influences have made for a vast network of roads between cities, villages and settlements to ease trade and patrol. Revelshire is the main political power here. Due to the geographic position of the Ebony Coast, it lies at the center of many different spheres of influence making it very diverse racially. These include Some Alryans and Karzulun tribesmen, but mostly Gishmesh, Antillians, Ghinorians and Skandiks. The south has a significant Karakhan influence with two outposts on Moonstone and Blackwell Isles.\n#8 Tarantis: This is the region containing the City State of Tarantis, ruins of what is rumored to be the capitol of the Kingdom of Kelnore, the Terad Mountains, the Silver Sea, Shadow Lake, and the Jarmeer Plain. The Tarantine Merchant's Association is based here. Weather tends to be warm and humid in the west and dry and hot in the east. The Jameer Plain is known for its almost daily occurrence of tornadoes. The city state of was founded 2541 years ago by the two nomadic tribes, the Gishmesh and Paldorians. The current dynasty ruling Tarantis was founded just under a hundred years when Edario I overthrew the sickly child Emir, Greataust II. Now Edario's son, Atar the Lion, is Emir of Tarantis, having ruled successfully for over 48 years. Many of the provincial rulers in the Tarantis region are Sultans in treaty with Atar the Lion.\n#9 Valley of the Ancients: According to the mythologies of men, and the ancient records of the Elves, the Valley of the Ancients was the place of genesis for the first creatures to walk the earth, the dragons. The prehistoric wars between dragons and the Markrabs raged here. Now, only rangers and hunters explore these poisoned lands. Thick fog obscures the sight of many travelers, leading to the naming of the Glow Worm Steppes. It is rumored that large carrion grubs which give off a bioluminescent glow can be seen making their way through the plains at night. In actuality, these are the hunting parties of cavemen armed with torches, mounted upon their ponies. Races found here include the Tenifell Lords, the Rangers of Tarsh, the Tarshian peoples, Avalonians (both common and true), and other mixed men so far removed from any particular race that they cannot be accounted for.\n#10 Valon: Valon is just south of the Great Glacier which has been receding the last thousand years making the Valonian rivers and streams rich with glacial deposits of gold, and silver. Iron, mithral, and copper are also found in the mountains. The Heareat Undersea Kingdom, populated by the Avalonians, resides under the Uther Pentwegern Sea. Pirate hole up in Malikarr, the City of Alchemists, on the Isles of Pokrantil, and on Thrinakia Isle between sorties. Malikarr is also where the last of the Orichalan dragons reside (in polymorph form) teaching their ancient alchemical knowledge. The City State of Valon is the greatest regional power here, known for its great weather wizards. Heavy rains and snows are frequent year round, and its large desolate landscapes make the region unappealing to foreigners. The thick cloud cover year round doesn't add to Valon's appeal either. The bitter cold during the winter causes the Ninuflan Bay to completely ice over. The Downland Plain is typically covered with 10-15 feet of snow during this time.\n#11 The Elphand Lands: The terrain here is divided between three major rivers and lakes. Mountains, hills, and dense woodlands populate most of the land. Some grasslands and bogs can be stumbled upon as well. Due to the variances in terrain and altitude, attempts to send communication are hazardous. This makes self-sufficiency the biggest factor in survival. Elphand cavemen can be found in the wilds, and the human race of Confeds are spread throughout the area. Demi-Giant settlements to the north and east of the Elphand Lands are responsible for the occasional raid. Wild mastadons, sabre-toothed tigers, dire warthogs, worgs, and other fel beasts can be found hunting the forests and plains. The major political power here is the city of Damkina, which resides on the Vast Lake Island. Here rules the White Overlord.\n#12 Viridistan: Viridistan is known by many names in many regions due to its large sphere of influence. It is known as the Immortal City, the City of Spices, and the City State of the World Emperor. The Green Emperor and his wife rule Viridistan. They are the last known survivors of the True Viridians, a green-skinned race known for their innate ability to use powerful sorcery. A kingdom of merfolk, Sae Laamer can be found in the Trident Gulf. Common Viridians and Tharbrians are most common races in the lands around the City State of the World Emperor. Alryans, Altanians, and Skandiks can be found outside the city.\n#13 Desert Lands: The Desert Lands contains the Holy Cities which are considered one of the most sacred sites in the Wilderlands. The Holy Cities are currently occupied by forces from Viridistan as part of the Green Emperor's policy of oppression against the Mycretians. The Mycretians are humble followers of the god Mycr. Other races found here are mixed descendants of the Tharbrians, Alryans, and some Antillians with the native Dorins which occupy the regions west of the mountains.\n#14 Lenap: Lenap was also once part of the Ghinor Successor States. Terrain here ranges from desert to thick jungle and hills. The Isles of Flame are volcanic islands located in the Churning Sea, making the sea chaotic to traverse. The region is full of herbs, spices, plants, saps, perfumes, and oils that are not found elsewhere in the Wilderlands making trade very lucrative despite the occasional volcanic activity and frequent hurricanes in the spring and fall.\n#15 Sea of Five Winds: The City State of Tlan is found on the eastern coast. Tlan was also once one of the Ghinor Successor States, but has since fallen from its former glory. Large wooded hills make civilization sparse and road construction too expensive to fund. The mineral rich Vastern Canyon is in the northern part of this region, but the terrain has prevented extraction. Many unique and hard to find alchemical plants and herbs can be found in the Hutamah Jungle.\n#16 Ament Tundra: Although the Ament Tundra is closer to the equator of Ghenrek IV, it is bitterly cold, extremely windy due to the altitudes that the steep escarpments reach. The rugged topology of the Ament Tundra makes for a natural barrier from the Demi-Giant marauders to the west. It's been over a millennium since the Demon Empires in the south have invaded. There are no roads, making this region true wilderness, and reaching the upper slopes can only be done by climbing the shear cliffs and steep escarpments.\n#17 Southern Reaches: Most of the Ghinor Highlands are actually lowlands full of jungles, swamps and marshes. Over Doom Mountains are home to the Ironfoot Dwarves, the only real political power there is in the region. The dwarves don't mind travelers or settlers so long as they are not encroached upon. Demonic exiles from the Demon Empires southward can be encountered from time to time. Other villages tend to be small self-sufficient communities that keep to themselves.\n#18 Southern Reaches: The last 100 years has been rather peaceful for the once tumultuous Southern Reaches. The Demon Empires have not raided these lands in quite some time. The foreboding Bendalion Mountains are known to be rich in metal and gemstone alike, yet remain largely untouched due to the increasing numbers of monsters and feral men and dwarves who control it. Dwarven civilization has built up its influence in the western highlands, while the Elves reside on the eastern seaboard. The races of men here are typically Ghinorians. This place is hot, and heavy rains are frequent.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe following are only challenges we think we are in the realm of possibility. The writing is already done for the book - so no issues there. The only thing that the book will need is illustrations and a final layout draft. What may potentially keep the book from going to print is illustration delivery delays. This would hold up the layout of the final product but can be mitigated by doing layout and illustrations in parallel instead of in series, or by printing the book with less illustrations. \n\nPrinting will be done through the same printer that Frog God Games uses, so the quality of these books will be on par with theirs. However the maps will be done through a different vendor. Delays may occur if map and book deliveries do not arrive together resulting in a decrease of time available to rubber cement the maps in the book for reward fulfillment. Fortunately, we have back-up vendors in town that may help to compensate for the delays. We also plan to get these all printed and ready MONTHS in advance to ensure early, or at minimal timely delivery.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #112", "update_userinfo": "Stormy Weather but Pushing Onward", "update_content": "Backers and Friends (I hope we still have some), as help from other sources never seem to come forth as promised, the going is slow, but I have not given up.

Add in a tense and captivating storyline, a modern animated filmic style, a bunch of evil villains, a classic A-team style partnership and an atmospheric score and you have 'The Breakout'.\nYou play as Guy Kassel, an ex-thief whose life of crime was turned around by his beloved fianc\u00e9e.

The classic point-and-click adventure games of the 1980s did an amazing job of dropping players into an animated world where skills and cunning were required in order to succeed.

Hero Generations goes far beyond just that - it's also an amazing game.\" \u2013Jon Shafer, Lead Designer - Conifer Games (Civilization V, At the Gates)\n\"Hero Generations is a brilliant concept that needs to be made. A game like this can compress the learning of a lifetime into a sandbox. You get to experiment and see how you, your children, and your children's children can change the world. What a wonderful opportunity.\" \u2013Daniel Cook, Chief Creative Officer - Spry Fox (Triple Town)\n\"Love the game! It's cute and approachable, but with amazing depth and an elegance of design - simple decisions with complex interactions makes it so replayable. Fun!\" \u2013Mark Terrano, Chief Creative Officer - Hidden Path Entertainment (Defense Grid, Age of Empires)\n\"Hero Generations is a game that stood out to us. It's unique, fun, and actually has something to say.\" \u2013Andrew Webster, Games Reporter - The Verge\nHi, I'm Scott Brodie, independent game designer, programmer, and founder at Heart Shaped Games. I'm excited to share with you my plans for the revival of my 2011 IndieCade Finalist strategy game Hero Generations.\nHero Generations is a quick-playing turn-based strategy game that takes inspiration from rogue-likes, 4X strategy, and independent art games. It has been described as the offspring of Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization, Jason Rohrer\u2019s Passage, and The Legend of Zelda. \nYou play a rapidly aging hero that explores a procedurally generated world in search of fame and a mate to settle down with before you die. After your life ends, you continue on adventuring as your child. Depending upon your choices, your child will be either more fit to take on the world, or hobbled by your poor decisions.\nLife took some surprising turns for me during Hero Generations' original development, and I was forced to put the game on the shelf in order to spend time with my then-newborn son and focus on other projects that could pay the bills. But with your backing, I can revive the game, finish the design and programming work, team up with amazing artist Dominic Sodano and musician Andrew Riley, and release it to the world as a standalone downloadable game for PC, Mac, and Linux platforms.\nHero Generations is best described as \u201cThe 5-Minute Civilization.\u201d An entire heroic life can be played through in minutes, but chaining together a 2000 year lineage comes from hours of deep strategic play. You move your hero around a procedurally generated grid-based world, and each step they take removes 1 year from their life. \nEvery turn confronts you with a meaningful choice about how you want to live your life. Do you stay safe and build up your hometown, or explore into the unknown in search of fame and fortune? Do you work to make the world better for your children, or do you selfishly pursue your own dreams? \nBelow is a narrated walkthrough showing off the status of our current gameplay prototype. Thank you to Journalist UnstableVoltage for creating the video. Note: all artwork is placeholder! \nHere are the game\u2019s current and planned main features:\nLimited Lifespan and Permadeath: each move your hero makes = 1 year of their life. Each hero has a limited lifespan (from 50-125 years) that puts pressure on you to think carefully about how you spend the years you have left.\nYour hero physically ages as you play\nGenerations, Mating, and Having Children: The world has towns that house mates for you to woo. Successfully finding a mate lets you have a child, and that child becomes the hero you control next in the same world. Choosing the right mate is key, as mates pass on traits (special abilities) that make your child more powerful and prepared.\n6 Strategic Paths and Meaningful Choices: Heroes are judged by how famous they become in a single lifespan. Heroes grow and gain fame by completing quests and pursuing the following strategic paths: \nStrength: growing in size and strength let\u2019s you battle the monsters in your path, and break down barriers to progress.\nLove: work to attract the mate of your dreams, and build an epic legacy of great heroes.\nExploration: discover what is hidden underneath the clouds, and blaze trails to make traversing the world faster in the future. \nWealth: collect gold so that you can create buildings in towns or buy items you can pass down to your children.\nFame: gain fame directly by questing to return ancient artifacts, slaying procedurally generated boss monsters, and competing with other families for the throne.\nBuilding & Technology: craft amazing towns by building Barracks, Observatories, Museums, and Monuments that offer you helpful resources lasting across generations.\nBuilding Tech Tree & Family Crafting: The 4 spaces next to towns allow you to construct special buildings that offer actions and useful resources. Buildings provide long term benefits and influence the culture of neighboring towns. Towns morph in response to combinations of buildings nearby, causing the mates in the town to take on unique traits! Examples of discoverable town types include the Ranch, Fortress, Ghost Town, Port City, and Dark Cathedral! \nPlanned Building Tech Tree and Stretch Goals\nExpansive Overworld: Each world of Hero Generations is a 10x10 procedurally generated grid filled with towns, forests, ancient ruins, monsters, and more. In addition, there is an expansive overworld: a 3x3 grid of connected worlds. Secret paths at the borders lead to completely different world types. If we meet our stretch goals, we\u2019ll add awesome new world sets that feature totally unique quests, enemies, terrain, and more! \nProphecies & World Events: Every 100 years, a major \u201cworld event\u201d occurs. Volcanoes erupt; giant creatures emerge hell bent on destroying the world. It can also mean the arrival of helpful special characters, like wandering caravans and fast traveling airships. You\u2019ll be challenged to grow and adapt to an ever-changing world around you.\nGorgeous Art Style: The finished game will feature the look and feel I always hoped for, developed by fellow Seattle artist Dominic Sodano. The visuals work to subtly reveal the emotional themes inherent in the game mechanics.\nSimple Yet Deep: The game system has many elements, but the moment-to-moment gameplay simply involves moving your hero from one grid space to the next like a rogue-like. The result is meaningful strategic choices like a 4X Strategy game, but without the heavy micromanagement and calculation.\nFemale hero aging along the strength and warrior path.\nMeaning: The game system was built from the ground up to be an exploration of the themes of death, legacy, family, love, and more. The experience of playing the game I hope will be a surprising and thought-provoking experience, as well as fun. I'll be posting more details on the inspiration and design philosophy behind this in future backer updates.\nIf we meet our basic funding goal, I will use the funds to convert the prototype into a downloadable, DRM-free version for PC, Mac, and Linux platforms. At a minimum the team and I will implement the following:\n1. All new art. We'll create final game art and animation with an all new, polished and fitting style like the mockups and concepts featured on this page.\n2. Support for both male and female heroes. The prototype supports male heroes and female mates. We'll fix this and add new female hero art.\n3. Overworld map. I'll add support for world tilesets, and procedural generation of the world and connected paths.\n4. New Worlds. I'll implement a 2nd world type: Desert. In combination with the Grassland and Ancient Forest types, the overworld will offer a lot to discover.\n5. Giant content addition: I'll add additional character traits, items, quests, enemies, and world events to give all worlds long term variety.\n6. Proper mid-term and end game content: Add the end boss demon and ancient prophecy system to provide goals and tension across many generations of heroes.\n7. New UI: I've learned a lot about what makes a good UI working on Highgrounds, and I'll apply that experience to create a new and streamlined user interface.\n8. Fill out building tech tree with more buildings and building behaviors.\n9. All new character rig and animations. We'll update our \"paper doll\" character system so that characters can be dynamically mated to create new heroes, and have more fluid animations.\n10. Polish: Fix bugs, improve performance, refactor hacky prototype code, better music and sfx, and generally do all the behind the scenes work necessary to get the game in shape to be deployed as a standalone game that can run across a variety of computers.\nConcept for the battle screen\nThe game is built to expand, and I've got big plans for how the game world can grow. If I am fortunate enough to receive funding beyond the basic goal, I\u2019ll pursue the following stretch goals:\nACHIEVED! We'll add the ability for you to track up to the past 50 generations of heroes in your family line, and display the chain in an awesome new \"timeline\" screen. It will show each hero, their fame score, and their parents before them! This screen will also show a local leaderboard of your most famous heroes.\n\nACHIEVED! Also known as the \"End Fortress\", this new world is the \"Mount Doom\" of Hero Generations. Only the wisest and bravest heroes dare travel here. We'll add a new art tileset along with:\nA new set of quests and quest objects: \"Defeat the Demon\", \"Rescue the Stolen Mate\", and more.\nMore challenge objects and monsters: Elementals & Chimeras! Lava, thunder storm clouds, demon fortress!\nSpecial traits only found in this area. \nUnique world generation rules: no towns, many volcanoes, many lava spaces.\nACHIEVED! We'll add 6 new building types to our tech tree, bringing the total to 18 possible structures. We'll also add a few new town morph types to craft! See the Tech Tree Diagram shown earlier on this page for details.\n\nACHIEVED! This new world is made up of 50% water tiles. The remaining land is clumped into 3-4 islands, and each island can have a unique biome. With the right traits, the right hero can brave these waters and discover rare treasures and mates. We'll add a new art tile set, along with:\n\nA new set of quests and quest objects: \"Defeat the Giant Squid\", \"Catch a Fish\", \"Find Buried Treasure\". \nMore challenge objects and monsters: Pirates, Giant Squids, and Sea Monsters! Boats & Trader Shops!\nSpecial traits only found in this area. \nUnique world generation rules: 50% water, 4 islands, dock nodes.\nACHIEVED! We'll introduce a new game system that allows for heroes to be adopted from a new building type, the orphanage. Adopted heroes are taken control of instead of the natural offspring of the parents. This offers a new strategic choice, and allows you to diverge from the path your current family lineage is leading you.\n\nA mucky new world where the dead take on new life. Dead heroes can become skeletons, and the ghosts of your ancestors haunt the land. Witches can craft items and potions from items brought from other worlds, and beware of plague-ridden bogs. We'll add a new art tile set, along with all new quests, challenge objects, enemies, and more!\n\nWe'll add 6 new building types to our tech tree, bringing the total to 24 possible structures. We'll also add a few new town morph types to craft! See the Tech Tree Diagram shown earlier on this page for details.\n\nThe world is a gauntlet of challenges, including quicksand, traps, and thunderstorms. But the world is filled with items and medicines of all kind, and many rare mates with special traits inhabit it. We'll add a new art tile set, along with all new quests, challenge objects, enemies, and more! \n\nWe'll add 6 new building types to our tech tree, bringing the total to 30 possible structures. We'll also add a few new town morph types to craft! See the Tech Tree Diagram shown earlier on this page for details.\n\nA harsh, frozen world where your every move takes an additional year off your life...unless you have the right equipment. Little life exists here, but rare ancient treasures, caverns, and knowledge about ancient technology can be found buried beneath the snow. \n\n\n???  more stretch goals TBA, and will be announced as we get closer to completing the rewards already announced!\nNote: during development we may decided to focus on different designs for the world types, but we will address the total amount of \"new world\" stretch goals we achieve. This is the current plan of the order we want to implement though!\n\nAll stretch goals will be added to the final game and made available to backers at all tiers $10 and above!\nHero Generations is very much inspired by my life experiences, so I'd like to share a little more about myself.\nI've worked in games professionally since 2002, and have worked as a designer, producer, programmer, and artist across projects of all sizes. For the last 3 years, I've been an independent designer/programmer at my own company Heart Shaped Games, working on an original web collectible card game called Highgrounds in partnership with my good friends at Spry Fox. In years prior, I was a Producer at Microsoft Game Studios, primarily focused on XBLA Games (Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Scrap Metal, Aegis Wing, Snoopy Flying Ace, to name a few). I've also worked at Stardock (Galactic Civilizations II) and Outrage Games (Alter Echo).\nHighgrounds, Aegis Wing & Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet\nIn 2010 I was inspired to make Hero Generations. It was an idea that stemmed from wrestling with many big life decisions all at once. My wife and I were recently married, looking for a place to settle down, thinking about when to have kids, questioning why we were 2000 miles from family, and both in good but creatively unfulfilling jobs. I wanted to make indie games full-time, but it felt risky, and it would delay a number of our personal plans.\nIn the end, we agreed the risk was worth it, and I left Microsoft Game Studios to start Heart Shaped Games and begin work on the prototype. That year, we were surprised with the news that our own next generation hero (my son) was on the way. With bad insurance, a small apartment, and a games business in startup mode, we were forced to make some hard decisions to accommodate our new arrival. Hero Generations had to be cancelled.\nThe next generation of Heart Shaped Games\nFlashing forward to today, my son is two years old, and my experience as a father has lead me back to thinking about reviving Hero Generations. My perspective has changed considerably, but that shift has also helped me fill in some important missing pieces of the design. It became clear that with Kickstarter, I didn't have to beg publishers for their support anymore. I could work directly with the people who love the game in the same way that I do, and release it in the form it was intended without compromise.\nWith your support, I'll be able to partner with a dream team of other Seattle Indie developers! \nDominic Sodano - Artist\nDominic Sodano is a 2D artist with over seven years experience in the gaming industry, having worked at Griptonite Games, Glu Mobile, and Zynga Seattle. He has worked on many titles over the years, starting from jobs that involved hiding objects into 2d backgrounds, animating characters, to fully concepting and designing characters. He has worked on many platforms including Nintendo DS, Kinect, PSP, IOS, Android, and Facebook.\nAndrew Riley - Musician\nAndrew Riley is the composer of over 50 titles, including the #1 selling iPhone game CraftedBattle and the Swedish Game Awards \"Game of the Year\" winner Secrets of Grindea. He also composed the music for my first game Highgrounds, and I'm excited to have the chance to team up with him again on an all new original soundtrack for Hero Generations.\nReward Notes\nAdd-On Reward s (new): You can now add an extra reward to your current tier if you so desire (no need to change your tier, just add the amount below to your pledge, and we'll see the amount and a note from you on the survey we'll send out closer to release).\nAdd $5 - Digital Art Book PDF.

You\u2019ll get a taste for what the final game will be, and have a chance to influence the direction the game takes ahead of the Beta release.\nYour Name in the Game: At the $20 tier and above, exclusive for Kickstarter backers, you\u2019ll be able to get your name* added to the game\u2019s random name generator for all future players to see. Depending on the pledge level, you\u2019ll find your name appearing as the name of NPC Heroes, Mates, Monsters, or even the end boss! The higher you pledge, the higher the frequency you can expect to see your name popping up.\n*We'll vet your suggested name for appropriateness, and will contact you if we feel we need an alternative.\nOriginal Soundtrack (OST): Receive a digital download of the full original soundtrack composed by Andrew Riley of Lucky Lion Studios!\n$100: Design a Family Crest! We'll create a family crest image based upon a description and reference art you provide us. The crest will be added as an option that all players can pick, along with a color that represents them. When a hero mates, the crest is combined with the crest of the mate as well. In addition, you'll be famous, as we'll add your name in the credits under the special heading \"Family Crest Designer.\" \nWe'll add a crest in the game based upon reference you provide\n$150: Design an Item! We'll work with you to design the visuals and name for one of the epic rare items in the game! Available items include swords, shields, armor, bombs, hammers, mate gifts, and more. In addition, you'll be famous, as we'll add your name in the shop description and credits in the form of a \"Forged by <YOUR NAME>\" credits line.\n$250: Design a Character Trait! We'll work with you to design the visuals and name for one of the character traits in the game. You'll also help us choose from a big list of gameplay ideas to find a trait you think is important to be included.

To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv.\nTo be clear, the OUYA exclusivity does not interfere with the computer release! The PC, Mac, and Linux versions can release SIMULTANEOUSLY! \nI want to see Hero Generations in the hands of players instead of collecting dust on my hard drive unfinished. The game has been entirely self-funded up until this point. I've come a long way in getting the project to where it is currently, but I need help to do the work to finish and release it.\nSecond, I've talked with many publishers thanks to the exposure the game received as a finalist at IndieCade, but the game was always deemed \"too small\" to be worth investing in. Plus, a traditional funding partnership would require the team and I to make too many compromises to the design in the name of maximizing profit. I want to be able to deliver the complete and focused game without sacrificing the integrity of the design.\nMost importantly, I'm interested in bringing appreciators like you in on the process so that the game can speak to all of our shared experiences.\nYour generous support will be used to:\nPay myself the minimum cost to live while working throughout the year to finish the game.\nCompensate collaborators in art and audio.\nCover minor business costs such as maintaining Heart Shaped Games, software, fulfilling rewards, serving the final game, accounting, etc.\nPolish and Improve Hero Generations to be as enjoyable as possible.\nPlease consider backing the project and help make Hero Generations a reality!\nYou can follow me at @brodiegames on Twitter for updates (I'm pretty active here).\nYou can send me any questions or concerns at scott@heartshapedgames.com\nThe Hero Generations website can be found at www.herogenerations.com\nI'll be sure to post a number updates on the Heart Shaped Games Facebook page as well.\nOn a personal note, thank you to my loving wife, son, family, and friends in the indie game community for all of your support. Your feedback and encouragement has been invaluable. \nAnd of course, thank you for backing the project and spreading the word!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe prototype version of Hero Generations is battle tested to be fun for multiple hours already.

Assuming this campaign is funded, and all computers and files in source control aren't wiped out in a flash flood, there is little to no chance a version of the game won't be delivered to you.\n\nThat said, every project has risks and challenges:\n\nSMALL TEAM: Our plan is to keep the core game simple, single player, and based on existing technology we're familiar with. We feel confident that will help our small team keep our bug count low and deliver a polished and stable game. As well, combining our own small group of beta testers with our Kickstarter backers receiving early access to the beta will help us find the big issues before release. \n\nCustomer support and communicating with the community is something I pride myself on doing well with my other games, and our approach will be no different for Hero Generations.\n\nREWARD FULFILLMENT: It's important to play to our strengths, so for this campaign we've opted to keep physical rewards to a minimum. This will allow us to stay focused on making a great game, instead of getting on a first name basis with the fine people running our local post office! As well, my wife Kate will be helping to manage communication and the reward fulfillment effort post release.\n\nSCHEDULE: Every game is different, but as a former Producer at Microsoft, I've had a lot of experience tracking projects, keeping to milestones, and managing budgets. There are always unforeseen challenges in game development, but I've done my best to keep the budget and release time frame estimates realistic. At the end of the day, my goal is to deliver the best game possible, so any future delays (whether self imposed or due to the project being given more budget) would only happen in order to give you a better end result.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "We Are The Caretakers Is Out Now!

Source of All Words.\nWelcome to the second Kickstarter for APEXICON! We're excited to be back on Kickstarter for another try!\nWhat does this mean for you, the backer? Well, this is a second chance for you to get in on the Apexicon ground floor. Our rewards are simpler, our energy is recharged, and we're excited to provide more in-depth analysis of the game (We've got Q&As, twitch livestreams, and more lined up during the Kickstarter!).\nFirst things first though! We know you want to try the game, and we plan to DELIVER.\nHere's the first ALPHA of APEXICON - Fantasy Puzzle Combat!\nAPEXICON - Fantasy Puzzle Combat Alpha for PC\nAPEXICON Kickstarter Alpha Requirements:\nWindows XP/Vista/7\n150 MB Space Free Required\nAt least 1 GB RAM on your Video Card\nAt least 4 GB of RAM\nFollow me on Twitter: @ashodinventeal \n Help us get our game on STEAM! Click the greenlight banner to go the page, and help us make it a reality!\nAmong all the RPGs that I loved to play, I would enjoy Puzzle RPGs because they merged the addictive feel of solving a puzzle to deal damage to your enemies. In regards to the original Puzzle Quest, where you had to match-3 orbs to gain mana and also deal damage to your enemies, I thought about the evolution of the genre.\nWhat if you had a board similar to match-3, except it was all letters? \nWhat if you could modify the letters and the board to work for you, and your enemies could thwart that? The concepts intrigued me - players could use their own lexicon to bring out the healing or damage needed to win combat. It turned their own knowledge of English (or other languages when we add them) into a weapon. Of course, that was the idea for Apexicon. The \"apex\" of a \"lexicon\" is a dictionary. It has all the words in it, or at least most of them. What if there was an artifact that created words that we didn't know yet, and held all the words we couldn't say yet? This is the basis for the power behind the artifact. Then the world itself spread from there.\nWe've even been backed by Steve Fawkner, who was the original Puzzle Quest developer.\n Fret not, Non-English Speakers: A portion of APEXICON's funding will go towards translating into Spanish, French, and German!\nWe knew we wanted to make it so that when players attacked with their words, damage would visibly seen, and feedback would be felt. So when players hit the \"attack\" button, they will see their attacks carried out, and the enemy will receive damage, make an \"OOF\" noise, and then turns will change over. It's as simple as figuring out what letters on the board there are to deal out damage. You have as long as you want to take your turn, so there's no rush.\nA Wordsmith attacks with the letters on the board.\nThe game employs a definite turn-based system to accompany this, which allows easy tit-for-tat gameplay. \nAn Eraser gets to take his turn after the player. Pre-Alpha GIF.\nWhat about upgrading your abilities? What about gaining new items? Well, we took a look at other games, and decided against the usual Collect-A-Thon, get X amount of currency to buy Y item. \nEverything in the game, from the items to the special attacks, is purchased and upgraded with INK, our unique currency.\nInk is gained after combat, after puzzle solving, and sometimes after completing storylines. It's our universal currency, and you'll want to manage it effectively. \nUpgrading your weapons allows more chance on hit effects in Combat.\n Other features for the game:\nCross-Platform Saving - Own the game on multiple platforms? Have a game on PC, and want to play it on mobile? We're doing that.\nMale and female versions of every class - Choose your gender, no problems.\nFull Town Management, Including Finding NPCs and Rebuilding the Town\nCustomization of character down to skills, special passives, and equipment which you can use in battle to slay your enemies faster\nFull Voice Over Narration for major characters, text for minors\nMultiple Endings, based entirely on what you do and how you develop your town\nIntriguing story that delves into the rich lore\nEquipment can be leveled up, allowing you to unlock even more skills and special abilities, further specializing your character.\nEnemies who have AI that will try to fight off your skills and use their own\nBuild friendships with your NPC friends in the town to unlock more secrets, sidequests, and various other fun things\nBuilt for PC/Mac/Linux in mind, as well as mobiles\nAnd much more!\nMINI COLLECTOR'S EDITION!\nComes with:\nSoundtrack by Scott Hitchcock, our Composer!\nHuge Art Stills of Scenes in the Game to Download (See Below!)\nCollector's Edition Item, the Collectatron - which will allow you to gain information on your foes if you use it as a Defensive Item!\nSome of the promo art you will get to download in HQ.\n  The Verbinator Promo Art.\n And more art!\nAfter you pick your character class in the beginning of the game, the entire game's story is different based on that class. So playing through as an Idiomancer is totally different than the Verbinator, for instance. Some classes have stories that intertwine, others may pit you against the class you played before, and playing as other characters may come up. Things like this can be switched easily with the way the game is programmed, so there's lots of interesting ways we can intertwine story into gameplay.\nOur goal is to have you feel like the story of just one character is part of a larger whole, encouraging replays.\nToo often games will have characters and classes with largely the same story. We pride ourselves on being able to deliver a multi-part intertwined epic that players will want to experience all of it.\nIdiomancer wants to take you down.\nThe Emperor Litacus Namicus III. He is an antagonist seen in multiple playthroughs. What is his goal?\nIn the world of APEXICON, everything is much easier thanks to the prevalence of magic words.The stories have told since the dawn of time that the origin of magic words, which people have used to make their lives simple and easy, came from the artifact, the book of all words, the APEXICON.\nAfter a terrible war that occurred much earlier in the overall timeline, called the Punctuation War, where large groups of people fought over which punctuations added to magic words had the best effects, magic words were sealed away from the general populace, and an order was established to protect the people from their own ignorance. Thus, the Literati Empire was born. With the magic words being controlled by only the craftsmen, the elite, and the chosen few to wield them, man would not have to suffer through another war again...\nThere are many quirky and interesting characters you will come across. Including this crazy guy:\nAbin D. Antz. A play on words of \"Abundance\", it's easy to see why. His chest is tattooed with the word \"million\", which means he has a million lives. Allowing words to be put on people allows us to develop characters radically different than most RPGs entail.\n VOICED OVER by Jason Wishnov of Iridium Studios \"THERE CAME AN ECHO\" and \"SEQUENCE\" fame!\n We're absolutely thrilled with being able to bring another Kickstarter online for APEXICON. The first one garnered a lot of coverage, especially from RockPaperShotgun and various other indie outlets, and we can't wait to have more people get in on the fun.\nIt's ultimately up to you, the fans, to support us. We love doing what we do, but we love you even more.\nThe fans are what really make this project and all other indie projects shine. We enjoy every chance we get to interact with them, and can't wait to show more of the game off when we get a chance.\nConstruct 2\nScirra's engine has been amazing thus far, and adding Wii U development support is icing on the cake. With the support, we can confirm something we've been wanting to say for a long time now:\nAPEXICON will definitely launch on Wii U's eShop. We're already a developer, and we're working hard on the Wii U Version.\n  Jonathan Meyer, CEO, Programmer, Developer, Designer\nI do all the heavy lifting when it comes to actually putting together the game. Using Construct 2, I've been designing Apexicon for almost a year now. I couldn't get the game into the state today without help from some of my other fellow developers, especially the composer, Scott, and Janice, who is my UI helper.\n Scott Hitchcock, Composer, Awesome Guy, Hard Worker\nShow Me Your Skeleton - Scott's Soundcloud\nScott is the epitome of \"gets it done\". Task him with some music, and the flurry of his efforts will astound you. He has a knack for getting music together that breathlessly evokes the style and power in what you want out of the piece. His efforts are absolutely amazing, as you can see below:\n Lee Che, artist, all around awesome person, amazing talent\nLee's art is what really makes the game shine. I give her a simple description, and she comes up with some amazing art to match the game's distinctiveness, using her own artistic design knowhow.\nA Plagiarist female has stolen all the items these people had and turned it into INK.\nJanice Kim, UI Artist, Super Cool Gal\nJanice came to us to help smooth out the UI and make it look friendly and professional. We really enjoy all the work she's provided thus far, and we'll be getting more work out of her yet! \n Amber Lee Connors, Voice Actress (Dust: An Elysian Tail, among others), Female Wordsmith\nAmber's strong voice is added to the list alongside Ben Britton, who's the male Wordsmith. We're extremely proud to have her, and she'll be doing a Q&A with us later in the Kickstarter campaign, so keep a watch out for that! Her voice adds a depth to the Wordsmith class that was only there before in writing. I'm excited she's aboard the project.\nBen Britton, Voice Actor, Male Wordsmith\nWhen I first approached Ben, I was excited to hear his voice. It matched so well with the Wordsmith, that I couldn't believe it. It really sounded like the character was speaking, not just the art, and that was pretty amazing. His voice has a gravitas to it that allows him to emote in ways that I had wanted the Wordsmith to be: strong, youthful, and determined.\nR. J. O'Connell, Voice Actor, Literati Erasers and Lansermaster\nR. J. came to us when I needed a strong voice for the Wordsmith, but he had a better talent I could make use of: a villainous voice that would be perfect for the Literati Erasers, the group of knights that hunt you down in the Alpha. With RJ, I knew we had something big when his yells and cries to tear down the player were giving me chills. Thus the angry Literati Erasers were born. Fantastic voice actor.\nTIGSource Devlog Thread: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=34262.0\nIndieDB page: http://www.indiedb.com/games/apexicon-fantasy-wordplay-puzzle-combat\nSteam Greenlight Page (In case you missed it above): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190357043", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with the previous R&C with the original Kickstarter, the only risks I have is getting you onboard.

In fact one of the the meanings of these early titles was 'the madman' . Interestingly there is also a clear link between the French 'Fou' ( meaning mad or crazy ) and the phonetically similar 'Fool' . The word Fool probably has it's roots in 'folly' and is probably derived from the French 'la folie' , which in both cases are other terms for 'madness' . All this leads me to wonder whether 'The Fool' was originally supposed to literally represent a 'mad' person , or madness , rather than a foolish person or a professional fool ( i.e jester ) . Perhaps all of this is a bit of irrelevant nitpicking ; Tarot cards by their nature are massively open to interpretation . This one , just as all the others, might have a whole array of possible meanings ."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "A new drawing of the Fool ...", "update_content": "I made this new drawing of 'the Fool' today ."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Hi again ....", "update_content": "I've been experimenting with some alternative faces for the 'Fool' .

It's generally very difficult to achieve realism in 'invented' subject matter like this . Real faces have subtle nuances and details that are difficult to remember and replicate without anything to refer to , such as a photo or 'model' . Eventually I might use a photo reference in order to get the features and shading really looking correct .

Although the meaning of what it traditionally depicts is fairly self evident , various characters have subsequently seemingly tried to re-invent this card and give it a new meaning .\nIn Arthur E. Waite\u2019s \u2018Pictorial Key to the Tarot\u2019 he described the \u2018Fool\u2019 as \u2018...a young man in gorgeous vestments ..\u2019 who \u2018 surveys the blue distance before him ... rather than the prospect below \u2018 . Waite goes on to say that \u2018 ....his face is \u2018.... full of intelligence and expectant dream\u2019 and that \u2018... the edge which opens on the depths has no terror ....as if the angels were waiting to uphold him \u2018 . This interpretation seems to be largely shared by another \u2018Golden Dawn\u2019 associate , Aleister Crowley , who apparently saw the \u2018Fool\u2019 as representing the \u2018Holy Fool \u2018 or perhaps \u2018Mad Visionary\u2018 and apparently saw the card as representing illumination or \u2018inspiration beyond logic \u2018 .

Announcement. Big publisher. Voxel engine\nSurvival, crafting, drones and laser weapons\nMood, trait and ambition system, as well as multiplayer plans\nAbout us\n And the brand new voxel terrain engine. See youtube\nWe've been working on Proven Lands with a super small team for some months now, creating a game in you become an explorer - not just another sandbox item collector. Packed with the real mysteries of physics, biology and chemistry, plus tons of (hopefully) reasonable science-fiction, influenced by Star Trek, Don't Starve and Project Zomboid. \nIn Proven Lands survival is our strongest concept. It starts with a stranded astronaut -- you. You fight hunger, thirst, strange animals, weather and even the nature itself. Give the pre alpha demo a try, attempt to survive for a few days. Right at this moment you\u2019re able to eat everything with your helmet on (for demonstration reasons) but because we aim to be a hard sci-fi game in the future you\u2019ll have to take off your helmet first before you can eat anything. Your initial spacesuit is weak and old. However you\u2019ll need an armored one to survive against stronger animals and armed aliens later on \u2013 oh, and you\u2019ll need better weapons than an axe.\nAs soon as you\u2019ve mastered the first terrain biome (desert), there will be plenty to discover such as steppes, savannah like environments, forests, big rivers, caves and different planet types such as ice or volcano - each filled with tons of items and characters. The AI game master will watch your influence in a region so after some time more intelligent animals, and perhaps even aliens will start to attack you. First off though we start with simple alien villagers and introduce you to a rather basic storyline. And, because it\u2019s a sci-fi survival game, build devices, smaller machines, factories and before you basically upgrade your \u201ccamp\u201d to a small one-man outpost -- similar to an advanced camp in Don't Starve, just deeper, bigger, and more sci-fi.\nThe story engine of Proven Lands has two sides -- a main story and an AI-driven meta game.\nThe main story is thrilling but also a little bit philosophical too - about friendship, bravery, responsibility and even a pregnancy. You assume the role not of a scientist or a soldier, but a a working class hero or heroine. You're named after the real-life Teruo Nakamura - a soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army who did not surrender until 1974.\nThink of the AI meta game engine as a pen & paper game master who gathers all the randomly generated elements unique to each player's experience and weaves these components into an one-off adventure. You'll be kept busy battling thirst, hunger, oxygen deprivation and dwindling energy supplies .... but as soon you've gathered enough resources, seek out for new civilizations!\n Intro music track\n Monolith music track\n Night Is Scary music track\n Key Concepts and Game Mechanics\nModding - We love mods! Proven Lands was designed with mods in mind, from the get-go.   \nProcedurally generated - Endless and seamless procedurally generated terrain with different biomes on different planets. So far we have desert, forest, river, mountain, hill, swamp and lake biomes. \nAlien races and eco system - In Proven Lands aliens participate in a simple eco system. Trade with a tribe or village, if you have something desirable, similar to Don't Starve.\nAI meta game - The AI is the director of your unique story based on custom quests, ambitions and events - like a pen & paper game master.\nClasses and no super powers - Proven Lands has some RPG elements. Everyone starts as The Forklift Driver with no super powers and a broken heart, and as time goes by new classes unlock: The Medic, The Pilot, The Engineer, The Soldier, The Scientist, and The Android. See stretch goals.\nMoods and ambitions - A mood and trait system makes your character less predictable. A wound left unattended might lead to fever, which could in turn lead to mental instability or death. See demo. Ambitions are quests with a deadline, chosen by you or the AI meta engine, similar to Crusader Kings 2.\nBuilding, housing, farming and eco system - Craft automatic ore mines, water drills, energy and oxygen generators to make your life easier. Proven Lands is not a sim, but there is a small eco system, influenced by an older game jam prototype called LOST UTOPIA. \nCrafting - Each item, weapon, tool, vehicle, drone and building has 7 modules: a base module (type) plus 6 extra modules. Extra modules for armor, power cells, shielding, special abilities, incredients or decoration. For instance, a knife: tool base + short steel blade; or a bio scanner: tool chassis + biology level 1 scanner; or a M1 Abrams tank with a scanner: car base + kevlar-uranium armor + smoothbore gun + turbine engine + bio lvl 1 scanner. ;) Aliens craft items depending on the planet's resources.\nSkills - Basic skills like condition, endurance, willpower, strength. Scientific skills like biology, physics, engineering, ehemistry and xeno sciences. And item skills like blunt weapons, laser weapons or drones (depending on your knowledge). Each skill with an own small skill tree. \nArchaeology and technology - Explore uncharted regions, unknown items and creatures, lost civilizations and artefacts. Your character progresses not only through skills, but through item and artefact knowledge. You do not develop revolutionary physics after a few nights, instead, you gather knowledge in order to become a specialist. Dismantle alien devices for undiscovered resources! See ASCII roguelikes as Dungeon Crawl or Cataclysm.\nOutposts and camps - You're not a camper with a huge bagpack. An outpost is for the long-term, with generators and storage.\nAirlock and natural organism - Thirst, hunger, insanity, oxygen deprivation and energy consumption. On some planets you need an airlock to eat, drink and survive.\nPower supply - Sci-fi devices depend on energy. \nSpaceship artefacts - Sometimes you\u2019ll find useful spaceship parts scattered around the planet. \nItems, resources and item modules - From food to wood to stones to water and megalomaniac butterflies. Each item can be analyzed from level 1 to 3. \nTools, devices and weapons - From a shovel to a scanner, from a navigator to generators and small factories! Aliens have their own devices, weapons and tools too. \nSpaceship, jump drive and space travel - Travel to other planets as soon you've a jump drive or gate. Your spaceship is not a ship, it is more jump gate in the orbit with a few special modules, dictating where your next journey starts. In order to jump to the next planet, talk to aliens and gather resources. \nOne more hour - Most survival games are not known for chill time: you are a laboratory mouse, always in a rush, starving or defending. So, we're working hard to give you more time for exploration and archaeology, or for just being cool.\nAlien companion - Start with the space cat from your first spaceship. \nInfluences\nGames - Dungeon Crawl, Project Zomboid, Don't Starve, Crusader Kings 2, Starflight, Minecraft, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, The Sims, SWTOR, Dead Space 1, Dwarf Fortress, Diablo 3\nMovies, TV and comics - Star Trek (TNG, DS9, TOS, VOY, ENT), Alien, Planetes, Enemy Mine, Outland, Gravity, Contact, Nausica\u00e4, Star Wars\nA few notes\nNew Classes: Soldier, Medic, Engineer, Scientist, Android and Robot - You start as a Forklift Driver, but new classes unlock as you play the game. The classes are based on your lost crew members. For instance, the android class focusses on energy, debris and metal. \nNew Episodes: 6, 7 and 8 - Make new friends and enemies. Discover a completely new side of Minamata, your first planet. There is something shocking below the planet's surface you didn't know before.\nNew Planet Types: Moon, Low Gravity, Volcano and Ice - Moon, Low Gravity, Volcano and Ice - Discover no- and low-gravity planets; landscapes with limited resources. Discover a heavy industry planet with mining towns and an eruptive nature. Each new planet type adds new flora, fauna, items and resources to the universe.\nNew Creatures: Yuracats and Guribulls - These are the concept names for quite a number of completely new creatures.\nNew Creatures: Huge Animals - Do you like dinosaurs? How about a huge animal wandering around in your neighbourhood. This part is a little tricky, due to their size (i.e. animation and combat), but fun.\nNew Creatures: Insectoids - A whole new family with particular skills and stats, different from planet to planet, with new resources.\nNew: Drones - Drones are an important part of the civilized life in the future, far more than in most sci-fi novels and movies. Daily life is different now: everybody has a drone. \nNew: Co-Op Multiplayer - Multiplayer would be amazing! Rafael already started to work on a nodejs/mongodb based server. Let's start simple with a co-op for up to 2-3 players on a planet. We have plenty of ideas here.\nNew Mini Game: Space Submarines - We've been thinking about a short mini-game for the shill out moments. We start with the idea of a voxel-based cloaked spaceship submarine sim xD\nNew: Terraforming - Let's add basic terraforming to the game, allowing you to alter the physical landscape. Basic digging is already in the making but the concept has a lot more potential...\nNew: Randomly Generated Meshes and Models - Do you like Spore? As we already know how to generate models using computer science and math, it could become something special. We start with procedurally generated stones and shrubs, and move on to trees, houses, items and weapons by the time.\nNew Planet Type: Underwater - Well! This is an amazing new world and something we've had in mind for months. We would recycle a lot of current assets and add new mechanics like flying, diving and piloting a submarine-like vehicle. But it is really special and unique - underwater creatures, cities and sub-stations. \nRAFAEL @btxsqdr (FOUNDER, ENGINEER, GAME DESIGNER, CREATIVE DIRECTOR) -- A Saber Rider for 13 years now with pro XP in over one hundred web, desktop, mobile, and VFX projects as an pro engineer. Made his first board game aged 8, learned to code on a C64. Did math and computer science. A degree and a scholarship. A huge sci-fi, games, knowledge and diy fan. Likes board games, Star Trek and Terry Gilliam. Working on a book about game design of procedural generated games. Quite a number of game prototypes. \nMORITZ (FOUNDER, BUSINESS) -- Invented by Silver Surfer, he did some impressive stuff before. As soon as Rafael and Moritz became friends they started to work on a few overambitious ideas. They have secured a few situations to make sure that a game like Proven Lands can be done. Moritz is our business, legal and Kickstarter guy.\nJEFFREY @couchmonaut (2D ARTIST, CONCEPT ARTIST) -- In his early childhood days Jeffrey pursued a figure skating career, but was eventually sifted out due to the high standards of a sport program. Fortunately for us his interest shifted to digital art and games on his grandfather's Amstrad CPC instead. A graduated artist. For some reason Jeffrey and Rafael became a super exciting sci-fi and board game combo.\nContributors and Friends\nDEK @dekdev (3D ARTIST) -- Rumor has it that Dek is an axe wielding, crazed viking slaying dragons on his motorcycle and raiding dungeons all day. Scientists however have proven that he is actually a young guy currently living in Berlin who really likes to create art and video games and to attend to game jams. He once found a treasure chest.\nTOM @nebulousflynn (SOUND DESIGNER, TRAILER EDITOR) -- Tom is a sound recordist and audio designer from the UK who grew up by the sea and now lives in London working as a multimedia designer. When he's not mixing and editing (or attending game jams), he likes to get out into the world and record audio.\nWRENCH @wrenchse (MUSIC COMPOSER) -- Contemporary composer gone rogue, Jonas is an audio engineering and electroacoustic composition student. While you might know him for his critically acclaimed soundtrack for Unmechanical, Jonas has great plans for game music, working on a few projects. Listen to his other music here.\nSpecial thanks to Andy (graphic and logo design), Oliver (ambient tracks) and Ioannis (story intro and second trailer).\nThe history of Proven Lands goes back to an IGM game jam, 7-8 months ago. Back then there was nothing, except for Rafael, early concepts and a few voxel-based prototypes. If you remember those first hours in Minecraft, your curiosity, your first shelter, you probably know how rare such game moments are. This is what Proven Lands is -- it is about the survival in the unknown.\nWhy Kickstarter? We have considered taking a private investor on board. We had a few interesting offers regarding publishers and investors. However, in the end, we came to the conclusion that Kickstarter is still the best choice for us. We also learned that a 3D procedurally generated science-fiction survival-roguelike-RPG-whatever such as Proven Lands is hard to evaluate, to say the least. A successful Kickstarter campaign is not only cool but proves that you guys believe in such a game as much as we do!\nWhy 299k? We've been thinking about the goal for a long time now. We'd like to be honest and keep our word. 299k sounds a lot for a single person, but not for a team, for 12 months. If you subtract 5-10% for Kickstarter, 20% for taxes, as well as social security and other costs, then you have approx. 150k for 12 months, which breaks down to 12.5k per month, for a whole project. That high goal is for a dream team of 8-9 friends for  a time period of 12 months.\nA few notes\nBecome an astronaut - Thank you so much, mate. Warm hugs from us. You are now part of our journey. Tell a few friends about us.\nChoose a copy - First up, we launch on Windows in Spring 2015. After that, iOS and OSX, and then Linux and Android. Additional release dates will be announced after the Windows release. PS4 or XBOX ONE are interesting, of course, but we'll see about it.\nGame credits - Impress your family! Your name in our game credits.\nOriginal Game Soundtrack - Wrench is composing our awesome music soundtrack. See above for a few music samples. If you know the Unmechanical soundtrack, you know that this one will be awesome as well. This soundtrack comes as digital release only at the moment.\nCompanion Book - Another piece of wowsomeness. It contains tons of illustrations, sketches, notes on the universe, the story, the characters, the vehicles and items, even upcoming ideas and extensions. It gives you a unique look behind the scenes. Digital only, as a high-resolution PDF.\nTumblr item DLC, Day item DLC, Night item DLC, Plant DLC, Creature DLC, Space suit DLC, Tool DLC, Weapon DLC, Vehicle DLC, Epic item DLC - All extra DLC items will be revealed within the next few months, but we'll make sure that it's worthy of your pledge. A \"day item\" is useful by day. A \"night item\", well, it's useful by night. A plant, creature, space suit, tool, weapon or vehicle item will make your life easier. Also, an additional tumblr item for tumblr users. Why tumblr? Uh, to be honest, thanks to the support of our tumblr fans some situations went... more smoothly. It's a gift. So, if you pledge as a tumblr user, show us your blog and you'll get an extra item.\nName a plate, a statue or get your name carved on a wall - A name of your choice on a plate, a wall, a house, a statue in the game. All names will be added to the random name list. Bear in mind that we'll want to make sure that the name you propose is reasonable, which means it will need our approval.\nName a plant, a tree, a creature, an item, a village or a planet - Propose a name for these things, even a village or planet. All names will be added to the random name list. Bear in mind that we'll want to make sure that the name you propose is reasonable. \nDesign a plant, a creature, an NPC or an alien race - Send us a photo, a concept, a model or just an idea. You have the chance to influence the process a few times. Show off your skills, impress your grandparents and become part of the game world.\nDesign a story or novel character - Did you ever wanted to be a character in a story? Describe in a few words the character. You'll have the chance to influence the process a few times. In-game NPCs, fellow gamers and perhaps journalists will talk about you for the rest of your life.\nAlpha and Beta access - Join the alpha and beta squad and help us with bugs, ideas and issues. \nGodlike - Geez, you must be the god of backers. Thank you! If you go this far, we can talk about many things. Name a planet after you. Help us design a novel character. And if you really as excited as we are, we could talk about your reward in general. We'd like to be fair.\nPosters and 3D prints - Grab a poster. Or, grab a 3D print (physical scultpure) of Teruo, our main character; additional 3D print model blueprints will be revealed in a few months. What posters do we offer? Most of the 2D art, and additional posters as seen below. More soon.\nProven Lands Con - Well, just a silly idea. We thought about a release party for backers only or something. Depending on the campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe hope you like the pre alpha demo. It is just an early version after some months dev, polished and limited for Kickstarter.\n\nGame development and creative-IT-rocket-science projects in general are often more complex than planned, therefore it is important to focus one's efforts, especially for procedural games with a story and an AI meta game like Proven Lands. You never know. But with a combined 30+ years (!) of experience between Rafael and Moritz alone, plus a bunch of great talents, we believe we are up to this task. \n\nMany challenging parts of Proven Lands are done -- like basic modding, endless procedurally generated terrain with a desert biome, water, canyons and hills, basic AI, an item and inventory engine, an organism, mood and trait system, even basic combat, crafting and collecting. There's still a lot of work to do. But, we are confident that we can and will make it within 1 year.

Its intricate plot and outstanding voxel based design offers opportunities for intense action and unlimited creativity. Planets\u00b3 has been designed to promote multi-player gameplay, to share the fun with friends.\nToday, in the early development stage, all the elements are in place to develop a first PC (windows) release. What we need now is your help to make it happen!\nUpdates\nEvolution and stats\nMaterials and combat system\nMaterial's recipes\nMultiplayer\nGravity\nRumors have it that aliens who look like humans, crashed onto the planet some years ago. What happened? Where are they from? Why did they crash? Are there survivors?\nTo discover the answers to these questions, Planets\u00b3 players will have to solve a number of mysteries and build up their own little world, before expanding into the universe. Many adventures await them and they\u2019ll find plenty of help -and enemies- along the way. As they progress, they\u2019ll be able to level up their character to achieve more and more freedom, till they can roam the universe in their own starship, which, by the way, they may have created themselves\u2026\nWho said the Earth was round?\nPlanets\u00b3 adventures take place in a universe entirely made of 25cm\u00b3 blocks (voxels). Each planet represents thousands of billions of blocks. The blocks can be combined in a variety of ways to build beautiful objects and landscape elements of all shapes and size.\nConcept Art\nFree to roam\nIn this completely open world, freedom is the key. With entire surroundings that can be completely modulated, destroyed and recreated as you wish, the only limit in Planets\u00b3 is your own imagination! But this freedom comes with its own set of challenges. For instance, to leave our planet and visit the universe, players must unlock their own personal spaceship, or build one themselves\u2026 And you\u2019ll need the natives to grant you their trust, so you can master the craft system and learn new skills.\nShare the journey\nYou will find lots of characters during your journey, natives who will ask you to complete tasks for them. Once you have gained their trust, some of them will allow you to use their crafting skills: they will then become Job Masters, Job Masters are essential for your progression since they can provide assistance in many ways: They can research new recipes for you, help build new structures, repair broken items, dismantle objects to learn how to reproduce them; they can also harvest crops for cooking, and of course, fight by your side against any enemy\u2026 Job masters can be blacksmith, goldsmith, engineer, fighter, cook, builder or farmer.\nThe first one you will encounter is Watts the blacksmith. He will be the one to teach you how to craft low level tools, armors and weapons.\nExperience an amazing evolution\nPlanets\u00b3 is split into zones, which represent different levels of difficulty and mark the progression of the player in the story line.\nYou\u2019ll be able to level up your avatar and improve your character\u2019s skills while playing. In fact every action will improve one of your statistics: For instance, running and jumping will improve your form, making you run faster and jump higher; Pushing your limit will increase your stamina and endurance; Using heavy tools or weapons will improve your strength, and make it easier for you to use them.\nIncrease your technical level\nYour technical level is defined by the level of the tools you can create. How do you progress in this area? When traveling from one zone to the next you\u2019ll find new resources that can be used by the Job Master to research new recipes and craft more powerful items. You can also improve your technical level by taking the enemy\u2019s gear after you win a fight, to use it directly or to bring it to a Job Master to dismantle it and discover new recipes.\nThe more advanced your technical level, the more powerful the crafted items will become, but also the more complicated the recipe to create them (requiring more resources and/or rare resources).\nChoose your combat mode\nWith Planets\u00b3 you decide how you wish to fight: You may want to be a heavily armed warrior, fearing nothing except the lack of enemies. But perhaps you will prefer to play an undetectable ninja, sniping enemies from a long distance or sneaking up from behind\u2026 Players teaming up can combine their favorite fighting styles, so that, together, they can take on the most challenging of enemies.\nFight the enemies in dungeons\nDungeons take up a big place in the Planets\u00b3 story and in the secondary quests. Inside each dungeon is at least one boss, who protects a long hidden treasure by sending out enemy apparitions. To put an end to the attacks and reach the treasure, you\u2019ll have to get past the enemies and kill the boss. The treasure itself is a chest full of useful objects, with some unique items in it, which you can bring to a job master to discover new recipes.\nMost dungeons are destructible, but you will need to have the adequate tools to do so. Some will prove to be indestructible for the moment, and you\u2019ll have to make it through their labyrinth to get past them.\nBeware: enemies in Planets\u00b3 are clever. They will work together in groups, aiding each other to fight intelligently against you. When an enemy apparition is killed, there is no random reward but you can take the armor or the objects they were wearing.\nAnd explore every corner!\nAn important part of the adventure will take place in the depth of the planets, where danger is ubiquitous. Of course the player will harvest valuable resources (minerals or crystals), but mainly he will be led there by the story in order to solve quests or mysteries.\nConcept Art\nMore than just an adventure game, Planets\u00b3 is also a construction game, entirely composed of blocks. The wide range of shapes and materials allows you to create everything you need: tools, vehicles, housing\u2026 A hundred different materials are represented, including woods, rocks, metals, dirt, sand, gravel, transformed materials, and of course\u2026alien technology and materials! You\u2019ll be able to use them as you see fit, to make whatever you have to throughout the game.\nCrafting is key\nCrafting is the essential feature of the game, and the only way to evolve. All objects (except gathered resources) are done by assembling subparts; each subpart makes the tool unique in terms of form and material.\nPLAY\n\nWhen you find an object, with a subpart you can\u2019t craft yet, you can choose to dismantle it to learn how to reproduce the object at will or construct new objects with this newly acquired subpart!\nEquip every weapon\nIn Planets\u00b3 players can equip every weapon, whatever their progression. There are no restrictions, but each weapon has an important statistic for its use, called the \u2018recommended strength\u2019; this makes it easier or harder to use depending on your character\u2019s strength.\nBecome a builder\nSome quests in the game will ask the player to build houses (Job Master\u2019s houses for example) or vehicles. To accelerate things you can call on the builder Job Masters to help you out. You will then be able to record the building patterns for key structures and reuse them in another spot, at another time in the story.\nTravel the universe\nDuring your journey you\u2019ll come across animals which you can tame and mount. But the best way to travel is to create the vehicle you wish: Just assemble the blocks to get the shape you want and add the necessary control blocks (motor, cockpit, wheel \u2026). Vehicles control blocks are crafted as any other object in the game, but the player will need to find the engineer job master to unlock the recipes.\nGround vehicles and animals are not the only means of transportation. Planets\u00b3 will have specific control blocks for spaceships!\nSome of the stretch goals can unlock other specific control blocks for boats, planes and helicopters.\nCustomization and Sharing\nThe entire Planets\u00b3 universe is customizable via xml file (or Planets\u00b3 editor if the stretch goal is reached). Crafts can be modified, but also textures, 3D models, quests, planets generation (landscapes), predefined constructions and so on \u2026\nUltimately, a tool is due to be integrated in the Planets\u00b3 editor and implemented on our website so that players can easily share their creations.\nIn the case of multiplayers, customization is stored on the server so that when you join a server you will automatically upgrade your client files.\nWe are three friends who graduated from the same engineering school in France. We share the same passion for video games. After gaining experience, during 9 years, developing a range of applications (professional applications and/or video games) for Windows, Mac, mobiles and even consoles, we decided to found our independent game studio, Cubical Drift, last year in october.\nWe surrounded ourselves with competent and truly motivated people from different horizons (creative artists, graphics and musician) to develop the game of our dreams\nEvery aspect of Planets\u00b3 reflects what we like in video games: old classic RPG, new open world RPG, adventure game and \u2018sandbox game\u2019.\nToday we aspire to dedicating all our energy to this game.\nWhy should you trust us? The fate of our company and its team depends on the success of this game.\nMeet the Team\nMore about the team in the update #5\nTechnology\nWe use Ogre as our 3D engine, because we have years of experience with it.\nWe have developed specific multithreading algorithms to be able to display a massive number of blocks with a large (almost infinite) viewing distance in real time. This allows you to see other planets from the surface (by night and without clouds!). This was our focus in the actual prototype.\nAmong our top interesting features:\nMarked progression, with clearly defined zone levels\nScalable UI: you craft what you need (a map, a watch, radar\u2026)\nAn \u2018In Game\u2019 vehicle construction system to build your transport solutions\nNatural elements taken into account, such as planets alignment, because all the planets are in motion!\nRealism, with features like pipelines to transport resources, different smelting furnaces for metal, electric circuits management, farming and animal husbandry\nTechnical challenges\nPlanets\u00b3 is full of technical challenges such as:\nLarge viewing distance: you will be able to see everything that is happening in the solar system you are in\nMassive amount of blocs to display: a planet is composed of 32 000 000 000 000 of blocks! One tranche of planet is composed of 1 billion of blocks!\nComplex physical engine for blocks made vehicles\nCommunity Sharing management (to enable players to share their creations)\nParts of these technical challenges have been addressed. In particular, before coming to Kickstarter, we had created the \u00absub resolution based view distance\u00bb engine, which is the major display feature of the game. We reached that goal in December. Sure it will take us a lot of time to optimize the engine, but the hardest part is done!\nHere is an actual game footage. The dev team has been focusing on technical challenges leaving aside the gameplay and the artistic aspect of the game.\nPLAY\n\nAs for now 10% of the game has been developed (game design, artwork, development bases), but we need you to make the other 90%!\nRoadmap\nAs you see some of our stretch goals are really ambitious, and developing them will take more than a year. This is why we decided to release the game in 2 parts:\nThe first release, named Planets\u00b3: Race to Space, is to be finalized, with all features complete, for the fall of 2015 and will include all the goals up to 500 000$ (with the Planets\u00b3 editor). It will take place in the first solar system, with the storyline suspended beyond that...\nWe are targeting 2017 for the release of the 'full game', named Planets\u00b3: Space Enemies, which will open onto the universe and lead to a climactic story ending. Some clues will be scattered in the first opus, though mostly in annex quests and dungeons.\nBudget Breakdown\nMost of the funds will go to development and artwork, the two bigger parts of the planning in terms of the number of persons involved (we will expand the team) and the time needed to complete them. The game also requires writing the story, the quests and working on the sound. These are key to success, even if less demanding in financial terms\nWe plan to sell the game at around $30. As a backer, it means you'll save some money when you support us ; two birds one stone !\nKickstarter Pledges\nAll Backers (whatever the amount) will receive a special thanks in the game credits and an access to the private discussion forum.\nContact and/or delivery for pledges will occur this summer.\nPledge add-ons\nYou just need to add the chosen amount to your current pledge and reward tier:\nFor each additional +$10, you will get an extra digital download (1 access to the alpha, beta and release). Available from the $35 tier and above. Limited to 5 per account.\n For each additional +$20, a set of 3 pets that will help you in the game. Available from tiers between $15 and $100, included in the $200 tiers and above. Limited to 1 per digital copy of the game.\nWe want backers to get something that will make them feel special when starting to play. Something that feels unique.\nHere are the 3 unique backer pets :\nMore about the add-ons in the update#8\nKickstarter Stretch Goals\nAll Kickstarter backers (>=$15) will get free access to the first PC (Windows) game, Planets\u00b3: Race to Space, AND the second, Planets\u00b3: space enemies, as soon as they are available.\nAs backers, you will also be kept up to date on the evolution of the game; we will update you frequently with weekly news, monthly development reports (newletter). What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll take part in the final design of the game.

The latest in steam technology will be on display, to attract and transport visitors to the hotels and guest houses that line the seafronts. Amusements and Monuments will be created to edify and delight the visiting holidaymakers. You, as the designer of these developments must complete your resort first and claim your rightful place as Chief Architect, by Royal Appointment! Help is available from enigmatic and mysterious personages: Donkey-boy, Lord Admiral, Princess Royal and Madame Ice-cream. They may prove invaluable but are fickle and may aid your opponents too!\n Steam Donkey is a card game that is fun but has depth to its strategic play. You will make decisions about when to take cards into your hand from the resort and whether to build in the Park, Beach or Town area. You, as the Architect will have to choose which characters will be of most use to you each turn and which projects they will help you construct. All for the glory of having the most magnificent resort in the land!\nIt is a game for 2 to 4 players and lasts approximately 45 to 60 minutes.\nThe Grand Hotel\nThe cards will be round cornered when cut and the borders a little more trim. Size will be 87 mm x 56 mm. This image is RGB, but will look even better in CMYK.\nLord Admiral\nIn Steam Donkey we have designed a game that is fun but not lightweight, that has competition but is not so 'in your face' that smaller players will cry when you deprive them of the services of Donkey Boy. \nWe are determined to produce a game with excellent art-work and high quality card stock. The game has 112 cards and 25 unique card images - more if we achieve our stretch goals. We hope the price of the game will be recognised as great value for money and that this will be a factor in encouraging you to support this project.\nThe Bandstand card\nWe have set the target (\u00a34000) at the minimum needed to produce Steam Donkey. \u00a34250 would enable us to produce two extra card images and \u00a34500 a further two. These four 'Kick-on' cards are our stretch goals and would add an extra element and level of strategic play to the game.\nWe guarantee you will have your copy of the game before they hit the shops, just as we did with 'Promised Land 1250-587 BC'.

The Zont Deck is a deck of many games that you could never play with a regular deck of cards. The goal of this Kickstarter is to get you and all your friends playing games with the Zont Deck. \nYou should support this Kickstarter if any of these apply to you:\nYou like card games. \nYou like having an infinite amount of games in your pocket.\nYou like making your own games.\nYou like owning a piece of Alien culture. \nYou like a game system that doesn't need a power source.\n\"If you're wanting to try something new, definitely check it out\u2026\"\n- Bower's Gamer Corner Video Review of the Zont Deck\n\"This is one card game you won\u2019t want to shy away from...\" - Vince, Dad's Gaming Addiction Video Preview\nThe Zont Deck is now officially EU Friendly. EU fulfillment will be done through Ship Naked who have a facility in the UK.\nThe famous and honorable Zont composer Jarum Vom Zont will begin composing a multi-planetary tribute. This original music track will be an MP3 download available by May 1 of 2014 to all Backers.\nAt $3000 the Standard Zont Deck will be upgraded! See below for more details. \nThe Zont Deck is a 55-card deck. Like our Earth Deck of cards (you know that one with which your grandmother might have taught you how to play Rummy, or maybe Texas Hold'em) the Zont Deck has been a part of Zont culture for hundreds of years. But...that's where the similarities end.\nThe Zont Deck has three colors with 5 unique suits of 11 cards each. Each suit has three sets of 1,2,3 and one zero and one four, instead of 2 through Ace like our Earth Deck.\nNumbers and colors aside it's the suits that make the Zont Deck truly unique. They are more than just a name and a pretty face (I\u2019m looking at you Diamonds). Each suit is tied to a specific and important part of Zont culture, things that they look up to, aspire, or maybe have just accepted. And because of this each suit represents a power, and how that power works depends on the game being played.\nThe Zont Deck is a living game system with games contributed by me, a community of game designers, and the Zonts themselves. \nYou can download a rules PDF HERE.\nThese are just a few of the games for the Zont Deck. You can find more games, or upload your own at TheZontDeck.com. \nYou're not limited to just the games we have created, the Zont Deck is a toolbox you can use to make your own games. You may choose to make games with any or all of the features of the deck. To unlock the true power of the deck, however, you should understand the suits. \nThe Zont Deck suits each carry a power theme, or type of action. When designing a game with the Zont Deck, you create actions for each of the suits to perform based off the theme of that suit. \nHere is an overview of the Suits and their power themes:\nTHE STANDARD ZONT DECKEach copy of the Zont deck comes with rules for the game Key. There are more games available at http://www.thezontdeck.com. Shipping in the U.S. is included in the reward. \nAdditional decks may be added on for $12 each for all backers. \nThe cards are poker size 2.5\" x 3.5\" and are made from a 12 point 285 gsm clay coated card stock. \nTHE HONORARY ZONT EDITION\nThis is a Kickstarter-only edition. It includes one custom Zont Deck and an extended rule and story book (English). How custom? That's up to you.  You get to pick any 3 different colors, have your name or your Zont name on the back of every card, AND provide me a list of up to 11 people you consider the most influential or important people in your life or the world. Those names we will place on the Great Zont cards of your custom deck. \nHere's an example of your custom back:\nCustom Back\nAnd here's an example of one of your Great Zont cards:\nA custom Great Zont card\nYOUR HONORARY ZONT NAME\nIn addition to a Deck, my Zont associates and I thought, as a sign of interstellar peace, we would offer an honorary Zont name to each backer. My Zont name is Snamo Zont, yours could be Harriet Zont, or Peter Zont. Or Crom Zont. Which is pretty cool you have to admit. \nTHE WAITING LIST TO VISIT THE PLANET ZONT\nBut what good is a name if you can't put it somewhere? Everyone else does Thank You lists. We thought why not list your Zont name on a Waiting list to visit the planet Zont? (disclaimer: Not sure when or even if an actual trip will be possible so this is just a Waiting list, not a guarantee of a visit to an alien planet). The waiting list will be posted everywhere it's possible across the Zontco websites and social networks. \nTHE OFFICIAL ZONT AMBASSADOR T-SHIRT\nA 100% cotton preshunk short-sleeve brick red t-shirt with the mysterious and eye-catching Zont Deck logo. Shipping in the U.S. is included in the reward.\nYOUR OFFICIAL CELEBRATION DAY!\nThis is the day that we will commemorate your help by a memorial posting across our social network every year for as long as Zontco LLC exists (hopefully forever). This includes Facebook, Google+, Instagram, and Tumblr at the moment, but more as time goes on.  If you're business minded - this is a great place for us to mention something important about you and yours. \nBECOME AN HONORARY GREAT ZONT\nThis is it, the top of the reward food chain. A professional illustrator/artist will create a caricature of you in a Zont style that will be immortalized on one of the 11 Great Zont suit cards (to be chosen by Zontco LLC) in EVERY Standard Zont deck produced from this Kickstarter. You will send me a photo of yourself, and we will bring you to life in a way that only a Great Zont could be.  In essence, you will be an Honorary Great Zont.  You will also receive a 24x18 poster of your card to help commemorate the experience. \n\nThere will indeed be stretch goals throughout the campaign. I prefer stretch goals that benefit as many people as possible, so you will see that thinking in each new goal. \nSTRETCH GOAL #1 : 81 BACKERS\nEvery backer will get an original music track from the famous Zont composer, Jarum Vom Zont. The honorable Vom Zont will begin his multi-planetary tribute as soon as the project is successful. The track will be an MP3 download available by May 1 of 2014. \nSTRETCH GOAL #2 : $3000\nAt $3000, the Standard Zont Deck will be upgraded to full plastic coated 310 GSM with a linen finish!\nMy name is Kevin Omans and by day I am a creative director in the far away and fantastical land of advertising. At night when I\u2019m done chasing my 3 year old I'm hard at work designing, playtesting and opening the Earth office of Zontco LLC. \nThe Zonts are the peaceful caretakers of the planet Zont. The Zonts absolutely love gaming. They find great joy in it, and I think we share that joy and this might be a great way for our two cultures to meet.

While our current product line has slowly grown to include more than 30 Character Meeples, we have received tons of requests for more!  Rather than releasing only a few of the ideas at a time, slowly over the course of the next few years, we want to work together with you, our backers, to make far more characters available right away!\nWith your help, we can make all of this meeply awesomeness happen! We started this project with an amazing 50 characters, but the potential was there to unlock even more choices via our stretch goals, which is exactly what we did! As a backer, you've had a say in what some of those extra characters would be!\nWith rewards from simply one set of your absolute favorite character, all the way to levels that include a complete 8-piece set of EVERY character released in this Kickstarter project, we have something for everyone!\nDown below are the Character Meeples that you can currently choose from, when filling out the backer survey at the end of the funded project. Any unlocked characters from the many stretch goals will give you even more to choose from. Or don\u2019t choose. Just get \u2018em all! :-)\nThis number DOES include the \"Character Germs\", but not the TEK tower token, as it is not part of the pledge level choices. Nor does it include meeples from our existing inventory, as they were released long before this Kickstarter.  Backers at the 1-of-each and 8-of-each pledge levels have seen their reward value go up with each unlocked stretch goal! :-D\n\nWhat about the characters that already exist?\nCheck out Update #17 to see which Character Meeples from our existing stock can be chosen as your reward for this Kickstarter project.  There is also a list of which ones are not available in this way, due to limited stock.\nPLEASE NOTE: As these Character Meeples were not released in this Kickstarter, they are not included in the \"1-of-each\" or \"8-of-each\" pledge levels.  If you want these as well, you can do an add-on based on which ones / how many you want. Thanks!\nCan I add-on 1-of-each of these 25 Character Meeples from existing inventory?\nDefinitely! It is actually convenient to do so, as there are 25 of them, and we already offer an add-on for any 25 individual meeples. You will have an option in the backer survey to simply state \"all 25 from MeepleSource.com\", instead of having to name each one separately.\nWhat are Character Meeples used for?\nAnything you want! Our 8-piece sets are the most popular size because that is how many meeples each player needs for a standard game of Carcassonne. Our Character Meeples are used to upgrade pawns in countless other games, representing workers, warriors, and more! How many games do you have that have some kind of marker for each player?\nDon\u2019t be \u201cgreen discs\u201d, \u201cyellow cylinders\u201d, or \u201cred tetrahedrons\u201d. Be pirates and princesses! Be zombies or werewolves! Be anything you want. Also, I know that many of you already have Character Meeples lined up on your desk at work. Because you can.\nHow big are Character Meeples?\nSimilar in size to our \"Mega Meeples\", they are approximately 19mm tall. Characters do vary some, particularly those with hats, wings, etc. As we have stated on our website since the inception of the Character Meeples, we have no intention of offering these characters in the smaller, \"standard size\" (16mm) meeples. The level of detail that we are able to achieve on 19mm meeples is very difficult, but impossible at a 16mm size. Thanks for understanding!\nRisk-Free Guarantee! \nIf for any reason you would like to return your Character Meeples, you\u2019ll have 30 days after receiving them to do so and get a full refund. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nYou Can Influence Characters That Are Still Undecided/Locked!\nAlthough we could have selected every character ourselves, we didn\u2019t, because we know how much you love to get involved in the process! As a backer you can vote on characters that are not yet determined, and be involved in other choices along the way.\nMore Pledges Help Everyone Unlock Even More Characters! Even after the project is funded, continued support will unlock more and more stretch goals, which will give all backers more Character Meeples to choose from. We will continue to add stretch goals as long as you continue to support us by pledging, spreading the word about this project, and participating by voting for our backer-chosen characters. We can\u2019t thank you enough!\nWe Need You! We have worked very hard to get this far, and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of our finished art. But we still need all of you to make this dream a reality!\nWant to add on extras of one or more characters? These handy add-ons should do the trick! Simply click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button and adjust your pledged amount to account for any add-ons from the list below. Remember that you do not need to change which backer level you are at (unless you want to do that as well), just the dollar amount of the pledge itself.\nALL pledge levels are also available as add-ons! To help you figure out how much to pledge to get all the goodies you want, please use our nifty...\nA NOTE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FOR ADD-ONS:\nIn an effort to simplify this crazy long project page, we have consolidated many of the pledge levels and add-ons, as secondary pledge levels can be added to ANY OTHER pledge level, if you wish.  Please use the pledge calculator to determine how much you should pledge for your desired combination.  The total that it will give you, including the appropriate international shipping, is correct.  Thanks!\nSOME OTHER ADD-ONS:\n$150  MEEPLE-IZE YOURSELF! (see FAQ for details)\n$350  DESIGN AND MAKE YOUR OWN RESOURCE BIT! (see FAQ for details)\n$800  DESIGN AND MAKE YOUR OWN CHARACTER MEEPLE! (see FAQ for details)\n  All stretch goals have now been reached, so every Character Meeple is available to backers at all pledge levels! Want to see each of the completed stretch goals?

We regularly collaborate with our loyal customers, bringing to market their own ideas as well as our own. We want to take great games and upgrade the boring bits to impressive ones, enhancing the player experience.\n If you are not already familiar with our existing line of Character Meeples, you may be wondering how close to the original art (pictured above) will the actual wooden bits be? We elaborate on this question in the FAQ down at the bottom, but here are a few recent comparisons from our existing product line that can demonstrate this.\nWe had the pleasure of meeting many of you at BGG.CON this past November, and despite already having over 30 different Character Meeples, we received many requests for more! Once we added your suggestions to the growing list of our own ideas, we realized that there were way too many great concepts for us to release in a single year. Heck, maybe not even over several years.\nThis is what led us to our first Kickstarter project. Together we can make this meeple magic happen!\nWant to make one of our new Character Meeples your avatar for Kickstarter, Facebook, Board Game Geek, or other sites?\nClick here to see each one individually and pick YOUR favorite!

You can order the game on the official webpage!\nAbout Province\nProvince is a two player game where you must manage your resources and workers to build, complete goals, and score the most victory points to win! It features eurogame strategy and only takes about 25 minutes to play. It also fits in a 4\" x 4\" bag, so it's easy to take with you.\nTo succeed you need to manage a communal worker pool representing the available workers in your town. Players move their workers to generate resources (Labor and Coin) that are used to build the various Structures, which in turn effect resource generation. But your opponent can also move the workers leaving you without the resources you need! \nIf you want to know more you can download the current draft of the rules here. A number of fans have also provided translations of the draft rules into other languages: German, French, Spanish (Spain), Italian, Czech, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), and Mandarin Chinese.

We\u2019ve designed and laid out all of the components to make it affordable and quick to deliver to everyone! The design work is done, and this game will go to press and out to backers as quickly as possible. By keeping the game small, we'll get it to you faster and spend more time making new ones. We\u2019ve got a busy year planned, and we\u2019re ready to print! \nWe care about how games are made and how they get to you. The game will be manufactured in the United States, so you're also funding proper living wages for the people making your game.\nYou\u2019ll receive a fresh slice of chipboard with all of the pieces ready to punch out and a bag to keep everything in.

Keep watching to see our progress and where we\u2019ll be heading in the future. Besides getting updates through Kickstarter you'll be able to follow our progress on our Official Site as well as via Facebook and Twitter. \n Tabletop Simulator is an online tabletop sandbox game with multiplayer physics. The sandbox nature of the game means there are no rules to stop you from playing however you want. Want to pick up and throw someone\u2019s piece, go for it, but they might not ask you back to play. This freedom allows near limitless gaming possibilities; with a deck of cards alone you can play hundreds of games. In Tabletop Simulator we supply you the tools, so you have the freedom to play anything. Play a game of chess one minute, and with one click continue your epic role-playing adventure!\nThrough the use of multiplayer physics you can pick up, manipulate objects, and play a multitude of games just like you do in real life. Computer adaptations of these classic tabletop games lack the charm of their predecessors due to their restrictive nature. Just being able to pick up dice and roll like you can in Tabletop Simulator, is part of what makes a tabletop game a tabletop.\nWe are all about the basics here at Berserk Games and nothing is more fundamental than having a game night with the family or poker night with your bros. Now you won't have to miss out playing even if you are across the country.\nOnline sandbox playground that you play how you want.\nNear unlimited games thanks to sandbox no rules design.\nMultiplayer physics with objects that collide and interact just how you would expect.\nPlay just like you do in real life; pick up, rotate, shake, and throw any object.\nUp to 8 people can play together on the same table & talk on in-game voice chat.\nThe perfect \u201cgame night\u201d fun due to seamless game loading & saving.\nTons of pre-made game modes with the option to make your own games.\nGreat admin tools to eliminate griefing in public games.\nMultiple 360\u00b0 panoramic backgrounds that change the mood.\n There's currently ~15 pre-made game modes: Backgammon, Cards, Checkers, Chess, Chinese Checkers, Custom, Dice, Dominoes, Go, Pachisi, Poker, Reversi, Sandbox, and Solitaire. \nDon't let that number fool you, there's endless game possibilities. For example, in Custom you can import any image onto the game board and spawn the objects to make your own game. This can be saved and played later with your friends. As the sandbox description implies we give you both the box with sand and the tools to make what you want.\nBerserk Games is a brand new indie developer studio composed of experienced modders who wanted to make new and exciting experiences. We are gamers first just like you, that had a dream to make something their own.

Thanks and wish us luck!\n What platform is the game being released on?\nTarget platforms are PC, Mac, and Linux.\nWhen do I get my beta key(s)?\nBeta keys will be given out at the end of the Kickstarter.

Six designs to chose from (see pics below). Just add to your pledge:-\n\u00a35.00 - One champion\n\u00a39.00 - Two champions\n\u00a312.00 - Four champions\n\u00a315.00 - Six Champions  \nAll mini's will be added to your copy of Mazemaster - yep, there will be room in the box for your add ons.\nThese sketches will now be turned into the final renders for one of our upcoming updates\n Firewalker Action Card\nThis Add On is free of Charge - just share Mazemaster on your social media or other forum and be eligible for this extra Advanced Action Card in your copy of Mazemaster. there is no cut off, so even if you see this in the last 20 minutes of the campaign, still share. Every backer pushes us further into the stretch goals.\nFor 19.50 ($30) you can have your very own 24\"X24\" Gripmat to play Mazemaster on. This includes the shipping and, if you're a Gripmat backer already you know how good these are. See below for the designs available.\nLast Day Mystery offer:\nFor those who think that a Gripmat, though awesome, is simply too costly, but still want a gaming surface on which to play Mazemaser, we have sourced A2 sized gloss posters to allow Mazemaster to be played on an 8 X 8 grid. For this Mini Mat - just add \u00a35.00 to your pledge, and we'll pop it in the box with your copy - that's right no postage. All four Gripmat designs are available in the Poster Form, like my favorite:-\none of our Gripmat Art forms - the A2 poster will be on a 8X8 grid, players staring in the four corners to race to the centee of the Maze\nMini Mats will be folded for delivery, and added to the box. If you want one fold free and rolled, postage is a further \u00a35.00\n The 'All For One' Game Mode\nThere is more than one way to play Mazemaster - maybe you want a quick game before heading out, and don't have time to race to the center then race out again. Maybe you're the type of player who wants to really battle for that one Relic. So, Here are a few of the Game modes that you can try:- \na. Get In Get Out - There are a number of relics equal to the number of players in the center. Each player must get their relic, and get back to their entrance before their opponents.\nb. Short Race - Players race to the center to obtain the relic. First one there wins\nc. All for One - In this game mode only one relic is used. Players race to the center to acquire the relic, and must then get back out of the maze via the exit. Once a player has the relic, others may use the advanced Action \u2018Steal\u2019 to take it.\n The Steal Action Card, and therefore the All For One game mode, will be unlocked at \u00a310,000.00. A little push will see us there. This game mode is ideally suited for use with pre-laid teleporter tiles, to take the battle to a new area.\nThe first stretch goal,New Tactics, is already going ahead. It will be fully unlocked at \u00a315,000.00, but as we lead up to that goal it will be unlocked in stages. Most of them will require the action card 'Enchant'\nAt \u00a38,000.00 We introduce Teleporter Tiles \u2013 using the advanced action 'Enchant' a maze piece can be replaced with the Telepoter Tile. When a champion enters the Teleporter, he will be zipped away to a different Teleporter tile of his choice. Be careful though, players using Teleporters may become the subject of another players wrath.\nAt \u00a310,000.00 we shall introduce the next two upgrade tiles:- First, The Fountain \u2013 again played as an upgrade this piece automatically extinguishes one adjacent tile at the end of the turn. Second, the fire launcher \u2013 at the beginning of each turn, an adjacent away is set on fire.\nAt \u00a311,000.00 we shall introduce tunnels. A player can use a single build action to create a tunnel 3 tiles long \u2013 a good way of bypassing traps, or against players who enjoy rotating your pieces.\nAt \u00a312,000.00 we shall introduce Mana Grove \u2013 this upgrade results in a tile becoming almost invulnerable, making your maze a champion paradise.\nAt \u00a313,000.00 we introduce Wind Tunnels \u2013 a new type of maze section to be built \u2013 which can replace like for like, the result being that area can only be traveled across in one direction. Don't like the direction, then best start rotating buddy!\nAnyone feel a breeze?\nFinally, at \u00a315,000.00 Two additional pieces to aid your tactics:- First - The Summoners Grove \u2013 a new maze tile to be constructed which adds a squire \u2013 an aid to the players champion that can also travel the maze to reach the relic. Be wary though, squires are not as epic as a champion, and can suffer from an infliction known as death. Second:- 'The 'De-buff' advanced action Card - allowing you to remove two enchantments of your choice. Exciting times ahead guys. Each time we reach one of this sub stretch goals we will show you what you have unlocked. This is the first to making Mazemaster truly epic.\nMazemaster is a 2-4 player game where stone, zombies, and even physics are merely obstacles to be surpassed as you build, fight and wend your way through a maze of your own construction in order to claim the legendary Relic. Starting from the very edge of the mountain, you \u2013 a mage on a mission \u2013 must use your powers not only to make your way to the centre, but also to impede and slow down your opponents through myriads of magical trickery - rotating their mazes into dead ends, burning their caverns, or even outright destroying what they create - all in order to ensure that the only mage making it to the centre is you and you alone. But beware, not only do you have to make it to through the maze to the relic, you have to make it out again. With up to 3 other mage's trying to stop you, that may not be such an easy feat! \n In each copy of Mazemaster you can find the following joys:-\nFour Champion Pawns\n4 Relics\n28 Basic Action Cards\n44 Advanced Action Cards\n90 Maze Cards\n4 Entrance Tiles\n1 Exit Tile\n1 Relic Tile\n4 Action Boards\nPure Awesomeness (awesomeness is a state of mind attained from seeing all of the above, it does not fade and is non transferable).\nO yes, and a rulebook - can't have a game without rules.\nThe rules for Mazemaster are simple (if you don\u2019t fully believe us, check out the rulebook here!). At the beginning of every turn, players select up to three actions (using a mix of basic and advanced action cards) they wish to use once the turn begins. These could be anything from as simple as building\nmoving...\nor revealing a part of the Maze (certain game modes) \nTo battling through a hoard of creatures eager to rip out your throat... \nIn fact, the number of actions are many \nBasic Actions\nAdvanced Actions\nOnce each player has selected their three actions, the turn is executed, the story unfurled one action at a time. Using the choices made players must respond to their opponents tactics - slowing down any player that may be ahead of them, or even preparing for a dastardly piece of magical trickery coming their way. Amongst the chaos, you must get to the center of the map, wherein lies the relic. Reaching the relic, however, isn't the end; your wizard has his powerful new weapon, but he needs to get out of the mountain in order to understand how to use it! And chances are, if you reached it first, your fellow players may not be too keen on letting you escape so easily!\nMazemaster lasts between 25-45 minutes depending on how many people are playing and is extremely re-playable. We've got a lot of additional exciting ideas that we want to include into this game which we have turned into stretch goals: Why kickstarter? We\u2019ve always been hugely fascinated by the concept of crowdfunding, and we've looked at and \u2013 contributed to a lot of great games that have come up on here! Gamers on kickstarter are engaged, interested and \u2013 importantly \u2013 keen to see games they like the look of get made. So here we are, hoping we will be one of them! \n Weaver, the company behind this game, began as all great ideas should; over a pint! We\u2019ve come from different backgrounds and experiences when it comes to games; Chris has a small mountain of Magic: The Gathering cards whilst Trev has played enough board games to fill up a shed. Our experience of these two different gaming worlds and our mutual love of all things entertaining has somehow coalesced into thousands of hours of talking, tweaking, developing and designing games, of which Mazemaster is hopefully going to be the first to market. We've got a load of games, expansions and new ideas lined up that we\u2019re really excited about and, if we\u2019re successful, you\u2019ll be seeing very soon! \nAs an additional perk - every backer who shares a link to our campaign on their social media or a forum that they are a part of will receive an extra type of Action Card in the game. The Firewalker Action.\nSharing is Caring\nDon't like the idea of additional postage costs? No problem, rather than adding the European and US postage fee, pay a mere \u00a32.00 extra and we'll arrange to be at Essen to drop off the game to you personally (why \u00a32.00....because Van hire and ferry tickets cost a pretty penny)\nIn the rewards you will see the very nifty sounding metallic cards. The Kickstarter Promo metallic cards will be solid metal as shown in this handy little pic.\nABOUT THE ADD ONS\nGripMats\nWe are pleased to say that following discussions with the creators of Gripmat, this excellent product is now available for Mazemaster. Backers will be able to select from several designs:-\nGripmat No 1\nGripmat No 2\nGripmat No 3\nGripmat No 4\nMazemaster fits onto a 24\" X 24\" Gripmat, and the cost of one (including postage to UK, Europe, USA and Canada) is $30 (roughly \u00a319.50). So, to all those backers who would like to play Mazemaster on a Gripmat, and enhance their experience further, you just need to add the equivalent sum to your pledge and, at the end of the campaign, pick your design in the survey.\n3D Printed Pieces\nOnce you have backed Mazemaster, head along to www.weaverentertainment.com and have a gander at the little poll we have just put up (3/3/14) for you guys. If we receive 100 yes votes on the poll we will add 3D printed Champions as an Add on (we require a unit order of 100, so won't add it unless we are sure we can deliver on the add on). Once we have the 100 yes votes we will confirm that we are good to go via the next update.\n Here are the concepts for the Bad Guys of the Champion world - there will be six available to chose from - Three Bad and Three Good. \n The costs of the champions will be:-\n1 Champion: \u00a35.00 \n2 Champions: \u00a39.00\n4: Champions: \u00a312.00\n5 Champions: \u00a315.00\n6 Champions: \u00a315.00 - that's right, the 6th one is free - because everyone loves free stuff, and by Joe if you've gone as far as wanting 5, who are we to stand in your way of the 6th!\nSo, if you want to see the Champions make their way into the game as 3D printed miniatures, then head on over to www.weaverentertainment.com and enter your vote.\nWhat a way it will be to end the campaign with these excellent pieces!\nCollaborations\nWe would like to convey our thanks to Mr Matt Flemming, creator of the Double Six Die project for his support and assistance to date. Anyone who wants a new take on dice, fairer rolls and cool designs should check out www.doublesixdice.com.\nWe would also like to thank Jeff of Home Run Games. Home Run games are creating the metallic cards on our behalf, and recently ran a successful Kickstarter Project. If anyone likes the idea of unique metal and foil playing cards, go to http://homerungames.com/\n Once the primary goal has been reached, we can look to the future at the potential of the game...\nNew Tactics & Game Modes: \u00a315,000\nWe will throw new possibilities into the game with additional maze tiles, advanced tactics, and squires, such as:- \nTeleporter Tiles \u2013 instantly traverse entire sections of the maze\nMana Shield (adds the Mana token) \u2013 prevent a tile from being burnt or rotated. Nifty against pyromaniacs\nFountain (adds the Selection Die) \u2013 randomly extinguishes adjacent tiles\nTunnel \u2013 find an existing path blocking your maze \u2013 no problem, that's what shovels, explosives and a well placed beam of mana are for\nSummoners Grove (adds the squire token) \u2013 summon a squire to the maze to travel independently of your champion to seek out relics.\nWind Tunnel (adds the Tunnel Token) \u2013 summon powerful winds to only allow a tile to be traversed in one direction.\nNew, Improved and basically fantastic Artwork: \u00a320,000\nAllow us to make more fanciful varieties of the maze tiles to add. Not just one design for each piece, but several! \n Grandeur Scaling: \u00a325,000\nWhy should you strive for one relic, when you can try and obtain three. Each piece gives your mage a new ability to manipulate the maze, with the final piece granting you untold power\n Character Development: \u00a335,000\nWhy not allow each player to bring their own twist to the table. By choosing which mage you play as you bring a unique strategy to the table. As we unlock this goal each mage will gain his or her own artwork to accompany the players choice. The first mages lined up are:-\nPyro \u2013 can burn multiple tiles in a single action\nDestroyer \u2013 destroys multiple tiles with one use of the destroy ability \nCharger \u2013 can utilise the charge ability \u2013 forfeiting a round entirely but gaining use of the victim slot for the next 6. turns.\nManipulator \u2013 rotate only costs one action point\nAdrenaline junkie \u2013 can pay one extra action point to move into a trap space\nSprinter \u2013 moves two spaces instead of one when using 'Move'\nBlinker \u2013 cannot burn tiles, or move, but can use the teleport action. every turn.\n Application Development \u00a350,000\nOnce we hit \u00a350,000.00 we will have the funding in place to bring Mazemaster to the i-pad or Android (which one depends on the backers). This will be a PvP game initially, and as we raise more funds, we can introduce and grow an A.I. to allow for stimulating single player fun as well. As we grow even further we can take the app to the market in fremium style, adding more and more content to be unlocked or purchased. Every backer who gets a copy of the app will of course have all items unlocked from the very beginning.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith all of the artwork for the game finished (excluding stretch goal art) and the game mechanics no longer being tinkered with, we can\u2019t foresee any problems our end.

Delays in either manufacturing or shipping and other things we have no control over are always going to be a possible risk, but we\u2019re hoping that won\u2019t come to pass. \n\nLikewise we must concede that the stretch goal for the app is based on guideline quotes. the final cost may be higher than what we have been quoted, and this remains a potential stumbling block.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Update", "update_content": "Over the past month copies of the game have been sold on e-bay to raise funds.

I had read the story of how Set had tricked Osiris into trapping himself in a box and it made me laugh and I wanted more people to know.\nHowever, when I came to continue reading the story, I found so much good content that I wanted to draw and it suddenly dawned on me - why wasn't I told about the Egyptian Gods sooner?\nWhy Make Pantheon?\nIf you want to learn about Egyptian mythology, you have two options; children's books which censor all the most interest bits or dry academic tomes which reference every contradicting version. \nPantheon exists because I want to read it - a simple but accurate version of the stories with all the humour, excitement and emotional beats they were originally supposed to have. \nPantheon focusses on \"the most important\" myth - the battle between Set and Horus for the throne of Egypt. However, no single version of this story exists and there are many additions and contradictions between the versions. Where necessary, I will use my artistic license to make sense of it all but I won't make anything up. This is a faithful adaptation in terms of story.\n Stretch Goals\nIf I manage to fund this project to \u00a312,000, the Divine Edition will be a colour edition and available to more people. Anything over the 100% will go towards printing more comics, promoting it at more conventions and possibly developing Pantheon as a series. Sequels would be based around other Mythologies. \nPantheon will be printed by Cambrian Printers. They're a wonderful company that I've worked with before and I am very confident they will get the job done to a satisfying degree.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPantheon is my first graphic novel and I've never done a comic of this length before.

Maybe you have bought a PC from EBay but the seller forgot to tell you the password. Or maybe you are helping to fix a friends PC and they cannot remember the administrator password they set when they first bought it. Enter the Password reset Key.\nUsing the key you can boot the PC into a special admin mode that allows you to view all of the user accounts and reset any password. Quickly regain control of the PC and get back to work.\nWhile other utilities exist to help with this activity they are often complex to setup, require technical knowledge to use and need a working computer with an internet connection before you can get started.\nThe Password Reset Key can be attached to your key ring so you never need to worry about losing access again. The Password Reset Key has been tested with a wide range of PCs that support booting from USB. The following operating systems are supported for password reset:\n\u00b7Windows NT 4\n\u00b7Windows XP\n\u00b7Windows Vista\n\u00b7Windows 7\n\u00b7Windows 8\n\u00b7Windows 8.1\nSome viruses make changes to your system to prevent access. Use the Password Reset Key and you anti-virus scanner to regain access and clean up after an infection.\nFrom the video above you can see that the Password Reset Key can reset a password in less than 60 seconds. It\u2019s simple to use, easy to carry and works with all current versions of Windows.\nHow It Works\nThe Password Reset Tool is a USB Skeleton Key for any Windows computer. Simply turn off the computer, plug in the key and turn it back on again. On some machines you may need to press a button such as Del, F10 or F12 to access a start-up menu. From here you will be able to select to \"Boot from USB\". Once the Password reset Tool appears simply follow the instructions below:\nOnce the USB Stick has booted this splash screen will be presented. Click \"I Agree\" to accept the terms of use.\nThe tool automatically scans all local disks for a copy of Windows. This will often NOT be the C: disk. Select the Windows installation (on a normal system there will usually only be one.)\nA list of users will appear in the box. Click on the name of the user whose password you would like to reset.\nClick the Reset Password button to remove the password for that user. A dialog will appear to confirm that both the LanMan and NTLM password hashes have been blanked.\nOn some systems there are additional security features that will reset the password back to a value during boot up. In this case a user account can be cloned. A cloned user is identical to the original user except for the username and password. Therefore the same profile is used on the file system and the same group memberships apply.\nAfter clicking the Clone User button enter a new name for the cloned user.\nThe cloned user will now appear in the list of users.\nYou will need to reset the password of the cloned user as it will have copied the password of the original user.\nFor any user on the system you can view additional information by clicking the User Info button.\nWhat Is Left To Do?\nWhile an image has been created that allows duplication of the key onto blanks there is still the challenge of creating a universal installer that will allow people to create a Password Reset Key on their own USB thumb drives. In order to support multiple hardware types and disk sizes an imaging approach is not sufficient. With your funding additional development will be undertaken to create a universal installer that will transfer the software to your own key and write the necessary bootloader code to the disk to allow it to boot. This will be non-destructive so you will be able to write this to a key that already contains data (although we still strongly recommend that you make a backup before attempting something like this.)\nOther Projects you May Like\nHaving started this Kickstarter I have come across some other interesting projects that you may also be interested in.

This world is your canvas; the place where you will tell your story as a dungeon master. Through our in-game editor which we've termed \"the Dungeonforge,\" you will be able to craft adventures rife with deep dungeons, dark woods, frosty mountain tops, and just crawling with the unspeakable legions of darkness. Your content then becomes part of the over-arching gameworld for all to enjoy. You can script quests within your adventure for players to complete, or even perform a \"Live Telling\" of your adventure, wherein you actively take the role of dungeon master, playing the part of NPCs, weaving dialog on the fly, and controlling monsters to shape the experience of the players dynamically, in real time. Going further along that theme, we will also feature a competitive, PvDM game type, which will pit the players against the DM, who will be given charge of the hordes of evil in an attempt to thwart the players on their quest.\nMaking sure the best content is available and easy to find during online play is important. All content is rated by the players. The lowest scoring content is hidden, while the highest scoring content will even be pointed out to you by NPC quest-givers in the gameworld's central hub city.\nClick to view larger image.\nCreate and edit large outdoor areas - including adding towns and areas to encounter enemies - to form the overworld for your adventure.\nBuild complex dungeons into your overworld with a simple dungeon tool.\nScript quests for players to follow with an easy to use interface\nScript interactions with NPCs in your adventure, including branching dialog.\nScript events and triggers into your adventure for a more unique and epic experience.\nCreation Tools Trailer:\n A token may be purchased in game that when used, gives the creator of the dungeon a tip, redeemable for real-world currency. This is just another way in which taking the time to create truly enjoyable content is rewarded. The person giving the tip token gains aesthetically unique, \"Epic Loot\" drops in return for their generosity. \"Epic Loot\" features unique designs, aura and particle effects, but is not gameplay affecting. It comes in sets and is meant to be collectible. It's a way for players to really differentiate their character and show to the world that they have a generous spirit.\nClick to view larger image.\nDungeonforge features a unique blend of gameplay concepts. We went with a top-down perspective, so the game shares the same simplicity and intuitiveness in the control scheme as games like Diablo. At the same time, we love the engaging, varied combat of games like Dark Souls and The Witcher 2. Thus the combat is driven by timing your mouse clicks to form combos, avoiding taking damage, dodging, parrying and countering enemy attacks, positioning yourself well and waiting for openings to attack. We knew going in, with the idea of a game driven by player-made content, that the gameplay would have to be good enough for people to actually want to make content for our game and play the content others make. Thus, gameplay became the top priority for us. We're working hard to polish the mechanics and deliver on that premise. We think we've got a fantastic, well thought out blend of concepts that truly sets gameplay in Dungeonforge apart and makes it a can't miss type of experience.\nDungeonforge is built to be equally enjoyable whether playing alone and completely offline, or in a group with friends just as in the days of ye olde tabletop game night.\n The combat is backed by vast character customization options:\nPiles of loot with with special traits and effects to really refine your build\nAn extensive stat sheet\nDeep skill customization with an array of special abilities to suit your particular play style\nSteam Workshop integration where the community can create and submit custom loot to be dropped in dungeons and special abilities to be added to a character's skill sheet and earned right along with the default skills\nIn addition to offline single-player and online play, LAN and same-screen multiplayer (using a mix of gamepads and mouse/keyboard) will be available to support that true, old-school feeling of playing D&D with a bunch of buddies in the same room.\nDungeonforge will feature five playable character classes to start with, each with unique abilities suiting various playstyles. Each character will also have a unique back story which will be elucidated via first-party campaign-style content. Each character's campaign will contain around 20 hours of gameplay. Future playable characters will be released over the life of Dungeonforge, each with an accompanying campaign of similar length. Whenever there's an opportunity to improve the game via new editing tools, a first-party adventure will be released to showcase the new tool.\nPlatforms:\nDungeonforge was recently Greenlit by the Steam community and will be available for the Steam platform on PC, Linux, and Mac computers.  \nA mobile version in which players on their high-end, gaming-oriented mobile devices may play with their Steam using brethren will be available on the Android market at launch, with iOS support being considered based on response to the mobile version.\nWe are completely thrilled to be bringing Steam Workshop support to Dungeonforge at launch! Using our custom mod tools and/or your favorite 3D content creation programs, you'll be able to create and submit content for everyone to use in their dungeons and adventures.\nCreate custom:\nMonsters\nWeapons\nSpells and abilities\nScripting for events, monster behavior, NPC interaction and, well, anything else!\nDungeon tiles\nDecorative and environmental items\nCustom playable characters with your own models, animations, spells and abilities for everyone to enjoy\nA voting and comment system will ensure the best made content rises to the top and that new submissions can be easily found and tried out.\nClick to view larger image.\nA Word on Rewards\nTwo major things of note:\nThe first is that all backers who receive the game as a reward will receive a Special Edition version where their characters come outfitted with a unique look that only backers have access to. You also get early access codes, meaning that every backer who gets the game gets to play it before release and have a say in the way the final product comes out. The Special Edition version also comes with 20 tip tokens so you can start tipping top dungeon makers right out the gate and reap the aesthetically unique \"Epic Loot\" that ensues. All backers will also receive a backer tag in the game and on the forums that is appropriate to their pledge level.\nThe second thing is the difference between a single-character account and a five-character account. Each character in the game will have an accompanying 20+ hour campaign detailing their back story. Purchasing a single-character copy gives you the choice of one of five characters to play. This will only give you access to their particular campaign. Of course, you'll be able to upgrade at any time, so this option is preferable for anyone wanting to try out Dungeonforge with a reduced cost of entry. The full experience can be had by grabbing a five-character account which gives you all five characters and over 100 hours of campaign content to quest through.\nThe levels for single character accounts are $5 normally, and an early backer special where the first 150 people to pledge get it at $1. Early backers can also snag a full, five-character copy for $10, down from $20 (limit 100).\nStretch Goals:\nA quick word about our stretch goals:\nThese are all things we hope to put into Dungeonforge in any case. They all rely on us getting sufficient funding. So, how much funding we receive from this campaign will determine how quickly we are able to tackle these goals. The stretch goals we reach will be available at the game's launch.\n70k Expanded PvP and PvDM game types\n85k New continent with two new environment themes\n100k In-Game Custom Dungeon Tile Creation System (Currently handled by external tools)\n115k In Game Weapon Creation System (Currently handled by external tools)\n130K In Game Monster Modeling and Creation System (Currently handled by external tools)\n150k In Game Character Modeling and Creation System (Currently handled by external tools)\n200k In Game Cut-scene creation system, featuring custom cameras, voice capture, and event scripting (Currently possible through external tools)\n250k Cyberpunk Content Theme (including weapons, environments, and characters especially built to fit this theme)\n300k Sci-Fi content theme (including ship-based dungeons!)\n500k We'll seek licenses from major entertainment franchises to add content from your favorite movies, books, and tv shows to the game and you will help us choose what content to pursue!\nA Word from the Devs\nDungeonforge is a real work of heart for us. The core motive of our team revolves around that sense of wonder and fascination each of us has with video games and the stories they hold. We've all wanted, all our lives, to be able to tell the stories that are within us and we know we're not alone. The mission we've ascribed to with Dungeonforge is simple, yet in it's own way quite daunting; to enable each and every person that has the desire, to weave their unique tale. To leave their particular mark. To make something that inspires them, satisfies their desire to create and makes them proud. Each and every member of our team is passionate about this ideal.\nFor me, it comes from the little boy in me who once took the little boxes from the CDs my mom got delivered on monthly subscription, because they looked vaguely like a Sega Gamegear, and would draw buttons on the sides and scenes from imagined videogames on their \"screens.\"\nThat same boy grew up to play Neverwinter Nights when it first came out and it appeared I'd have the opportunity to live my dreams of creating in that game as many did. But at 17 I must have been too sick with hormones and addled by girls and ADHD to really give it the attention it deserved. That was one of my deepest regrets and one I hope, through this game, I can save some other poor youth from.\nWe have guys who lost hours in the Starcraft and Warcraft map editors before going on to make their own games. These same guys are passionate about bringing a similar experience to a new generation; one in which the existence of quality mod tools for the games you buy is becoming an ever more rare occurrence.\nCounterstrike, DoTA, Team Fortress, DayZ and others are games that exist solely because of the creativity of the community. The guys that made them? They've all got jobs doing what they love and fulfilling their dreams. While we'll never claim to be on a level with the games that spawned those mods, we hope, in some small part, to provide the inspiration for those who have a story to tell, and the tools to allow them to do so.\n-Mason Stanford, The Collective Dream Studios", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDungeonforge is happening. Regardless of whether we achieve funding or not, this game is going to be made and released. It's been a work of heart for us. We've all sacrificed to get it to where it is as we've been self-funded from day one. This means we've had to work around day jobs and have had to eat our share of Ramen to get it this far.\n\nThe only setbacks we could face would be related to not receiving the funding we're seeking. This would mean that we'd have to continue to work around day jobs. Our lead artist and technical lead would have to do their work from their home country of Chile, rather than in our studios here in the US. We also want to enlarge our team to increase the quality and speed of our output which will depend heavily on funding. All of those circumstances may cause delays, but they will not derail this train. Dungeonforge will be made, regardless.

Our ambitious $50k goal has been utterly smashed by your generosity and enthusiasm! In addition to PC and Mac, Rain World will now be officially coming to LINUX... and beyond! Any additional funds raised will be used for polish and making Rain World the best game it can be. Massive thanks to all, you have been amazing and we look forward to getting down to work!\nUpdate #3 - ALPHA VIDEO \"THE ROOF\" & GREENLIGHT NEWS!\nUpdate #5 - ALPHA VIDEO \"SLUGCAT LIFE\" & MAP OF THE WORLD\nUpdate #6 - ALPHA VIDEO \"PUPS!\" & LINUX NEWS!\nRain World is set in an abandoned industrial environment scourged by a shattered eco-system. Bone-crushing intense rain pounds the surface regularly, making life as we know it almost impossible. The creatures in this world hibernate most of the time, but in the few brief dry periods they go out searching for food. \nYou are a lonely nomadic slugcat, both predator and prey in this land. You must hunt enough food to survive another cycle of hibernation. Other - bigger - creatures have the same plan.\nInspired by the aesthetics and simplicity of 16-bit classics, the gameplay consists of platforming and fast paced sneaking; both sneaking on your prey and sneaking in order to avoid larger creatures. A large focus of the development has been on enemy AI: they are cunning, vicious and they are always hunting you. \nRain World is currently in development for PC and Mac, and can be found on Steam Greenlight \nGameplay:\n* Sneak, climb, and pounce your way through an exotic alien landscape full of hidden secrets and undiscovered dangers. \n* Nimble controls and unique physics-and-code based animation gives characters a natural fluidity of movement and intuitive weight, for lighting quick high-wire action.  \n* Intense, primal predator encounters will challenge your reflexes. Limited resources and the constant impending threat of rain will test your nerve. This is not an easy game!\n* Co-operative and up to 4 player competitive gameplay: deathmatches, endurance, waves, custom challenges, etc.\n* Seriously Mega Cute Slugcat character. Hey, I know that's why we're all really here!\nProgress so far:  \nWe have been developing Rain World on our own for almost 3 years now, and have a pretty solid playable alpha in place: game engine, AI, art assets, levels, and music are functional and exist in some stage. All of the content on this page, the trailer, gifs, screenshots, etc., are taken from actual gameplay of the current alpha build of Rain World and could be considered representative of typical gameplay.\nBeyond that, we have detailed plans of where we want to go from here, fleshing out the narrative elements, allowing plenty of room for new inspiration and organic growth along the way. Rain World is a passion project and will remain to be so.   \nIf you are interested in even more technical details and concept discussion, feel free to browse through over 67 ACTION-PACKED PAGES of devlog on TIGsource: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.0\nThe Sound of Rain World:  \nTaking inspiration from both the unique alien landscape and the decayed future-industrial aesthetic, the music of Rain World is a blend of other-worldly ambient soundscapes, glitchy chiptune and urban-inspired breakbeat. Here is a selection of some of the work so far:\nWhy Kickstarter?:\nWe have reached the inevitable point where we realize that in order to make Rain World into the game we believe it deserves to be, additional resources and personnel will be required that we -hacking away in our basements- can't provide on our own. Your generous help in funding this project would allow for:\n* Complete Realization of our vision of Rain World. We want to present to you a rich, dynamic world brimming with secrets to uncover, engaging narrative choices to be shocked by, and a lush eco-system of interesting creatures to kill and eat (or be eaten by). The vast majority of funding will go towards further development of the nuts and bolts of the game: art assets like level design, new terrain and new characters; expanded AI for terrifyingly intelligent predators; a lengthy well-written single player campaign; more music, more hidden secrets, more Rain World for you to experience.\n* Hiring a skilled C++ contractor to help the game run faster and do all the important stuff that C++ wizards do best: display optimization and modernization, help porting to new platforms, etc etc. This is an essential part of \"doing it right\", and their skills don't come cheap!\n* Proper testing and Quality Control: Rain World is hard and we want it that way, but it should be hard for the right reasons, not impossible levels or tricky controls. Having time and resources for thorough testing and QC would make the game a smoother experience for all players.\nand slugcat pups! awwww\nKickstarter Budget Breakdown:\nWho are we?\n* Joar Jakobsson - Concept, Programming, Art, Design\nJoar is a Swedish illustrator and graphic designer who is obsessively interested in every art form there is.

It has been a game \"for us\" for so long that we've grown comfortable with the quirks. We need to update it so it fits on todays slick modern systems and polish it until it shines. This might include things like upgrading our development tools and porting Rain World to more modern programming languages.\n\nThe $25,000 funding goal for this Kickstarter is what we believe to be an honest assessment of the bare-bones cost that it would take to bring a publishable version of Rain World into the world, and we feel this should be taken into account when considering pulling the trigger on funding.\n\nThanks for reading this far and a sincere thank you for your interest in Rain World!\n--James & Joar\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Rain World: Expansion News!

It is designed for larger screens only, 4.5\" at a minimum, ideally 5\" and up. (please note the target is Android Ice Cream Sandwich/4.0 and up!)\nYou can check out the older alpha version here:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triumvirate.minicivalpha\nPlanned features include modding support, an in-game map editor, and online multiplayer.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is about the first stage of the beta version, which focuses on developing the game's singleplayer mode, and finalizing the 3D engine.\nCampaign goal\nThe game actually has an internal Windows version, so the good news is development won't stop while I wait for the campaign to finish and Kickstarter to do their thing.\nBut a lot of work has to go in making the 3D engine work on limited mobile hardware, so I absolutely need to work with a real device.\nThat's why I started this Kickstarter campaign: to replace my broken tablet, so I can continue normal development, and avoid problems down the line from a lack of testing. I am working full-time at the game for the next 3 months, during my summer break.\nThis campaign will deliver the first beta version of the game.\nRewards\nThe rewards include a beta key, but it actually unlocks the whole game once completed. So with this key, there's nothing more to pay, and there are no IAPs. You will receive normal updates through Google Play, like any other app. The normal beta price is $10; early backers get a 20% discount so the Kickstarter price is $8.\nStretch goals\nThe device this campaign is for is the 2013 Nexus 7, which has a 7\" screen and is a great device for development! However, I want to test and polish the game on other screen sizes, and on other GPU families.\nThe stretch goals are:\nFUNDED! $700 - an additional 4.5\" phone, different GPU family.\nFUNDED! $1,200 - an additional 10\" tablet, different GPU family.\nFUNDED! $3,500 - OST and sound effects by contractor.\n$5,000+ - extra help with art, misc costs (drawing tablet, servers etc.)\nAbout me\nMy name is Andy, I live in Australia, and I have worked as a professional C++ programmer and at a local game studio.\nI wrote my first game about 10 years ago, it was a text-based city building game written in Pascal!

Travel to strange alien worlds, meet interesting and unique life forms and then if you want... shoot them? In Tiny Trek you will be able to do exactly that. You see, probably like me, you have yet to find a space based game that gives you gameplay that emulates the great Science Fiction TV shows we all love. And thus that is what I set out to do with my latest game project, Tiny Trek.\n     Tiny Trek's mission is to provide you with the exact same experience as those favorite adventures we watched on TV, allowing you to sit in the Captain's chair and make those critical and dramatic decisions. From diplomacy, exploration and resource management to epic space battles and exploring alien worlds.\nAre you ready to sit in the Captain\u2019s Chair?\n     From the creators of Vincere Totus Astrum comes for a universe of exploration and adventure. As the Captain of your own Starship begin your trek of literally endless worlds by first selecting your randomly generated race and ship, then set out for the stars.\n     Encounter alien races and exotic locations as you travel in an endlessly procedurally generated galaxy. No two game are the same. As you explore, randomly generated \u201cEpisodes\u201d will have you fighting hostile ships, helping aliens and exploring the surface of new planets.\n     How long can you survive the deep of space? How far can you travel? Who knows what is waiting for you! Your trek begins now!\nSetting out to the stars!\n     The game starts with players selecting a Home Star from the intro screen galaxy view. From there you zoom into your new system and select a homeworld. The type of the star and the kind of planet you select orbiting it determines some of the base stats of your race. A low gravity cool and wet world tends to produce sentient species that are more docile in nature, where as more hostile environments lead to more aggressive races. These differences help decide how battle-hardened they are or how adept at science they may be etc. From these base stats a player then sets out to determine the look of their race through a set of procedurally generated tools and what kind of society they come from. All of your decisions up to this point help affect what your ship will turn out like. Using procedural generation the game creates unique ship designs which you can edit. Design choices affect a ship's capabilities and stats. Once you're done, it's time to set out amongst the stars.\n     Tiny Trek is designed to be endless... Well, endless if you are a good Starship Captain, that is. Players could select one direction and keep on going, if they choose to do so. The way you lose, of course, is getting killed or running out of resources. As you travel, make sure to orbit some stars and collect fuel. Damaged and need repairs? Visit a planet rich in minerals and mine for them, or trade with a local spacefarer.\n     Exploration in itself is fun, but throughout your star hopping you will encounter randomly activated \"Episode triggers\". The triggers are the starting point for an adventure that is created procedurally from the Mission Matrix. For instance, you may locate a plasma trail during interstellar travel. The bridge crew would then ask you if you would like to investigate. If you choose yes, then the game may take you to a ship in distress in an asteroid field, or one that is under attack or has crashed on a planet. From there, your choices affect the rest of the episode. Attacking the damaged vessel will mark you an enemy of that race whereas tractoring them out makes them a friend.\n     And I think that is the cool thing about Tiny Trek. It is a game that is procedurally generated and thus your actions perpetuate the game world. For instance, that race whose ship you helped repair after they were marooned on Planet X sent word to their homeworld about your heroics. And so, when you are attacked by a hostile race later in the game, they may be flying by and lend a hand (thanks to the randomly generated \"Episodes\"). The current engine design supports over a hundred different episode combinations, and with your help we hope to make that number much larger.\n-Galaxy is big: And when I say big I mean really big like a never ending Galaxy with stars, planets, nebula and other space phenomenon.\n\n-Do you have that ship in a different color? Yes we can do that with our procedural generation algorithms.  Everything from the planets and stars to ships and races is created on the fly. And then to take it step further we provide you tools to edit your Ship and your race.\n\n- Lets fire blue particle cannons full... Engage in battles of one on up to three enemy vessels. Cool thing is with the Mission Matrix, a ship might jump out of battle and you may get the option to chase them, once you catch up you may finish them off or two of his friends might be waiting for you.\n\n--You think they have apples on an alien planet? I don't know if apples will be there, but the idea is that you can explore endless alien worlds and conduct various away missions. Planets will contain unique items that your science officer can scan, and your engineer can collect to bring back to the ship for trade.\n\n-Making Friends will be important: Talk, trade and assisting other spacefarers will benefit you as each race you encounter will store an enemy, neutral or friend status. That will effect how your next encounter with them will be.\n\n-Episodes for everyone! In Tiny Trek we have worked on creating a generator that creates randomized missions or as we call it, episodes. Each episode last around 3-8 minutes on average and include everything from search and rescue, transport, battles and more. Imagine receiving a distress signal, then approaching a ship to discover it's a trap. After defeating them and searching the ship discover that the stranded crew is on a nearby planet. The unique Mission Matrix generates over a 100 different \"episode\" types and puts them together.\n-Stuff is cool... Player will be able to collect and store unique plants, materials and relics you discover on your journey. And trade them for other resources or information.\nWhy do we need Captains like you?\n     Tiny Trek has come a long way in it's one year of being developed.  We need your help to get it finished. Tiny Trek will require a lot of polishing and testing as we enter the final development phase. In order to achieve that we need few things outside of the \"hard work and sweat\" stuff used to build it to this point. The funds raised will be used exclusively to finish out the game and get it to market. The funds would go to the following areas.\nAdditional Programming Staff: To full implement the vision of Tiny Trek I am going to need some additional code warriors to help me complete the game in a timely manner. I could continue to work on it by myself, But this would stretch out the release time. With the additional programming muscle I will be able to assure that Tiny Trek will be released with all the intended features and functions we all want, and what you deserve as the player. Areas in programming that will benefit from more coders involve the random sound engine, piecing together all the various episode functions and porting to all the aforementioned target platforms.\nMusic: Vincent Beers a outstanding chiptuneist has provided us two amazing 8 bit tracks for the game so far, To create a truly submersive experience more music compositions are called for to create the right mood in key areas of Tiny Trek. Portions of the raised funds will go to the creation of these musical pieces. \nOperational Costs: Being Indie is a tough business, involving lots of cheap ramen noodles and store brand sodas. However some of the costs of game development can't be deferred by time and effort. Fees, taxes and other associated business end costs are tough for a indie to produce, I am hoping with your help that these costs wont kill Tiny Trek.\nStretch Goals\n     If we are lucky enough to extend the campaign beyond the funding goal we do have some additional goals in mind that would build a lot more fun into the game.\nACHIEVED! $6,000.00 Raised - Robust Editing Tools: If we can hit this mark we can afford to spend the extra time developing more editor tools for the player, providing more customization to you. More editing tools for your ships and races, more color options, and the ability to edit your home world. At this amount we would also provide procedurally generated weapon systems that you can edit.\nACHIEVED! $8,000.00 Raised - Server based content sharing: If we can raise up to this amount we will be able to hire the database programmer to assist in creating a option where a player could share their games content with another player, and the new player would be able to see that content in their game. Player could share their ship, race or items they encountered in their current play.\n$10,000.00 Raised - Mega Melee modes: If we can reach the $10,000 dollar mark we will be able to expand the Melee combat mode we have planned out. We will be able to include the ability to create team battles where you construct teams out of your save files and download NPCs from the server. Then battle one ship at a time against another team. Another mode would be endless mode, where you ship of choice has to survive against a never ending onslaught of Saved NPCs and generated enemies. The third battle mode would allow you to combat against two enemy vessels and you have a friendly NPC to assist you, two on two. The fourth mode would involve a endless round of battles, where each battle is timed. Each victory adds more time to the clock, the faster you can defeat them the more time added to the clock.\nAddons\nAddition Copies for any platform - $5.00: You can add as many additional copies as you would like for 5.00 each, and can for any platform you select for each copy. This includes PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and the Ouya!\nTiny Trek Soundtrack - $10.00: Get a digital download copy of all the music for Tiny Trek in MP3 and FLAC with cover art and jacket notes.\nSteam copy of Clickteam Fusion 2.5 - $60.00: Get a copy of the same tool used to make Tiny Trek and start programming your own game with ease! More information on how Clickteam Fusion 2.5 works is here.\nDonate with Paypal\nA few of you have asked if they could donate with Paypal. So I am providing the below paypal option for funding.

And I have dreamed of designing this kind of game since picking up that boxed copy of Starflight back in 86, and loading the two 5 1/4 floppies into my Tandy machine.

Released DRM-free for PC, Mac, and Linux.\nIn a cabin at the end of the world, the game of life and death is played. Draw your cards, play your hand, and discover your fate. \nHand of Fate is a card based roguelike, in which the player builds a collection of cards into a deck, which is then used to deal out the dungeon floors through which they adventure. Upon entering a combat, all of the cards the player has collected fly into their character's hands as fully modeled 3D assets, and combat begins.   \nUpdate #1 - Off to a great start!\nUpdate #2 - Updates, and Weapons!\nUpdate #3 - Midway!\nUpdate #4 - From concept to model - 6 of Plagues.\nUpdate #5 - A close up look at gear and equipment.\nUpdate #6 - Revised Stretch Goals.\nUpdate #7 - Final Week!\nUpdate #8 - The Mage Revealed\nUpdate #9 - Kickstarter exclusive weapon pack\nUpdate #10 - GOLDFARB!\nUpdate #11 - 70 hours left!\nUpdate #12 - Exclusive Backer Encounters.\nUpdate #13 - Raising the Lich.\nBuild your deck, enter the world of Hand of Fate, and prepare to face the King of Skulls.\nKey Features\nTabletop card game brought to vivid life.\nA unique take on roguelike gameplay.  \nVisceral action-RPG combat.\nGame changing gear and items make every playthrough unique.\nHundreds of encounters, items, armour, weapons, artifacts, and mysteries to unlock.\nUnique deck building mechanics let you customise your own adventure, as you seek to defeat the Jack, Queen and King of each suit.\nDiscover the mysteries of the world of Hand of Fate, as you complete your collection.\nHand of Fate uses a deck building mechanic that allows players to choose both the types of loot they will gain and even the type of adventure they will embark upon.\n\nMost roguelike games use randomness to increase game difficulty, Hand of Fate uses Deck Building mechanics so the player can completely customise and control their game experience, which is then randomly distributed as the dungeon level they delve into.\n\nGot a favourite combo of weapon and ability?  Stack the deck with those to increase your odds.\n\nNeed to defeat the Jack of Skulls?  Swap in holy weapons and abilities to do extra damage to undead.\n\u201cScales, Skulls, Dust and Dread, Four Suits, Four Fates, Four Prices Paid\u201d - Ancient Proverb\n\nJack of Skulls.  King of Dust.  Jack of Dread.  At the end of each dungeon waits a member of the court, ready to end your quest where you stand.  Defeat them, and you\u2019re one step closer to facing the game's ultimate challenge.  Fail, and your quest ends.\nThe twelve cards of the court provide the structure and framework for the player's progression through the game.\nA host of equipment waits to be discovered in the Hand of Fate world. The player will come across a variety of weapons, artifacts, armour and gauntlets to assist in their travels. \nThe weapons range from brute force apparatus to magical devices of destruction. Artifacts provide the player with special abilities that can be triggered during combat, while magical weapons have their own intrinsic powers. Armour ranges from pure defensive, to magically enhancing your abilities and attacks. \nThe guiding principle for Hand of Fate is that every piece of gear should be a game changer.  There are no \"Sword + 5% damage\" instead there are weapons that become more powerful the weaker you get, shields that shoot fire when you block, artifacts that create a whirlwind of destruction, and many more.  Discovering unique combinations of weapons, armour, and abilities is one of the keys to mastering Hand of Fate.\nEven if you do not fund a reward tier on Kickstarter, please vote for us on Greenlight!  \nSteam Greenlight is a system that enlists the community's help in picking some of the new games to be released on Steam - developers post information, screenshots and video of their game and seek a critical mass of community support in order to get selected for distribution. \nIf you want to see Hand of Fate on Steam, the best way is to support us on Greenlight.\nClick here to check out our Greenlight page.\nDefiant Development is a Brisbane, Australia based game studio. We've been around for 3.5 years now, and you may have heard of some of our projects - Heroes Call (a groundbreaking tablet RPG that inspired our early thoughts about Hand of Fate), Warco (a proof of concept for a game about War Journalism that sadly never found a home with a publisher), Ski Safari (published by Defiant, and one of the two developers is our Art Director) and the upcoming Ski Safari : Adventure Time, or some of our AR games. We're a combination of local veterans of the console industry (Pandemic, THQ, Sega, Krome) and fresh new talent, and we're all about making new, exciting games. Members of the team have worked on series like Mercenaries, Destroy All Humans, Freedom Force, Homeworld, Fable, Dark Reign, Fury and Total War. In short, it's a kick-arse crew.\nWe've worked hard to get Hand of Fate to the point where we can show you our vision for a new take on card gaming.  We've gotten to this point with the support of Screen Australia, and our own warchest built up from previous games.\nWith your help, we can take it over the line to a finished game that's as good as it can possibly be.\nWhen we started working on games in the late 90's, it seemed like every new game that came out established a new genre, or a new set of mechanics and conventions.  As time has passed, budgets have become bigger and the willingness to innovate among the larger publishers has vanished.\n\nKickstarter offers us the perfect chance to build something that speaks to that golden age of game development, a card game that's also something new and different.\n\nRevised! As we extend towards and beyond our goals we have some amazing additions to the mix. Additional cards, new enemies, new weapons, and new encounters that we're just itching to get in.\n\nWe've just revealed the Mage - check out Update #8 for details!\n\nWe've passed $37.5k, which means we'll be adding an exclusive pack of additional weapons to the game for all Kickstarter subscribers!\n\nIn addition, and hugely excitingly, we've got an all star team of guest designers who'll be creating cards for a special expansion pack that every Kickstarter backer will receive.\n\nAs we get closer to our goal, we'll reveal more of the guest designers, but to get you warmed up, here is the first, with an introduction from Morgan Jaffit\n\n\"In seeking out designers for our expansion, I wanted to try and involve the people who had been most influential on my development as a game designer.  People who had either shown me the ropes, or shown what was possible.  It's an incredible honour to have Ian Livingstone, OBE on board, as there's no single person who's more responsible for me being in games today.  From the Fighting Fantasy books, to playing Games Workshop games, and watching his transition into being a video games powerhouse with Eidos, Ian has blazed a trail through the industry.\"\n\nWe've passed our second goal, and in the process announced our second guest designer!\n\n\"Every person we've chosen to be a guest designer has been chosen because they're the people who've helped make me who I am as a developer. Rob Cunningham is a mentor, a creative mastermind, and now the CEO of Blackbird Interactive (developing the incredible Homeworld : Shipbreakers). He also started an art foundation (eatART) that makes giant robots, not to mention one of the coolest people on the planet. Working with him to create new concepts is amazing, as his mind and his pen are both blisteringly quick. Ideas comes to life and jump off the page as you talk, and his creative style has been an ongoing inspiration for me.\"\n\nHand of Fate needs your help to become a success.

They are what we now know as the abominations: life trapped in cold machines, seemingly mindless and uncaring, focused only on their desperate attempts to reclaim a world that was once their home\u2026\u201d - Pilum\nBloom: Memories combines many classic game design elements into a gorgeous unique action adventure / rpg.\n At its core, we are creating a game that moves away from the cliche of violence and domination. In fact, you can play the entire game without harming anyone or anything if you so choose. \n Of course, we understand that there are different types of players, and we are dedicated to building a world that accounts for each of them in a rewarding way. Combat, stealth, story or collection \u2026 it is up to you to decide how you want to face the challenges ahead.\nConsider talking. The world is filled with strange creatures; sometimes taking a moment to talk to them can be well worth the time. Every now and then, as you consider how to kill the imposing monster standing before you. . . you might instead simply try and say hello. ((Read more about a related feature \"The Bridge\" in update 5)) \nUse stealth and strategy to fool those who block your path. Careful planning may be a bit slower and generally safer . . . but of course, nothing is without risks. One misstep and you might find yourself in a very tricky situation.\nGrow stronger by feeding off those you defeat. This is an extremely challenging road, and one that will take you on a very different path as you slowly grow more powerful through taking the lives of others. In the end, you may find yourself with a great deal of strength. . .but at what cost?\nAlong with your choices also come consequences: Be violent\u2026and the world will react more violently in return. Be kind, and the world may soften, revealing a more loving side.\nPrimary Ability \u2013 This is your \u201ccombat\u201d oriented ability, and main means to defend yourself at a moments notice. Born from your dual inheritance, you find yourself with the unique ability to manipulate your energy out into the world. While this begins as a simple defensive gesture, pushing away enemies and protecting yourself, you eventually learn how to release more into the attack as you need. What are the limits of your power? And, at what cost does it take to reach them?\nSecondary Abilities \u2013 These are your utility type abilities which can fit a wide range of purposes. Largely, these revolve around the various seeds you find throughout the world, each providing a new tool for you to use as you like. A hedge to hide behind, a flying distraction to lure away guards, or even vines to delay a rampaging Golem. Besides the seeds, you may find other items that can also be used here, such as a fishing rod or a small animal companion to keep you company.\nStealth \u2013 While direct fighting is always an option (a very hard option), we also have a strong stealth system in the works. This is heavily based on the amazing stealth play of the original Thief game (on PC). So using shadows to conceal yourself, luring away enemies with distractions (sound and vision detection), or simply sneaking around an unaware enemy. Of course, a bit of stealth can also come in handy for getting the drop on an enemy (for the combat-oriented), letting you start the fight with a little advantage.\nDialog + Mood \u2013 Dialog and mood are important features for those more interested in interpersonal play. Talking to enemies (or friends) will be much more important than simply being told where to go next. You will make allies, discover secret paths, find new solutions of how to solve problems, and even gain new powers. Of course, creatures also have shifting moods. So if you are aware of those and manage to control or take advantage of them, new ways of approaching problems will appear. \nDiscovery + Collection \u2013 As you travel around the world, you will have the chance to discover secret areas and items. Finding these can be difficult, and requires a true adventurer's spirit\u2026 facing and overcoming unique challenges you uncover, or simply finding your way into a hidden bit of the world where few would dare to go. \nPuzzles + Mini-Games \u2013 To give a fuller experience, the game will also have a variety of optional puzzles and mini-games to challenge you. This isn\u2019t a large focus, but now and then you might run into something interesting. Of course, we want to avoid obtuse and overly annoying \u201cfiller\u201d content, so we will be very careful in how we approach these.\nThe Legend of Zelda \u2013 From Hyrule, we take the innocent nature of discovery, exploration, and wonder. We also borrow the carefree adventure and importance of facing challenges not only with a sword\u2026 but more importantly with cleverness.\nThief: The Dark Project \u2013 This game taught us how gripping stealth and careful thinking could be when combined with the exciting danger of death from even a single enemy. This was not a game about combat, even though combat was available. Instead, the goal was on progression and exploration. Enemies were simply dangerous obstacles, and it was up to the player to decide how to overcome them. We hope to carry these themes into Bloom, enhancing the options available to players and really making it our own. Effectively creating an experience unlike any RPG.\nLoom (and the era of point-and-click adventure games) \u2013 These taught us how important a unique and lovingly crafted world was to a game. Even in the handling of generic subjects, they would go many steps beyond and breathe a special personality into their worlds. The possibilities are limitless when approaching games from this mindset.\nHarvest Moon (and RPG dialog) \u2013 Harvest Moon was an important lesson in how games don\u2019t have to be simply combat to be enjoyable and how different players valued different experiences. It showed us that interpersonal dialog and relationships could also drive forward a story in a fun and engaging way. We take this to heart and want to offer a non-violent path through Bloom. One that places more importance on the stories of the characters, not simply how good your reflexes are.\nMusic is an important element when creating a truly memorable experience. This is where our award-winning composer, Jose Mora-Jimenez, comes in. Of course, like with every other element we aren't satisfied with doing the bare minimum. Instead, the music in Bloom continues the narration of the story-line with each instrument representing a character as their stories are woven into the game.\nEven better, please listen to a couple of the tracks and judge for yourself. \nNo one really knows when the remnants of the past began to stir, when they decided to reclaim a world that had moved on long ago.\nFor many years they had encroached on our lands, slowly driving us back as their corruption spread. Their strength was overwhelming and even I and the other guardians were helpless to stop them, though many of us died trying. At the front of the assault were their skeletal machines, abominations of hollow souls and metal\u2026.of which they had a seemingly endless supply. You see, this was a battle of attrition, and it was a battle we were losing.\nThough rumors abound, what is known for certain is at the heart of the corruption are the Eternal, known to us before only as mere stories to scare children. Men? Machines? Perversions of life.\nIt was there at their very heart, from amongst the Eternal, that, one day, a mysterious woman escaped. She too was an abomination, but I could feel she was somehow different . . .and in frantic desperation. So I reached out to her, offering her refuge in our forest.\nIt was once she arrived that I realized why she had seemed so different. Somehow inside her grew new life, and she couldn't stand her child being twisted into the monsters which attacked us. We worked quickly, gathering pieces of the fallen machines to house her child\u2019s life, and in the end were successful. She gave birth. Though her child was broken, weak, and helpless; he was alive \u2026 and that is where our story begins.\nWe are currently in pre-alpha stage and constantly building upon our custom engine to add new features. If you haven\u2019t already, check out our pre-alpha engine demo! \nThe Engine:\nBloomCore, the bloom engine, has been built from the ground up to be a multiplatform engine to support the unique features required by Bloom; such as the high quality assets, advanced enemy AI, dynamic music and unique lighting systems whilst also taking advantage of various different technologies to use only a very small memory footprint. Effectively this means the engine will provide an amazing experience, no matter the platform or spec. The BloomCore engine will allow us to tell the story we want to tell without any limits.\nGetting to this stage has been a long hard road, but well worth it. \nFor more information on the team, please visit HERE.\n For more info about Jose and for samples of his music you can check: http://www.musicvortex.nl\n To see more of Craigs work, please visit www.craignowicki.com\n----- Special Thanks To -----\nHayden Black - Pilum voice and video voice \nwww.twitter.com/haydenblack\nThe Hamster Alliance - Main video music and editing\nhttp://www.hamsteralliance.com\nJavier Zumaeta - Character Animations\nhttp://www.JavAnimation.com\nMichael Adams - Old Woman animation\nhttp://www.crashadams.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHey there everyone, this is Dani. If you are already reading down here, well, hopefully you like everything you have seen so far! :) \n\nBut, now I want to take the chance to get some things out of the way and really address what we are doing. \n\nBasically, we are a very tiny team tackling a pretty ambitious project. We know the amount of work ahead of us is a lot, we would be insane not to see that. The thing is, the amount of work we have done ALREADY to get where we are has been one of the hardest parts of the entire project (especially since we have done it with no budget and just a lot of passion).\n\nFor example, one of the biggest achievements so far is building our custom BloomCore engine from scratch (with the bulk of the core systems in place). From this point, we simply continue to add more features and functionality to it. \n\nOn the art and story side of things (my job) is mostly about continuing to do what I have been doing, and just creating more content (on top of the already rather impressive amount we have! More than we can even squeeze onto this page). \n\nSo really, the challenge ahead is for us to keep going and staying motivated. Luckily, this is a passion project and one we really believe in, so there is no shortage of drive.\n\nIn fact, you can even look back through our rather public development of the project and see exactly what we have faced. From our very first attempt at kickstarter with not much more than a few concepts... then a very basic engine... and finally what we have today. Each step along the way the game becoming better as we strive to push it further. \n\nOf course, we also aren't alone. We have been lucky enough to meet a lot of amazing people along the way that have helped us move forward. From voice overs, to special scripts, to even a bit of advice when we get stuck on a technical issue. \n\nSo, if you see anything interesting in what we are trying to do, we would really appreciate the help in moving forward. Even if you can't donate money, just spreading the word would be really helping an indie team that could truly use some support in making something special. \n\nThanks so so much for all of the support!\nDani\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "Steam Festival Begins!

Every pocket of space has its own dangers and rewards, such as unlocking new areas of space, alien races eager to join your crew, or even advanced weaponry not available elsewhere.\n-STORY: The setting and the mechanics allows for you to drive the plot! There are several missions to take part in, a main plot to unravel, or if you so choose ignore the needs of others and simply build your own fortune.\n-EXPLORATION: Every location on the starmap has its own event or challenge. You could face a moral scenario near a dying star, or be tasked to apprehend an alien outlaw. Sometimes you'll be given the opportunity to scavenge a derelict space station, or find yourself shooting your way out of a hostile encounter.\n-CREW LIFE: Your crewman die, so be careful! Permadeth is a constant challenge in Interstellaria. In addition to leveling skills to maximize your ship\u2019s abilities, you must also make sure the crew eat, sleep, and entertain themselves. When managing your crew the wrong choice will wipe out that max level crewman, or worse... wipe out your entire ship!\n-CONSTANT PROGRESS: Interstellaria is all about progress. You can level up your crewmen in the various stations on board. You can purchase bigger and more powerful ships, and you can swap out guns to pick the ones you like best. Each time you play you make your ship your own!\nDefending your vessel is a key part of surviving space. The player must balance power, crew, and life support in order to be the most successful. As you progress so do your crewmen, making them incredibly valuable in a combat situation. A high level crewman can target specific points of an enemy vessel, while a novice can only aim in the enemies general direction. Be warned - once the shields go down the enemy can invade your ship as well!\nENERGY - players must balance the energy of their ship between the engines, life support, systems, and weapons. Energy is limited and usage is dynamic!\nSTATIONS - The crew boost the power of the ship through their stats, as well as the function of the station. Having a special engineering station will boost repair rates and ship speed. Having a max level engineer at that station also boosts ship energy output. Stations can be powered, and they can be damaged!\nSCANNING - Enemies must be scanned down to be fired upon. In addition, having high level scanning stations and high level scanners will boost the loot from wrecked ships. Be careful! Scanning a ship is a very hostile maneuver, and some friendly vessels will fire if they feel threatened.\nLIFE SUPPORT - The oxygen cycles through the ship room by room. A hull leak in any given room can quickly kill a crewmen. In addition, large numbers of leaks will cut into the oxygen cycle and cause other rooms to lose their life support as well.\nINVASION - Be warned, several hostile ships have been known to launch invasion pods. This allows them the ability to board your vessel and kill your crew. The act of forcefully boarding  a ship is illegal!\nA unique side of Interstellaria is the ability to also go planet side. Your captain takes on all risks! Some planets will challenge his mind with unique puzzles and hazardous terrain. Other planets can only be tamed at the point of a gun. The captain can equip armor and unique alien weapons he discovers along the way. In addition to valuable loot, some alien worlds will unlock their vessels for your purchase!\nHAND CRAFTED WORLDS - each world is designed by hand. From sketch, to art, to testing, to completion. The goal is to create unique challenges and memorable encounters. The environments all have their own unique appearance. Coupling the beautiful art with the amazing sounds of Chipzel, planets are really fun to explore.\n\nUNIQUE ENCOUNTERS - Each world has it\u2019s own special enemies and allies. You might travel to a bright red lava planet in Kursha space to discover rock-spiders crawling towards you, or travel to the gaseous world in Human space to chat with human like fungoids.\nSPECIAL ITEMS AND GEAR - The further you travel from human space the more diverse the gear becomes! In addition to finding powerful artifacts to upgrade your ship, there is a plethora of equipment for your crew! Neon lazer tubes, backpack rail guns, chitin chest armor, bio-neural helmet\u2026 you can upgrade your captain to overcome any challenge! In addition, some area\u2019s of larger planets aren\u2019t accessible until you come back with upgraded equipment.\nIn pre-alpha phase, Interstellaria currently features the human components of the game. Some minor alien technology is available, but mostly for debugging/testing purposes. As of now the game sits in closed alpha, but by pledging  you can also be invited to our alpha phase starting January 1st!\nThe current build has been designed to slide all art/code/mechanics seamlessly into the final game. This should shave several months off development time. The hope is for a late 2014 release, but of course Interstellaria will only be released when it feels both satisfying and fun!\nThe best part is by offering alpha/beta access to the game we can also get valuable input by players just like you. Often times games ship with features that were well intentioned, but boring or not well thought out. By having people test features as they are developed we can ensure that we come up with something that is really fun!\nThe game demands large amounts of content just like all the space games of yesteryear. To complete that amount of content within a reasonable timeframe would be difficult. The game would see much of content cut to provide a polished, but smaller, game. The money isn't being raised for anything but to help make Interstellaria the best game it can be! Any money earned would go towards:\n-Musician: The biggest, and in some ways most important, expense. A professional artists helps to bring life to the game. The sounds, music, and ambiance can't be replaced! Chipzel brings her considerable talent to the project and really brings the game to life.\n-Additional artist: It's easy for me to work on this project for free for the rest of my life. I'm passionate about it. In order to create an exciting and diverse universe I will need help, and not everyone can work for free! With the aid of additional artist I can design/implement more worlds, enemies, and equipment\n-Operation costs: Owning a company, paying fees, and supporting contract artists/musicians adds up. A good portion of funds will go towards these costs as well as important software licenses. In addition, time I personally take off to ensure the game is complete means funds are neccessary to support that time.\n- Testers: the final portion of the funds goes towards testers, debuggers, but mostly a professional programmer to keep the game running smooth! I would rather put my money towards improving the game than anything else!\nCOLDRICE - PROGRAMMING/ART\nColdrice (Jon King) is a programmer/pixel art faring from Washington State, USA. A lover of pixel art, his goal is to make pixels that are easy to fall in love with. In addition, he doubles as the lead programmer with skills in Unity, as well as mobile platforms. Coldrice is the main developer for Interstellaria and owner of Coldrice Games LLC. He is committed to bringing the game to players no matter what. He would love to talk to you (yes you!) on twitter: https://twitter.com/ColdRice_Dev\nCHIPZEL - MUSIC\n Chipzel (Niamh Houston) is an incredibly skilled indie chiptune artist from Ireland. Her recent album, Spectra, sets the bar for all other chiptune artists in terms of quality and entertainment value. Using genuine 8bit sound via Gameboy combined with modern tools she produces the perfect sound for a game like Interstellaria - hard beats, vibrant sound, and the electronic pulse of space.\n(All tracks are ideas/a work in progress!)\nTRAILER VERSION 2 - NEW/ORIGINAL CHIPZEL TRACK;\nhttp://youtu.be/7BxZLula1mI\nAMBIANCE/EXPLORATION MUSIC - NEW/ORIGINAL CHIPZEL TRACK\nILLYA KING - CONCEPT ART/DESIGN\nIllya King is an Indie comic book artist faring from Washington State, USA.

You can spot his artwork, as well as several concept art images for Interstellaria, here at his portfolio site.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst Risk - Failure to receive funding. It became really obvious very early on that this game would need a lot of support Without funding, it would be very difficult to complete the project. The game will end up being much smaller due to the limited amount of content I could create alone. In addition, we would lose the awesome soundtrack! I would try and continue to work on the project, but the release date would also slip further away. With bitcrobes, my first \"larger\" project I was able to turn around the game a lot quicker with the support I received. Development under poor equipment was greatly hindered until that point. I know that kickstarter will be the key to success in Interstellaria.\n\nSecond Risk - Development delays. It happens. We've all seen it. My plan is that by offering alpha/beta access at low tiers it'll allow those who put their energy into this game the chance to play it regardless of delays. In addition, all testing feedback only helps to keep development running smoothly!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "NEW UI Patch almost here!

The overall idea isn't entirely original, sure, but the game has been polished to a very fine finish.\"\n --- \nReal world names will generate stronger effects, but you can enter anything! Available to backers only! Get yours with the game!\n When I first set out to create games, I knew that I wanted to create something special. Something with a rich world, and humor to back it up. As I worked out general ideas for games, I came across one that seemed compelling to me - what if you could play an RPG with not match-3 mechanics, like Puzzle Quest, but with words, like Scrabble? This I had to figure out if I could do, and the early ideas of APEXICON were born.\nDrawn eagerly into a spiral notebook, the first ideas and iterations of APEXICON's development happened here a short six months ago. Development has been furious and fast-paced since, and I've pretty much put several thousand dollars into this thing. Now's your chance to help me finish what I've started. \nAPEXICON is a game where you take words from a board of letters, much like a Boggle board, and match them to deal damage.\nA typical battle board set up on the PC.\nBut that's not all. The combat, of course, is a big part, but there are other things I had in mind for the final game:\nCross-Platform Saving - Own the game on multiple platforms? Have a game on PC, and want to play it on mobile? I'm working on making this happen.\nMale and Female versions of every class - Choose your gender with impunity!\nFull Town Management, Including Finding NPCs and Rebuilding the Town\nCustomization of character down to skills, special passives, and equipment which you can use in battle to slay your enemies faster\nFull Voice Over Narration for major characters, text for minors\nMultiple Endings, based entirely on what you do and how you develop your town\nIntriguing story that delves into the rich lore\nEquipment can be leveled up, allowing you to unlock even more skills and special abilities, further specializing your character.\nEnemies who have AI that will try to fight off your skills and use their own\nBuild friendships with your NPC friends in the town to unlock more secrets, sidequests, and various other fun things\nSpend INK, the game's currency, to unlock even more secrets\nBuilt for PC/Mac/Linux in mind, as well as mobiles\nAnd much more!\nSubject to clauses which are entirely not real.\n UPDATED AS I GET MORE THINGS PROCESSED!\nSHIRTS WITH LOGOS\nWordsmith shirt. Any gender any size!\nCustom journal that comes with the EARLY BIRD MEMO TIER\nLee Che Wordsmith vs. Literati Eraser Poster that comes with the EARLY BIRD GAME TIER\nMINIATURES\nUpdated soon!\nEmperor Litacus Namicus III\nSo, you've heard about the story. Well, what is it, you ask? Each class, the Wordsmith, the Idiomancer, the Plagiarist, and the Verbinator have their own story to tell, and they intertwine in the story. You may even cross paths with the other classes and control them for a moment or two in the story for a quick taste of how each other class plays!\nPlagiarist Female\nIn the world of APEXICON, everything is much easier thanks to the prevalence of magic words.The general idea people have that has been passed down through generations is the magic that suffuses words comes from Apexicon, the relic where all knowledge of words and literacy came from, since the dawn of time.\nAfter a terrible war that occurred much earlier in the overall timeline, called the Punctuation War, where large groups of people fought over which punctuations added to magic words had the best effects, magic words were sealed away from the general populace, and an order was established to protect the people from their own ignorance. Thus, the Literati Empire was born. With the magic words being controlled by only the craftsmen, the elite, and the chosen few to wield them, man would not have to suffer through another war again...\nOr at least people thought this was the case...\nA Literati Eraser. Their special weapons can erase your enchanted words on your weapons and armor.\nYour character begins the game differently based on your class. For example, the Wordsmith starts out by being chased by Literati Erasers, the \"stormtroopers\" of the empire.\nSome story from the mobile version.\n After that, it gets weirder and weirder from there. It's up to you to figure out your class's motivations behind who they are, what the Literati Empire are up to, and find out more about the mystical relic, the Apexicon. All the while smashing enemies, solving mini-game puzzles, and engaging in setting up your own town.\nA major character you'll keep coming across is this wily guy, Abin D. Antz. A play on the word \"abundance\", it'll soon become apparent why after you face him:\nThe man with a million lives.\nVOICED OVER by Jason Wishnov of Iridium Studios \"THERE CAME AN ECHO\" and \"SEQUENCE\" fame!\nYep, that's right. He's been \"blessed\" with a million lives, and after he dies, he just keeps coming back for more. Finding out the reasons behind why is central to the game's story.\nThe World Map Menu\nCharacter Creation at its finest.\nA screen of the mobile version's battle board.\nAn AlphaGob. They use huge sticks as pencils.\nMy core thoughts for the game would be based around three big features:\nHuge emphasis on story-telling\nExtreme customization for combat\nInordinate amounts of things to do or find (secrets!)\nI enjoy games that have a lot of optional content that you can do, as I am a content glutton myself.. Do you love the ability to do a long side-quest chain that is entirely irrelevant to the story, yet has a funny story of its own, and rewards you with an equally silly, yet totally awesome item? So do I.\nI enjoy customization on characters, having systems and things to make every character unique, and worth it. So I'm building the game with simple yet deep-if-you-want-it customization. On the surface, there's three skills you equip, then an offensive and a defensive slot. Past that, there's leveling up equipment, then unlocking new skills from that, and so on and so forth. It's all tied together.\nAI in the game will not be punishing. Sure, there will be challenging bosses, but nothing you can't figure out by swapping your skills around and trying what works. There won't be a \"solve this extremely hard riddle\" to pass or anything out of the ordinary. If you can make words, you can do it. \nI'm humbled by the ability to put your dreams online and have people share in your desire to make them real. It's why I went with Kickstarter, as it allows many people to view your idea, then take part in the process of creating it.\nThrough Kickstarter and your donation, all the money will go towards development of the game, no questions, no ifs, ands, or buts. I have more game ideas, but the polish and development of APEXICON is foremost in my mind. I want to make this a worthy entry into the Puzzle RPG space, and it's only going to get better with you guys behind me!\nThough I've sunk a couple thousand into the development of the game already (licenses, art, music, engine, etc), I've turned to Kickstarter to get the most important resource: you. Yes, money is important too, but that already comes with your backing, and you are the one parting with your money in the first place. I'm looking to you guys to help me build something amazing.\nConstruct 2\nThis engine is HTML5 based. I absolutely love what it can do (which is pretty much 2D stuff at the moment), because I'm not the best programmer in the world. I know what I want, and how I want to create it, but the problem is that the majority of languages I have tried to learn are a struggle for me. So Construct 2 has allowed me to visualize the outcome I want from games, and create it with its intuitive event system. I have many ideas for the next games I want to create after getting to know this software's ins and outs. \nJonathan Meyer (that's me) -I'm doing the programming through Construct 2, the overall design of the game, and the various aspects of the story is created through my vision. Everything that could be developed for the game is passed through my eyes before it makes it into the game. And then possibly revised, over and over until I think it looks right. Polish is what I love and what I'm good at.\nScott Hitchcock - Music - I've been amazed at his talent with emulating various other game styles and his music is thus far been absolutely phenomenal. \nTake some samples of his work below:\nLee Che - Her stunning artwork will be gracing the enemies, players, and characters in the game. Each one is handcrafted with emotion and awesomeness. \nLike this guy:\nGeneral Regular Standard. Yes that is his name.\nJanice Kim - My ever faithful UI artist has been helping me get the UI just right so it's easier for people to use and make. She provides the art direction for the UI so that way navigation and accessibility are paramount. This goes for the PC version and the Mobile version.\nAll of this wouldn't be possible without those above helping me out. Now you get to as well!\nTIGSource Devlog Thread: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=34262.0\nIndieDB page: http://www.indiedb.com/games/apexicon-fantasy-wordplay-puzzle-combat\nSteam Greenlight Page (In case you missed it above): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190357043", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risks I'm taking here is getting you, the supporter, on board with the project.

See important scientific chart below:\nPrint Artists:\nPrint artists thus far: KC Green! Aaron Diaz! David Hellman! Zac Gorman! Cubeheart's own Dale Beran! Pledge at the $64 Dollar tier to receive one of their fine works! These samples here reflect their styles, final SCALE print designs tbd.\nScale anything, discover everything.\nYou wield a device that can make any item any size. A tree, a wall, an enemy, a passing cloud, even the levels themselves are all \"SCALEable\". Space is relative in the game so progress is as much conceptual as it is physical. The unique mechanic of SCALEing is inspired by games like Portal and The Swapper. Progression through the game is freeform and open like Mario 64 or early Zelda overworlds. It\u2019s all about exploring and discovering secrets!\nYou play as young physics savant Penny Prince, inventor of a device which can suck the size out of one thing and shoot it into another. SCALE begins as Penny awakes in prison, convicted of 9,322,591 counts of Depraved Heart Murder for accidentally destroying the east coast. Someone has confiscated her cat. Against the express advice of the rehabilitative therapy coordinator now living inside her brain, she hastily reconstructs her device using materials from a nearby cellphone recycling bin and embarks upon escape in an attempt to regain her freedom and her cat.\nThis is the main deal! If you pledge right now, you\u2019ll get a DRM free copy of SCALE and a Steam key! We\u2019re aiming to make SCALE triple-A quality\u2026 no, quintuple-A quality! But when it\u2019s done, we\u2019ll probably charge a quadruple-A price. Pledging or pre-ordering now is the surest way to get the game at its lowest price for the foreseeable future.\nAre you the type of gamer who just types WASD over and over to the exclusion of all the other awesome keys? Well no longer! Steve also made a game that uses EVERY KEY! Every key! That's right the fun and the inputting never stop because they are the same thing in Inputting-- the game! You can get it packaged together with SCALE for just $15!\nSold out!\nUsing the power of friendship, we condensed five tremendous games into a single value pack! For just $20, you'll get a DRM-free copy of SCALE on MAC, PC, and Linux. You'll also recieve four additional amazing games donated by super-group Friends of Scale: OSMOS, Incredipede, Electronic Super Joy, Noitu Love 2, and Inputting! Like friendship itself, this offer is limited!\nDo you like tunes? And jamming to them? We want to help! The SCALE OST is going to sound amazing! Did you look at the musicians involved!? Did you see them!?? Did you?!! Scroll down and look at them and then come back down here when you\u2019re calm. Yeah, it\u2019s out of control. This album is going to be like sunshine-- hot, sparkling, and DRM free! Pledge now and you'll also get SCALE's OST as a digital download.\nA lot of great musicians have approached us with ideas and work for SCALE, so many that we won\u2019t be able to fit them all in the game. But we love them and want to do anything for them because their music is so good! Thus we have no choice but to release a second ALL AWESOME companion album, so called in the music industry because ALL THE TRACKS WILL BE AWESOME and there may be some risk of you bopping until you drop/can\u2019t stop, etc.\nOnce we feel SCALE is ready for a limited audience, but not quite ready for prime time, we\u2019ll release it to a limited audience. You can be among that select number and your feedback will help shape the final game! Watch as friends and enemies burn with jealous rage as you shrink and enlarge stuff before anybody else in the (SCALE) universe!\nMost concept art for games is buried deep underground with the artist once the game launches to ensure an auspicious reception for the title in heaven. But SCALE is different! We\u2019ve promised all the talented artists involved that they will escape with their lives. And what\u2019s more, we want to pick through the vast pile of amazing art littering the floor of their forbidden temple and put it into a big book! This transcendent volume will feature, among other items, sick sketches, storyboards, mockups, and renders from SCALE\u2019s development, all for your perusal as a high quality PDF download!\n Before SCALE is ready for a limited Beta audience, we\u2019ll be doing Alpha testing, so called because it is the leader of the pack of all testing! If you\u2019d like to see the game before anyone else and give us feedback, pledge in a tier with Alpha access, and you\u2019ll get an extra-first look at SCALE as we\u2019re putting it together! This may be the only place in which you will be able to glimpse the creative team\u2019s true forms as they flicker in and out of existence briefly during the strenuous act of creating something from nothing.\nContrary to what the internet advises, you can\u2019t go naked all the time. You just can\u2019t. These tees, intended to cover and accentuate the chest and the top of the arms, are designed by Mr. Swink himself, with designs printed on tasteful grey, red, green, or blue cloth. Once this shirt arrives, place it on any part of your body and move about through the world to collect \u201cmad props\u201d, \u201cinstant respect\u201d, and fistbumps ad libitum. Transformation into a marmalade tabby is rare. After several weeks of wear, you will probably turn into some other sort of cat. \nPart of what we love about SCALE is it\u2019s potential for wild and abstract visuals made from the distorted hash of everyday objects like flowers, houses, cars, trees and even the landscape itself. It\u2019s already made for some fantastic and unique art. So we\u2019re really excited about putting together a series of slick posters! We don\u2019t have a final designs to show you yet, but we\u2019re planning on at least 5 of them. (One of our cat interns whipped up the prototype above). But rest assured, we will not feed our cats until they forge the finest print ever seen in their secret workshop underneath the stairs\nFor those of you who left a part of their heart in the 90s, we have just the thing: the SCALE OST in CD form. Glimmering sides caparisoned in delicately wrapped custom-designed packaging, this item will provide great comfort to those whom, when they listen to music, want to know that somewhere, somehow, there is a disk silently spinning.\nIf you are someone who enjoys existing in physical space and possessing objects likewise endowed with tangible properties, this is the reward for you! The Scale Meatspace Masterpiece Possession Form of SCALE includes a custom designed physical box for the game (artist and final design TBA), the game on disc, an instruction manual full of unique content/dubious advice, and a CD copy of the OST. All items possessed of mass and composed entirely of matter!\nWe\u2019re gonna\u2019 cut the SCALE OST and the ALL AWESOME COMPANION Albums to a pair of Vinyl discs housed in beautifully designed dust jackets. Why? Because we like vinyl\u2019s charm and warm sound. Those who obtain such an item should be prepared to instantly become cool(er?) and stay that way for the rest of their life.\nWhen the apocalypse comes and all your buds are vainly thumbing the blank screens of their uncharged mobile devices, won\u2019t you be glad you opted for the SCALE Masterpiece Meatspace Artbook with analog-style pages? In this volume, we will collect all the goodness of the digital artbook, wrapped up in retro physical form, amazing cover design, and custom packaging. Once it arrives, place it on a coffee table or bookshelf to seduce anyone instantly!\nSteve is a game design instructor who has experience helping game designers refine and scope their ideas into manageable, fulfilling projects. If you select this reward, he\u2019ll work with you to hone your idea into the best possible game it can be, and playtest, and offer feedback. Includes a trip to get ice cream. Not valid at participating locations offer void if coupons vouchers.\nAs Penny progresses through a universe she has skewed seemingly beyond all repair, her inherent curiosity compels her to collect all the subatomic particles that now drift as big as life through the detritus such as tachyons, fermions, muons, quarks, inflatons,and even those that have yet to be discovered like the benbernankion, the orgon, and the emoticon. If you pledge at a tier that includes a particle, tell us what you\u2019d like to see, and we\u2019ll craft it for you into a classy model.\nPenny is confined in a miniprison, carefully SCALEd and crafted by the Poetic Justice System so that her punishment fits her crime. Just like PJS, we will uniquely craft a miniprison of your very own, complete with advertisements for popular near-future prison contractors such as Nev-R eScape Therapy Cell and EZ Kwik & Accurate Memory Trappers, LLC. This item sits nicely on any desk, table, or secret shrine behind the bookcase.\nCertain recently resurrected species of the Silurian period have been genetically enhanced to provide the ultimate in prisoner rehabilitation. These brain parasites work with their host to overcome and correct a wide array of antisocial tendencies and mental difficulties. But to those on the straight and narrow, they just make great hats. If you feel you are virtuous enough, consider sporting a lovingly crafted Silurian Brain Parasite Hat.\nThe SCALE device streams the \u201cSCALE-ness\u201d or \u201cSize Juice\u201d out of one thing and into another allowing the user to really mess up the universe big time. We are planning five different versions of THE DEVICE for usage in game, each more refined and magnificent than the last, especially because the first one is basically whatever Penny could build out of the garbage on hand in her mini-prison. They get cooler though. If this is your chosen reward, you will receive one (1) Hollywood prop quality version of the in-game SCALE device, for you to use on your very own quest to discover the ultimate nature of matter.\nThis would be the perfect opportunity to make a joke about how the quality of the game will SCALE up to match your contribution (huh? get it? get it?) but that\u2019s really not the case. We don\u2019t believe in holding mechanics, levels, or key features ransom behind ludicrous stretch goals. We\u2019ll be able to make a great game if we hit our initial funding target, and if we make it, you won\u2019t have to settle for \u00bd the systems you got excited about when reading about our project.\nBut there are some things we\u2019d like extra money to do, and we do think that they\u2019ll make the process of making the game swifter and easier.\n100K - Oculus Rift support\nDue to how we\u2019re making the game, it should be pretty easy for us to add support for the Oculus Rift, which is why Oculus support is our first and lowest Stretch Goal.\n125K - Unlock Dale\u2019s SCALE custom companion comic\nDale\u2019s writing the game by using up the last jot of love and passion in an otherwise cold and robotic heart. But with some extra money we could activate his for-profit subroutine and tap into a rich dark vein of wild SCALE-themed comics undreamt of in this modern age. Dale experts tell us it\u2019s dark magic would create a special companion comic for the game that would go with you wherever you went.\n150K - Hire Additional 3D Artist\nAn additional 3D artist means we\u2019ll not only be able to have more art in the game, but we\u2019ll be able to have better art, as there will be more time refine for the artists to refine their work.\n175K - Level Editor\nWith a level editor, you\u2019ll be able to build the worlds you\u2019ve always dreamed of, and then make them really, really big or really, really tiny and watch your friends play them. However, you\u2019ll need to supply your own Zoolander style \u201cwhat is this, a _____ for ANTS?!?!\u201d jokes.\nOfficially, we call our company CubeHeart, a Voltron-like flesh monstrosity of game development talent, lead by Steve \"I'll form the head\" Swink for the purpose of making SCALE a good video game that humans will enjoy. Steve is SCALE\u2019s designer and principal developer, and he has made a bunch of other great games, taught game development course, and even written a book. You can learn more about that by checking out the biography section in the sidebar.\nCubeHeart's other robo-parts include:\nDale Beran, Writer (A Lesson is Learned but the Damage is Irreversible, The Nerds of Paradise):\nDale forms CubeHeart's writing core located in a jaunty robotic hat and is responsible for SCALE's excellent story, dialog, and world building.\nEddy Boxerman, Physics Ninja (Osmos): Eddy is our physics guru extraordinaire, and forms CubeHeart's adamantium skeleton, upon which bugs are righteously shattered. A true warrior poet.\nAndrew Coggeshall, Polygon Wizard (RedFrame): Andrew's abilities in the eldritch world of 3D art are not to be underestimated. Andrew is CubeHeart\u2019s raw brawn, beefy arms, and rakish good looks all in one package.\nMax Geiger, Producifier (Unfinished Swan, Deadliest Warrior): Max forms CubeHeart\u2019s robo-codpiece. What that conceals, no one knows, but it is responsible for the potency and chutzpah of CubeHeart\u2019s planning and project management.\nMike Wright, Soundsmith and Composer (Miscrits): Mike is SCALE\u2019s audio designer, and CubeHeart\u2019s shining ears. His shimmering platinum lobes make lesser golden ears seem crude and unrefined in comparison.\nWith Voiceover work by:\nAshly Burch (Hey Ash, Watcha Playin\u2019?, Borderlands 2)\nSarah Elmaleh (Gone Home, Skulls of the Shogun)\nForming CubeHeart\u2019s sonorous vocal cords, Ash and Sarah have agreed to lend their considerable talents to SCALE as the voice of Penny and Penny\u2019s Silurian brain parasite therapist, respectively. Their euphonious stylings will carry you to new emotional highs and lows over the course of the game.\nFeaturing tracks by:\nBen Prunty (FTL, Gravity Ghost)\ndanny B (Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Issac, Drifter)\nThe sweet grooves of these two maestros need no further introduction, but we\u2019ll try anyway. Like the golden fingers of CubeHeart\u2019s left and right hand caressing the smoothest saxaphone you\u2019ve ever heard, Ben Prunty and DannyB are laying down the finest tracks we\u2019ve ever heard to accompany what we hope will be the finest game you\u2019ve ever played.\nTogether we are CubeHeart. THE CUBEHEART IS BEATING!!\nWhy are you Kickstarting this project?\nBecause we think Kickstarter is the best avenue for raising the funding we need while putting SCALE in front of an audience of people who will have a vested interest in the success of the project. We also like that with Kickstarter, there\u2019s the expectation that we\u2019ll keep our backers updated. We think building SCALE is going to be a fun ride, and we\u2019d love to bring you along with us, rather than toiling in secret.\nWhy is your goal $87,000?\nBecause we\u2019ve run the numbers, and the advice we\u2019ve gotten from everyone has been \u201cask for the money you need, and don\u2019t try to lowball it.\u201d We think 87K will be enough to cover development expenses for the time it will take to make SCALE, as well as pay the talented people who are contributing to the project. We\u2019re also keenly aware that a lot of project underestimates fulfillment costs and Kickstarter/Amazon Payment\u2019s 5% and 3-5% shares, respectively, and so we\u2019ve tried to build this in to our estimate.\nHow are you making SCALE?\nSCALE is being developed in Unity, which is a familiar and comfortable development environment for us. Steve has been using Unity since version 1.6.\nWhich platforms are you targeting?\nCurrently, PC, Mac, and Linux are all viable platforms we\u2019d like to see SCALE on. Targeting Linux means we\u2019ll be on SteamOS/Steam Machines as well. We are also considering next-gen consoles, and are in talks with a few different publishers about the viability of bringing SCALE to a those platforms, but a getting the game out on personal computers is our first priority.\nHere's an interview Steve did with Adam Sessler at the INDIE MEGABOOTH this year at PAX.\nJohn Walker, Rock Paper Shotgun: \"This was undoubtedly the star of the afternoon. Receiving gasps of delight, along with multiple bursts of spontaneous applause, it was a concept that just kept delighting.\"\nTaylor Cocke, GameCenterBlog: \"Steve Swink's first-person puzzler might be my most-anticipated game of this year.\"\nJared Rosen, Indiestatik: \"What instantly struck me about Scale was how it seized on such a pure, childlike focus on exploration.\"\nNorthernLion did a \"Let's Look At\" preview video of the PAX build of SCALE.\nA Carl Sagan Quote because Carl Sagan:\n\u201cIf the cosmos is closed...there's a strange, haunting, evocative possibility...one of the most exquisite conjectures in science and religion. It's entirely undemonstrated...it may never be proved, but it's stirring. Our entire universe, to the farthest galaxy, we are told...is no more than a closed electron...in a far grander universe we can never see. That universe is only an elementry particle...in another still greater universe and so on forever. Also, every electron in our universe, it is claimed...is an entire miniature cosmos...containing galaxies and stars and life, and electrons. Everyone of those electrons contains a still smaller universe...an infinite regression up and down.\u201d - Carl Sagan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISK 1: SCALE's project schedule is not final yet.\n\nSCALE is a videogame, and frankly, video games take a long time to finish and get right. There's a morbid joke in game development that building the features and levels of the game is the first 90% of the work that a development team does, and the second 90% is fixing all the bugs in that work and polishing it up. The official answer for when SCALE will be complete is \"when it's good,\" but we anticipate that we'll be done way before the heat death of the universe. For some perspective, Steve has been working on SCALE in bits and pieces since 2012, but retooled the art and started serious work on the game in early 2013, and as of now we estimate that the game is currently 25-30% done.\n\nWe know a lot of people have been mislead on Kickstarter, or feel like backing a videogame on Kickstarter is a risky proposition, and that's not without good reason. But we're a team of veterans who have a solid track record of shipping quality games and projects, and we're confident that given enough time, we'll be able to ship the best possible version of SCALE.\n\nRisk 2: Hey, aren't you the guy behind Shadow Physics? That game turned out to be vaporware, won't this one too?\n\nCutting right to the hard questions, eh? The story of why Shadow Physics was canned is simple: you gotta know when to fold 'em. It just wasn't working. We worked our butts off and the game just wasn't fun. Lessons were learned and have been applied. The past 9 months of development on SCALE have resulted in more enjoyable gameplay than the entire two and half years of work on Shadow Physics.\n\nRISK 3: Will you guys be able to fulfill all these physical rewards in a timely fashion?\n\nYes.

We've beaten TEN stretch goals! New professional artwork, cryptography consultation, tons of new rooms, unlimited endings, easter eggs, voice acting - it's insane! See the \"Stretch Goals\" section below for more details.\nPostcards! For every $10 pledged, you get a postcard mailed to you. These postcards have original art on each, and include lots of content and secrets about Emerald. See the Backer Rewards section for details.\nkrangGAMES Abettor Level! At $30 you get seven unique, experimental prototype games from krangGAMES, the developer of Emerald.\nThe Game\nThe Ship is floating dead in space, adrift in the interstellar void. In zero-gravity you navigate its haunting, labyrinthine corridors. Through flickering terminals you bring electric subsystems back to life. Hidden ciphers and encrypted secrets tease the periphery of your senses. Vivid interactive memories of your past reveal why you're even aboard this vessel. What kind of disaster brought your original mission to a standstill? What is the significance of the word \"Emerald\"?\nThomas Was Alone meets Analogue: A Hate Story meets System Shock, but without any gravity.\nEmerald is an atmospheric, story-driven action/adventure game. It features a mysterious sci-fi environment with a heavy emphasis on exploration. It is being built for PC, Mac and Linux and is expected to launch on February 13th, 2014.\nIn Emerald, you must repair your damaged spacecraft in the zero-gravity drift of space. There are many subsystems that have failed, and your life and survival depends on what systems you choose to reactivate.\nIn between reactivating the Ship's subsystems, you experience intense interactive flashbacks of your old life. How did you get to where you are? What kind of person were you? What is the significance of the word \"Emerald\"?\nThe world of Emerald is built into a rich, haunting sci-fi atmosphere. Countless hours have been spent ensuring that the game's technology, though futuristic and conceptual, is rooted in reality.\nMuch of Emerald's history is found encrypted within the Ship's data systems, waiting for the player to decipher it. There is no gibberish-text; everything has meaning. The story is wide open for interpretation, investigation, and imagination.\nWhether you simply play from beginning to end or scrounge for every clue and datum, you'll be left with a rich and reflective experience that has followed Emerald's protagonist across years of time and lightyears of space.\nThe footage from above is from the first full prototype build of Emerald. It includes all the gameplay, much of the content and nine unique endings.\nEmerald was originally conceived at the 2013 Global Game Jam (of which krangGAMES was both a sponsor and participant). It was initially intended to be an online Flash game, but soon grew into something far more substantial.\nThe prototype is built in Flash, but the final version is constructed in Unity to take advantage of better visual features, optimized performance and the ability to build to virtually any platform, consoles included.\nThe visual style of Emerald will not stray far from what it is now, but will take advantage of Unity's engine to use better shaders, parallaxing and camera effects. The aesthetics will still have the stylistic vibe pictured here, but will be way slicker and nicer overall.\nEmerald is slated to launch on February 13th, 2014.\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used for three things:\nDevelopment! To fund the development of final build of Emerald over an approximately four-month period, and cover any business costs that are involved.\nWonderful helpers! To pay all those who've helped Emerald become what it is today. This includes the audio designers at Power Up Audio and artists at Miniboss, who have generously lent their talent pro-bono and have done an amazing job.\nKickstarter costs! To pay for the Kickstarter fees and Backer Rewards themselves, mainly for development and shipping of the posters.\nAny funds gained beyond the Kickstarter goal will go towards focusing more effort directly onto Emerald. $5,800 alone is not enough to work full-time on a single project for four months, and my budget/timeline does allow for some wiggle room to work on external contracts. Exceeding the exact Kickstarter goal will let me focus more on Emerald, benefitting the game overall.\nStretch goals have now been announced! See below for a list of all rewards, and descriptions of each reward.\n$5800 (BOOYAH): The Base Game. Emerald!\n$6000 (BOOYAH): Ten Endings. One more detailed ending will be added to the game, bringing the total up to ten.\n$6250 (BOOYAH): Two New Rooms in the Ship. Two unique new areas will be created, giving more details and environment to explore.\n$6500 (BOOYAH): Twelve Endings. Two more endings bringing the value to twelve.\n$7000 (BOOYAH): Five-plus New Rooms in the Ship. At least five rooms will be added, with the possibility of more.\n$7500 (BOOYAH): Fifteen-plus Endings. Three more endings, with the possibility of more.\n$8000 (BOOYAH): Professional Voice Acting. With the help of Power Up Audio, professional voice actors will be brought in to lend their talents to Emerald.\n$8400 (BOOYAH): Easter Egg Pass. A complete work pass on the game will be performed, specifically with the intention of adding unique easter eggs, secrets and bonus content.\n$8800 (BOOYAH): Dynamic, Virtually Unlimited Endings. Some endings will be designed to be influenced by extremely subtle, personal actions performed in the game, and will change on the fly. The result is that there will be emergent and original endings, making the Emerald experience vastly more personal and emotional.\n$9750 (BOOYAH): Full Professional Art Design. Professional artists (who, exactly, is to be determined, but I have several interested parties) will be brought onboard to thoroughly enhance the visual aesthetic of Emerald's gameplay.\n$10500 (BOOYAH): Hire a Cryptography Consultant. I'll visit local police stations and universities, and speak to consultants who deal with cryptography on a professional level, adding an extreme authenticity to Emerald found in precious few games.\n$11000: \"Takeoff\" Story Sequence. A longer interactive gameplay sequence will be added that explores the Ship's takeoff from Home, before its fated journey began.\n$12000: New Music (at least two new songs). At least two new tracks will be composed for Emerald, again by the extremely talented folks at Power Up Audio.\n$12500: iOS/Android Ports. Emerald will be ported to be playable on mobile tablet devices, and ideally on mobile phones as well (depending on whether or not it plays well on such a small screen).\n$13500: Physical Game Box and OST Disc. A physical box copy of Emerald will be created with a playable game disc. The OST will also be provided as a CD.\n$14250: Physical Art Book and Dev Diary. An enhanced physical copy of \"Encrypted Gemstones: the Emerald Developer Diary\" will be printed, including unique game art, concept art and sketches from Emerald.\n$15000: PS Vita Port. Emerald will be ported to be playable on the PS Vita.\n$16000: \"Outside the Hull\" Gameplay Sequence. A section of gameplay will take place outside the hull of the Ship, adding a completely new and totally unique area to explore in Emerald.\n$17500: PS3 Port. Emerald will be ported to the Playstation 3 and, as soon as possible, Playstation 4.\n$18000: Physical Version of all story documents at \"Log.txt\" Level. The story-related documents at Log.txt Level will actually be created in the real world. Handwritten crew accounts, voice recordings, images and other media will be created and shipped to you in a big old box.\n$21000: Emerald Figurines (characters, objects, and the Ship). Small plastic figurines will be cast and created. These figurines will be of characters from Emerald, unique objects in the game, and of the Ship itself.\n$25000: Wii U Port. Emerald will be ported to the Wii U.\n$25000+: Beyond? Who knows... I haven't designed more tiers than $25k's worth, but if you keep throwing money at me I'm sure I'll find an excellent use for it. Be warned, though - I won't risk expanding Emerald to the point where a February 13th, 2013 launch date is no longer feasible.\nThere's a bit more information available on the Stretch Goals Announcement Update.\nPlease note: Platform ports are entirely dependant on the companies who own those platforms, such as Sony, Nintendo, and Apple, and are also dependent on how soon I can secure licenses for Unity for those platforms. I'll work very hard to launch Emerald on all platforms as close to the primary launch date as possible (Feb 13th, 2013) but there may be factors that are entirely out of my control when it comes to porting Emerald onto these systems. It is NOT guaranteed that Emerald will launch on all platforms on the primary launch date. That said, I've spoken to folks at these companies, they're lovely people and are extremely helpful. Fingers crossed!\nAll tiers include one DRM-free copy of the game for PC, Mac or Linux. All tiers include all previous tier rewards.\n\"Echoes\" Level ($9): You get the original soundtrack as well. The soundtrack is normally $5 alone, which our on-staff economist has determined is a $1 saving - final copy of the game and a high-res desktop wallpaper (pictured below) notwithstanding.\n\"Terminal\" Poster and Wallpaper, Low-Res Version\nPostcards ($10/each): For every $10 you pledge, you get one postcard mailed to you! Every postcard features original artwork by indie game developers, artists, friends and well-wishers. The postcards also include a short message from one of the Ship's crew members, an in-game code used to activate some of the Ship's emergency functions, and an encrypted secret.\nAt $100, you get ALL the postcards! There are about 15 in total, though that number does seem to be rising ;)\nNote: There is no international shipping fee for these postcards. I love you too.\n\"Alpha\" Level ($15): You'll receive a copy of Emerald at its current state of development - the Flash prototype pictured in the video. Note that this version is early, kinda buggy, and is not representative of the final version of the game. You also receive TWO high-res desktop wallpapers. The first wallpaper is pictured above, the second is the \"the Ship\" poster that's available at \"Cartographer Level\", below.\n\"Log.txt\" Level ($25): You get three new things! First, a collection of digital documents from the Ship itself, such as audio logs, crew journals, status reports, infographics and encrypted messages. The story of Emerald goes remarkably deep, and these documents give an internal perspective to the happenings of the Ship. You'll also receive a digital copy of Encrypted Gemstones: the Emerald Developer Diary, a .pdf document of behind-the-scenes images, diagrams and commentary about the game design and development processes of Emerald. Finally, you'll receive three of twenty-five secret codes that unlock certain things within Emerald, like in-game secrets, hidden menu options, or even easter eggs. The digital story documents will be delivered about a month before game launch, and the developer diary and codes will be delivered at game launch.\n\"krangGAMES Abettor\" Level ($30): Support not just Emerald, but krangGAMES as a whole! Get 7 experimental unreleased games made by me (Nick Yonge) over the last few years at krangGAMES. For a detailed list of the games and their descriptions, please view the Day 14 Mega Update.\nAlso get first notice when development of krangGAMES' next major open-world project, Overworld (working title), begins - as well as the first available prototype of Overworld!\n\"Personal Trust\" Level ($45): Customize your version of Emerald! Get TWO specially dedicated versions of Emerald, with a unique intro sequence. This new intro is an interactive dream sequence that is custom tailored to immerse you - specifically YOU - into Emerald right from the start. Since it includes TWO customized versions of Emerald, you can customize one for yourself and the second as a gift. Emerald is a deep, story based game; if you have any friends who enjoy thoughtful stories, this would make an excellent gift for them.\nAdd $15 for additional customized copies of Emerald. Gift versions include the OST. For more details, please read the Personal Trust Announcement Update.\nAlso note: ALL VERSIONS OF EMERALD AT $45 AND HIGHER INCLUDE THE \"PERSONAL TRUST\" REWARDS! I can't edit reward descriptions after they've been backed, but all tiers at $45 and above let you customize two copies of Emerald.\nBehold, this is the poster for \"Cartographer Level\":\n\"the Ship\" Poster and Wallpaper, Low-Res Version\n\"Cartographer\" Level ($55): You get one \"the Ship\" poster, pictured above. It's 16\"x12\" in landscape orientation.\n\"Terminal\" Level ($80): You get one \"Terminal\" poster, pictured above. It's 24\"x36\" (standard movie poster size) in landscape orientation.\nFor both Cartographer and Terminal Levels (and all subsequent levels), please add $10 for non-Canadian shipping. Ships within one month of campaign completion.\n\"In Memoriam\" Level ($90): By popular demand, another in-game feature tier! You will be featured in-game in the Ship's Memory Banks, a directory of individuals that somehow affected the Ship in the past - previous crew members, loved ones, old friends, investors, skilled enemies, or something else entirely. You can choose what type of impact you had on the Ship, customize your in-game appearance, and give yourself a brief personality and history.\nAlso note: the Memory Banks were digitally secured against tampering. With my help we'll create the encryptions that hold your data secure!\n\"Fated Crewman\" Level ($99): You will be featured in-game as one of the crew members aboard the Ship. You will be listed on the Ship's crew roster and will be able to customize your in-game appearance. If you would like, you can write a Crew Log detailing what your character did in the Ship before the calamity. These crew logs must fit within the mythos of Emerald, so I will help you write and edit them... but you will be able to add your own personal flair to the game!\n\"Luminous Flux\" Level ($125): Get the \"Luminous Flux\" Gallery Book, a physical book which features printed editions of every piece of artwork from Emerald, all the postcard images, all the promotional artwork, and a few screenshots from in-game.\nNote that this is a physical art book, whereas \"Encrypted Gemstones\" at the $25 \"Log.txt\" Level is a digital dev diary.\n\"Extrasolar Beauty\" Level ($140): Get everything at the $125 \"Luminous Flux\" Level, PLUS a signed Emerald \"Lumens\" 24x36\" Movie-style Poster (pictured below).\n\"Lumens\" Poster, Low-Res Version\n\"XO\" Level ($213): Similar to Fated Crewman, though it's limited to just one spot and thus has more impact on the game. On top of creating a crew log, you can help me encrypt hidden data into the game. It's up to you how much you want to participate, but we will collaborate to define the origin of the Ship itself. This will be revealed by three messages scattered through the game for players to uncover.\nI'm Nick Yonge, the Founder/Director/MCS-EOOEJ* of krangGAMES Inc. I'm the designer, developer, artist and programmer behind Emerald. You can view my full portfolio here.\nBelow is a brief history of krangGAMES. There's a presskit available if you're into that kind of thing.\nI've been working as an independent game developer since I founded krangGAMES in December of 2010, shortly after graduating from VFS with a diploma in Game Design. I've mostly developed Flash games since then, making most notably the games i saw her standing there, Nyan Cat FLY!, and PRIOR. Collectively my games have gotten over thirty million plays, and have been nominated in the Canadian Videogame Awards twice, once as a nominee (PRIOR) and once as a finalist (i saw her standing there).\nThough I usually work solo on projects, I love working with other artists, developers and designers too!\nThe \"Terminal\" image (used as the main image of this campaign) was illustrated by Pedro Medeiros of MiniBoss. Hailing from Brazil, MiniBoss has both created many of their own games, and worked on such awesome indie projects as Deep Dungeons Of Doom, Towerfall, and Out There Somewhere.\nThe album art (pictured in the OST link below) was created by concept artist Trudi Castle. A wonderfully skilled person, her professional work has included such projects as Halo CE: Anniversary, Crysis 2, and Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. She's also worked with plenty of indie studios like Exit Strategy Entertainment, East Side Games and Phosphor Games.\nHer personal works are pretty whimsical, too.\nSound design was done by the endlessly talented folks at Power Up Audio, including SFX design and music composition.\nPower Up Audio's varied portfolio includes Brace Yourself Games (Crypt of the NecroDancer), Matt Makes Games (Towerfall), Quark Games (Champs Battlegrounds), Fathom Interactive (Sky Pirates of Neo Terra), the Coastal First Nations Group (Bears Forever), Kerberos Productions Inc. (Sword of the Stars: The Pit, and Ground Pounders which has its own awesome Kickstarter campaign too!). Many of those folks have had great things to say about Power Up. I'm extremely glad they loved Emerald enough to work on it!\n*Master Chief Supreme-Executive Officer Of Extreme Justice. Basically a needlessly lofty version of CEO. When I found out I could legally define my own job title, I naturally had to have a bit of fun with it.\nEmerald is very much a project of passion. I would love nothing more than to bring the game to fruition these next few months, and with your help we can make that a reality.\nIf you're interested in Emerald too, please share it on Facebook or Twitter! Kickstarter campaigns live or die by word-of-mouth referral, and every post and tweet is valuable.\nNote: Social Sharing links are at the top of this page, right under the video.\nThanks for reading! I hope you'll help me make Emerald a reality \u2665\n-Nick Yonge, krangGAMES", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be krangGAMES' first for-sale project. As such there will likely be business and set-up costs and work that I haven't considered.\n\nI'm fortunate to have enough close friends working in the game design industry that I have access to plenty of advice and guidance, and have built three weeks into the end-of-project schedule to allow for \"flex time\", to cover any unexpected tasks.\n\nIdeally, if the number of unexpected tasks stays low (fingers crossed, but ever unlikely!), I can use this time for MORE polish on the game, and perhaps adding more hidden secrets (or even easter eggs).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Moving On", "update_content": "Hi, folks.

Marrying Mr. Darcy is a strategy card game where players are one of the female characters from Jane Austen\u2019s novel Pride and Prejudice. Players work to earn points and attract the attention of available suitors. Our heroines do this by attending events and improving their characters, but advantage can be gained by the use of cunning. All of their efforts are in hopes of marrying well and becoming the most satisfied character at the end of the game!\nI created this game to be the ultimate participatory fan fiction experience for lovers of Pride and Prejudice, the classic novel by Jane Austen. You are able to put yourself in the shoes of your favorite female character, who must marry to secure her comfort and/or happiness.

Printing, delivery, shipping to backers, fulfillment administration, and kickstarter fees. \nAre you working on this by yourself? No! My talented husband, Erik Evensen, is my artist, graphic designer and sounding board. He has independently published two graphic novels and ran his own successful kickstarter campaign for \"The Beast of Wolfe's Bay.\" He has experience working with printers, file preparation and self-publishing. \nWhy did you make this? I am a huge Jane Austen/Pride and Prejudice fan. I initially had the thought to write an adaptation of it, but then had the better idea to make a game a little over a year ago. I've been working on it ever since. I love playing Settlers of Catan and Munchkin and thought a game of P&P would be really fun to play. \nWill this be sold in stores? I hope so, but this is not a sure thing. I'm currently working on getting distribution for the game, but it all depends on how successful this Kickstarter campaign is. If you want a copy, supporting us now is the quickest and guaranteed way to get a game.\nWhere did you get those sweet vintage graphics? Various sources, but mostly from The Graphics Fairy. (Used with permission)\nDo you know what you are getting into with this whole Kickstarter thing? Why should I trust you? While my personal Kickstarter profile is quite new, I've been involved on Kickstarter supporting campaigns through my husband's page since early 2012 and helping him fulfill his rewards for The Beast of Wolfe's Bay.

I have made a good faith estimate based on research of when I can deliver your game, but there are somethings outside my control.

Battle sea-beasts, pirates, sentient coral. Explore a map that changes every time you play. Discover islands. Establish staging posts. Win fame as a navigator. Learn the stories of your crew: assist them, seduce them or consume them as you see fit.\nSunless Sea is a game of exploration, survival and loneliness set in the award-winning Victorian Gothic universe of Fallen London. Take the helm of your customised steamship and set sail for the unknown! Light and darkness are your greatest allies, but a stout set of cannon and a gunnery officer with a grudge will come in useful too.\nAnd Sunless Sea is a game of stories; the dark pasts of your crew, the hidden coves of the soul-smugglers, the tentacled nemesis that you chased from Hunter\u2019s Keep to the shores of the Elder Continent. \nGameplay concept\nYour choices will determine the events of every game. Will you return to Fallen London with a hold full of loot or succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Will you free the colonies of the Carnelian Coast, or keep them in the Empire\u2019s grip? Will you betray your father\u2019s legacy or reclaim it?\nYou are the captain. It\u2019s your call.\nOur influences! ... FTL; Don't Starve; Strange Adventures in Infinite Space; Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates; Taipan; Elite; roguelikes; the Crimson Permanent Assurance; the Irish immrama myths.\n\"Thirty years ago, London was stolen. Now it rests on the shore of the Unterzee, that old dark ocean under the world. Hell is close, immortality is cheap, and the screaming has largely stopped. Steamships ply all the wild black zee, between the Iron Republic and the Elder Continent, between Hunter's Keep and the Travertine Spiral and the Dawn Machine. Welcome. Delicious friend.\"\nSunless Sea is set in the same universe as Fallen London, our award-winning browser game. Fallen London (formerly Echo Bazaar) is a dark and hilarious Victorian-Gothic underworld, where every choice has a consequence, from the style of your hat to the price of your soul. \n\u201cSuperlative... every bit as vividly drawn as the worlds built by Rockstar in Red Dead Redemption, or Irrational in Bioshock, or Supergiant in Bastion.\u201d -Tom Chick\n\u201cDripping with lore, obscure and refreshingly odd... the word-forging and world-building are quite brilliant.\u201d - Rock, Paper, Shotgun \n\u201cA complex web of short stories and deliciously moist slices of fiction.\u201d - PC Gamer\n\"This is hands-down one of the best browser games we've ever played.\" - Gamezebo\nSunless Sea will combine the choice-based storytelling style of Fallen London with real-time exploration of a dark and threatening ocean. \nChoose your ship, name your captain, and leave the bustle of the docks for the wild and lightless depths of the Unterzee. Some areas, like Fallen London itself, are fixed and will always appear where you expect them. But once you get beyond the trade lanes, the Sunless Sea is unexplored, and the map will change every time you play. One time you might encounter a corsair's village in a forest of stalagmites, another you might come face to face with the vicious war trimarans of the New Khanate or the golden agents of the Dawn Machine.\nPlayer ship concept\nYour ship controls like a steamship, with a rudder for steering and an engine telegraph to control speed. Fuel and supplies are finite resources. Running out of either may leave you in terrible peril.\nExplore and survive. Grow strong and wise and rich and feared. With luck and skill you may achieve an endgame goal: find your father's legacy, found a pirate princedom or sail beyond the Unterzee into the strangeness at time's heart. \nRecruit officers on your travels - some are familiar faces from Fallen London, some are new. Officers provide bonuses to your ship's stats - Iron, Veils, Mirrors, Hearts and Pages -  but more importantly they're a source of stories. Get to know your First Officer and she might share the co-ordinates of a secret smugglers' cove stuffed with drowning-pearls. Feed your ship's cat a moonish sprat and it may begin to glow in the dark. Invite your surgeon to dinner in your cabin and... well, who knows?\nCombat occurs in (pauseable) real time, with abilities on a cooldown. You and your opponent each have an array of abilities for defence, damage, healing and trickery. Your Iron stat allows you to attack; your Mirrors stat allows you to Illuminate your enemy, leaving them vulnerable; your Veils stat hides you from your enemy's Illumination; Hearts and Pages allow for healing, drugs, trickery, diplomacy. Your Officers enhance all these, so equipping the right Officers may unlock further abilities.\nOnce again, light and dark are key. Begin a battle with your enemy in your prow-light to have them begin the battle Illuminated, or turn your lights off to ensure your own Illumination starts low.\nAs your stats rise, and as you purchase new equipment for your ship, the number and power of your abilities will grow. Begin with a Splinter-Salvo and Evasive Manoeuvres: aspire to the Rarefaction Cannon and the terrifying Unclear Bomb...\n\"We went dark: we extinguished the prow-light, even the running-lights. We stalked the Pirate-Poet, the lap of the waves on our hull and the the soft throbbing of our engines the only hint of our presence. Her lookout heard them at the last.\"\nThe Unterzee is a realm of sombre beauty. The false-stars in the cavern roof glimmer: the lamps of the cities below answer them. It is always night. See the shapes of islands loom through the gloom, the distant glows that might be phosphorescent seaweed or running-lights or the eyes of monsters, and turn to pursue or avoid. You'll turn up your lights to see farthest, or let them sink low to escape detection... or to become the hunter.\nLike everything else in Sunless Sea, light has its cost. Turn your light to its highest setting and you'll see farthest; but not only will you alert more monsters, you'll burn through your fuel faster, and risk leaving yourself adrift at the mercy of the tideless black.\nUnterzee mood concept\n\"So here you are, boilers stoked, hold awash with chittering crab-things. Your scarred first officer pipes a melancholy tune. Your ship's surgeon strops her razors to a hearty stropping-song. Phosphorescent tentacles uncoil in dark waters. Cast off. Don't look back.\"\nEvery foray out from London may end in shipwreck. Stay among the near isles, where the seas are known and the rewards are small, and you'll be fine if you're careful. As you head farther out, you'll need to balance your remaining supplies against the tantalising possibilities lying just out of reach, and the lurking dangers. If you want to cross the Unterzee and explore the unknown ports there, you'll need to find staging posts and safe routes - perhaps use ocean currents to speed your progress and make best use of your provisions.\n\"We broke into the galley today and found appalling things: corpse-candles, graven images, and the mortal remains of Able Seaman Ayrton, rendered partially to stock. The wretched cook would only cackle: You liked him better salted...\"\nKeep your crew's Hunger low with Supplies; keep their Terror low by limiting their exposure to horrors, allowing them shore leave, encountering wonders. If Hunger and Terror rise too high, the fun begins: stories of quarrels, despair, nightmares, madness, cannibalism and mutiny. Too much of this, and you'll lose your crew, your captain and your ship.\n\"We sighted Mt Nomad again today, still afloat but listing, her dark glass flanks scored and pitted from the cannon-fire in our previous encounter. This will be the last battle. This monster has harrowed the seas too long.\"\nYou'll meet pirates, monsters, ill-tempered customs officers, many of them interchangeable. But some of your enemies will flee from you, to change and grow as part of a larger arc until you can finally hunt them down. Perhaps they'll become your obsession: perhaps you'll risk everything to end them.\nThe dreaded Angler Crab\nEverything in Sunless Sea counts towards your personal story. We're using an offline version of our award-winning StoryNexus engine from Fallen London to build and recombine chunks of story, giving you a non-linear, choice-heavy, personalised experience. It'll take dozens of games to explore all the sub-plots, grand arcs, alternatives, mysteries, relationships and romances in the game.\n\"This is the day I finally listened to my dreams. I climbed the ladder to the attic. The box was there in the farthest corner. In the dream I had opened it and the crows had poured out like a black fog, but of course that was nonsense... there was nothing in there but the map, and the lamp. And my father's sword.\"\nThe Unterzee eats ships and their captains. Your character will die (or disappear, or lose her mind, or be hollowed out and filled with candle-wax and haunt a cliff-top chapel)... but their legacy may survive. Your next character may be a daughter, a student, or just someone who found an old ship's log in a curiosity shop. The risk of death remains, but that sting of frustration that makes you rage-uninstall will be lessened. You'll build up your own story across generations of zailors who braved the Unterzee and lost - or won...\nAs an Unterzee captain, you\u2019re not limited to one role. You can be a privateer and a merchant, but also an explorer and a scientist \u2013 as much Charles Darwin as Francis Drake. Consequently, the riches of the Neath are more than mushroom-brandy, spider-silk, drowning-pearls. Those riches are also charts, secrets, journal entries, and the world\u2019s hastiest and most terrified sketch of the Bound Shark. And you\u2019re going to need riches \u2013 not just to improve your ship, but to cover the cost of supplies and fuel and repairs. That\u2019s part of the \u2018survival\u2019 element. And Sunless Sea being the story-driven game it is, you don\u2019t know when your hold might be more exciting than you\u2019d expected. If you carry zoological specimens from a Benthic College encampment, they might escape. If you carry sealed shipments from Hell, will you risk cracking them open to unravel their secrets?\nThere\u2019s more to the Unterzee than the surface. Travel beneath the waves and wax-winds or descend to the sea-bottom in a zubmarine; or keep your surface-ship, but send landing parties in diving-suits down below. Explore coral colonies, the Fluke-Legions, and the Drowning Feast.\nThis stretch goal adds submarines, or more correctly, zubmarines. We\u2019ll peel away the surface layer of the Unterzee and let you manoeuvre and explore in the depths. It\u2019s darker down here, but the rewards can be great. Of course, you\u2019ve just exchanged the more familiar perils of the surface for the misbred, pale-skinned, bulging-eyed vileness of the sea-floor\u2026\nIf we achieve this goal, we expect to deliver it as an expansion to the main game at the end of the third quarter of 2014. Anyone backing Sunless Sea at the Zailor (\u00a310) level or above will get the expansion free of charge.\nDirigibles are expensive. But they\u2019re fun. The fuel will cost you, but you can travel above the sea in safety. Well, mostly safety: there\u2019s the feral bat-flocks, the moon-misers, the blood-stealing Mosquito Zeppelins \u2026 \nWith this stretch goal, we\u2019ll add Dirigibles to allow you to explore the roof of the Neath \u2013 the vast cavern that contains the Unterzee. Fuel keeps range short, so this won\u2019t spoil the fun of exploring the far archipelagoes, but the roof has its own dangers and its own rewards. Buzz New Newgate prison. Gather glim from the carapaces of creatures from outside the sky. Refuel at the stalagmite-citadels of the Starved Men: assist them in their desperate battles against the infection overtaking the roof\u2026\nIf we achieve this goal, we expect to deliver it as an expansion to the main game at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Anyone backing Sunless Sea at the Zailor (\u00a310) level or above will get the expansion free of charge.\n--\nWant to know more about Sunless Sea?

They need your help!\nWe're hard at work developing The Mysterious Cities of Gold: Secret Paths on the Wii U, 3DS, iPad and iPhone, and it's on track for a release this fall (fingers crossed!).\nUnfortunately, and to be completely and candidly honest, our initial plans were to release the game in French only; the new season is directed in France, and airing only in French-speaking territories, where it's the most popular.\nBut since we announced the game, we've been swamped with emails, and messages on various social networks, asking us to consider both an international release, and a PC version.\nThose requests came from all over the world: UK, US, Germany, Latin America, Lebanon \u2013 we simply didn't anticipate it would raise such a global interest, and already had focused our development budget on the game itself.\nThat's where you come in.\nMore than 30 years after enthralling a whole generation, the cult French and Japanese anime show \"Mysterious Cities of Gold\" (also sometimes known as \"Esteban, Child of the Sun\") has been resurrected this year for a second season currently airing on leading TV channels in French-speaking countries.\nThis rebirth was mainly the result of a Facebook-led campaign driven by over 100.000 French fans, and all the activities they organized to keep the show alive in everyone's mind. \nToday, we turn towards this vibrant and international community of die-hard fans to help us make our Mysterious Cities of Gold video game project a little bit bigger than we could make it on our own.\nAs huge fans of the show since its first broadcast 30 years ago, we're currently completing our dream video game based on the Mysterious Cities of Gold universe, characters and story.\nFans, we heard you! So here we are, throwing a Kickstarter to gauge more precisely how many of you want this to happen and just how bad you really want it.\nIf our goal of 30.000 US$ in pledges is met, we commit to:\n\u2714 Develop a High Quality Port of the game for the PC.\n\u2714 Fully localize the game in English, including voice-acting dubbing of cinematic scenes and dialog.\n\u2714 Subtitle the game in Spanish.\n++ STRETCH GOAL: If we exceed our initial funding goal by 10.000$, we will add five more languages as subtitles: Italian, German, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese and Swedish. Polish will also be added as subtitle option for free, after a professional translator fan volunteered for the job. ++\n(Because it requires a lot of modifications to the code, we cannot add Arabic as an extra language at the normal rate.)\nOur game will be perfectly faithful to the art and soul of the Mysterious Cities of Gold, featuring original music and even cinematic excerpts from the show (which is actually one of the reasons we\u2019re here ^^). The video game will basically retrace the new adventures of Esteban, Tao and Zia in an interactive manner.\nWe have identified the Mysterious Cities of Gold as a universe that many nostalgic fans love from back in their youth, and would now like to enjoy and share with their children (at least those who have turned into parents). \"Trans-generational\u201d is the word we use in French to describe that phenomenon. \"Family entertainment\" is probably how Disney-Pixar would call it stateside...\nIt is our firm intent to respect this and therefore, we have taken extra care in making sure that the game is not only accessible and playable by players of all ages, but also enjoyable on different levels so that kids, parents and even more \"core\" gamers have playing modes that they will find compelling.\nBut enough chitchat, here is the factual information about the game:\nThe basics : The game is a balanced mix of puzzle and infiltration, in top-down perspective, where you alternatively control one of the three heroes (Esteban, Tao and Zia) and combine their abilities to go through the levels. Influences include Lost Vikings or, more recently, The Cave.\n\nThe controls : We offer two main control schemes. A touch-screen approach for kids and mobile gamers, and, on the consoles, a regular, direct stick and buttons control for people who like traditional controls. Of course, the Wii U version offers both; and for a PC version, we'll be using point & click based, mouse and keyboard controls.\n\nThe story : We tried to be as faithful as possible to the story-line. The game starts at the exact place where Esteban, Tao and Zia, begin their journey in search for the far eastern City of Gold. Each level is a transcription of the places they explore in the series, and, between the main groups of levels, cinematic cut-scenes from the animated series guide the player through the story arc.\n\nThe universe : We based all of our work on the actual assets of the series. Character models, enemies, props, places, animations : for all of these, we started from the graphics that were used in the animated show and transformed them into game assets. All this work has been done hand in hand with the series director and creative director, with, once again, only one goal in mind : loyalty to the spirit and the atmosphere of the show.\n\nThe music : Because music has always been one of the key elements in the Mysterious Cities of Gold universe (starting with its theme song), it was unthinkable for us not to include it in our game. Every environment of the game has its own musical theme, coming directly from the series.\n\nGet Bonus ! While we think beating all the puzzles and infiltration phases of the game will be a challenge in and of itself, we didn't forget those power players among you who wish to explore absolutely everything or do perfect runs. So we added collectibles, hidden chests and challenges like finishing a level without being detected by the enemies or under a certain amount of time. Those challenges unlock original artworks from the TV series, showcased in a gallery.\n\nThe numbers : 30 levels, about 6 hours of game-play in average, around 20 different puzzle mechanics that combine into hundreds of possibilities, 17 different environments faithfully rendering the places which the heroes of the series go through, 26 cinematic scenes. \n\n\nExcept as noted below, all physical rewards are expected to be delivered by December, 2013. Digital rewards will ship as soon as they are ready, starting the week after the successful end of the campaign.\nThe actual game is what this is all about. A digital copy of The Mysterious Cities of Gold: Secret Paths is included for all pledges above 15$, if you want the Nintendo Wii U, Nintendo 3DS or PC version of the game. The iOS version of the game changes hands for 12$. Delivery of digital copies on Nintendo Wii U, Nintendo 3DS and iOS will be handled through individual coupon codes systems available in both the eShop and the App Store.\nA Kickstarter-exclusive Digital Art Book composed by our art director will also be included as a perk for all pledges above 30$. The Digital Art Book contains exclusive work-in-progress pieces.\nYour name will appear in the \"Special Thanks\" credits section of the game if you care to pledge more than 30$. Even more bragging rights for you!\nJust can't wait to get your hands on this? Want to feel special about playing this game that you help make a little bit before everybody else?

Passionate about games, she pretty much blackmailed C\u00e9dric Littardi to be in charge of the project, when he brought up the idea of turning the series into a video game. She has been pouring all of her energy towards turning this great vision into reality ever since.\nCedric Littardi : One of the instrumental people in the discovery of Japanese anime and manga culture in Europe through the Kaz\u00e9 anime label that he had founded as early as 1993 to spread distribution of a multitude of famous series. He also handled the distribution of the Mysterious Cities of Gold DVDs in French until last year, when he left his company. As a child, he had never missed an episode of the show. He was the one that came up with the idea of bringing it to the video game universe and took the necessary time to convince the creators of the show to make that leap after all those years.\nYnnis Interactive : A new indie video game publishing company with a team of five and active in production and distribution of indie games with strong \"Japanese culture\" or \"trans-media\" components. The first successful game the company participated in was Strike Suit Zero, a previous successful project on Kickstarter.\nThe whole team would like to rise to the occasion and send millions of thanks to Blue Spirit Animation, Movie Plus, Jean Chalopin, Bernard Deyries, Studio Pierrot and all the great teams that worked on this awesome saga!\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nHelp us spread the word!

On her travels to get clean water from a local pump, she walks through the maze of dark and dingy alleyways with poor sanitation. She witnesses 'back street' butchers and gets into a troubled situation when she is meters away from a serious fight involving triad gang leaders- the mafia of the slum. Worried she has been spotted by the leaders the girl seeks the sanctuary of the roof tops - the only area in the slum where you are guaranteed natural sunlight.\nI am a 'one member team' working on an animation short for the third year of my degree. The animation will be a mixture of 2-D (digitally drawn characters) and 3-D environments (The Walled City).\nI am currently in the pre-production phase (researching about the Walled City, life drawing and producing anatomy studies etc).  \nResearch\nMain character inspiration!\nExample of the 3-D effects I will use for the establishing shot and other exterior shots.\nThe interior backgrounds will have a similar feel to my Goldilocks animation \u2013 mostly dark and eerie with lots of textures.\nI am a budding animator with hopes of getting into the industry after I graduate next year.

I have already written about this in length in my sketchbook. I have a big task to fulfil and every element of this project is time consuming from the concept art to the production of 3-D scenes and 2-D texture.

Ian and Greg's Kickstarter campaign can be found here and my openly soppy/cringe worthy comment can be found lurking around the comments section. The book is currently in shops in Hong Kong and will be released in the UK, America, Australia, etc., in the coming months. After waiting for months wondering if my work had made the cut, I figured that ironically, it would be quicker to find out for myself in Hong Kong. As luck would have it, I was due to fly to Hong Kong anyway (not just for the book! The trip was arranged before any of this came into fruition and Hak Nam Henney was merely a vision). Isn\u2019t it amazing how things work out sometimes? Anyway, thanks to the help of my friends, we tracked down a bookshop and after showing a member of staff the front cover on my phone \u2013 they instantly walked me over to the book.

Oh sure, they know I\u2019m the \u201cloyal servant\u201d to his holiness Sherlock Holmes, but that\u2019s only what he makes me put in those damn journals I write for him! I\u2019m here to tell things from my side of the story. The right side. The side that shows Sherlock for what he really is: an oafish, pompous, deceiving, righteous, attention-hog, controlling snollygoster!\nAhem. Well. Yes. I seem to have gotten myself into a bit of a fluster here. He does that to me, you know. It\u2019s a lot to put up with. Yes, I respect the man. When it comes to people, well... I suspect you may already know what he is like in that particular arena.\nBut I am here to set it straight! Put it on the up and up. The straight and simple facts. To prove once and for all that Sherlock Holmes does NOT solve his cases via cunning intellect alone. He does it with help. MY help. I\u2019m going to tell you the real story of a case that began with a runaway train, and ended with me finally telling him that it was, in fact, Elementary, My Dear Holmes.\n          \u201cAh ha. Watson really should do a better job of hiding these notebooks. A story where he is the hero? Laughable. This shall be amusing.\u201d\n                              - S.\n          \u201cWhere has my blasted notebook gone? Damnit. I bet he found it. I\u2019ll need to start again, and hide it better this time.

Like Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle and Grim Fandango, we\u2019re making a game where you once again suffer from the terrible infinite pockets affliction, and are forced to store everything from a whisky bottle to a weird painting about intelligent peaches for further bizarre combining use. Solve puzzles that we\u2019ve done our best to not be incomprehensible to anyone who isn\u2019t a game developer! Obviously, using that gnome plus a watermelon on the revolving door will create an interdimensional portal! Obviously.\nWatson. John Watson. Who? Exactly.\nIn Elementary, My Dear Holmes, you play as John Watson - doctor, soldier, and adventurer! - as he quests around turn-of-the-20th-century Europe, facing mysteries while danger abounds! A cryptic message from Afghanistan, a lost heiress, a cunning noble family, and the birth of an organization that will come to be known as The Illuminati are just some of the elements that you, as John Watson - doctor, soldier and adventurer! - will be facing. We have all your favourite Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s characters, including Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, Inspector Lestrade, and Professor Moriarty, plus a cast of unique, eccentric and sometimes downright dodgy new characters!\nWe've got them all!\nEven Old Man #2\nWhat we\u2019ve also got is a twisting story in the true Holmesian fashion, but with John Watson as the lead. Tired of being delegated to a mere journal writer, Watson decides that it is his turn for the spotlight, no matter what Holmes thinks! Set on a runaway train in the classic Sir Conan Doyle era, Elementary, My Dear Holmes is designed to be a loving reference to the intricate plots of old, while staying true to its witty Adventure Game roots.\nSherlock \"I Got This\" Holmes.\nGot opinions you want to share? Join the conversation at #Watson\n          \u201cVery intriguing. Watson does seem intent on making himself out to be the hero. Maybe it is finally time for me to test his skills and see if he is up to snuff...\u201d\n                              - S.\n          \u201cNow... where to really start. Ah, yes. The train. It was always about the train, wasn\u2019t it? No, no. Wait. It started that day in Sherlock\u2019s parlour when we were discussing the case. Listening to that windbag going on yet again about his heroics...\u201d\n                              - W.\nAdventure game fans have had an amazing year. A genre that had been given a death sentence has risen again through fan-funded projects, and inspired us to do it ourselves. We really want to put together a game that speaks to the genre we love, and Kickstarter is naturally a great way to put our pitch video out there and see if you would like to play the game we want to make.\nAdditionally, Kickstarter gives us a lot of freedom, and the ability to utilize many voices to help us make our game better. Player feedback has become increasingly important to projects, and we\u2019d really like to make a community around Elementary, My Dear Holmes to take advantage of that input. How we believe that Crowdsourcing should not begin and end with crowdfunding, but should be all inclusive: Crowd-Developing!\nAnd because the point-and-click genre is one where you quite literally want to have your cake and eat it too, the fine folks at Ouya have this super awesome deal... well, let us put it like this:\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar if we raise a minimum of $50,000, so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for six months\u2014no matter what. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv.\nSounds awesome, right? It is! It\u2019s like, if you\u2019re giving us $10, you\u2019re really giving us $20! You get to feel as good about yourself as if you\u2019d given twice whatever you actually do give! We\u2019re all fans of the open-source nature of the Ouya, and when we saw this opportunity, we knew we had to act. And after the six months, we\u2019ll continue on and port it to Android, iOS, PC and Mac!\n          \u201cAh yes. The day Watson and I discussed  the case, so he could start to write it down for the next book. So, that was when this all began...\u201d\n                              - S.\n          \u201cThe young girl dropped a note. This cipher! I\u2019d seen it before. Afghanistan? How would one like her possibly have something like this? I knew that only I, and I alone, could decipher it.\u201d\n                              - W.\nYou backed a project on Kickstarter and it promised the world and then got delayed for months on end? Bummer. We\u2019ve been there too. That\u2019s why we\u2019re running a tight ship and have a whipcracker of a Project Manager who ensures we deliver on time and on budget.\nRemember that time when Sherlock made Watson dress up like a woman to seduce a German Arms Dealer? He\u2019s like that. It\u2019s scary what he makes us do.\nOur plans, with successful funding, is to launch on the Ouya by March of 2014, followed by a release on all other platforms by September of 2014.\n(This is Kickstarter, so we don't need Sherlock or Watson to figure it out!)\nWhat we\u2019re looking for today are backers to support our project. This could be by sharing our page on social media, telling your friends about it, or by selling your house and giving us all your money. Our goal is $50,000, and every penny helps.

We\u2019ll add significantly improved puzzles and an extended story. Matching puzzles? Pshaw! We\u2019ll have... complicated matching puzzles! In addition, we\u2019ll be able to increase the story range by roughly 50%, adding in sections at historical locations in England, Paris and Germany. We will also flesh out the inventory and flavor text segments of the game.\n$125,000. We\u2019ll include professional level voice acting for every character in the game. That weird guy in the train bar who has four lines? He\u2019ll have a voice, and we promise it won\u2019t be some random dude off the street we shove a microphone and a script at. PLUS, you want languages? We\u2019ve got languages! We\u2019ll release the full game in German (subtitles AND voice overs), plus subtitles in Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Italian.\n$150,000. We\u2019ll include an encylopedia with the game on Sherlock Holmes lore, characters, and all of the canon stories, accessible within the game!\n$175,000. We\u2019ll finally get to add in that coveted action sequence that made Sam wonder how the devil we\u2019d be able to do it! Watson shooting plates! Amazing.\n$200,000. We extend our scope to the Moon! With new set pieces, characters and an expanded scene where Watson takes some funky mushrooms and engages on a psychedelic trip through time. Thanks, Tim Schafer! Sorry you weren\u2019t able to include this in Full Throttle.\n$250,000. All of the above + we get a full-time documentation crew that records our progress as we develop the game. All backers get a copy of the finished movie. The rest of the world has to pay for it!\nYou love rewards. We love rewards. Everybody loves rewards! That's why we've got a bunch of them over on the (top) right to express our thanks to you for helping us fund this project! Go ahead and indulge!\nWe're going to be building this in Unity, which means porting is over is as easy as ABC. Oh, 123!\nAnd if we get Greenlit, Steam too!\n          \u201cWho was she? This young girl needed our help. My help. Not our help. Blasted Sherlock was getting in my way at every angle, and there was something funny going on this train.\u201d\n                              - W.\nWe\u2019ve got a team of industry experienced professionals ready to lay it all on the line for this project. Like Watson, you may not have heard of them, but they\u2019re the brains behind some serious brawn.\nThe two idea guys behind this project are Sam Chandola and Max Tennessen. They\u2019re a lot funnier than they sound. Trust me. Almost as funny looking!  Ha! No! Put down the stick, Sam. I didn\u2019t mean it!\nSam has extensive experience working on video games at companies like VirtuosGames, where he worked with Electronic Arts, Activision, Ubisoft and (RIP) OMGPOP :(. He\u2019s always boasting that he \u201cProduced apps for the United Nations\u201d or something like that. He now heads up Victory Square Games and is a big-headed jerk who always makes everyone work way harder than they should (We need our beauty sleep, after all!). He\u2019s also asking me, again, if I included the fact he worked with the United Nations. We get it Sam. No, writers don\u2019t get you coffee.\nMax is a producer and comedian with over two million YouTube views, mostly on videos of him talking about comic books. He\u2019s such a nice guy that made a video game music album that raised over $15 000 - and get this, he donated all of it to charity! His less charitable work has included web series, short films, music videos, and more. He has extensive digital marketing experience, and if this whole project goes south, we\u2019re blaming it on him.\nAll our game art is done by the abrasive, offensive, and incredibly talented Stefano Marrone. This guy has studied and practiced animation all over the globe, from Milan, to Vancouver, to London, and everywhere he goes people will remember him (both for his amazing art and... unique personality). He currently works as animation director and producer at the Nucco Brain animation studio in London, probably twirling his amazing moustache.\nOur writing staff includes the wonderful, handsome and incredibly talented Bob Edwards who is not unlike Sherlock Holmes when it comes to video game writing. (We told Sam we took that part out, but we\u2019re going to leave it in. He\u2019s too busy trying to convince someone down on the street to do voice acting for us to double check this). Bob is currently a Content Writer for Interdimensional Games, whose successful Kickstarter for \u201cConsortium\u201d back in May earned a little over $70,000, and is set to release on Steam and GoG next month.\nAnd finally, we have Riley Godard, who knows his 0s from his 1s and will be mixing and matching them in a completely arbitrary fashion to come up with what he calls code. One never knows what goes off in that crazy head of his - mostly because he never takes his hat off - and he likes to make up complex mathematical equations on our whiteboard to pretend he is busy. Before haunting us here at Victory Square Games, Riley was annoying the good folks over at Fathom Interactive, where he worked on Kaia's Quest, a puzzle adventure game for iOS and Android.\nThe staff at Victory Square Games pretending to be happy.\n          \u201cWas Watson ready for this? No. I mustn\u2019t let him think that I\u2019m taking control. I\u2019ll need to keep watch discreetly. From where? Aha. That plant. Perfect. He\u2019ll never know I\u2019m here.\u201d\n                              - S.\n          \u201cThe train was barreling out of control. I knew I\u2019d need to think fast if I wanted to figure out how to get the brakes engaged! Damnit! Sherlock would know this. But...I don\u2019t need him. Not this time!\u201d\n                              - W.\nElementary, My Dear Holmes is a game that we\u2019d love to play. We\u2019re pouring our heart and soul into the project, and we want to bring as many people along on our journey as possible. The game design industry is changing, and we really believe that the voice of backers and fans is integral to the process of making a truly great game.\nSherlock Holmes and John Watson are some of the longest living characters in our popular culture, and still incredibly relevant. Interpretations of their characters are facing a golden age right now, and the same has been said of the resurgence of adventure games. To be able to combine these two is a dream come true, while at the same time, applying a unique and new perspective to both the characters, and the genre.\nWe're listening!\nGrab your Tentacle, Golden Monkey or Motorcycle and gear up for a new Adventure Game that will stretch the limits of your imagination (without time traveling mushrooms).\nFind us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/victorysquaregames\nand on Twitter @vsquareg www.twitter.com/vsquareg\n\n          \u201cWatson?

encounter charts, maps, and more. The digital boxed also includes two notable exclusives: the RED AEGIS Hacker's Guide and RED AEGIS Unleashed (see descriptions below). Finally, the Digital Boxed Set also grants you access to the Red Aegis Online Tools (character builder, lineage designer, and so on).\nRED AEGIS Hacker's Guide: This accessory contains system \"hacks\" for incorporating RED AEGIS into other game systems. Initial target is the Pathfinder roleplaying game, with additional systems added with stretch goals.\nRED AEGIS Unleashed: An epic-sized adventure path that spans 9 time periods (through stretch goals). Each adventure is accompanied by a novelette that ties into the adventure arc. The first module will be penned by Brian R. James and Ed Greenwood.\nRED AEGIS Tactics: A tactical skirmish game that is designed for 2-6 players. Players construct an army using everything from axe-wielding barbarians, to spell-slinging archmages--from incredulous biker gang vagabonds, to futuristic space soldiers. This is truly the battle of all ages. Construct your army, deploy to the fields of battle, and defend the prestige of your legacy.\nPyralithos\nJoin us in designing a tabletop roleplaying experience that you've never seen before!\nRED AEGIS is an alternative take on the traditional roleplaying game. This is not just a game about fighting monsters and pillaging ancient ruins for treasure (though we have that too!).\nRED AEGIS is an epic, millennia-spanning, strategic roleplaying game where you claim your birthright, rally loyal followers to your cause, and forge a dynasty to stand the test of time.\nIn RED AEGIS you command successive generations of heroes from the setting's ancient past to the far future\u2013from axe-wielding barbarians to space marines packing gravity hammers, and everything in between.\nRED AEGIS is about making difficult choices. These decisions will impact not only your tribe's future, but also the fate of your descendants and the world they inhabit.\nWe're excited to share with you our vision of epic storytelling. Vorpal Games is devoted to hiring the best talent in the industry to make that vision a reality.\nMacuilanx\nThe Game\nIn addition to familiar tropes you'd expect from playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons\u00ae, RED AEGIS is also infused with millennia-spanning tactical strategy, inspired by games like Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae and X-COM\u00ae.\nThe story of a RED AEGIS campaign is revealed over ten gaming sessions, where you command successive generations of heroes from the world\u2019s ancient past to the far future. \nIn RED AEGIS all heroes die. Whether on the field of battle or of old age, your character will eventually die. At the start of each game session you play a new character, a descendant of your starting character\u2019s bloodline.\nIn RED AEGIS your character abilities are not tied to the individual hero you are playing. Rather, your skills and powers are inherited from and infused with your bloodline, passed from one generation to the next.\nLEARN ABOUT GAME PLAY\nOne of our major motivations with our gameplay experience is to have hundreds, if not thousands, of years pass between each session. Your character in the new session will be a descendant of your past character and will inherent characteristics of the applied dynasty. For example; if in the past your ancestor slayed the great Minotaur lord Kogulous, you would not only gain in-game story-based rewards for such a feat, you would also earn additional Prestige to use in the construction of your descendants in following sessions. Prestige is a value pool that is increased based upon the actions and exploits of your character. One might view this as a type of experience pool, and they wouldn\u2019t be incorrect. Different players would earn at different rates, depending on their actions in the campaign, as well as other factors that we\u2019re not ready to release just yet. In addition, we are implementing a dynamic system by which the storyteller/dungeon master/game master might change from session to session. We refer to this as the Arbiter. The Arbiter will be a role that players will aspire to become, due to the increase in Prestige and other story-based rewards. This process is governed by an element of the game that revolves around the RED AEGIS itself.\nAnother interesting aspect you may enjoy: as your descendants traverse the timeline your characters will be defined not by equipment (as is in traditional tabletop RPGS), rather by your followers. Followers will have specific skill-sets and professions that will aid your character, and will help define them as your dynasty evolves. This is going to allow for an immense amount of customization, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re eager to show off once completed.\nIkomatshe\nThe Products\nRED AEGIS Player's Guide: An introductory guide to the Red Aegis Roleplaying Game, featuring a complete, learn-as-you-go adventure and a printable character sheet for your custom bloodline.\nRED AEGIS RPG Corebook: A lovingly crafted, hardcover sourcebook with high quality maps and illustrations scattered throughout. The book will contain complete rules to build your bloodline, as well as guidance for designing custom monsters and encounters set in the RED AEGIS universe.\nSample Products (Not Final)\nThe System\nThe RED AEGIS Roleplaying Game is powered by the LGS (Loremaster Game System\u2122) \u2013a customizable tabletop game engine that supports multiple genres and play-styles.\nUnlike most other systems, the LGS encourages the selection of a new game master for each session, allowing for a truly unique experience whereby the actions of the game master are encoded into your shared story!\nHoarthostat\nThe World\nThe starting region characters will explore during the game's first age is known to the indigenous tribes as Namarune. This is the cradle of civilization in the Red Aegis setting, and it serves as the region where your tribe will take its formative steps toward building a dynasty and an empire to stand the test of time.\nThe tribes of Namarune have always feared the world anchors\u2013those crimson, impossibly massive stone monoliths that have stood, inscrutable, since the dawn of time. To approach one was forbidden and taboo. To ignore the omens would be to invite the wrath of the gods down upon yourself and your tribe. \nYet despite the warnings, each generation witnessed a foolish few that would make a pilgrimage to one the ancient monoliths in defiance of reason and self-preservation. The few that returned, if any, would often ramble of unimaginable wonders and lament of god-like powers wielded ever so briefly. Many of these individuals came to be shunned by their superstitious clan mates and driven into exile, while a rare few would be raised up and heralded as hero-kings. \nDuring the first arc of the campaign, the player characters gather at one of the fabled monoliths, where they are imbued with fantastic powers and a mandate for greatness.\nWhich destiny will befall you when heeding the call of the Red Aegis?\nNamrune: Age of Monoliths (click image to view map animation)\n\"No civilization lasts forever, and a society is most treacherous when facing its extinction. Countless inscrutable ruins dot the countryside of Namarune, like ichor-filled sores on a plague-ridden corpse. It\u2019s curious that the most magnificent of these fallen structures often rest within sight of a world anchor\u2014those most holy of stone monuments from which our own civilization was given rise.\"\nReward Add-Ons\nYou can add on individual copies of the Red Aegis RPG to any pledge that already is shipping a physical book by manually adding the appropriate amount on the pledge page:\n+$15 for each additional softcover Red Aegis Player's Guide.

If you have any other suggestions, please add them to the comments.\nWant to be a Game Designer?\nAt the start of this Kickstarter we said \u201cJoin us in designing a tabletop roleplaying experience that you've never seen before!\u201d and we meant it!\nWe\u2019re sincere in our desire to solicit feedback from the roleplaying community during every stage of the design. But contributing to online polls and filling out beta surveys only goes so far. For a few of you, that sort of impersonal feedback is not enough. You want to be more directly in contact with the designers and help shape the mechanics or lore of the game.\nBackers at the Associate Game Designer level will be given a small section of the Corebook to design. Other RPG Kickstarters may allow you a token task like naming an NPC, or a city, or some such, but this opportunity is much grander than that. Who knows, if you complete your assignment as tasked and on deadline, you may even find additional, paying contracts in your future.\nThe extra cost associated with this reward level is really for the one-on-one mentoring the backer will have with an established game designer, who will offer advice, critique design work, and so on. There should be no pressure for a backer to turn over a perfect design.

Squinting your eyes under the dim light, you can make up the improbable form of a pig with wings. It is glorious. \u201cWe are Pigasus. Mighty game developers\u201d, asserts the airborne swine, \u201cAnd this here is Adventurezator\u201d.\n\u201cAdventurezator is an adventure game. Well, sort of. You see, we all love adventure games (as all sentient beings in their right minds should) but you must admit that even the best of them lack something very special: good old YOU.\u201d\n\u201cIn Adventurezator, you not only play an ever-renewed pile of brilliantly designed point-and-click adventures: you actually get to design your own, and publish them too! The best part? You can do that without all that boring programming, or math. It\u2019s all very technical, but (if we had to put it in layman\u2019s terms) it works like a very fancy cable connected directly to your brilliance.\u201d\nYou stare at the flying mammal for a while, barely containing your happiness. But still, you could use a little more detailed information. Something like a description and a gameplay video. Maybe with reward levels. Or a teaser video. Pigasus opens its inventory and gladly gives all of this to you, and more.\nStarting with this here Intro Teaser, which was entirelly made with with the Cutscene Creator, within the Adventurezator itself! How cool is that?\n____________________________________________________________________\nThat's all nice and sweet, \"but I still don't know what the games will actually play like\" you may say. Fear not, backer, we've got you covered:\n____________________________________________________________________\nIn this world of ever-shrinking attention spans, and an ever-growing amount of crap on the internets, we are told time and again by the so-called carriers of wisdom that our videos must be short and our descriptions to the point, or our potential backers will soon look away. Nonsense, we cry! They are here to decide on spending real money! They are here to help develop an amazing game - no, millions of amazing user-created amazing games! They are here to write history! It's our responsibility to show them everything they need to know! (Well that, and the fact that the Adventurezator is not easy to demonstrate in 3 minutes, and we are not \"camera-ready [golden] sex gods\" like Tim Schafer, makes us want to show you a bit more of what we have)\nSo we present you with a short video of the Sandbox Tools of the Adventurezator:\n____________________________________________________________________\nOn the single player campaign When Pigs Fly, you will play the adventures of Edmund, the human-turned-pigman while he tries to become a human again, and his sidekick Zookwinkle the Gnome. In this tale of courage, intrigue, betrayal (and dumbness) - you and our pseudo-heroes will face many challenges and re-write history while they are at it: meet Isaac Newton, the Seven Dwarfs, and even Weeping Angels (holy crap!). Your actions will decide the fate of many, with 3 different endings (maybe 4), some of which will make you laugh, others will make you cry - okay that was probably exaggerated, but they will make you smile and re-play some levels to see the other outcomes, we guarantee!\n____________________________________________________________________\nHere a nifty image to help you visualize exactly what you are getting with each reward tier:\nReward Tiers\nAnd here are the Tees and Poster designs we have to far.

We hope the Adventurezator will have a rather long 'shelf'-life, and plan on developing several content packs and expansions after release. If we reach any expansion pack funding via this kickstarter, all backers that got a digital copy will also get such expansions when they are released for free.\nMobile Client: We are also planning on porting the game (without the sandbox and editing tools) to Android and IOs, to enable you to enjoy that infinite well of adventure games on the go - as well as have your friends and family play the adventures you make on the cheap (we still don't know how cheap). We have already taken steps since the beginning of development to make sure this can be done without too much trouble (hopefully...).

Each card has a distinct ability that can dramatically help your score if used wisely.  \nIn each hand there is usually one perfect word that will use all your letters \u2013 you just need to find it!   Flexibility comes from two elements: a \u2018common\u2019 vowel and wild letter cards.  The 'common' vowel can be used by all players and changes throughout the game.

So that's a bonus.\"\nJeff Cannata (@jeffcannata) of the Totally Rad Show:\n\"I love word games and I love deck builders - now I can get both in one game! Paperback is a blast to play, and much easier to get into for my less geeky friends than many of the other fantasy-themed deck building games.\"\nEric R. Burgess of Boardgame Babylon:\n\"Paperback is a terrific game for just about anyone. Serious gamers can geek out on the clever use of deckbuilding mechanisms in a classic word game. Casual players can enjoy the easy gameplay and creativity they express in their word choices each turn. Families can delight in the well-disguised educational value and very obvious fun Paperback provides. Our family and friends have had a great time playing Paperback and I know you will, too.\"\nAn extensive review from Father Geek:\n\"I like it. I like it a lot. It\u2019s the only word game I have played in a VERY LONG TIME that had me thinking on multiple levels. I really enjoyed the deck-building aspect as it challenged me to buy cards that I knew I could use with existing Letter cards for mega points. That is actually a lot harder than it seems because every Letter card is only as good as the other Letter cards that are in your hand. I also had to be creative when it came to maximizing the card abilities. If I did it right, my simple three-letter word scored massive points, which felt great. I think this is the closest thing to a \u201cgamer\u2019s word game\u201d I have ever seen. The game play is engaging, the turns are quick, and everything I love about deck-building is seamlessly entwined with everything word gamers enjoy most, which is spelling words.\"\nMy friend, Tom Mason, enjoys the game so much that he decided Paperback needed to be on mobile devices.

I am a magician and I need your help!  Don't worry, I am not trapped in a box; quite the opposite in fact.\n\nI have several ideas I would like to put on Kickstarter, from trivia games and joke books, to magic kits and even a big box product.  I have so many crazy ideas it was difficult to decide on what project to do first, but in the end I decided to start with my childhood passion for mazes.\nMy interests vary from pop-up books, clean jokes, mazes, and optical illusions to strange trivia, science, and of course puzzles and magic, but it can all be boiled down to two words: \"Fun\" and \"Wonder\".\n\nMost of my anticipated projects combine both of these elements, and this one is no exception.  The project is simple: I will draw 52 unique mazes, each in the design of a playing card or poker card.  Every card is a maze that can be solved on its own going from corner pip to corner pip, plus the entire deck becomes one big maze going from card to card like a choose your own adventure book.\nThis is not a deck of cards themed to look like a maze.  This is 52 mazes, each drawn around a different playing card.  Every card can be solved on its own going from either corner pip you wish to the opposite one.  This makes it so that there is no backwards - some people try to solve mazes backwards because they are \"easier\", but not my mazes.  Each one is designed to be equally challenging both ways.\nBut wait, there's more...  Add the two jokers (featuring special guest boajes - more on that later) and now you have one big maze starting at one joker and ending with the other.  This maze takes you from card to card.Now, instead of working form pip to corner pip, you start at either corner you like and work your way to one of the center icons indicating your next card.\nFor example, you would start on the joker with the S and as you can see it has several paths, some ending in dead ends and others taking you to new cards.You might choose to go to the 2 of Diamonds and there you start at either corner you like and then find your way to the center. This takes you to the 6 of Spades and from there you would go to the 3 of Clubs where again you have a choice, and so on until you make it back to the joker with the F (for Finish) and make your way to the broken lightbulb.\n\nSome cards that have more than one option will lead you to dead ends, and others will result in an endless loop.  Your job is not only to navigate the mazes, which now use different paths than the 52 individual mazes, but to figure out what cards you should go to and what cards you should avoid.\n\nOh yeah, and if you like you could use the cards for card games or magic tricks.  But don't ever forget they are mazes that look like cards, not cards that look like mazes.\n\nI am doing all the artwork myself so the funding is all going to set up fees, printing, and shipping. \n\nI have drawn a handful of cards already and will draw more as the funding progresses.\n\nI will post updates every few days and occasionally with cards as I draw them \u2013 and I plan on drawing a card or two a day for the duration of the funding.\nThe cards will be printed by the US Playing Card Company on Bicycle stock with a magic finish.\nThe rewards are simple. You get the super fun deck of cards... I mean mazes, plus every backer will get a Kickstarter exclusive thank you maze as well.  And just for kicks, some of the higher backer levels have magic postcards included (you can read more about them in update #3).\n\nBy popular demand we have also added uncut sheets.This way you can have the entire maze right in front of you, or better yet on your wall.

Make sure to read the FAQ) PayPal contributions so far: $1,753\nGreetings!\nHello, I'm Lars Simkins. I'm a VFX artist by trade and an indie game developer by passion. I'm here to make that first person exploration/survival game we've all been dreaming about.\nI can still remember the first time I played Daggerfall. Yes, it was uglier than a monkey's armpit and controlled worse than a bumper car on a frozen lake. \nBut it also created the feeling of a world that lived on even after I'd stopped playing, and that feeling still sticks with me all these years later. A world where you could spend hours searching every pixelated nook and cranny. A world of potential. A world of EXPLORATION...\n...and then a Dragonling would chomp my face because I hadn't spent ten hours grinding in the easy regions. Arg! So frustrating! \nOther games have touched on that elusive feeling, especially Elder Scrolls and early Fallout games, but as fun as they are and as much as I love hardcore RPG mechanics, I've always dreamt of a game that emphasized exploration above all else.\nFRONTIERS is that game\nDalarna - North Tower View\nBenneton Gateway\nIn 2011 I finally decided if no one else was going to make it, I'd give it a try. For a full feature list check out the 'Game Features' section below. The trailer you see is the result of hundreds of hours of work and many thousands of dollars out of pocket.\nI'm close to finishing this thing. Another six months ought to do it. But it needs a push - and that's where you guys come in.\nI've taken stock of exactly where the game needs attention and I've already got a small team of hand-picked programmers & artists lined up to flesh out the content that will take this game from scrappy Alpha to polished final release. Finishing the base feature set will take $50,000, broken down roughly like so:\nBeyond the bare minimum to finish the game there are stretch goals. These are features that aren't strictly necessary, but which I scream, you scream, we all scream for because they're awesome and fun. As many of you know I've spent several weeks listening to and discussing your feature requests. Until now I've avoided making promises about most of them (especially when it came to co-op, the most requested feature of all), but after crunching the numbers I can finally tell you what we're shooting for, and what we need to make it happen:\nPayPal contributions so far: $1,753\nCan't pledge with Kickstarter / Amazon? You can use PayPal! All PayPal contributions are put towards stretch goals.\nMajor features\nHere are the base features that are already prototyped / in progress / completed in the alpha.\n\nOther cool features\nRelaxing Pace & Tone \u25cfThis isn't a hack & slash game or a deep, complex RPG. It's an exploration game, and the pace & tone reflect that. There are challenges and tense moments, but they're something you seek out, not something that's thrust upon you. And while there is some complexity to be found in the skills and weapons system, it's not overwhelming.\nImmersive Fast Travel \u25cf Unlike most open world RPGs where fast travel feels like teleportation, fast travel in FRONTIERS won't break your sense of immersion. You get to watch as your character makes the journey, with the sun rising & setting and the landscape rolling by. (To see it in action check out the Videos section.)\nSurvival & Hunting \u25cf Stay fed & warm using your Survival skills. Hunt live game with bows & traps, or gather nourishing mushrooms with book smarts. Eat it raw and damn the consequences or become a master chef and prepare filling recipes  The survival elements in FRONTIERS are engaging and fun without being oppressive. Whether you want to hunt, gather, buy or steal, you'll be able to find a play style that matches your tastes.\nMinecraft-Style Crafting \u25cf Craft almost any item in the game - from weapons to potions to chocolate cake - with grid-based blueprints.\nBeautiful Fantasy Soundtrack \u25cf Steve can't wait to get started on new tracks for each region. I don't even have to tell you how good he is, just give the trailer another listen.\nImmersion Settings \u25cf My goal is to let nothing break your immersion. Everyone has a different threshold for GUI intrusion - you'll be able to tweak sounds, your HUD, glowing paths, your crosshair and even object highlighting styles.\nI'm shooting for January 2014 - but take that with a grain of salt. Even the least ambitious, most experienced teams can slip behind schedule. And if we start hitting some of the bigger stretch goals all bets are off.\nThe good news is that a venn diagram between game dev and VFX has a lot of overlap, broadly speaking, and no skill carries over better than time management. After six years of delivering complex shots for TV shows & films with pressure cooker deadlines, I know a thing or two about creating high quality material with changing requirements under intense pressure. I've also got a great infrastructure for working with an offsite team.\nPlatforms & Distribution\nFRONTIERS will be available on PC, Mac and LInux.\nIf all goes well the plan is to distribute the game on Steam, but I will also be trying to make it available on GOG.com for folks who like to keep their games totally DRM-free. (If your reward includes a copy of the game, I'll make sure a DRM-free option is available for you.)\nGeneric Assets\nQuick side note for all you game developers out there: I plan to make any generic assets I create or commission for the game freely available - tree models, textures, weapons, C# scripts, etc. I wouldn't have made it this far without support from sites like Open Game Art and the Unity community, so this will be a chance to contribute to the growing pool of high quality art & code available to aspiring game developers.\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out these links, videos and screenshots! I talk about features in a lot more detail elsewhere, especially on Greenlight.\nOfficial Pages / Information\nFRONTIERS Official Page\nIndieDB Page\nAAD Games Devblog\nArticles\n\nPC Gamer - Exploration, discovery and survival in a one-man made indie RPG\nPolygon - How one man is creating open-world exploration in Frontiers\nIndie Game Magazine - Trailblazing with Lars Simkins\nIndiestatik - Do It Yourself: Frontiers Is An RPG-Sized Exploration/Survival Game Made By Just One Person\nScreenshots\nFor all kinds of pretty images, check out the Greenlight gallery.\nVideos\nFor more videos, check out the AAD Productions YouTube channel.\nEnough of the jibber jabber! Let's get to the good stuff!\nAdd-Ons!\nWhat are add-ons? They're fun extras that you can add to your existing pledge, regardless of the reward you claimed.\nIf you want an add-on, just increase your pledge without changing your existing reward. For example, if you already have an Early Bird Ranger reward and you'd like to add a Butterfly, pledge another $50. Then at the end of the campaign you'll receive an official backers' survey asking which add-on you wanted.\n(Using PayPal? Same basic procedure - just make sure to shoot me email after you've contributed the difference!)\nStandard Rewards\nIf you have questions about any of these rewards let me know and I'll answer them in the FAQ.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm proud of the fact that I've never missed a VFX deadline, but with a game this complex there's always a chance that January 2014 will slip through my fingers.\n\nIf I ever feel the deadline slipping you will know before anyone else. My policy is the simplest policy - transparency across the board. (I can guarantee you'll be sick of hearing about my problems within a month.)\n\nI should also address the elephant in the room - is it even possible for one guy to create a game this big? The short answer is no, and that's why I'm bringing on a small team! But the other thing to keep in mind is how simple this game is compared to its influences (like Daggerfall). The focus on exploration allows me to prune mechanics and prevent the game from getting overwhelmingly complex. That's how I've been able to make it as far as I have, and that's how the team will be able to finish the game in the end.\n\nThanks for reading!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "The Final Update", "update_content": "FRONTIERS is Finished\nA new build - the final build - has been pushed to Steam.

Like barnacles on the hull of a ship, the world of Freebooter is dotted with islands. The only way to travel is by ship, all trade is done in harbors and wars are fought as much for the sea as for the land.\nEvery time you start a new game, we create a new world for the player to explore. New islands are placed, complete with natural resources and settlements. These settlements may be independent or they may belong to a faction. The factions themselves are also procedurally generated, with their own colours, territory and characteristics.\nFreebooter is all about giving the player the freedom to explore this world - we just provide a starting ship and the opportunities. You are never really locked into a role when you play Freebooter. For example, even if you have been trading for a long time, there is nothing to stop you from exchanging your merchant ship for a battleship and doing a bit of pirating or fighting a war.\nNaval combat in the world of Freebooter is an intense affair. Battleships vie for position, seeking shelter from the enemies\u2019 broadsides and a clear shot for their own. Battles take a toll on the ship, leaving sails torn to shreds, hulls splintered and gun ports bellowing smoke and fire. The Captain is at the centre of the engagement, shouting orders and hearing the crews reports of failing equipment and approaching enemies. In the end, a ship may raise the white flag and it will be left to the victor to accept - or to condemn them to the depths.\nThe life of a merchant in Freebooter is perhaps less grim but no less challenging. The economy of Freebooter is driven by a supply and demand simulation. If an island is not getting the food its population needs, food will be traded at a higher price or if food is abundant, it will be traded at a lower price. A player looking to trade will do well to make note of the market on the islands he visits and try to match a supply with a demand. Of course, knowing where to buy and where to sell is about more than just prices - a chance encounter with a pirate, a rival merchant or a faction embargoing trade at your would-be destination can all turn a healthy profit into a significant loss.\nHuge procedurally generated world.\nOpen world gameplay allowing for many playstyles.\nDiverse factions vying for control.\nDynamically generated quests.\nIntense and strategic naval combat.\nIn-depth trading and economy simulation.\nDynamic weather and day/night cycle, which affects your journey.\nExtend your command from a single ship to a fleet.\nOutfit your ship to your preferred play-style.\nCrewmembers provide you with useful information.\nAll reward tiers include lower tiers!\n\u00a37 - One digital copy of Freebooter and the Trailer Soundtrack, claimable once the game is released!\n\u00a315 - Art PDF - a digital artbook!\n\u00a325 - An ugly digital \u201cthank you\u201d sketch signed by the team! \n\u00a340 - Access to the alpha of Freebooter and a chance to see the game evolve!

We have made early versions of most features which the final game will be based on. Currently we are refining the naval combat system and working on the art style as well as the economy simulation. These will be covered in detail in upcoming Kickstarter updates.\nTribunal Games consists of three friends. Nissanthen does all of the art while Johannes and Jakob do the coding - everything else, like game design and business decisions, we handle together.\nWhen we were at university we started talking about the possibility of making computer games together. Following graduation we started making small games as a spare time activity. In 2011 we got the idea for Freebooter and started spending the majority of our free time working on it. In 2012 we decided to make Freebooter our full time occupation.\nSo far we have made an early version of the game to test the main features. The gameplay that did not work in the early version needs to be redesigned, reimplemented and tested.\nFreebooter is a fairly ambitious game and to make it, we will need to work on it for almost a year going forth. Therefore almost all of the money will go straight into development. There are a few other expenses we have to cover: in addition to buying Unity3D licenses, we will need to consult an accountant and possibly a lawyer to help us set up everything legally.\nAll the money raised in the Kickstarter will go towards the development of Freebooter. If we manage to raise more than the set goal, we will discuss what direction to take the game in with our players.\nThere are many features we would like to add to the game but some, such as multiplayer or land-based combat, require a substantial amount of extra development time. Therefore it is very unlikely that we will have the time to implement them. If we greatly exceed the Kickstarter goal, we will focus on making small content updates or flesh out existing features. Examples of such are: expanding the crew mechanics or the faction AI, adding sea monsters, biomes or smuggling. But again, we do not want to settle on any one of these features before we can get feedback from our community.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first game we have worked on as Tribunal Games and while we have worked on smaller games before, this will be our first commercial project.

Could you manage and sustain a human population on humanities next frontier?\nColonisation: Moonbase is a game originally designed for android Smart Phones and Tablets.\nHowever due to the lack of demand for the game on that system and with over 90% of the feedback I got from our last kickstarter, I am attempting to make it for PC instead - you asked and I listened!\nFor those of you who followed the android kickstarter and just want to know what will be changed please skip to the bottom.\nGo where few have gone and do what no one has done before. Build your base on the lunar surface to support and grow a colony of humans. Feed them, keep them warm, give them oxygen and in return they will support you in your goal of creating advanced technology and mining the Moons resources for use back on Earth?\nCan you make a successful base and become rich beyond your wildest dreams or will you find out the hard way that humans need more oxygen than you thought?\nFind out how well you can handle life on the next frontier with Colonisation: Moon Base!\nDo you remember those classic games like Theme Park and SimCity?\nColonisation: Moonbase takes what these games where and puts them into a futuristic setting with an update visual style and feel. Apart from the visuals the game has some very unique features that differ from the games mentioned above.\nUnlike most city building games Moonbase is set in a completely new location with new challenges. You won't have the old classic grid placement, instead the game will allow you to place buildings anywhere you like so long as there is enough room! - in turn making each map look unique and amazing, allowing you to be completely flexible in your design - it also adds to the challenge of finding or reserving space for larger buildings!\nThe game will also have a much stronger focus on strategy and resource management whilst also making it accessible to casual gamers with a varied amount of difficulty as you progress!\nPlan your space well and prioritise what you need or you could find yourself out of space and unable to complete your objectives.\nIn addition, you will have access to over 70 buildings and 10 real lunar locations to build your base and grow your colony.\nBy exploring the moon in 'flight mode' you can take control of the camera and fly around your colony. Take in the breathtaking scenery of the lunar surface; highly accurate and mapped to real locations on the moon!\nI have designed Colonisation: Moonbase to be playable in long or short bursts. There is always something to do, such as building more structures, unlocking new buildings or growing your population, Alternatively you could sit back and let your resources build up!\nAnd if that is not enough you could always go fly around your colony and admire all your hard work.\nThe game also has an auto-save feature that will save your progress regularly, so if you want to stop after 10 minutes you can always come back and continue where you left off!\nThe game also includes a tutorial to help you learn the basics, but I am sure you will pick it up in no time.\nThis section mostly refers to the original video, we have updated the opening video mid way through the kickstarter campaign to focus more on the game itself. Below is the original video.\nAs the current build is in alpha there are some things missing or incomplete, one of the major things that will be improved is the building detail, a few of them are complete whilst others do not have any textures (you was wondering about those purple buildings right?)\nAll buildings will have lights/windows on them making them feel like they are occupied and also looking cool at night time!\nUI - Some of the UI will be re-designed due to the original interface being designed for small mobile, with the precision of a mouse and the size of monitors the size of the UI can be reduced as well as more information being shown at any given time.\nUI Help - I am also still working on some aspects of the UI including more feedback help such as warnings when resources are low and coloured text so you can easily spot any issues your base may have.\nCurrently there are some help systems in place - semi included in the video but would like to point them out.\nClicking on your resources: - When you click on your resources a menu will appear showing you the total in/out as well as the top 5 producers of that resource and the bottom 5 producers of that resource. Clicking on these will then send you to that building to help you identify it.\nYou may of also noticed that when your placing the building the costs appear below the resource, showing if you have enough, this helps to identify when you have enough and reminds you the cost so you do not have to go back to the menu to look.\nMissions - These will be a set of tasks and objectives to complete where you will receive rewards once completed, there will also be a story plot within some of the missions, can you keep the peace, what will you discover along the way? is it possible to fully colonise the moon?\nTutorial - The tutorial is mostly complete but was excluded from the video as the purpose of the video was to demonstrate the current state of the game. - rest assured that the game will be easy to grasp with discovery of useful features throughout the game, making it accessible to anyone who would like to play the game.\nTransport ships & Trade - These will allow you to trade with earth to buy or sell extra resources, you will see the ships take off and land, adding some activity to the game.\nCivilian ships - These will not have a function, but instead will be like the people and cars from other city building games - giving the feeling that there is now life on the lunar surface.\nScreenshots - You will be able to take screenshots of your moonbase. It will allow you to save them on your computer for you to then do as you wish.\nFrom the video and screenshots you may of seen that there are a lot of the same buildings (especially those water mining outposts!) when the game goes into beta I will be testing the balance of the game and gathering feedback, our aim is to balancing the resources so its still a challenge but so you don't struggle and have to build the same things over and over - because that\u2019s boring!\nYou will be able to build over 70 different buildings - over 50 of which will be completely different and unique to each other.\nFurthermore, as the game was designed as a more casual game for android phones I am considering implementing a couple more features just for the PC version. This will be based on feedback from people who play the alpha versions as to weather they make the game too hard etc.\n1.Your control buildings that give you your building cap will have an area of effect, you will have to build within this area for you to be able to control it.\n2.You will have to micro manage your resources and/or organise your transport ships to keep a constant supply of resources feeding your different buildings.\nAs the game is mostly a port from android almost all PC's can play the game, as the game is not finished I can only advise at this point on the system requirements.\nCPU: core2duo or higher\nRam: 2GB\nGPU: Any SM2.0 card with 512mb of memory (should still work on inbuilt and on chip gpu's, e.g. core i3/i5/i7/motherboard gpu)\nHDD: 1GB spare.\nI will update all Kickstarter backers with the system requirements if they change.\nThe following screenshots demonstrate some of the current graphics settings to aid in performance on lower powered / older devices\nThese screenshots show the game set to the highest setting with everything at maximum.\nThese screenshots demonstrate the game when it is set to the medium settings.\nThese demonstrate the lowest settings.\nHere I will cover the full extent of exactly what you get for each pledge level.- make it as clear as possible so no one feels cheated (and I don't get into any trouble for being misleading)\nREWARD 1 - BASIC SUPPORTER!

(mechanic)\ncolony ships (Visual)\nNo In App purchase (removed from android version)\nImproved sky/stars (Visual)\nBuilding Shadows (Visual)\nSun (Visual)\nBasic mineral prospecting.(Mechanic)\nAdded complexity to cash, some things will cost cash to run, this in turn will create a game over mechanic.\nGoal 2 - \u00a37,500\nImproved mineral prospecting mechanic, will require scanning etc for better locations.(Mechanic)2 more resources to collect - rocket fuel & helium 3 (Mechanic)prospecting building(s) (Additional content)Your ships (repair & trade) will require rocket fuel instead of costing money. (mechanic)\n+ you will be able to play the PC Alpha version for the remainder of the kickstarter campaign when this goal is met.\nGoal 3 - \u00a39,000\nLight coverage & day/night cycle will affect solar panels, energy usage (heating and lighting at night time) and oxygen with hydroponics (Mechanic)\nGoal 4 - \u00a310,000\n4 more music tracks (Audio)\n\nGoal 5 - \u00a312,000\nPopulation management complexity - there will be lots of factors that will affect your colonists, work rate, moods and health that will make people want to come to your base or not as well as severe health issues and other colonists hazards (Mechanic)\n\nGoal 6 - \u00a315,000\nA connection system that connects buildings together, colonists will have work times to follow, travel system will have things like congestion/limitations. (mechanic and visual)\n\nGoal 7 - \u00a317,000\nAdd 4 more plots to build on (Additional content)\n\nGoal 8 - \u00a320,000\nUpdate the graphics of the buildings (Visual)\nAn upgrade system to the buildings (Mechanic)\n\nGoal 9 - \u00a325,000+\nWill implement more features requested by the community as well as more buildings and more polish to everything.\n\nQuick overview of the differences between the android version and the PC version.\nMap Detail:\nAs you can see the map detail is fairly high as it is, however for the PC version there I will attempt to make it better by detail in the surface when zoomed in, you will be able to see more stuff like rocks and the ground will be crisper and sharper detail - In addition things that are being looked into but not confirmed yet is better terrain model and higher resolution maps of the actual lunar surface.\nBuildings:\nSome of the buildings will be updated due to the capabilities of PC's, for example the hydroponics building, that was just a coloured glass dome will have a transparent dome whewre you can then look into and see the trees inside,\nOther buildings will have more detail added to them too with the possibility of animations and lighting effects.\nGraphical User Interface (GUI):\nAs the GUI was designed for android devices the UI in places was large and bulky to accommodate small screens that you had to touch with your finger, which is way less accurate than a mouse pointer. Some of the UI will be reworked so it doesn't take up large portions of the screen when it doesn't need to\nThere will also be some more special effects and quality control such as AntiAliasing, Depth of field etc.\nGameplay:\nWith mobiles being a more casual audience, the performance limitations  and the control input, the game was designed a little too casual for PC gamers (in my opinion) - as such there are a couple of ideas in the works to improve game play and will be implemented based on feedback from our Alpha players.\nArea of effect - the idea behind the construction buildings was that they gave you a building limit that they can control, there is now the possibility of taking this further and making it necessary to build other buildings near the construction buildings - bringing more emphasis on planning the location and layout of your base.\nMicro management of resources - As each building requires its own resources you need to make sure supply chains are made and maintained keeping them running at full capacity all the time - this means as well as keeping an eye on your overall production to be able to expand you need to manage the buildings or else you could easily have a knock on effect if a building doesn't have enough resources to keep up supply. (current idea is the player will have to set up the initial logistics, not to have to send resources every x minutes. but may have to update them with new routes when there are new/more buildings)\nOne improvement already made is that you are now able to see where exactly your building is over unstable land whilst building, previously you just had a simple inidcator, red for unstable land and green for stable land, with this new feature you can easily identify the exact location that is causing you issues and move/rotate the building accordingly.\n\nThat has been removed from the game -\nWell in game microtransactions have been removed! I was never a fan of these and was added to help income for an android freemium game.\nWith the higher pledge prices I never expected anyone to have to pay for ingame content.\nPosting to facebook, unless there is a huge demand you no longer will be able to post your pictures to facebook from within the game, on android phones, finding pictures and posting them is not as easy as a PC, so now we are on PC there is little need to have this feature in game - you will still be able to take screenshots, these will be saved in a directory on your computer, for you to then choose to upload to facebook or not.\nHere you can see some press coverage, some of them will have unique questions and answers, so it may be worth checking them out.\nSpace Sector\nhttp://www.spacesector.com/blog/2013/07/colonisation-moonbase-a-city-building-game-on-the-moon/\nUniversal Gaming Reviews\nhttp://www.universalgamingreviews.com/kickstarter-previews-colonisation-moonbase/\nInterview over at iamashwilton.com\nhttp://iamashwilton.com/2013/07/06/interview-colonisation-games/\nDuuro.Net\nhttp://duuro.net/colonize-the-moon-now-you-can/\nStart2Continue\nhttp://start2continue.com/blog/2013/7/17/start2kickstarter-colonisation-moonbase\nMore will be posted as they come!\nIf you like the game and want to pledge more than a particular reward don't forget you can request not to receive that reward - I would like to thank you for any and all of your support to make this game amazing - fulfilling a personal dream of making a computer game!\nYou can find us at www.colonisationgames.co.uk\nAnd don't forget to like and share our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ColonisationGames\nYou can also follow us on twitter\nhttp://twitter.com/ColonisationG\nP.S.

With each new tune, we'll having enough funding to be able to add one or two more enemies, more power pins (attack abilities) as well as NPCs!)\nThe exclusive virtual Kickstarter hat is now also available for backers $40 and above!\nBring the Magic back into Games!\nA Hat in Time is a 3D collect-a-thon platformer in the spirit of the beloved Nintendo and Rare games from the Nintendo 64 era. Think Banjo-Kazooie, The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64 all in one! \nLike many of you, we grew up with those games and became fascinated by their huge magical worlds. We want to re-create that feeling of exploration and excitement. Many modern titles simply don't have the same magic and wonder as games from the 90's - we want to change that!\nTime Travelling is awesome!\nSo, you are probably wondering about the game's title. It's because one of the most awesome things in the world is of course time travelling! \nTime is falling apart and it is the job of the brave interstellar-travelling Hat Kid to collect all the time pieces and put them back together! But watch out, you're in a race against the evil Mustache Girl who wants to use time for evil!\nThe game mashes the best from old-school 3D platformers and gives it a modern twist!\nNot only can you navigate terrain using traditional gameplay mechanics such as running and jumping (and wall jumping - everybody loves wall jumping!), but you are also provided with your trusty umbrella, which can be upgraded to provide a wide range of abilities!\nPlatforming is the biggest aspect of A Hat in Time, and we want to make traversing the levels as fun, easy and interesting as possible!\nHat Kid can wall jump, slide and double jump. As her story progresses, she unlocks additional moves like the hookshot, ground pound and pogo upgrades!\nIn previous collect-a-thon titles, combat has played no bigger role than a mundane task. In A Hat in Time, we want to fully integrate combat into the game, and we've done so by giving every new upgrade Hat Kid finds an alternative combat functionality!\nIn addition, and unlike previous platformers, combat is rewarding: obtain unlockables, such as new abilities, by defeating strong enemies! Here you can have your cake AND eat it!\nIf the fan-release of Super Mario 64 multiplayer has taught us anything, it's that it's incredibly fun to mess around with a friend, even if it is a designed singleplayer experience!\nWe want to be able to provide that same experience with co-op, but making all game code network-compatible.is not as easy as the flick of a switch - there are a lot of difficulties that need to be taken into consideration (screenshot above is just a test). So many, that we wouldn't be able to include it with our initial budget - that is why we have included it as a stretch goal! If you would like to play this game with a friend, then you can help by pledging more money.\nChapters and Acts\nA Hat in Time is split up into five story segments, \"chapters\", and each chapter is split into several \"acts\". If you have ever played Super Mario 64, this is the same as choosing different stars on the same level: you have different objectives and the environment changes depending on the act you have selected.\nThe chapters differ greatly, ranging from big cities to spooky forests, vast deserts, and even the moon!\nIn chapter 1, Down with the Mafia, Hat Kid crash lands on a mountain containing an enormous city, entirely infested by the Mafia of Cooks! Hat Kid will have to both defeat the Mafia of Cooks and save the city from drowning in super hot lava, all this while keeping Mustache Girl at bay!\nIn chapter 2, The Subcon Forest, Hat Kid is on a mission to save the gloomy Subcon Forest! But it won't be easy, The Snatcher will be stealing your stuff, the Moonjumper will be mind-controlling everyone around you. To make it even more difficult, there is Timmy who will be getting in your way as he takes control of his living haunted manor!\nDistribution and Platforms\nA Hat in Time will be available on Windows and Mac. We also aim for getting a Steam release (please give us a vote on Steam Greenlight!). Additionally, we have plans on releasing console versions if everything goes to plan. Being big Nintendo fans ourselves, we are talking with a publisher to help making a Wii U version. However, at this point we are not able to promise anything - so stay tuned and cross your fingers!\nWhere the Money goes\nSo far the team has been developing the game with a budget of zero dollars, while at the same time working either full-time jobs or studying. However, it won't be possible to continue the current rate of development if there is no budget.\nMaking games is fun, but at the end of the day everybody needs money to be able to live. That's why we are asking you to pledge a small amount of money through this Kickstarter campaign. If the campaign succeeds, it will allow us to properly finish and polish the game. Here is a pie chart that shows what the money will be spent on:\nMeet the Team!\nHere are the people putting their sweat and tears into the game!

However it is a saturated market and it is difficult to make the cut. If you want to help us get on, go over on Greenlight and give us a vote!

These are some of the figures in the game. \nThe game asks player to imagine conversations with people who are gone or out of reach.\nIn Rehearsals and Returns, you explore each level in order to literally pick up things to say - these collectables the game's primary resource.  At the end of each level you encounter a person.  This is when you have an opportunity to quote someone (see Rewards and Rules, below) or, instead, you can choose a kind or hateful statement to say to that figure.  \nSam is already working on the music.  Listen to \"Runthroughs and Renditions\":\nThe core mechanic feels more like that of Apples to Apples than the conversation mechanics of Mass Effect, for example, although strategies definitely manifest over time; players must weight how one conversation affects another.  \nWhat if you had a brief moment with Einstein?  Or George W. Bush? What would you say to him? \nOften these figures are famous people that - in real life - you (probably) have never met, but later your encounters get more personal.  This is a crucial point, but I don\u2019t want to elaborate as what we\u2019re going for provides an experience arc for players who, well, don\u2019t know where that arc is going.  \nHow far along are we?\nI started developing this game a year ago and plan for it to be done in another year.  It began as a paper prototype, and I\u2019ve iterated on the digital version consistently.  I\u2019ve recently started collaborating with Jason Ronzani and Sam Marshall.  Jason is creating the art and animation and Sam is doing all the music and overall sound design.  I have a little bit of money for both of them, but I need more to see Jason\u2019s side of it to the end.  \nRewards and Rules\nRead the pledge rewards (to the right) carefully as the larger pledges don't necessarily inherit all the smaller pledges' rewards.  Many of them include giving pledgers the chance to shape the game design.  I will be in touch with you folks - to get your favorite wise quote or the name of your chosen historical figure.    \nPledge rules are:\n*For the Wisdom Quote Contribution, I won\u2019t accept any quote.  First, it has to be a real quote from a real person.  Second, it can be cold-blooded but not offensive (i.e. - Stalin probably ok, David Duke probably not).  Finally, it has to be less than 140 characters with spaces and the source\u2019s name.  I will consider as many quotes as you want to offer, but we will agree to incorporating only one per funder.  \nHere are four example quotes:\n- \"I am extraordinarily patient, provided I get my own way in the end.\" -Margaret Thatcher\n- \"A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way.\" -Mark Twain\n- \"Life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act.\" -Truman Capote\n- \"People who enjoy meetings should not be in charge of anything.\" -Thomas Sowell\n////////\n**For the Famous Figure Contribution, I won\u2019t accept any historical figure.  I will encourage you to pick a person many people have heard of.  Playtests reveal that when many of the figures are less than very famous, the experience breaks down.  (I was disappointed to learn that incorporating Kirby Puckett and Ian Curtis worsened the game).  We can have a conversation and you should have backup choices. But I will not be strident about this if you give $70+ ;)  \nStretch Goals?\nWith over $6300, I will hire a database programmer (to implement playtesters' favorite part - an aspect that I don't want to reveal publicly).  \nAlso, the more money I have for Jason (art) and Sam (music), the more work they will do.  Additional money will go to embellishing the world as even more beautiful and intricate; and the same goes for the music.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideogames are difficult to make.

But one of my best backers, who've been supporting my art since the beginning offered me an interesting idea of making something in between. Let me explain. Acrylic sculptures are quite costly, the cards are pretty simple. What if we make something more than a card, but less than an acrylic sculpture? This is how this idea was born.\nI believe that this piece of art can not only be used as a decorative piece - write something on it and use as a post card! Truly very special sort of. It is not like just \"I've got it for you\" it is \"I MADE it for you\"..It is a huge difference, believe me.\nI already \"tested\" this cat concept on one of my friends - she was hysterically happy when received it as a Birthday card with the wishes written on it. And this present will be remembered, I'm sure. Try it :)\nAnd please feel free to contact me any time. I will be glad to answer any of your questions or just to chat.\nThe cats are available in white, yellow, red, pink, blue, green and black color. So feel free to choose any color you like.\nAlso the cats are available with the face engraved (\"Grumpy mode\") and with a blank face (\"Draw-it-yourself mode\").

Can you find Picadilly circus?\nLet\u2019s be honest - a ghost in your house can be a real pest. For centuries we have accepted hauntings as unexplained phenomena which we can do little to stop. Side affects of living in a haunted home can include sleepless nights, headaches, smog everywhere and in some cases even physical damage in the house.\nEnough is enough, with your help we intend to put an end to these paranormal pests. Build, manage and develop your own team of talented ghost hunters.\nWith the income from your team\u2019s work you can equip them with some amazing gadgets, but manage your budget with care not everything is as useful as it may appear. Hunt your customer's ghosts down \u2013 property damage should be kept to a minimum. Take on the ghosts, follow the map, take in the lovely sites and stunning landmarks.\nBe the hero of the day and save the city!\nMoving your hunters strategically, you have to entrap the ghosts while keeping the damage to interior low. [CLICK IMAGE TO ZOOM IN]\nSummary\nThe project in a nutshell before we cover the details.\nWith GhostControl Inc. you'll get:\nTrue, challenging turn-based strategy gameplay.\nGet the FULL game in a box or as a download, depending on your pledge.\nNo DRM. No \u201calways-on\u201d necessity.\nWhat\u2019s In The Game?\nLoads of ghost hunting with various equipment\nTeam management and strategic investment decisions\nAI driven competing teams\nA London city map with famous landmarks\nTons of humour in text messages and game action\nWhat is our schedule?\nWith tons of game assets already completed and four people full time and three people part time on the case we believe to have a beta version available exclusively for our backers in July and the game finished by end of August 2013. We target September 2013 as a really conservative shipping goal to allow for final polish and serious testing. \nThe game starts by building a team. Select the right guys, hand them a ghost-gun, a few traps and a sensor and purchase a car. Now all you need to do is wait for the first call and off you go. Riding through the city, it depends on you and the competing teams cars to be first at the scene of the spook.\nManage your employees! Find the best hunters available and build a strong team to stand a chance against the spooky minions.\nHaving arrived, you enter the building and use your sensors (or eyes) to search for the haunting ghost. Split your team up or go as a team, it's up to you. In best X-Com manner, your up to five team-members seek and entrap the troublemaker. But take care: Using nuclear powered ghost-guns in a residential building can cause lots of damage. Try to do as little harm as possible to the rooms or you'll end up paying a bill instead of earning cash.\nAs the game progresses more and more equipment will become available and you will encounter more challenging troublemakers. If your business ends up in bankruptcy try again and sort out your strategy!\nChoose your headquarter! Starting out small, you will soon be able to expand into a larger base including more storage space and car ports.\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to ensure the game is full of surprises, we\u2019ll make you jump, we\u2019ll make you laugh, hopefully the ghosts wont make you cry. There\u2019s plenty of content to keep you on your toes and entertain you along the way to your first million!\nListen carefully to your team members!\n-\nAs with any business you\u2019ll start with some pretty basic equipment, reengineered vacuum cleaners, I mean ghost cleaners and similar. As you start to capture ghosts you\u2019ll build up pile of cash to enable you to upgrade and buy more equipment.  \nPurchase equipment wisely and load it into the car of your choice. [CLICK IMAGE TO ZOOM IN]\nBut be aware not all the gadgets are as useful as they look, a used-underwear trap probably wont be suitable for all types of ghost! If you purchase a 3G-Comm receiver remember to check that your traps meet the IEEE-SensoTrap standard or they wont be able to benefit from the power of the 3G-Comm receiver. As you get more and more equipment we have cool devices like Riff Raff Inc.\u2019s \u2018Shrink-em Further\u2019 to help you squeeze even more ghosts and ghouls into your traps. If this all makes sense great, otherwise ignore us and enjoy learning about these great tools yourself, by backing our project.\nWe'll send you occasional messages with either funny stories or useful information for your strategy. They will be delivered to your ingame-smartphone (or your real smartphone: see stretch goals). We are putting a lot of energy into writing up hundreds of unique news messages - literally. The news is about spooky sightings, interesting narrations, equipment-news as well as, from time to time, completely useless nonsense. They are picked randomly and if you are lucky you will get really useful tips. Because of that large pool of messages you shouldn't see the same message twice even if you play several times.\nIn addition we've written some phone dialogue that mix in with the emergency calls. You may have to make some serious decisions from these conversations, but hopefully some will just make you laugh. \nThe game will feature news on a regular basis brought to your in-game smartphone (or to your real one, see Stretchgoals).\nProduct recall for all Ghost-O-Mat 3175\n\"Pagan Industries have just announced that the lately released ghost trap of the Ghost-O-Mat 3175 series is having issues with the power supply. There have been reports of burning power supplies due to an overload. The company says that all devices shipped between yesterday and the day before that come with a power supply of the type XB756 are in danger of malfunctioning and should be returned for repair. A known side effect is the loss of power which sets free all trapped ghosts immediately and unintentionally.\"\nUsing our custom-made genetic algorithm, GhostControl Inc. will deliver you with almost unlimited numbers of unique rooms to clean, giving you a new experience every time you play. Using thousands of individually created game-sprites, we have created a bazillion of beautiful and logical combinations of rooms and inventory, automatically regenerated each time you enter a new building.\nA bazillion of possible houses to explore, thanks to a genetic algorithm generating original flats everytime you play.\nExplore a wide range of locations: From cozy private homes over trendy restaurants to the creepiest sewers.\nFirst of all we are trying to do this campaign in sort of a presale style. So we will make sure all backers will receive the game which is great value for the money. Content is key for each game, right? So the more money we get, the more content we can afford. We want to add more objects in graphics and more original music and sound to make this game a perfect experience. Please help us do so. As you can imagine what we are asking for in this campaign covers only a fraction of the cost. So we have put a lot of our own money on the project already and we are asking additional support here.\nWe have built a prototype and we are confident that we are headed in the right direction. We aim to finish in August but we set the delivery to September in our pledges to set expectations. If we are early you will get the game as soon as we are done.\nGhostControl Inc. is the first game created in collaboration of two German teams: Application Systems Heidelberg Software GmbH and Bumblebee.\nApplication Systems is originally a software developer. Founded in 1985 the company has seen the ups and downs in the business. Originally they developed and published for the Atari ST Computer series and after the death of the Atari platform the company focused primarily on Mac software development, localization and distribution. But some of the companies history includes hardware products too - like the famous \"Force Feedback Underwear\" or the iPhone2Mac products, see video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEAuGHS6rGY\nBumblebee, founded in 2012, is a team of freelancing professionals from the games business \u2013 and every one of them a games-loving nerd since the very beginning. They create games out of passion and for the fun of it. In 2013 they got a lot of attention with their original roleplaying game Days of Dawn. \ufffc\nFrom left to right: Tassilo, responsible for individually placing each and every pixel in GhostControl Inc.; Philipp Klein, balancing the game's numbers and designing the haunted houses; Thomas Hummes, coding and technical design of spooks and hauntings.\nGreat music makes a cool game even better. Having the awesome guys from Sound of Games create GhostControl Inc,\u2018s music will make an awesome game incredible. Responsible for the music of games like Days of Dawn, Pearl\u2018s Peril and Lords & Knights they have impressed us more than once with their outstanding skills.  We aim to use some of the money raised in this campaign to buy additional tracks of original music from them.\nACHIEVED: \u00a39,000! Stretch goal \u2013 TALKING HUNTERS - Reaching this, we'll be having your hunters exclaim their thoughts every now and then (recorded by voice actors in english). Examples may be: \"Ectoplams is dripping from me ears!\", \"Guys we are being busted!\", \"Is that all you learned in the past 200 years?\"\nACHIEVED: \u00a310,000! Stretch goal - Ten more equipment items! This may be traps, sensors or actual weapons. We\u2018ll need to see in the design process what\u2018s best to keep the balance. This includes all graphics, extra sound effects and the in game wiring, balancing and testing. The game is quite complex, so we can\u2018t just add stuff.\nACHIEVED: \u00a311,000! Stretch goal - Ironman-mode as discussed in the comments section This will unlock the Ironman-mode. Without that, you'll be having three savegame-slots plus an autosave-function that is saving every now and then into an autosave-slot. The ironman-mode would reduce the overall savegame-slots to one which will also be overwritten with the autosave. This one goes out to the tough guys out there.\n\u00a312,000! Stretch goal - CHOPPER & GHOSTS \u2013 With this goal reached, we will be adding a helicopter to the game and three additional ghosts, offering additional strategical options, gameplay and fun.\n\u00a315,000! Stretch goal - Additional City! We will add one more city with landmarks, new missions, new city specific events and ghosts.\n\u00a320,000! Stretch goal - The APPPP! Yes, that\u2018s right an App for the game, not the game as an App! We will add an app for iOS that communicates with the game. This is really cool because you can get a sensor message from a trap used in the game appear on your iPhone and alert you to take some appropriate action.\n\u00a322 Million! Stretch goal - The Party! If we reach this goal we'll fly the first 100 backers over for a really good party.\nHere are additional optional rewards. We did some research and believe that whilst the majority of Kickstarter Backers in the video games category prefer digital there are still people who like physical rewards. Therefore we decided to offer those separately. \nBy increasing your pledge by a specific sum you can get add-ons to build your very own bundle. So far the following Add-Ons have been introduced:\nSecond electronic game for a friend - If you want to add a second non-physical game for a friend to your pledge then please add \u00a37 to your pledge.\nPhysical Edition box - Includes a second license in addition to the one you already have.

Will be sent out approximately in August 2013. Please add \u00a325 to your pledge (worldwide shipping included)\nT-shirt selection\nThis is included in the reward tier THE TEE or you can order it as an Add On to any reward tier as explained by adding \u00a340 to your existing pledge (Far right: back of the T-shirt).\nThe Ghost Hunter T-shirt - one of a kind!\nThis comes with your portrait and is exclusively included in the reward tier THE REAL GHOSTHUNTER only. See reward description.\nAll T-shirts are GOTS-certified organic-cotton fair-trade T-Shirts (size S-XXL). And we have done these before, so we can guarantee they are not the cheap type that lose all color after two times in the washing machine.\nAfter the campaign we\u2018ll send out a survey asking you for sizes and shipping details.\nWhat can I do to help?\nThere are several things you can do to help:\nLet us know what you think: If you don\u2018t want to support the project let us know your concerns.\nContribute your ideas: We will consider everything in our forums as content for the game. We have a concept and a general idea what the game should be like. Anything that is inline with that concept and will not cause a major delay will be seriously considered.

With these influences in mind we\u2019re creating an epic, replayable turn-based tactics game where you train generations of heroes to repel a demonic invasion.\nAnd with Kickstarter, we can do it. We have a great concept and team ready to go, and we want to work closely with our community to control the future of MASSIVE CHALICE free from outside interference.\nMASSIVE CHALICE is a single player turn-based tactics game within a multi-generational strategy campaign built for replayability.\nAs an immortal King or Queen, you must unite your kingdom under a powerful dynasty, eliminate the demonic threat, and reforge the MASSIVE CHALICE!\nThe game is structured into two main layers: strategy and tactics. In the strategy layer, you oversee your kingdom, arrange royal marriages, conduct research, and make the far-reaching decisions that will determine the fate of your legacy.\nIn the tactics layer, you fight brutal turn-based battles to defend your kingdom using small squads of customizable heroes.\nForest environment (early concept) - click for Hi-Res version\nPermadeath is inevitable: your heroes will grow, age, and eventually die. You'll have to choose between keeping your favorite heroes on the battlefield or retiring them from combat to foster a new generation of warriors.\nA Hero (early concept)\nDrawing from roguelikes we love, content is modular and randomized. Each playthrough begins with a random assortment of male and female heroes from various bloodlines, guaranteeing that each game is unique.

The game was originally inspired by classic roguelikes and RPGs such as Rogue, NetHack, Ultima IV, and boardgames like Hero Quest. Since it's inception, the game has taken on a life of it's own, dragged kicking and screaming into a new age - where terrifyingly intelligent monsters haunt the beautifully lit corridors of TinyKeep's dungeons.\nIn essence, TinyKeep is a 3D realtime Action RPG, focusing on exploration and combat. The premise is simple: Your character is a prisoner, a seasoned fighter jailed many years ago and left to perish in the deepest, darkest cells of the keep. The nights pass by and all hope seems lost, you realise that the end is drawing near. But on one fateful day, you wake up and find yourself mysteriously free of your shackles, and in front of you lies a broken, unlocked door. There is only one thing left to do, you must now escape TinyKeep!\nAt its heart is a sophisticated AI system, designed to produce unique monster intelligence that behaves in exciting and unpredictable ways. We wanted to create a game that feels alive, where the dungeon's inhabitants have their own motivations and needs, and situations are created that have never been seen before in a game of this genre.\nIn order to construct this Kickstarter campaign, test technical feasibility and properly estimate costs, 2 months (of evenings and weekends) were spent developing the prototype, or \"proof-of-concept\".\nClick to try our dungeon visualization demo!\nThe result is what appears on the video and the screenshots on this page. The prototype has given us a very good indicator of what is and isn't possible, how long it takes to create features and how much funding we need to ask for.\nRoom generation algorithm in action\nAdding corridors\nThe fully rendered dungeon in all its glory\nSpawning Skeletons for the first time!\nBasic test of separation AI\nExperimental lighting test\nTaking care not to get trampled by the Rock Monster!\nThe TinyKeep HUD showing Health and Effort. The blue bar runs down when casting spells, and is also used for maintaining some kinds of special items.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game engine is complete and we are now ready to dive in and actually begin creating the huge amount of content for the game!\nSo far, prototype development is funded by Phi Dinh, the creator and programmer of the project and it was all completed during his spare time. We are now ready to begin creating all the content, including art assets, sound, music, game mechanics, AI behaviours and testing. This part of the project requires a huge amount of time and resources, so it can no longer be supported by one person. In addition to this, there are also asset licensing costs, publishing costs and software purchases. This is why we need Kickstarter!\nLong story short, we really want to make this game, so please pledge as much as you can, because without enough funding there will be no TinyKeep! And that would make us very sad...\nBaby Skeleton Tom needs your help!\nList of planned features for the core game:\nA mix of procedurally generated random dungeons with authored content - no boring generic levels!\nBeautiful dynamically lit 3D graphics for a variety of environments: cold slimy green walls, hot fiery pits and scarily dark corridors.\nChoose your difficulty before starting - harder dungeons generate better loot!\nPersistent characters - collect legendary weapons, learn new skills, improve your character and tackle increasingly harder dungeons.\nA variety of intelligent monsters each with their own unique behaviours and traits.\nBeautiful hand painted 3D monsters featuring art from Matthias Andre of BitGem!\nThe Pocket Inventory System\nThere are 3 distinct features which characterise many hardcore RPG games. These are stats (in the form of attributes, experience and levelling), inventory management, and a wide range of active and passive skills.\n\nFor TinyKeep, our goal is to condense all of these features into one tidy package. We want the game to be as accessible as possible for players new to the genre, but also retain the level of depth and customization that RPG gamers love. We've spent a lot of time designing a system that hopefully will do just that! TinyKeep combines player stats & customization, inventory & equipment and skills into a single game mechanic. We call this, The Pocket Inventory.\n\nAt its simplest, the Pocket Inventory is a 3x3 grid representing the layout of the keyboard's numpad. Slots 4 and 6 will be left and right handed items (such as sword and shield), and slots 2, 5 & 8 are for other equipment. The remaining 4 corners contain unequipped items - this is your storage/bag space. So in total, you can only carry 9 items around with you at one time - yes, that's right, so choose your items wisely!\n\nThe aim of the pocket system is to reduce the amount of grab-and-go and to force the player to make more tactical decisions on gathering items. It is at the player's discretion to take what he or she sees fit and leave behind the less valuable stuff.\nSwitching gear is intended to be difficult, which puts more pressure on the hardcore player to utilise the inventory and manage it better. Maintaining two sets of gear is difficult, but not impossible, which is why the player is encouraged to build a decent set of all-round armour.\nThe items themselves have stats and attributes which change the base statistics of the player.The reduced inventory space is intended to make this clearer and easier to manage while still allowing the player to examine how each piece interacts with each other.\nAll in all, the pocket inventory works to actually make things harder for hardcore players and easier for newcomers to the genre - which is the opposite to what games in this genre have provided thus far.\n\nRead more about the Pocket Inventory System here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/482045\nSeeds and Level Difficulty\n\nMonsters and AI\nThe focus for this game is on AI. We really wanted to get away from simple minded monsters that would blindly chase you around the map, as if your character were the center of the universe. With this in mind, a sophisticated AI engine was developed, based on Behaviour Trees in combination with Steering Algorithms and Pathfinding. The plan is to develop our monsters to have their own motivations and needs, so that they become more reactive to their surroundings. They should also work in teams, take advantage of the player's situation and run away from threats.\nTry out our interactive AI demo!\nTo get an idea of the kind of emergent behaviour we are trying to create, imagine the following gameplay situations:\nYou are being chased by a horde of Skeletons, your health is low and they are coming at you thick and fast. You know that facing them head on means certain death, so you must quickly escape. As you flee, you recall that Orcs and Skeletons are rivals, so you lead your pursuers to the Orc den on the other side of the dungeon. When the two opposing forces clash, all hell breaks loose and you sneak away unscathed. The ensuing battle does all the hard work for you, and you return minutes later to the battlefield and recover the loot.\nIn a long winding corridor you come across a lone Orc on patrol. The Orc spots you from a distance, but decides to flee as it knows it will probably lose a 1-on-1 battle. You give chase and eventually follow the Orc into a darkened room. Suddenly the doors slam shut, the torches are lit and a firing squad of Orc Archers appear in front of you. It is a trap!\nYou are in the middle of a heated battle between yourself and 3 other Skeletons. Surrounding you are several other Skeletons waiting their turn, and a Skeleton Mage giving support from afar. The Skeletons appear to be on the losing side, so the Mage decides to cast a summoning spell. Out of nowhere appears a giant Rock Monster, but fortunately for you he is unhappy with his new life and runs around in a blind panic, trampling down Skeletons in his path. The Skeleton Mage is flattened, but the Rock Monster is heading your way. What will you do?\nThe best thing about the scenarios above is that none of these are scripted, they arise naturally as emergent behaviour from the very simple rules and traits defined for each monster type. With this engine the result is greater than the sum of its parts, and it will be interesting to see what kind of situations are created that even we can't foresee.\nRead more about our plans for the AI here:\nPart 1: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/480360\nPart 1.1: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/484699\nPart 2: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/485220\nPart 3: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/489170\nPart 4: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/492985\nPart 5: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/495141\nRead more about our plans for the Pet System here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep/posts/475921\nHere are a few monsters included in the game:\nThe funding goal shown will allow us to create the most basic core version of TinyKeep.

Taking up your ancestral weapons, you'll choose your path to reclaim your homeland through orc-legions, hidden grudges, and nameless horrors from the Deeps. You will delve, expand your fortress and confront a mighty army, if you have the mettle it takes to hold the realms of old.\nWith over 600 sections, you'll discover many different mysteries, threats and resources to aid in your rule. The book will be printed in soft and hard covers, black and white, with over 50 illustrations. We have partnered with Tin Man Games to use their excellent platform to provide the Android, Mac and PC versions of the gamebook.\n\"You\u2019re not the first person to enter these halls since they fell.

Someone taller than your kind \u2013 it could have been human, or gray lord, or one of those things that live too deep down to have any name you\u2019d know.

Wounds do lower your stats permanently, but on the other hand they are highly regarded by the Dwarves as a sign of toughness, strength and the will to triumph. Some of the best improvements in your Holdfast can only be obtained by having Wounds, so you\u2019ll have to balance the pros and cons.\n\"You take a deep breath and shout, \u201cI don\u2019t give a goblin\u2019s bleached backside who or what you are, but this is a dwarf\u2019s house and a dwarf is here to take it! You either come out and face me, or you run off to someplace that\u2019ll have you!\u201d\"\nStaking your claim\nAs you progress through the gamebook, you\u2019ll gather items, discover resources, command improvements to your fortress, and prepare it against a vast army. The enhancements you make can grant you powerful boons, equipment and unlock new adventures. Your fortress can also lead to different endings, depending on your foes, alliances and choices.\nHoldfast upgrades include walls and defensive weapons, such as traps, economic and crafting buildings, such as inns and forges, and personnel, including your personal guard. You can choose to go it alone, too, and dwarven history is filled with desperate last stands, ending in legendary, but inevitable, sacrifices...\n\"Your words echo against the good, dwarven stone. At first, there\u2019s no response. Then there\u2019s a groan.\nIt sounds like it might be old iron doors moving when they don\u2019t want to move, but it picks up in pitch and you know it\u2019s a living thing roaring \u2013 and it must have lungs like bellows.\nYou can\u2019t help but smile. You\u2019d been getting bored.\"\nStretch Goals\nGoals Set #1\nGoals Set #2\nThank you, noble Patrons!\nThe records of the ancient Dwarven kingdoms tell many stories of bravery, battle, gold, glory and victory over impossible odds. We trust you\u2019ll take up your axe, gird for war, and help us tell this one!\nThe gates have opened, the Deeps wait expectantly, and the call goes out to all true dwarves to pitch in and help us craft this sturdy tome of deeds.
