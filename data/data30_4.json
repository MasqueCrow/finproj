[[{"biography": "Rogue Bard Media is a growing collective of like-minded artists in the metro-Detroit area whose interests range from Photography and Film production to illustration and writing. Consisting principally of Fyl, Dan, Krystal, and The Captain, the group is just starting to build some steam behind their plans to make an indelible mark on the Detroit scene, and one day the world.\n___________________________________________As head of the organization I am responsible for deciding which projects we pursue and, more importantly, making sure everyone remains on task to see them through to completion. I have been producing event videos for four years and short films as far back as 1999. I've come a long way since my humble beginnings editing videos using two VCR decks and a disc-man to insert music, but even so I still end up pulling all-nighters to put the final touches on videos more often than not.", "websites": ["roguebardmedia.com", "redbubble.com", "youtube.com", "facebook.com", "twitter.com"], "name": "Fyl Frazee of Rogue Bard Media LLC", "no_of_backed_proj": "Backed 132 projects", "location": "Westland, MI", "joined_date": "Joined Apr 2011"}, [{"title": "Tiny Epic Dungeons", "content": "A quick playing cooperative dungeon crawler for 1 to 4 players, featuring a modular dungeon, epic boss battles and detailed miniatures!", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coe/tiny-epic-dungeons?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/coe", "backers": "by Gamelyn Games and 41,486 backers"}, {"title": "Onyx The Fortuitous and The Talisman of Souls", "content": "THE WEIRD SATANIST GUY is making a FEATURE FILM!", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1418036943/onyx-the-fortuitous-and-the-talisman-of-souls?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1418036943", "backers": "by Andrew Bowser and 7,493 backers"}, {"title": "Steven Universe: Beach-a-Palooza Card Battling Game", "content": "Join Steven Universe for a competitive card game featuring an exciting battle-of-the-bands theme!", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cze/steven-universe-beach-a-palooza-card-battling-game?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/cze", "backers": "by Cryptozoic Entertainment and 2,826 backers"}, {"title": "Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops Boardgame", "content": "Run fast, run hard, and beat the competition in this competitive worker-placement game featuring push-your-luck dice-rolling mayhem.", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cgl/shadowrun-sprawl-ops-boardgame?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/cgl", "backers": "by Catalyst Games and 2,664 backers"}, {"title": "Posthuman Saga", "content": "A strategic survival board game in the mutant world of Posthuman", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyboards/posthuman-saga?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/mightyboards", "backers": "by Mighty Boards and 3,658 backers"}, {"title": "Interbellum RPG - War Adventures in a World of Technomagic", "content": "Adventurers and soldiers try to survive on the battlefields of the first mechanized wars with magic and strange technologies.", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1600397087/interbellum-rpg-war-adventures-in-a-world-of-techn?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1600397087", "backers": "by Studio Ludens and 475 backers"}, {"title": "No Thank You, Evil!
