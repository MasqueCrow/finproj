[{"backer": "Don Schlaich", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In 2014, Magpie Games launched a Kickstarter for Urban Shadows, an ENnie award-winning tabletop roleplaying game of political urban fantasy that quickly became one of our flagship titles. For years, fans have praised both the game\u2019s effortless explanation of the Powered by the Apocalypse engine and the groundbreaking content on race and urban communities, leading Urban Shadows to be a favorite of urban fantasy gamers, podcasters, and streamers alike.\nNow\u2014more than six years later\u2014we are returning to the dark streets of the city for Urban Shadows: Second Edition, updating the game\u2019s rules, look, and tools to better support moving stories of political urban fantasy. Featuring new playbooks, new faction mechanics, and completely revised materials from first edition, Urban Shadows 2E will thrust you into the danger and drama of the city like never before!\nUrban Shadows is a political urban fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which mortals and supernaturals alike vie for power in a modern-day city. Vampires, faeries, hunters, wizards, and more clash in the shadows...or make backroom deals for their piece of the streets and skyscrapers. No one is ever safe, and everything is always at stake.\nIn Urban Shadows, you play unique and powerful archetypes, protagonists who are attuned to the supernatural world. While the mortal world remains ignorant of the struggles of the city\u2019s supernatural denizens, you are caught in the middle of the physical conflicts and political drama of the city\u2019s past, present, and future.\nYou might be a spectre bound to an artifact, unable to move on until you\u2019ve resolved your trauma. Or you might be a clever vampire who controls the best blood supply in the city, caught up in a war between your kind and those who hunt you. Or you might be a veteran of your city\u2019s ancient conflicts, someone who got out of the game but keeps getting drawn back in by friends and allies.\nNo matter who you are, you contain within you the power to shape the city\u2019s destiny. What future will you choose? And what will your victories cost you?\nUrban Shadows is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and many of Magpie Games\u2019s own titles such as Masks: A New Generation, Root: The RPG, and Zombie World. The game uses the core framework of that system to provide a strong, simple way to create your own stories of political urban fantasy. You\u2019ll create a character using one of several archetypes, and then you\u2019ll take action, rolling two six-sided dice to resolve the outcomes of dangerous and difficult situations.\nUrban Shadows creates stories like those you\u2019d find in Constantine, Diableros, The Dresden Files, The John Wick franchise, The Last Witchhunter, Lost Girl, and The Wire. \nIn Urban Shadows, the city is a living, breathing character all its own. It hides dark desires, wicked deeds, and devious schemes, its shadowy tendrils a danger to mortals and supernaturals alike. Some residents have sacred sanctums or secure workshops\u2014places to weather the storms of the city\u2014but a sprawling metropolis lies just outside those little nooks, caring little if you prosper\u2026or bleed out in the gutters.\nBut nobody faces the city alone. Even the humblest of imps has a small community, a circle of those who can offer solace in the face of problems and danger. But community is a double-edged sword\u2014demanding as much as it gives\u2014and the needs and desires of those same circles constantly shape and reshape the vibrant urban landscape of the city. Nothing lasts forever, but the city turns over nearly every night, different forces laying different claims to you and yours.\nThe city hungers. Will you sate its gnawing desires? Or will your enemies make you the feast?\nThe schemes and plots of supernatural beings have been a part of the city for as long as anyone can remember. The faces at the top may shift and change with the tides of fortune, but rarely does something occur in the mortal world without some push from those who lurk in the shadows. A new subway system? A contested election? A bank robbery? Nothing is what it seems.\nBut what is mere money or prestige to wizards, ghosts, and faeries? Who cares about cash or elections when trafficking in human souls or exploring other dimensions? The supernatural forces of the city\u2014and the mortals who deal with them\u2014know only one real currency: debt.\nDebt is the power to influence those who owe you, the chits you call in to get things done, the ties that bind you to the rest of the city, and the proof that your word is strong and your bonds unbreakable. There are few true friends in the city, but your debtors always want to see you survive\u2014you can\u2019t pay up if you\u2019re dead.\nBut there are other ways to triumph in the city beyond the economy of favors and patronage. Cruel rituals. Dark secrets. The temptations of the monster within you. Those who seek power at any cost will find no end to the magics and mysteries available for the merest price of a soul.\nThe streets bleed shadows\u2014your debtors always around the corner\u2014as the city threatens to swallow you whole. Will you die a hero\u2026 or live long enough to become the villain? Will you fight the darkness\u2026or beg for power? The choice is yours.\nOver the past five years, Magpie Games has developed and created multiple games that broke boundaries and redefined what PbtA can do. Now, we think it\u2019s time to apply the lessons we\u2019ve learned to Urban Shadows, making a game that\u2019s tighter and easier to run, but also filled with new ideas and improvements, including new tools for players and GMs. We\u2019re also excited to create a beautiful new book with visionary art and fantastic graphic design. In short\u2026 we\u2019re making Urban Shadows 2E because we\u2019re thrilled to revisit and refine our work!\nHere\u2019s a quick list of the major changes, many of which are already available in the quickstart:\nrevised basic moves, including new versions of turn to violence and let it out \nrevised playbooks, including rebuilt versions of The Hunter and The Oracle \ntwo brand new playbooks: The Sworn (Power) and The Imp (Wild) \nchanging Factions to Circles\u2014see below\u2014and adding Circle Status to represent standing\na new downtime phase of the game focused on player-facing city moves and rumors\nreplacing Storms with a new MC-facing faction turn, including new faction moves\nexpanded MC tools for generating your city and Circles at the start of play\nWe\u2019re also adding a new mechanic to bring PCs into contact more often with each other: City Hubs. Cities are enormous spaces, and we found (in US1E) player characters could sometimes retreat to their different corners of the cityscape, interacting only with their own worlds and not with each other. With City Hubs, we want to create smaller, expandable environments to focus play and create drama. These Hubs\u2014described below\u2014position characters in neighborhoods, institutions, and community spaces in which they interact more frequently and avoid sessions in which PCs rarely come into contact and conflict.\nDownload the quickstart for a chance to test out some of these new features! We\u2019ll be previewing more of them during the campaign, and we\u2019re excited to get your feedback and refine Urban Shadows even more. Thank you to everyone who has given us feedback on 1st Edition since 2015!\n In Urban Shadows, your characters juggle relationships and obligations, seeking allies and opportunities, cashing in debts along the way to get things done. When you seize the day, you reshape the city in your image and unleash your powers on those who stand against you; when your enemies move and hunt, you do your best to stay ahead of the oncoming storm.\nUrban Shadows uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework to resolve interesting moments of uncertainty through moves, bits of mechanics that say: \u201cWhen you do [x], [y] happens.\u201d Each move trigger\u2014the \u201cWhen you do [x]\u201d part\u2014is designed to help point at moments of uncertainty, when neither the players nor the GM know exactly what happens next. Some examples of such moments include:\nWhen you throw a punch at a loudmouthed werewolf in a demonic club\nWhen you plead with the wizard\u2019s council to return a tome of magic stolen from you\nWhen you try to escape the evil ritual you stumbled onto in the city\u2019s sewers\nWhen you ask one of your companions to forgive the debt your fae lover owes them\nWhen you trigger a move\u2014when you perform the action described in the move\u2019s trigger\u2014then the rest of the move kicks into effect, often requiring a die roll. You roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and add in one of your stats to find out what happens.\nEvery playbook has four stats: \n Blood is the measure of your fight or flight instincts. It tells us how tough, dangerous, coiled, and quick to act your character is in a perilous situation.\n Heart is the sum of your passion, charm, and charisma. It tells us how proficient your character is at getting what they want through negotiation and persuasion.\n Mind is a reflection of your critical thinking and analysis. It tells us how perceptive your character can be and how good they are at manipulating others through deceit.\n Spirit is a gauge of your connection to the \u201cother\u201d and your force of will. It tells us how focused your character is under pressure and what kind of power they can unleash.\nEach stat is ranked from -3 to +3. You add your stat to some rolls when you trigger certain moves. For example, when you turn to violence, you roll 2d6 + Blood.\nOn most moves, if you get a 10 or higher (10+), things go your way! If you get a 7-9, you get what you were after, but usually with some cost or complication. If you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s called a miss, and the GM gets to tell you what happens next as things spiral out of control. \nUrban Shadows has basic moves for all the usual conflicts in urban fantasy\u2014fighting, lying, escaping, magic, and more\u2014along with special moves for managing debts and your relationships with communities at large.  \nThe city is a fierce cesspool of politics and corruption, but there are clear connections and boundaries between like-minded residents, spheres of influence that make up the scope of politics within the city. Most call these divisions Circles, loose political groupings that illustrate the differing affiliations and loyalties in the world, each one a community with its own internal politics and dramas. The Circles are:\nIn addition to the main stats, each character also has ratings (from -3 to +3) for their Circles, measures of how well the character understands each specific community. A character with a high rating in a Circle has contacts and connections within it, and can easily interpret its political information; a character with a low rating in a Circle doesn\u2019t understand how that Circle works or who the power players are within that community.\nCircles aren\u2019t organizations or formal alliances; they are more like broad communities or subcultures. The disagreement between two members of the same Circle may be as\u2014or more\u2014intense than any conflict between two differing spheres. A werewolf and a vampire both hail from Night, but that doesn\u2019t mean they get along. It only means they understand each other...and the violence inherent in the language of their streets.\nYet there are factions within each Circle capable of acting in unison, alliances who can shape the city\u2019s future\u2014werewolf packs, witch covens, faerie courts, and more. In Urban Shadows: Second Edition, we\u2019re giving GMs new tools to support those factions in a \u201cfaction turn\u201d between sessions. We\u2019re also giving players new tools to get stuff done in downtime, acting on the rumors they heard about what the factions have done in the past week or two of offscreen activity, all fueling the drama of the city and the power players have to shape the setting.\nUrban Shadows uses archetypes (The Wolf, The Wizard, The Oracle, etc.) to help players create characters quickly and easily. These archetypes are only ever a starting point; you can always bring in different myths, legends, and ideas to make your character entirely your own.\nCharacters often acquire abilities and powers from other archetypes and may even change archetypes over the course of play. As your character advances, you may also find reasons to retire to safety, securing that character\u2019s place in the city as you create a new character to continue your group's story.  \nAbsolute power...corrupts absolutely. Urban Shadows features a dynamic corruption mechanic, tracking your character's descent into darkness. When you take a life, give in to your monstrous nature, or cross a line you shouldn't cross, you mark corruption. As you gain corruption, you unlock new and potent powers, allowing your character to get what they want\u2014at the cost of further corruption. The dark side of your nature bears productive fruit.\nPower is never free, though. Cross the line too often and you lose your character to the darkness, handing them over to the GM for them to play as a threat. Corruption is a downward spiral threatening to push you over the edge, and not everyone is cut out to make it back from the brink. As your character gains new abilities fueled by the growing darkness within, you face a difficult choice: will you give up what you've gained to save yourself? \nCorruption also encourages you to play to your archetype. Each archetype contains unique boundaries and taboos that define when you mark corruption. Life is always sacred, but werewolves, mages, and faeries all face unique temptations while stalking the city's streets.\nCities are giant, complex networks of interconnected communities caught in an almost constant state of change. In order to focus your characters\u2019 conflicts and provide reasons for the players to consistently play together across those spaces, Urban Shadows 2E uses City Hubs\u2014dynamic sections of urban life that frame the story you\u2019re telling together without cutting you off from the rest of the city\u2019s potential.\nA City Hub isn\u2019t just a physical district or area of your city. Instead, each Hub is a collection of institutions, relationships, and anchors\u2014important NPCs\u2014that create a background for the action in your story. Even better, Hubs can be added over the length of a campaign, expanding the city with new locations, conflicts, and NPCs as your story progresses. \nUrban Shadows 2E features four City Hubs, each dominated by one of the four Circles:\nCity Hall (Mortalis)\nDowntown (Night)\nThe University (Power)\nThe Arts District (Wild)\nPerhaps your Tainted is a student at the local university, the same campus that lies within the Wolf\u2019s territory...and the same institution at which the Wizard recently started working as a professor. Or maybe your Oracle has an occult bookstore downtown in the same office building in which the Sworn is regularly summoned to meet with the wizard\u2019s council, just down the street from the family restaurant in which the Aware still waits tables.\nHubs are also a flexible tool for structuring your campaign as a whole. You can use two different Hubs set in the same city for different campaigns, you can grab elements from any Hub to use as inspiration for your campaign, or you can expand your campaign to include new Hubs as your city grows. We\u2019ll release new Hubs through this campaign as stretch goals and as digital supplements after the Kickstarter.\nPeople have been playing Urban Shadows since 2013, and we love the stories they\u2019ve told during that time.

Spill Blood. Drink the Rich.\nBrinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants is a Forged in the Dark tabletop roleplaying game about building a rebellion that will overthrow the blood-soaked vampires that oppress and dominate your world. \nDownload a Free Preview\nYou are a brigand, a commoner radicalized by tragedy who has decided to forsake their old life and flee into the woods to plot a rebellion. Cardenfell is your home, a kingdom on the brink of open revolt against the vampiric nobles and factory lords who rule over it. All it will take is a single spark. Your spark. \nWhether you're robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, or assassinating vampires and drinking their blood, every move you make will take you closer to your goal: liberating your home from the vampiric scourge of blood rent and exploitation. \nThis campaign will fund a printed, fully illustrated book release of Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants.\nForest Brigand - Olivia Rea\nDiscord - Join the Chat -\nBlades in the Dark\u2122 is a trademark of One Seven Design. The Forged in the Dark Logo is \u00a9 One Seven Design, and is used with permission.\nOrslae - The Bloody Isles, Our Grisly Home\nOur story begins in Cardenfell, a county on the island of Orslae, itself part of an archipelago known as The Bloody Isles. In many ways, Cardenfell is the beating heart of the Isles; as the saying goes, \u201cBlood flows from Cardenfell.\u201d It is controlled by one of the most powerful and favored vampire counts of the entire Crimson Crown and is as jealously guarded as it is viciously exploited.\nAlong the edge northern board of Cardenfell, lies your forest refuge, the Brinkwood. Since time immemorial, it has been avoided as a place of terrifying dangers and incredible magic, as all know it as a realm of the fae. And now, it is your home.\nNearly a century ago, the fae retreated into their forests. To this day, they fight a losing war against the vampires who invaded and ravaged their lands. From their magic and their souls, they forged masks able to grant some measure of their power to the mortal brigands who earn their trust. If you don these masks, they will take their toll, etching themselves upon your very soul, but allowing you to drink the blood of the rich and powerful vampires who dominate your world. From their blood, your masks will strengthen, allowing you and your rebellion to overcome seemingly impossible odds.\nVampires are created through imbibing blood sterling, an alchemical mixture of silver and blood.  Throughout the lands dominated by vampires, peasants are obligated to pay \"blood rent.\" Paid in silver or blood, this vicious tax is paid to the vampire landlord who owns the land they live and work on.  It is important to note that vampires are not born, forced into their life, or even incapable of leaving it. A vampire who stops drinking blood will find their power withers away and their mortality slowly returns, but most are unwilling to sacrifice the \u201cgifts\u201d of the blood, even if it means they would no longer need to feast upon their fellow man.\nThe Duke - Mohamed Saad\nCastlepunk - Anachronist Gothic Aesthetic, Punk Intention\nWe define Brinkwood's aesthetic as castlepunk. Castlepunk is an aesthetic genre that blends elements of gothic horror, medievalism, anachronism, victorianism, gas-punk and fantasy. You might find factories, gearworks, victorian fashion and other out-of-place setting details, but still set against a backdrop of gloomy castles, old decaying cities, and vaulted gothic architecture. This is a world where you\u2019ll still find faeries and other supernatural creatures, but driven to the fringes, back into the darkest parts of the forest where few dare tread.\nThe \u201cpunk\u201d in castlepunk implies a punk aesthetic and intention brought to bear on the setting. You aren\u2019t here to admire the scenery, or brood in secret castles, or soliloquize on your moral complexity or the depths of your depravity while you drink the blood of virgins from a crystal chalice; you are here to fuck shit up. This isn\u2019t a game about having sympathy for blood-drinkers and oppressors; it\u2019s about staking them through the goddamn heart. Be reckless. Be active. Stay mad. Stay punk.\nBlood of Tyrants - Olivia Rea\nThe Rebellion - A Practical Guide to Revolution\nBrinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants is based on the Forged in the Dark SRD, but takes cues from games such as Trophy, Belonging Outside Belonging, Dracula Over Europe, and the entire itch.io indie scene. \nEach time you sit down to play Brinkwood, you will choose a different mask for your brigand to wear. The masks you choose will grant access to powerful new abilities and actions, while occasionally offering you mask bargains designed to push your character's commitment to the cause and radicalize them further. \nThe decision of which mask to wear allows flexibility both to the player and character, as you can explore different roles and abilities without being \"locked in\" to an unsuitable build. Is your character without much martial training caught in the midst of battle? Don the masks of Violence or Terror and sow destruction and fear among your enemies. Is your taciturn brigand in a situation where they must deceive their enemies or rally allies to their cause? Take up the masks of Lies or Riot, and sow deception, truth, or hope.\nThe extensive almanac included in Brinkwood contains descriptions of cities, towns, villages, factions, allies, and deadly vampires, as well as their terrifying servants. As you GM Brinkwood, you will never be at a loss for what lurks around the next corner, and the cycle of foray, downtime, and planning phases will allow you to follow the fiction you and your players create. In play-testing, a 10 minute break before each foray was enough time for our GMs to check up on the lore and use its resources to generate a reliable \"idea cloud\" to pull from during play.\nBrinkwood marries the Forged in the Dark faction game with revolutionary politics by laying out a \"map\" of Cardenfell before you, and generating opportunities and threats for you to seize, defeat, or ignore at your peril. As your rebellion gains strength, your enemies will take greater and greater notice of the true threat you pose, and the back and forth between vampire and brigand will drive your campaign towards climactic final clashes as your underground rebellion graduates into open revolution.\nThe Organist - Steph Cheung\nPreview - A Sampling of Deeds to Come\nOur talented artists and designers have been hard at work to create several previews of what the finished Brinkwood book is likely to look like.

To view a full list of the stretch goals that have already funded, visit this blog post here!\n$16,000 - In the Face Of Our Despair \nIn the Face of Our Despair - By Jamila R. Nedjadi of Sword Queen Games\nThis stretch goal will fund a extended edition of In the Face of Our Despair, a Brinkwood game by Jamila R. Nedjadi. In Despair, players take on the role of the ancient fae who appear in Brinkwood - The Blood of Tyrants as they make their retreat into the forests. You can purchase the original edition of In The Face Of Our Despair here.\nThis stretch goal will fund additional art, layout, and editing for In the Face of Our Despair, as well as a zine-style print run of the new, extended edition. Our backers will be the first to purchase this extended edition in physical and/or digital format. All proceeds from digital sales will go to Jamila, with a 70% / 30% split for physical copies after production costs. \n$20,000 - Monstrous Art\nSteph Cheung\nThis stretch goal will fund additional monster art, produced by Steph Cheung and Myca Labelle. We look forward to them bringing more of the monstrous beauty of Brinkwood and its denizens to life!\nMyca Labelle\n$33,000 - Fellwood and Brigand's Dictionary\nAlex (@roxasbuddy) maps out the Fellwood. A work of the deeper, twisted parts of the Brinkwood. Other, alien threats are talked of here in the sanctuary against the vampire nobility.\nJosh (@joshtjordan) creates the Brigand's Dictionary, a glossary of slang, passwords, fae greetings, and other useful phrases in the dialect of the residents of Orslae. This dictionary designed for the Bloody Isles contains fictionalized versions of terms from Scots, Faroese, and Icelandic.\n$36,000 - Brigand's Treatise and In Want of Blood\nOlivia Hill (@machineiv) will give a Treatise on adaptability and guerrilla tactics. If your sword breaks, grab a pitchfork. If your pitchfork breaks, let's talk sharpened sticks. Warfare when you're out-numbered and out-gunned isn't hopeless\u2014you just have to want the win more than your enemy does.\nSi\u00f4n Rodriguez y Gibson (@Estuary_Witch) brings us the Austen-esque guide to playing Scions, In Want of Blood. \u201cIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of blood.\u201d When the scions of the blood-red order rebel it is often useful for them not to stray too far from the luxury of the nest. In order to unravel vampiric schemes and steal vital intelligence for their comrades, such rebellious children must still attend the balls and soirees and even accept marriage proposals from the leeches. In a mannered world you must hide rebellion behind pretty words and slip an ashwood stake into your petticoats.\n$40,000 - Brinkwood Refuge\nBrinkwood Refuge\nThis stretch goal will fund the completion of Brinkwood Refuge, a Belonging Outside Belonging role-playing game by Jamila R. Nedjadi. Refuge is can be played between regular sessions of Brinkwood, in order to explore the experience of revolutionary life from a different perspective. \nRefuge focuses on quiet moments, and can be played standalone or as part of an extended Brinkwood campaign. It's focus is on the people who are left behind during a foray, who quietly but dutifully build and sustain the rebellion. This game can be played between sessions of Brinkwood, making the Refuge feel real and truly alive.\nView an actual play session of Brinkwood Refuge below:\nThis stretch goal will fund the completion of Brinkwood Refuge, and the finished version of Refuge will be bundled with Jammi's previous game, In the Face of our Despair, as an add-on to this campaign at a reduced cost to you, our backers. This stretch goal may fund a physical version of Refuge, if funding permits, which will also be made exclusively available to our backers via an add-on.\n\n$43,000 - Colonia and Brinkwood Skirmish\nSimon Moody (@LuchaLibris) brings colonial Mexico to Cardenfell. Become bandidos allied with outlawed gods to fight the vampire lords who\u2019ve bled you dry since they came to your shores. Castlepunk meets Borderpunk in a bloody Mexican Western revenge story. \u00a1Viva la revoluci\u00f3n!\nBiscuit Fund Games (@plumtreechloe) musters Brinkwood: Armies of Blood and Silver, an expansion for the wallet-friendly war-game, Skirmish, that will let you pit Vampiric armies against one another as they carry out their ancient vendettas over blood-soaked soil.\n$46,000 - The Scene is Dead and the Militant Faithful\nAllie (@madpierrot) creates The Scene Is Dead, Long Live The Scene. Pop-punk used to be GarageBand and trundling vans. But times are changing and money flashes recklessly. Set against the backdrop of a Warped Tour that never was, your band must defend the scene from corporate vampires and make it to the end of the Distortion Tour.\nV.J. Harris (@victhhe) expands on the beliefs and actions of the Prayers with the Militant Faithful. How they moved away from the Reformed Faithful and how some have taken it a step further and become the Militant Faithful, a sect that gets blood on their hands to liberate the people from their blood-sucking tyrants.\n$50,000 - A Noble Lord and How We Live\nShannon Strucci (@plentyofalcoves) writes the short story A Noble Lord. Some who take the blood do so with the best of intentions: to guide, to lead, to improve the lives of the lesser commonfolk they rule. But the best intentions born into a system such as the Crimson Crown all too quickly go awry.\nAdrianna Burton (@adriiadventures) writes How We Live, showcasing the minutiae of the rebellion through a vignette story with early, middle, and late campaign insert points. Various vignettes adopt the POV of diverse characters that grapple with the price of liberation as well as its benefits.\n$55,000 - Brinkwood 2070, Cardenfell '65, Beneath the Mask and Lorebound\nDyer Rose (@BasiliskOnline)steps forward with Brinkwood 2070: Step into a Cardenfell of tomorrow, a cyberpunk dystopia where Vampires have driven the Brinkwood back and forced it to retreat into cyberspace, where ashwood is cultivated in secret and hunted endlessly, where technology allows the Corporate Vampire Lords to oppress and exploit on scales never before imagined, and wealth and luxury beyond reach are to be had.\nThat doesn\u2019t stop you from masking up and spilling blood, though. Now, more than ever, is a time for rebellion. Now, more than ever, is time to act. Twist those same technologies and advancements to destroy the Vampires that rule from their spires of silver and glass.\n\nAustin (@sailorsctaustin) writes Cardenfell '65: What if Cardenfell was a city/suburb/community in mid 60s America, growing in numbers it seeks to demolish the community nearby of Brinkwood for expansion reasons?\n\nW.H. Arthur (@Aryl_Ether) writes the short story Beneath the Mask. The local gazette in Cardenfell would have you believe the duke as a benevolent ruler. Meanwhile, a brigand goes about their everyday life and sees the city as it truly is.\n\nGinger (@inkyginge) creates Lorebound. Make Brinkwood come alive with rumours, red herrings, strange mysteries and plot seeds. Lorebound are the Shadow of Man and a Glimmer of Fae, twisted by time and magic, they collect and tell the strange happenings of the forests throughout Orslae.\nFINAL GOAL: $75,000 - DOUBLED Mutual Fund\nWe will double our contribution to the San Jenaro Mutual Fund. This fund will be used to jumpstart production of worker-owned tabletop RPGs, such as Brinkwood. With this stretch goal, we're paying forward our success. Our hope is that this will \"seed\" a mutual fund that will allow groups of creators to pay for art, layout, editing, and other \"jumpstart\" costs necessary to produce quality tabletop RPGs, without having to dip into their own pockets.\nFunding - Allocations and Accountings Explained\nBrinkwood was developed in a Co-Op model, meaning that all the business decisions involved in making this game were voted upon by all workers, including our funding and share structure.\nThe funds raised by this Kickstarter will be used as follows:\n$2,200 - Artwork and Graphic Design Commissions\n$600 - Consultant, Advertising, and Other Commissions\n$2,800 - Production Costs\n$2,400 - Shares\n$1,000 - Kickstarter and Backerkit Fees\n$500 - Charge-back Buffer\n$500 - Additional Costs Buffer\nThe funds raised for \"shares\", as well as any additional profits raised by this Kickstarter or through other sales of Brinkwood, will be split according to a democratically approved shares model described below: \nThe net profits of Brinkwood will be divided into \"Share Pools\", with 5% of the net profit going to the San Jenaro Co-Op Mutual Fund.\nThe remaining net profit will be split into \"Share Pools\" as follows:\nWriter - 13%\nEditor - 13%\nLayout - 13%\nPromotion - 20% \nArtist - 20%\nConsultant - 20%\nShare Pools - A pie chart illustrating the percentage shares of the different share pools.\nEach worker will receive shares of these pools according to additional democratically-approved agreements.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady?

You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. We would be happy to add your location as well! \nPlease contact us at feedback@evilhat.com if it looks like your destination is not yet covered, and we'll add it as an option as soon as we confirm the shipping rate for that country/region.\nIf you end up ordering multiple books for international shipment, we will bill an additional $5 per additional item in BackerKit well after the campaign is done.\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or ze/zir) writes queer games about feelings, vulnerability, and caring for one another.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Just a Taste", "descp": "All backers at $10 and up get immediate access to the fully playable prototype PDF.

It\u2019s the nexus of all the \u2019verse, where eternal planes and infinite primes meet. It\u2019s a rough home for cutters and bashers, hungry for coin and glory. It\u2019s a battlefield between the city factions as they fight over territory. It\u2019s a city of gods, demons, and stranger things which lurk. No wonder that scoundrels and freebooters flock to the Nexus of the verse.\nIn the City of Blades, you will play Freebooters who work for one of the minor political factions of Sig. You will help your faction rise the ranks, seize territory, and get ridiculously wealthy so you can retire in luxury.\nIn the City of Blades, you might:\nEliminate a couple of troublesome Enforcers who are causing trouble in your neighbourhood.\nSteal important ritual object from the Goddess of Rivers and Sacrifice to weaken her hold over the docks.\nConvince the Dustkeepers to help you steal the territory currently held by the League of Exterminators.\nNegotiate an alliance with a community of irate refugees who just arrived in the city.\nThis is a game about clever spies, renegade sorcerers and reckless smugglers. You are going to get rich or die trying, so let\u2019s get started.\nSig is a city of contrasts and strange bedfellows. This setting was originally presented in Sig: Manual of the Primes by Genesis of Legend Publishing. The system used is derived from Blades in the Dark, published by Evil Hat Productions. These two elements come together to form Sig: City of Blades.\nThis game is Forged in the Dark, designed to enable bold heists and backstabbing faction politics. Of course, any game set in the nexus of the verse is bound to have a few changes to the rules. Here are a few of the newest elements.\n\nModular Characters\nSig: City of Blades has modular characters, with each Freebooter consisting Culture, Lineage, and Devotion. Culture reflects your Freebooter\u2019s identity and upbringing. Lineage represents your family that shapes your prowess, whether it be by blood, ichor, adoption, or choice. Your Devotion represents your character\u2019s religious obligations and/or faith in one of the immortal Powers of the City of Blades. Each of these provides a pair of potential Advances to choose from, ratings in four Actions, and a Drive (which you can use to reduce stress).\nA sample character sheet of Phentan the Unifier (Draft)\nSample Faction Sheet: Daughters of the Raven\n\n\nThe Map of Sig\nThe city itself has an important role in the game. The game comes with a map of the city which is divided up into 48 distinct pieces of territory which function as claims. Every claim is controlled and defended by one of the many factions of the city, who maintain their position (Tier) and gain benefits associated with them. As Freebooters, your mission is to \u201cliberate\u201d claims from your rival factions though audacious heists and subtle schemes. If you want a workshop, you better seize one from someone else!\nLiving with Consequences\nEnemy actions, bad circumstances, Planar Bargains, or the outcome of a roll can inflict consequences on a PC. Consequences may be minor, moderate, or major in severity, leading to different impacts on the Freebooter\u2019s initiatives. As characters suffer stress, they also expose themselves to more severe consequences based on the GM\u2019s discretion and the fiction.\nMinor: A stumble, unwanted attention, an expense, or a minor injury.\nModerate: entrapment, a curse, collateral damage, or a moderate injury\nMajor: Betrayal by someone you trusted, duress, imprisonment, or a life-threatening major injury.\n\nEvery player portrays a Freebooter; a scoundrel and adventurer who lives in Sig.

Alex Louise Hill will illustrate over a dozen inhabitants of the City of Blades to grace our pages. Take a look at one such citizen of Sig, one of the Waterborn!\nPhentan the Unifier, a weary Riverborn labourer with secrets to hide.\n\nAt $20,000 CAD, we will have enough funds and demand to support an offset print run of the book by our friends at Bang Printing. This will give us higher quality and greater quality physical copies. This will also unlock discounted physical copies for those suffering economic hardship. \nAt $25,000 CAD, we will commission a set of missions for your Freebooters to perform. Quinn Murphy will be the writer and designer behind these new jobs and I am eager to see what he will come up with.\nAt $30,000 CAD, we will create two additional playable crews who represent the Recyclers Cooperative and the Portalsmiths respectively. This will bring us up to a total of five playable factions.\nAt $35,000 CAD, we will commission a four-episode limited series Actual Play podcast of the game. Jeff Stormer, of the Party of One Podcast series designer of Mission: Accomplished!, will coordinate these sessions and show the game off to the world.\n\nBudgeting in tabletop roleplaying games is fraught with difficulty and discourse. We are sharing our preliminary budget in the interest of transparency and a conviction that creatives deserve to be paid for their labour. All of our compensation is derived from the minimum wage of the publisher\u2019s jurisdiction, which is $12.50 CAD, or about $8 USD per hour. Contributors all receive at least this amount.\nCurrent Project Budget\nAll of our internal contributors receive compensation at that rate, which is equivalent to a per-word writing rate of 8 cents per word. Our total internal expenses are $4,480 representing 14 days of writing work (Jason), 10 days of development (Jason), 10 days of Layout (Jason), and 10 days of editing (Christopher).\nAll of our external contractors receive compensation at 150% that rate, which is equivalent to a per-word writing rate of 12 cents per word. The total external contractor amount is $3,520 This includes 10 days of cover illustration (Juan), 10 days of internal illustration (Juan), and 2 days of design consultation (Avery)\nOur base goal also includes a printing and shipping budget of $1,000 CAD based on the minimal print numbers to reach those goals. This base goal also includes budgeted kickstarter fees of $1,000 CAD. If we reach our stretch goals, we will be allocating more money towards internal illustration (Alex), Printing/Shipping, writing/development of missions (Quinn), and a podcast AP (Jeff).\nWe are keeping this campaign simple, with only five reward tiers for you to consider.\n$1: Retailers and Merchants: Back at this level to get notified when the product is available for purchase, and to receive a complimentary PDF of the game along with all other backers.\n$5: HIVE: Community Copy:  Individuals suffering from economic hardship or other forms of marginalization can back at this level to get the game in PDF and ebook formats at a significantly reduced price.\n$15: PRIME WORLD: Community Copy:  Individuals suffering from economic hardship or other forms of marginalization can back at this level to get the game in print, PDF, and ebook formats at a significantly reduced price.\n$25: TETHERWARD: Standard Digital:   Backing at this level will get you the full digital version of the game in PDF and ebook formats.\n$50: RIVERWARD: Standard Print & PDF: Backing at this level will get the full digital version in PDF and ebook formats, as well as a professionally printed, full-colour, hardcover book.\n$75: ETERNAL PLANES: Generous Print & PDF: Backing at this level will get the full digital version in PDF and ebook formats, as well as a professionally printed, full-colour, hardcover book. It will also unlock another 5 slots for the \"Prime World\" tier.\n$90: HIGHSPIRE: Two Tomes:  Backing at this level will get you both Sig: City of Blades and Sig: Manual of the Primes.

Those Kickstarter campaigns successfully delivered their rewards to backers on time. \n\nThe main text for Sig: City of Blades is complete at this point. If personal emergencies prevent our artists from contributing, we have backup options.

There can occasionally be quality control issues with their services, but we will replace and substandard books produced. If we secure enough funding, we will be able to afford a proper print run with a well-regarded, professional and experienced printer, but I have several backup options, just in case. \n\nAnything that goes through the mail system can go astray, but I will replace any missing copies at no cost. This is a particular concern with regard to the use of the United States Postal Service for obvious reasons. We will do our best to mitigate these risks and will do my best to work within the existing shipping budget.\n\nWe are trying to run a kickstarter campaign in 2020 / 5781, which is foolish at best.

Over Arms is set in a world where select people are able to develop an \"Anima\", a powerful psychic manifestation of their own psyche and will. These \"Anima\" are able to  assist their \"User\" in a myriad of ways in and out of combat based on the strengths of their individually unique abilities. In Over Arms players can expect to weave stories of mystery and intrigue as they discover this new world around them and within.  \nA black and white quickstart rulebook was released in 2020 to allow fans to get a closer look at the core mechanics of the game, develop their own character / Anima, and even play a few games with their friends. You can download the Over Arms quickstart rulebook for free below to see if the game is for you! \nDownload the Over Arms Quickstart Rulebook for Free Here!\nIn addition to downloading the free rulebook you can join us on the Official Over Arms Subreddit and the Official Over Arms Discord Server to further discuss the game!\nIn a game of Over Arms, player characters will awaken their \u201cAnima\u201d, a manifestation of one\u2019s own will and psyche that is typically born through an incredibly stressful or emotional event. These Anima come equipped with unique special abilities that YOU, the player, will create and utilize both in combat and while interacting with the world that surrounds you. These abilities are learned by your character only through coming to understand the nature of your Anima and working together in tandem. From character and Anima creation to scenarios and combat, Over Arms is rules-light at its core: RPG newbies and seasoned veterans alike can pick it up, read it, and play a game of Over Arms in just a few hours. \n The game has been structured in a way that provides players with a unique focus on the narrative experience while retaining the love of rolling dice across the table to determine the various outcomes of player decisions. The sky's the limit in Over Arms, this game does not limit your imagination or possibilities by conforming characters or Anima into a constricting \"power system\" and instead puts an emphasis on groups designing their Animas' abilities from the ground up. Want to phase through the shadows? Generate electrical storms? Manipulate thoughts? control fire? or even something more intricate and outlandish? Over Arms makes all of this possible.\nWhile most players portray their characters, one of them acts as the Game Master (GM): this person creates and navigates the characters through a scenario comprised of several different \"Phases\". These Phases work as a simple tool to help the players better understand what their characters should be doing during that time, so that the game never skips a beat or strays too far from its premise. Over Arms holds as much focus on combat as it does narrative, with each encounter becoming more deadly and unforgiving than the last. Within the book you will find plenty of sample stat blocks, items, and relics to use in your own campaigns, along with a unique scenario and a simple scenario generator. \nFeatures of Over Arms include:\nIntroduction to TRPGs and Intro\nPlayer Character and Anima Creation mechanics\nA quick reference for vocabulary\nMoney and social status mechanics\nA Leveling Table for levels 1-10.\nA robust list of Items and Relics\nRules for various Status Conditions\nSample Anima and Abilities\nFull stat blocks and images for enemies\nRules, mechanics, information and much more relating to \u201cThe Mirage\u201d, a strange world meant for dungeon crawling.\nA full bestiary of different creatures that reside in \u201cThe Mirage\u201d known as \u201cAnimus\u201d\nExample Scenario and Scenario Generator\nCombat rules, mechanics, examples and much more.\n Over Arms PDF -\nThis is a copy of the Over Arms book in English, running at about 6x9 inches, at 100+ pages, and will be in full color! It has been laid out by layout mastermind Emanuele Galletto, using the Persona 4 artbooks as Inspiration. It will be in PDF format, and distributed exclusively to all backers through DriveThruRPG.\nEveryone at the \"Supporter\" level or higher will have their name added to a special page on the website under the Over Arms section within their appropriate banner outlined in the \"Rewards\" section.\nEach copy of the PDF comes bundled with both the Condition Cards PDF and the Over Arms Character Sheet PDF.\nOver Arms Physical Books -\nWe're producing hardcover, softcover, and limited edition hardcover copies of Over Arms. They will be roughly 6 x 9 inches, all full-color pages, 100+ total pages. Each copy contains the same content plus some extra materials such as the Condition Cards and Character Sheet. In addition, all physical books will also come with a code to download the digital PDF aside from the \"Retailer Bundle\". These books have been insured of their quality by seeking fulfillment through the popular DriveThruRPG.\nMy mission when creating Over Arms was not only to design a toolkit, but to design a robust and simple game that everyone can pick up and play quickly, with little preparation. You just need paper, pencils, a set of dice, a place to play, and friends with an Anima waiting to be awakened. Explore the relationships, exploration, investigation, mystery, crime, and fantasy that awaits you, and most of all... Enjoy the time spent together playing Over Arms!\n* The game is complete and ready to go: As you have seen above, we already have our final print proofs! This project is not at the start of the game development lifecycle (playtesting, writing, editing, proofing, printing, etc), it's at the very end. All of the major work has already been done.

Join me here in celebrating this milestone with my first ever Kickstarter campaign\u2014an online book release party for the tenth anniversary edition of my book\u2014The Way of Kings.\nFor years I\u2019ve dreamed of turning my stories into a library of beautifully-produced books that go beyond the usual specifications of everyday paperbacks and hardcovers, so in 2015, my team and I at Dragonsteel Entertainment released the Dragonsteel Tenth Anniversary Leather Edition of Elantris.\nPrevious Dragonsteel leather editions. Read them in a tufted armchair, by candlelight, in a British accent, while angels are singing.\nSince then, we\u2019ve published more anniversary editions, including Mistborn, The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages, and Warbreaker.\nWe\u2019ve been able to release these books thanks to readers like you who believe in the stories I tell. So let me take a moment to say thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for loving these characters and worlds as much as I do. I love telling stories, and you are the reason I can continue to do that.\nUPDATE: Wow! My team and I are floored and humbled by the response to the campaign. Thank you for your trust. Thank you for your patience as we will be putting everything together over the next several months to send out to you. And just overall, thank you for making this possible.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve offered the anniversary editions by themselves for reasonable prices. The Way of Kings is so large, however, that we needed to split it into two volumes to maintain the quality and integrity of the physical books. This results in a set that costs more to produce, therefore it also retails for more. We recognize this is your hard-earned money, so we've turned to Kickstarter as a way to:\n1) Give you more bang for your buck.\n2) Bring the excitement of a book release party home to you.\nBook release parties sometimes offer attendees goodie bags full of extra swag. In this case, the more people who back the Kickstarter release, the more swag we\u2019re going to put into your goodie bags, so to speak, mostly in the form of stretch goal rewards, which we'll discuss further down.\nNow, without further ado, I\u2019d like to introduce the Dragonsteel Tenth Anniversary Leather Edition of The Way of Kings.\nPlease note that this is a mockup. The actual product will look slightly different. For example, now that we have the leather from the bindery, it is a slightly darker blue than is portrayed here.\nEach volume is bound in dark blue bonded leather with a hubbed spine and foil stamping in two colors (gold and blue) on front, back, and spine. The interior pages are acid-neutral, Smyth-sewn into the binding instead of only glued, and are printed in two colors: black and blue. It comes in two volumes\u2014the first of which is signed.\nUnbound sample of the signature page in The Way of Kings, Volume I.\n\nThe page ends are gilded, each volume has a satin-ribbon bookmark, and the full-color endpapers present art by Michael Whelan, Howard Lyon, and Isaac Stewart. \nFront endpaper by Michael Whelan.\nBack endpaper by Howard Lyon.\nEach volume begins with an 8-page gallery of full-color artwork, including cover illustrations from around the world, commissioned pieces, and top-notch fan art.\nGallery illustrations. French covers by Alain Brion. Dalinar by Randy Vargas. Taravangian by Tara Spruit.\nIn addition to 2-color versions of all of the original interior maps and art, there are a few new 2-color pieces by Ben McSweeney and K\u00e4ri Christensen, and I want to make particular note of five new end-of-part illustrations by the talented Steve Argyle.\nEnd of Part illustration by Steve Argyle.\nTwo-color map of Roshar by Isaac Stewart.\nSpread across the two volumes are seven new full-color interior pieces by Miranda Meeks, Dan dos Santos, Micah Epstein, Audrey Hotte, Bryan Mark Taylor, and Steve Argyle. \nTwo of the new full-color illustrations. Left by Dan dos Santos. Right by Steve Argyle.\nAdditionally, Jian Guo has created stunning reimagined versions of the chapter arches. \nNew chapter arches by Jian Guo.\nWe are committed to beautiful books, and we've elevated the quality even more with this edition. When you see the final version of the book, we hope you'll agree that it's the finest book Dragonsteel has produced so far.\nI recognize that many of you are perfectly happy with your existing copies of The Way of Kings, in whichever format you prefer. With this in mind, we've created six pledge tiers so you can get involved with the campaign at whatever tier you're most comfortable with. We'll use BackerKit to facilitate add-ons, which will further the customizability of your pledge, allowing you to buy some of the rewards \u00e0 la carte once the campaign is over. Even pledging $1 to the \"make a pledge without a reward\" tier will allow access to the add-on store. More on this later. Here's an overview of the pledge tiers with explanations for the different rewards further down.\nUpdate: We are sold out of all leatherbound books that will arrive (hopefully) by the holidays 2020. We have opened up new tiers that will continue to offer the leatherbound books, but the books won't arrive until sometime in 2021. These books slated for 2021 will still be signed and will also be part of the first printing.\nImages are mockups, not actual photographs. Designs are not final.\nSince the books, the posters, and the other goodies are various sizes and will arrive from the manufacturers at different times, you will be charged shipping for each package we send out, depending on which tier you pledge to. For more information, there's a handy shipping chart in the shipping section further down.\nTo save on shipping (particularly overseas) some of you asked for a tier that has no physical rewards besides the leatherbound. We gave this some thought and don't feel that discounting the leatherbound is fair to those buying it in the other tiers\u2014plus, the amount of work and effort we've put into this has pushed the margins pretty tight\u2014but we think we've found a balance. You can either opt for physical rewards in Tier 4, or you can can opt for none of them in Tier 3, and in exchange we've added this reward to Tier 3: a $10 digital gift card to our store. If shipping is an issue, you can buy digital copies of some of my novellas there\u2014or you can save up for a physical item you want, when you want it.\nYou'll notice that Tiers 3, 4, 5, and 6 have a limited number of backers available. If we sell out of these, we might open up new tiers, but be aware that the leatherbound books in these new tiers won't ship until sometime in 2021, though these books will still be considered part of the first printing of this edition. If we do open new tiers, we will only be able to do it once for Tier 6, capping the signed and numbered copies to just less than 2000 copies total.\nMockup of the 23.75\" x 35.75\" Bridge Four, movie-style poster.\nEven without the stretch goal rewards, each pledge tier comes with the bonus of a Bridge Four movie-style poster\u2014by the amazing Zack Stella\u2014in either digital or physical format. Pledge Tiers 1 and 3 come with 1920 x 1080 and 1080 x 1920 digital wallpapers based on the Bridge Four poster, and Pledge Tiers 2, 4, 5, & 6 each come with a physical 23.75\" x 35.75\" Bridge Four poster\u2014rolled, not folded.\nThis is a mockup, not an actual photograph. Design is not final.\nI'm working on a new Stormlight novella in the vein of Edgedancer, a story about Lift that bridges the gap between Words of Radiance and Oathbringer. The new Stormlight novella will focus on Rysn and will be available as an e-book in all tiers, or in both physical and digital formats in Tiers 2, 5, and 6.\nMockup of The Way of Kings Prime hardcover and e-book. Design not final.\nI understand these are hard times and not everyone has the funds for The Way of Kings leatherbound, so I decided to take something originally planned as a stretch goal reward and give it away for free on my website in e-book and PDF forms.\nThe Way of Kings Prime was written in 2002 and is basically an alternate version of The Way of Kings, which was published by Tor Books in 2010. The Way of Kings Prime is very different from the published book. Think of it as set in a different universe with a completely different plot. If you haven't read the 2010 canonical version, please read that one first.\nThe Way of Kings Prime is what we're calling a Sanderson Curiosity. A hardcover version of it is included in Pledge Tiers 5 and 6, or as an add-on for backers of the campaign. We can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ll ever reprint it once the campaign is over.\nAfter you back the campaign, and before we fulfill your pledge when the campaign is over, we will give you the opportunity to pick an Order from among the ten Orders of Knights Radiant. If Order-specific stretch goal rewards are unlocked\u2014and you choose Pledge Tiers 2, 4, or 5\u2014those rewards will be themed to your chosen Order. (Read further down for more about the stretch goal rewards.)\nFor example, if you pledge $200 for The Way of Kings leatherbound and choose Windrunner as your Order, all five Order-specific stretch goals (sticker sheet, patch, art print, pin, and challenge coin) will be themed toward that Order, using its unique glyph and color scheme.\nNot sure which Order of Knights Radiant to choose? Take the Official Knights Radiant Order Quiz. Or if you\u2019d prefer, you can read about each Order and make a decision based on that. We\u2019ve worked hard to give each Order its own visual identity, so when in doubt, pick your favorite symbol or color scheme.\nWe have prepared ten stretch goal rewards as a way of telling our backers \u201cthank you.\" Each time we unlock one by meeting a certain amount of pledged money or backers, all pledge tiers will get more rewards in the digital art package, and Tiers 2, 4, 5, and 6 will receive more physical rewards. (The exceptions to this are the \"genuine leather\" and \"slipcase\" stretch goal rewards, which only apply to Pledge Tiers 3 through 6.) Thus, the bigger we make this release party, the more rewards the \u201cattendees\u201d get in their goodie bags!\nWe hope all of these will unlock during the course of the campaign, but if there's something you want here and are worried it might not unlock, you can check out the add-ons further down.\nImages are mockups, not actual photographs. Designs are not final.\nPlease note that while we'll carry The Way of Kings leatherbound in our online store after the Kickstarter, we can't guarantee that future printings will have the slipcase and the top-grain genuine leather (if unlocked). Future printings of the leatherbound sold through the online store will be sold separately from any of the stretch goal rewards available here.\nUPDATE: Two hours in and we have already unlocked all the planned stretch goals and reached 10,000 backers. Wow! THANK YOU! You all are the best! So, what's next? On the livestreams leading up to the campaign, we accidentally dreamed up the existence of Roshar's Chromatic Chicken Scouts. We reached 10,000 leatherbound books sold, so we will create another sticker pack, this time themed toward the Chromatic Chicken Scouts. It will match the style of the other sticker sheets, with Ben McSweeney drawing these up with a symbol and wordmark to represent these persistent patch-earners and brave badge-hounds. We can't guarantee that any of the stretch goals will be available in our store after the campaign.\nAnyone who pledges to any tier of the campaign\u2014even if it's only $1 to the \"make a pledge without a reward\" tier\u2014will have access to the add-on store through BackerKit once the campaign ends. These are items that you can purchase in addition to what you already receive with your pledge. For example, if you pledge to Tier 4 and the campaign ends without unlocking the playing cards, you will still be able to buy the playing cards for the add-on cost through BackerKit. If the campaign ends with the playing cards unlocked, you will get a copy of the playing cards with Tier 4, but you will also be able to buy additional copies of the playing cards (and anything else in the add-on store), if you would like.\nAnother example: Maybe you've pledged to Tier 4 for The Way of Kings leatherbound but also want goodies from a second Order without needing to buy a second copy of the leatherbound. We have the Order Pack add-on that allows you to buy the five Order-themed goodies in any Order of your choice at a discounted price from what we'll eventually sell it for in the online store. This, and any of the add-ons, can be purchased multiple times with a different Order of Knights Radiant chosen each time, but please note that some add-ons might have a limit on the quantity you can purchase.\nImages are mockups, not actual photographs. Designs are not final.\nWhile we hope many of these goodies will be sold later in our online store, we can't guarantee availability and pricing outside the campaign. The backer pin is exclusive to the Kickstarter and will only be available in conjunction with the campaign.\nWe love independent bookstores, so as part of the campaign, there will be a few limited vendors who will have copies of The Way of Kings leatherbound as well as some of the swag items. These bookstores include:\nSubterranean Press\nThe BYU Store\nMurder By the Book\nMysterious Galaxy\nPowell's Books\nBorderlands Books\nWe'll have more information about this after the campaign, but the books likely won't be available at these vendors until the holiday season.\nIf you're not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a platform that allows creators to crowdfund their creative projects. The campaign lasts several weeks, and when it\u2019s over, my team will go into full production and fulfillment mode. We will send out Kickstarter surveys, which will allow you to choose your Order of Knights Radiant\u2014if your pledge needs that information\u2014and also to give you the chance to give us your most up-to-date information so that your books and goodies arrive to the correct address in as timely a manner as possible.\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about how to make a pledge on Kickstarter, here's a short overview.\nAfter the campaign, your shipping will be calculated based on your pledge tier and shipping address. Some rewards will have to be shipped separately from others. For example, The Way of Kings leatherbound will be shipped directly from the bindery so that it doesn\u2019t have to come across the country to us before we then ship it back out to you. The rolled posters will be shipped separately in 24\u201d wide triangle boxes. Because of these realities and others, we unfortunately can\u2019t use a one-size-fits-all approach to shipping, therefore, rewards will be sent out in waves (more on that below), and shipping will be charged to you depending on how many packages you are receiving.\nReference the chart below to see how many packages and the total cost of shipping you can expect for each tier. Please note that the Total Shipping side of the chart is not the price per package, but represents the total you will pay for shipping and handling. For international orders, please note that your country might have additional customs fees. We do not collect those. Please check your local regulations for that information.\nWe welcome international orders! However, we unfortunately cannot ship everywhere. Currently these are the countries we can ship to:\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Estonia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greenland, Germany, Croatia, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Malta, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Slovenia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States, Hong Kong, Cyprus, and the European Union in general.\nShipping Update: Special Destinations\nSome of you have asked about specific countries that have been a bit harder for us to ship to in the past, and we've done some research into how to make those happen. We wish the shipping was cheaper, but to make sure we can get the items to you safely, we have to use a specific carrier that costs a bit more. This is also only available on the leatherbound books that will ship in 2021. We feel this is the best option right now, so we've added some destinations that require this special handling. These are:\nArgentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates.\nFor these destinations that require special handling, you will receive the same amount of packages listed under the International destinations in the shipping chart. Like we've mentioned for all destinations, if you do not want the poster, please pledge to our streamlined tier, Tier 3.\nIf your country is not listed, we apologize. It means we haven't been able to establish reliable delivery in that region yet.\nShipping Continued...\nThank you for your patience. We\u2019re learning a lot right now that will help us keep the number of packages and the shipping costs down if we decide to do future Kickstarters.\nWe hope to have most rewards fulfilled by the holidays 2020, but many things like the physical editions of the Stormlight Novella and The Way of Kings Prime will not be ordered from the printer until after the campaign is over and might not ship until early 2021. If we wind up opening extra leatherbound tiers, they will ship sometime in 2021 as well.\nWave 1\nWhen The Way of Kings leatherbound is finished, we will verify all backers\u2019 addresses\u2014including addresses outside of the United States\u2014and then provide this information to the bindery who will ship your books, shrinkwrapped and packaged in custom-fit boxes, directly to you.\nPosters will likely also be sent in this first wave of shipping, both to addresses inside and outside of the United States.\nWave 2\nMany of the stretch goal rewards and add-on items will be produced after the end of the Kickstarter. As soon as we have all of these rewards in-hand (except for the books), we will once again verify addresses before packaging up the rewards and sending them out to you, hopefully in one box of awesome happiness.\nIf your shipping address is outside of the United States, your goodies will be shipped in Wave 3, as described below, to save you on shipping costs.\nWave 3\nThe Way of Kings Prime and the Stormlight Novella are the items most likely to be shipped in this final wave. These will be fulfilled as soon as we get the books back from the printer, but not without once again verifying addresses. Please keep in mind that printing usually takes a few months, but in some cases can take much longer.\nIf you live outside of the United States and have chosen pledge tiers 2, 5, or 6, postage is more cost effective for you if we wait until the Stormlight Novella and The Way of Kings Prime are delivered to us so we can ship your books and goodies together. \nWe hope you will join us for the release of Rhythm of War\u2014the Stormlight Archive Book 4\u2014to be published by Tor Books on November 17, 2020. Find pre-order links here.\nI have the best fans in the world. You've proven that to me time and again as I get to meet and interact with you, so I can't say thank you enough. You are awesome, you are amazing, and you have incredible taste in books!\nYou've read this far, and because of that, I want to give you one last goodie just to say thank you. Life before death, Radiants!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve been producing our anniversary editions for several years now, and before that, we produced some of our own hardcovers, so we\u2019re experienced in the production of nice books and other goodies.

One of the biggest challenges will be getting everything produced or printed and delivered to you in a timely manner.

We don\u2019t want to rush any of these steps because we want to send you the best products we can produce. In addition, as we\u2019ve seen from world events this year, there are sometimes things out of our control that affect more than just supply lines.

A prequel story set in The Messenger\u2019s universe, it tells the story of two Children of the Solstice who will combine the powers of the sun and moon to perform Eclipse Magic, the only force capable of fending off the monstrous creations of the evil alchemist known as The Fleshmancer. \nPromising the Sabotage touch in every system, Sea of Stars aims to modernize the classic RPG in terms of turn-based combat, storytelling, exploration and interactions with the environment, while still offering a hearty slice of nostalgia and good old, simple fun.\nComing to PC and Consoles in 2022.\n Key ingredients :\n Engaging turn-based combat. Combat gameplay includes active player input during attack animations (timed hits), multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and strategic defense options to hinder enemies while they are channeling powerful attacks or spells. For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.\n Unshackled traversal. Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tile-based movement.\n Prequel story set in The Messenger\u2019s universe. Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you\u2019ve come to expect from a Sabotage production.\n Full-on dynamic lighting our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.\n The Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre. Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements in order to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and overly lengthy sequences.\n\n   A prequel to The Messenger \nThe story takes place long before the flood, where many islands are waiting for you to explore. As a full-fledged RPG, the adventure promises intrigue, perils and wonders . Those familiar with our previous work may recognize a few faces and get meaningful insight on some origin stories, as well as hints towards the bigger picture of the universe we aim to develop more with each of our games.   \nThe Messenger - Sunken Shrine\nThat being said, newcomers should rest assured that Sea of Stars is absolutely enjoyable as a self-contained experience and doesn\u2019t depend on having played The Messenger. In fact, it will even work the other way around should you choose to play our platformer second!\nTurn-based combat\nNo random encounters, no separate battlefield: Considering immersion a top priority, combat is initiated by physical contact with an enemy, and battle takes place in the same field as navigation, seamlessly, with no loading or transition.\nNo grinding: Character progression in Sea of Stars flows naturally along with the story, without the need for any grinding. This concept is supported by a combat system which relies mainly on strategy and skill rather than statistics. That being said, you will very much be leveling up, increasing your stats and unlocking new special moves.\nSynergies: During battle, everything is based on building up momentum and effects over a few rounds, to eventually unleash massive damage by cashing out on your build up. Featuring six very distinct playable characters, and a lot of synergies between each of them, there are a lot of ways to take down opponents.\nTimed hits: Celebrating the greats of our childhood, we top it off with a \u2018timed hits\u2019 mechanic, where precise player input will increase damage done by your characters, or mitigate incoming attacks. Losing a battle doesn\u2019t mean you should go back and grind, but rather that it\u2019s time to apply what you learned from the enemy\u2019s attack patterns and improve your execution the next time around. With skill and strategy as your main weapons, there is always ample room for improvement when a particular encounter proves challenging.\nSpell-breaking: Making a point to break the potential linearity of turn-based combat, enemies can mount especially strong attacks or spells. While a good use of timed hits will always remove a good chunk of the damage dealt, even the smallest minion can be lethal if left unchecked while casting. \nEnemies in a casting state display a bar with what we simply refer to as \u201clocks\u201d, each with an icon representing the damage type required to break it. For every broken lock, the ensuing spell\u2019s efficiency is reduced. Break all of them, and the enemy\u2019s action is entirely cancelled. This spell-breaking gameplay mechanic truly comes to life when groups of enemies demand clutch reactions and choices as more than one is preparing a spell, coupled with playable characters capable of combo attacks and multi-hit special moves.\nBoss fights: No RPG would be complete without big bosses, and of course Sea of Stars is no exception. For bosses, we are also looking at breaking the potential linearity of rinse and repeat for x amount of rounds to win. Each boss will present different attack patterns to learn, evolving through manually scripted phases and special events.\n\nBanking on the synergies, timed hits and spell-breaking mechanics, bosses will offer ample room for longer-haul strategies, giving players the freedom to see how much damage they can really deal in a single round with enough preparation time.\nBoost: To shake things up even more, performing a regular attack generates \u201cEclipse Orbs\u201d, which can later be absorbed to double the effect of any action (regular attack, special attack, healing, spells, etc...) \nDepending on the situation, it may be wiser to save your orbs for later, perhaps to quickly get rid of an enemy that begins casting a spell with too many locks, or, in the case of longer battles like bosses, to dish out as much damage as possible once everything has been put in place for damage to be increased during a short window. \nUnshackled traversal - no rigid tile-per-tile movement\nPutting our platformer experience to good use, we make a point for moment-to-moment gameplay to present satisfying controls, micro challenges, and varied traversal opportunities. In other words, venturing through the rich environment should be accompanied by a feeling of freedom. While multiple paths and approaches can lead to your objective, leaving the main road and exploring less accessible (or hidden) areas will be rewarded. \nClimb, jump, run, swim, vault and dive as you progress through villages and dungeons of all kinds. Anytime it feels like you can interact with something, the odds are that you can. Hoist up on rooftops, or jump off ledges into deep natural pools to explore underwater tunnels. Stick to the main objective, or follow your curiosity and see for yourself what wonders lay hidden.\nWorld Map\nTraveling between points of interest takes place in a classic World Map view where adventurers can roam around, free of enemy encounters. Those who like to go off the beaten path will find many optional areas concealing upgrades, vanity items, and side quests. \nSailing\nSince traveling between islands is a key part of the adventure, the party naturally gets its own boat. With full analog control, you will be invited to negotiate waves, and take advantage of the upwards and downwards formations to optimize for speed. While it isn\u2019t anything that will ever block the casual sailor wanting to get to the next objective, we expect a lot of adventurers will be spending extra time sailing the world to play around with waves, look for sunken side-areas, secondary islands, or simply take a break from the hardships of heroism. \nThe boat also acts as a mobile base of operations, which can be explored in close-up character view, where the party is fully settled in, and available for banter and guidance in-between major story beats. \nIf you ever find yourself struck by the infamous \u201chaven\u2019t played in two weeks\u201d RPG curse, you can rest assured that someone on your boat is ready to offer clear reminders as to what you should be doing next. \nFull-on dynamic lighting and shadows\nTo truly convey the story of warriors using the power of the moon and the sun, we had to go hard on the lighting system. Spectacular spell effects thus being a given, the game also features real-time dynamic day and night cycles, which the player eventually gets to control with full granularity.\nFocusing sunlight through a prism in order to open some secret area may only be possible at high noon, while a magic flower blooms exclusively in the evening. You may want to follow a trail of glow-in-the-dark aquatic plants only visible at night, while some monsters like to sleep during the day.\nAll of this ties into properly telling the story of Solstice Warriors , while also allowing for multiple puzzles and mechanisms dealing with light, shadows and reflections. Oh, and to make sure this world truly comes alive, we are also throwing in weather variations! Please back us.\n\nSix unique playable combat characters\nSea of Stars features six unique playable combat characters, each with their own backstory, personal objectives, play-style, special skills, and synergies with the rest of the party. In this multi-layered story, motivations sometimes align in unexpected ways. In the interest of allowing you to go into the game without any major spoilers, we will only be revealing the two main protagonists here. \nBorn on the Summer Solstice, Zale is optimistic and bold. He wields a sunblade, through which he can absorb Eclipse Orbs whenever his attacks need an extra kick.\nAs a blade-dancer, he walks the path of the Guardian God Solen. The Elder Mist foretold that, in order to find his light and achieve his full potential, he will first need to \u201cstare at the night inside of him\u201d.\n\nBorn on the Winter Solstice, Valere shows curiosity and balance. Gifted with Lunar Magic, she can absorb Eclipse Orbs in her moonstaff to dish out massive damage.\nTrained in the martial ways of the monk, she walks the path of the Guardian Goddess Luana. The Elder Mist sees great potential in her, believing she might one day be the one to \u201ccreate paths on water\u201d.\n Garl was born a regular kid devoid of any special powers. Along with his training as a cook, his innately strong constitution makes him a capable defensive fighter, giving him the tools to support his two best friends in their Solstice Warrior duties.\nThe Elder Mist saw something peculiar in the stars about him, as it seemed his heart just may be warm enough to \u201csoothe a long tormented soul\u201d.\nEven though we will be keeping our favorite ideas under wraps for the foreseeable future, we\u2019re happy to show you above a few of the things we've been working on for the protoype!\nFor the sake of your enjoyment once the game releases, we want to be very careful with spoilers. However when it comes to mentors, villains, villagers, critters, pirates and abominations... as a full-fledged RPG, you can rest assured that Sea of Stars will have it all.\n\nSabotage\u2019s award-winning composer Eric W. Brown, AKA Rainbowdragoneyes, is back to rock your socks off yet again. He was so delighted to apply his musical genius to a full-fledged RPG production that he even built his own studio at home!\nIn Sea of Stars, the music and SFX include instruments from all over the world, blending the catchiness of retro music Eric is known for with modern sound design\u2019s best practices. Taking full advantage of the Wwise engine, all things audio are dynamically layered and adjusted to transition seamlessly through day and night cycles, indoor and outdoor areas, weather variations, and, of course, battle. \nSea of Stars is built in Unity, the engine which our technical team has been working with for over 8 years. It is our best companion for fast iteration, as well as the development of the specific tools we need to bring this new world to life.\nEven though the game might seem simple at first glance, a closer look reveals visual effects seldom seen in 2D pixel-art games. Notably full-on dynamic lighting, which was mandatory given the narrative emphasis on the Sun and Moon.\nScalding desert suns, unsettling blood moons, lush underwater bioluminescent reefs, foggy swamps and dark caverns. We have the tools necessary to ensure each environment is brought to life with the utmost attention to detail to take you on a gripping adventure full of wonders.\nFor those interested in the technical aspect, here are a few of the components we are working with to tailor our own rendering pipeline based on URP (Caution : buzzwords ahead!) :\nPost processing effects such as Bloom, Color Correction and Ambient Occlusion\nPixel perfect rendering\nFully dynamic lighting of sprites including normal mapping, pixel depth writing and shadow receiving\nShadow casting sprites from multiple angles and punctual/directional light sources\nVolumetric lighting\nScreen-space indirect lighting\nAnimated Height fog\nWater shading including transparency, refraction, reflection, absorption, subsurface scattering and contact effect\nWater simulation for rivers and oceans\n  Languages\nThe Messenger is known for its quality localization that keeps the story intact, and we won\u2019t settle for less when it comes to Sea of Stars. Everything will be localized by finely selected external partners who have a track record of excellence. Extra care and resources will always be directed towards ensuring that every language our games release in lets their player base enjoy the stories and events at the same level of quality as everyone else.\nAt this time we expect to release with full support for the following:\nPlatforms\nThe game should be completed sometime in 2022, and is designed to be played on PC and console. For specifics, rest assured that we are in touch with the key players of our industry, and that the game will be wherever the players are.\nIt is hard to predict platforms as we seem to be at the dawn of a new era, but we are keeping close watch, have extensive porting experience, and fully intend on supporting all current generation platforms with Sea of Stars.\nNot only is the entire team that brought you The Messenger working on Sea of Stars full time, we also doubled its size!\nWe\u2019re a studio that bets on focus, meaning once we enter production all hands are on deck working full time on a single project. Our team now counts 16 cherry-picked members, all cut from the same cloth and working from our studio located in downtown Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada.\nOperating with minimal management and completely open work schedules, our team is composed of self-driven artisans who seek to be unleashed rather than controlled.\nEven though the vision for the game is clearly defined, everyone is given the tools and encouraged to express themselves in bringing everything they want both to the company\u2019s culture and to our games. \n\nCampaign Stretch Goals\nNeither incomplete nor bloated - A stretch goals philosophy.\nWhatever happens with the stretch goals, the game will get made in its full vision. We won\u2019t tack on features that would bloat the game to add more incentives, or remove systems that would make the game incomplete if we didn\u2019t reach objectives. \nThe Crypt : an in-game memorial site for backers\nFound on a seemingly uncharted island, The Crypt is an underground area built to pay homage to our fantasy world\u2019s founders, or to be more precise, top-tier backers. Keeping things as spoilers-free as possible, it is still worth mentioning that the place is not disconnected from the world\u2019s lore, and will plays some role in the overarching story.\nSupporters of the campaign who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers will be immortalized in the game as a unique interactive object within the crypt. \nThere are 3 tiers:\nCommemorative stone (Level 1)\nA stone in the first room of the crypt, displaying the name of your choice when interacted with. Get it for yourself, or for someone dear to you!\nStatue (Level 2)\nIn the second room, which is a bit more luxurious, you can have your own statue displaying the name of your choice, along with a short body of text. A great place to leave a positive message for other adventurers, or to immortalize your positive intentions for someone special.\nClaiming your statue will be a simple process of selecting how you want it to look by customizing its parts, sort of like in a character creation menu. Body type, hair, height, weapon of choice, clothing, etc.\nMonuments (Level 3)\nThe final room, which the crypt was built around, looks especially beautiful at night, as a sunroof lets the moonlight shine on an array of mirrors, filling the air with magic and peace.\nFor monuments, our artists will get in touch with you to create a fully customized character of your choice. Whether you want to be there as yourself, see the hero you envision taking form, invent a fantasy creature, or show the world a special pet. \nAlso interactive, monuments will display the name of your choice, along with a lengthier body of text.\nWhether you choose to leave a message for the world, pay homage to a loved one, or  write a backstory for your fantasy character, our team will work with you to ensure your immortalized presence in our world is meaningful to you.\nThe Cryptwalker\nIn debating whether or not to add an NPC to The Crypt, we opted to leave it up to the community! It is said that this mysterious character who roams the halls may actually come from a different time, and certainly a different place. Could this mysterious presence be \u2026 you?\nShould someone choose to take it upon themselves to ensure The Cryptwalker is added to the game, they will play a key role in defining the character\u2019s personality. This fully animated character\u2019s appearance will be directed by said backer, and will be quite the conversationalist, telling stories and touching on philosophy, to make sure adventurers who enter The Crypt take some time for introspection.\nRest assured that while your input will be considered to the extent you want it to, we\u2019ve absolutely got your back should you not have many dialog subjects to contribute. We are the studio that brought you The Shopkeeper, after all, and there is certainly more where that came from.\nThe vinyl\nSabotage is excited to partner with iam8bit, who were integral to the vinyl renaissance since their first release in 2010. Since then, they've minted nearly 100 videogame soundtracks on wax, and always do so with a premium ilk, from mastering to design to packaging. We previously collaborated on The Messenger vinyl soundtrack and were super happy with the results.\n\nWhy Kickstarter\nLet us be direct : it would be risky to base the funding of an ambitious project like this on Kickstarter alone. As always, we want to remain fully transparent with anyone who wants to support us : 16 people over 3 years is intense budget-wise for a small studio. Taking the bulk of risks ourselves by reinvesting the gains from The Messenger, all we ask for is to hear a big \"YES\" from our fans and other potential players, enough to feel confident Sea of Stars is a game enough people want to see releasing.\nOf course, it is now common knowledge that the value of a Kickstarter goes way beyond the amount of money raised during the campaign; it also makes for the best early feedback loop a game studio can hope for. Again, we are committed to this project. All we ask for is confirmation that Sea of Stars is something you want to play.\nOn a final note we absolutely want to thank everyone who has been supporting us since the beginning, especially our wholesome Discord community.\nWithin The Messenger was the hope for some connection, that some would \u201cget it\u201d, and choose to share their own experiences so that the values portrayed in our fantasy might, to some extent, live, if only within the hearts of those it touched.\nInspired by the overwhelming response, we chose to trust in our fanbase completely, and were thus compelled to create a crowdfunding campaign to reveal our next project as early as possible. Being so engaged with our community both in chat and through the Alternate Reality Game we run on the server, it would have been truly annoying not being able to discuss what we were so excited about on a daily basis. \nNow that everyone\u2019s in the know about Sea of Stars, the fun can begin, unhindered once again!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are aware that Kickstarter projects often come with a certain level of risk for the backer, but we want to reassure you that this game will be completed no matter what happens during this campaign.\n\nOur team has extensive experience shipping games of all scopes, and we are surrounded by veterans from other studios who we can always rely on for sanity checks and feedback. \n\nIt is our promise to every backer, that to the best of our knowledge and experience, the Sabotage team will always make sure the finances are aligned with the vision, that this vision is clear, shared by the team, technically feasible, and validated by players. Challenging each other is embedded in our culture, and no stones will be left unturned.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Keep me posted!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBacker exclusive HD wallpapers for your desktop and phone\nGet the updates\nYou can upgrade your pledge as long as the campaign is running!

Plus, Decuma can be paired with any tabletop RPG setting or system, including D&D, Savage Worlds, Powered by the Apocalypse, Pathfinder, and more\u2014so you never have to worry about compatibility.\nDecuma uses a unique set of question cards that give the whole experience a feeling of mystical interconnectedness\u2014as if Destiny herself is guiding the campaign! Decuma saves the GM a ton of prep time and can be easily customized to focus on (or exclude) specific aspects of campaign creation. You can use it to add depth to a pre-written adventure or to create a home-brewed world from scratch!\nBest of all: this big world-building tool fits into a little card box! There are no books to lug around! \nClose up of Decuma Cards\n\"Decuma is player investment in a box, at your fingertips, and plays just as well on its own or as the opening to a campaign.\" - Senda Linaugh, She's a Super Geek Podcast \nIt's all in the cards! Decuma splits the tarot deck into three parts, and each part creates a different aspect of your campaign.  \nThe three types of Decuma cards\nCharacter Connections: The Sun Cards - Suits of Wands & Cups\n          Players come to the table with basic character concepts, but by using Decuma they create backstory and connections with one another that enrich the story. It gives the players and the GM lots of story elements to work with so no more strangers meeting in a tavern!\nLocation Building: The Star Cards - Suits of Coins & Swords\nDecuma facilitates collaborative world building for any setting! Whether you need a fantasy village, a generation ship in space or a neighborhood in an urban city, this game can make it! By the end of your session you will have a map to reference during your campaign, NPCs the party can interact with, and cultural elements, such as slang terms or philosophical beliefs. Best of all, the players know the location as well as the GM so lots of explanation time is saved later!\nWorld Dynamics: The Moon Cards - The Major Arcana\n         Your PCs shouldn\u2019t just have history with each other! They have been interacting with the rest of the world too! Who are the party\u2019s allies? What do they believe in? What big event made them famous or infamous? Building another layer on the location and character connections, they players also gets to build a collective history that will impact how they interact with the game world as a party!\n Decuma can be easily customized to fit your needs just by including or excluding cards! \nRunning a pre-written D&D adventure in Waterdeep? You already have a location! Leave out the star cards and just build character connections and world dynamics! \nPlaying a PBTA game like Masks or Demigods that has built in character connection mechanics? Just play with the star and moon cards to build your location and your world dynamics!\nPLAY\n\n\"World building and character creation are often my favorite parts of the RPG experience.

It received critical praise and was the top-selling physical game on itch.io from May 19th - June 1st, 2019.  \nAlthough Virgins & Vixens was released first, Decuma was actually the idea that launched Golden Lasso Games. It's slow growth from a funky idea and some scribbled notes, to a cheap tarot deck with question stickers on them, and finally to a beta-test document and some prototype cards was a long one, but it paid off!\nIn addition to the amazing team of women listed above, Golden Lasso Games would like to thank: Sam Balcomb, Element Mill, Jason Mills, Stu Venable, Kairaku, Foundry 58, Story Games Glendale, Strategicon Conventions, the entire Happy Jacks RPG community, Mel Caylo, Jennifer Kretchmer, Moe Poplar, Clara Allison, Laurie Goldfarb and everyone who has played in games and provided feedback along the way! This couldn't have happened without you!\nFind Golden Lasso Games online:\ngoldenlassogames.com\n Facebook \nItch.io\nWhere is the money going?\n  The majority of our funds are going to two things: paying our artist to do these amazing cards one-by-one and physical production. Each card takes several hours of work and we are dedicated to paying our artist a fair wage. The remainder of the funds are going to pay Kickstarter's fee, paying the rest of the Golden Lasso Games team, and all the rewards for backers.\nHow long will this take?\nWe are estimating that the completed deck will be delivered by the end of 2020. The exact production time is hard to estimate until we know how many of the stretch goals get unlocked. Drawing 78 individual cards takes a bit more time than drawing a more basic deck.\nDigital rewards will be sent to backers sooner than the physical rewards.\nShipping Info:\nShipping costs will be charged after the Kickstarter ends in the pledge manager. Damage may occur during transit by the various shipping carriers used. We wish this was not the case, but it can happen. We are a small business that relies on shipping companies to fill our Kickstarter campaigns.\nPLEASE email us if you have major issues with delivery/loss/damage that cannot be resolved with the carrier (i.e. always try your local post office first) and we will help assist you in resolving them. We will need your backer number, a photo of the damaged item, address and backer name in the email. We request the opportunity to make things right before you give us a negative review. \nThere are many advantages to using a Pledge Manager, such as late add-ons, the ability to change your address as much as you like until we lock them, and a more accurate cost for you, the backer, on delivery costs. \nWe are partnering with CrowdOx for our pledge manager and shipping. \nCrowdOx is our partner for pledge management and add-ons!\nKickstarter Terms:\nThe following Terms are accepted by you, the backer, when you pledge, so we can ensure smooth delivery for all. Surveys not filled in after 2 months of final delivery (from the \"we are shipping\" update) or missing reward requests after 2 months of your game shipment will be treated as a no reward pledge. Please help us get you your rewards by emailing us with any issues you may have and filling in your survey in a timely manner! Watch for updates on all shipping statuses. All our major communications will be via Updates. \nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look of the project and the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active. If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the possibility of a general release copy. We will always do our best to provide exactly what was pictured, but sometimes small details change or a design is removed and replaced with another, etc. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- This is the first Kickstarter project by Golden Lasso Games.\n\nWhile the Decuma team collectively have been involved with many successful Kickstarters, this is our first under the banner of Golden Lasso Games. We have carefully planned out every aspect of this project to ensure that we are able to create a high quality product and fulfill our obligations on time.\n\n- Partnering with an outside company for production.\n\nWe are working with a well-known and trusted company in the manufacturing industry to print our card decks. They have a long record of high quality work and produce goods for a number of large-scale retailers. However, things sometimes happen that cause delays or disruptions. We have confirmed production cost breakdowns with this company, set timelines that give some padding to ensure that we are able to get the product shipped in a timely fashion. \n\n- We are human.\n\nGiving our incredible artist, Samantha, the necessary time to create dozens of individual card designs is large part of the project timeline for Decuma. She is an industry professional with many impressive credits to her name working for companies such as Blizzard, DC Comics, and more, so she is very skilled at project management. However, despite rumors to the contrary, Samantha is not a robot. Even with an expertly planned development schedule things can happen that may delay her work. \n\nIf something happens and Samantha is unable to complete the artwork for this project, we have another artist on standby to take over.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "PDF & Digital Thank You", "descp": "At this level you will receive a PDF version of Decuma, which you can use with any traditional deck of tarot cards.

Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

In Agon, you create and play these heroes, crafting their epic tale into an immortal legend.\nOn their way back home from the war, the heroes have become lost among strange islands populated by mythical creatures, dire beasts, treacherous landscapes, legendary kingdoms, and desperate people\u2014all somehow cursed or abandoned by the cruel power of the capricious gods.\nIt falls to you to seize this opportunity for greatness\u2014to set things right in these lost lands, overcome the trials of gods, monsters, and people, prove the glory of your name, and win your way back home.\nAgon is a game of fast-paced heroic adventure inspired by ancient legends. The Hero Players create heroes who wander from island to island, engaging in contests, resolving strife, appeasing the gods, and seeking their way home. The Strife Player presents each island\u2014its strife, opponents, and other characters\u2014by revealing the situation, asking leading questions, and judging contests.\nEach session contains an adventure on a dangerous island. Every island suffers from strife which the heroes fight to overcome with their strength, courage, and wits. The gods watch and judge, granting favor or wrath, depending on how the heroes resolve the situation. \nEach island takes approximately two to four hours to play through, depending on the size of the group and your desire to wax poetic or dive right into the action. When the heroes leave and continue their voyage, the gods light their way among the stars of the Vault of Heaven, leading them to the next island and closer to returning home.\nThis game is set in an ancient fantasy world of myths and legends. Here you\u2019ll find titanic monsters, vengeful spirits from the underworld, ruthless marauders, conniving kings, vicious gods\u2014and all the other elements of fables and epic poems of old. This setting is yours to play with as you wish. There is no call for historical or literary accuracy\u2014it\u2019s strongly discouraged, in fact. Let yourself be inspired by those enchanting stories, but make your mythic world your own.\nThe racism, sexism, ableism, and other bigotries of the past can be confronted head on or set aside as you see fit. A game of Agon is first and foremost an excuse for you and your friends to hang out together and have fun telling a rousing story\u2014be mindful and include the elements that everyone wants to explore; discard the rest.\nThe first edition of Agon (which we\u2019re now affectionately calling Agon 2006) was written by John Harper. It was a game of battle and competition, which pitted the antagonist against the band of heroes, and in turn the heroes against each other to win the greatest glory.\nThis new edition of Agon written by John Harper and Sean Nittner embraces the friendly competition of Agon 2006 while also rewarding heroes for the strength and compassion required to support one another, form bonds, and extol the virtues of their companions.\nNew to Agon? Here\u2019s what to expect!\nRules for creating your heroes of myth and legend, building the glory of their name, and forging their eternal legend.\nDivine favor, bonds, and pathos for each hero to call upon to reach further than a mortal could. \nIslands full of gods, monsters, and people to challenge your heroes.\nGuidance for the Strife Player, who presents the challenges on the island.\nThe Vault of Heaven to record your progress towards returning home and the ire of the gods.\nA one-roll resolution system that determines which side gets their way, who is best, and who suffers.\nContests and Battles that reveal the heroes' greatness and glory as well as what they care most about.\nPlayed Agon 2006? Here's some changes you\u2019ll notice:\nThe Antagonist is now the Strife Player, and the role is designed to be easier for anyone to pick up and start playing, without the need for prep or extensive rules mastery. \nWe\u2019ve created a variety of islands full of monsters, people, and gods, each with their own desires for the heroes. \nThe conflict system now rewards heroes based on the challenge presented. Whatever difficulty the Strife Player rolls on their dice will match the glory awarded to the hero who is best!\nBattle has been greatly streamlined and gets resolved in three contests. You engage your foe to outmaneuver them, clash to control the outcome of the contest and defend against their threats, and then enter the finale to find out who is the victor.\nThe focus has shifted from replicating the myths of old to playing fast paced adventures inspired by the legends of the ancient world.\nThe Prototype PDF: As a backer of this project, you get immediate access to the current version of the PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes ([[click here]], or see the link under the video up top). We want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you're new to RPGs. The prototype PDF still lacks some art and a few other finishing touches, but there's enough there for you to get started playing right now.\nThe Completed PDF(s): Backers at $15 and up will receive the final, art-complete PDF as soon as it's ready. They will also receive all digital stretch goals (see below) which are unlocked during the course of this campaign.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $25 and higher will receive one (or more, depending) copy of the 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover book with approximately 144 pages and a matte finish on the cover. At our initial funding level, this will be a black and white book\u2014but you can help us make sure it's in color (see below). The book will ship by April 2020. You can increase your pledge by $25 for each additional copy you want to receive. Backers at this level also receive PDF copies of the final book and any digital stretch goals which are unlocked. \nCode for At-Cost Print-On-Demand Softcover: We will also offer a print-on-demand softcover version of Agon, primarily for our international backers who don't want to wait for the physical book to circulate through distribution for sale at game stores local to their country. Backers at $15 and up will receive a special code to buy the print-on-demand (POD) version from DriveThruRPG at-cost (i.e., the cost of manufacturing the book) plus shipping. DriveThru has developed a number of print-on-demand partners outside the USA to help provide options that will ship locally, or at least from a country that often has more favorable shipping rates than the USA does. We've gone with this as softcover both to reduce the cost to you (it will likely still run between $11 and $12 USD not including shipping) and to make clear that the POD book is separate from the official-release hardcover version we're putting into distribution, rather than the same thing. \nFirst Look with Adam Koebel:\nAgon with John Harper, Sean Nittner, Tara Hynson, and Stras Acimovic on Actual Play: \nAgon  with Sean, Rev, Jake, Tass, and Teej on The Critshow: \nStretch Goal 1: Upgrades & More Islands ($20,000)\nOur first stretch goal is all about adding some extra bells and whistles to the book as well as show gratitude to the freelance talent working on the project!\nWhen we hit this goal at $20,000 the Path of Glory package (available to backers at $15 and up) gets its first new items:\n High-resolution digital wallpaper of the book's cover art to haunt your digital workspace\n Six more islands of adventure from the creators of Agon, to be included in the book\nAdditionally all who back at the Heroes of Legend package (available to backers at $25 and up), will receive these upgrades at no additional cost:\n Full color interior art for the physical book\n Beautiful endpapers and the signature Evil Hat spot gloss on the cover.\nStretch Goals 2 & beyond: New Islands! ($25,000+)\nBeyond our first stretch goal we'll bring in other creators to devise new islands full of strife and glory. These will be delivered digitally, at no added cost, for all Path of Glory package backers at $15 and up. \nAllison Arth ($25,000 UNLOCKED): Allison Arth is a poet and game designer who studied ancient Greco-Roman literature and language and literally kept a copy of The Odyssey in her glovebox for a decade so she could always find a way home. She is the creator of Gentleman Bandit and Moonblind (forthcoming), the first two installments of the Western Cantos series of poetry RPGs, as well as Gold & Girl: The Fabulous Grandmas RPG, a heartwarming hack of John Harper\u2019s Lasers & Feelings. She is honored to be part of the AGON team.\nBen Scerri ($30,000 UNLOCKED):  Ben Scerri is a Maltese Australian tabletop- and video-game producer, writer, designer, and community builder, living in Melbourne, Australia. Their work focuses on themes of diaspora, disability/critical illness, self-actualisation, and found family, often through the lenses of their ethnic and queer intersections. When not writer for or about games, they're liking talking about language, cooking, baking, folklore, and fashion.\nWhitney Marie Delaglio ($35,000 UNLOCKED), aka @widdledragon, is a game designer, artist, and creator of the brand Little Wish Productions. Her aquatic roleplaying game, Prism ( https://www.littlewishproductions.com/games/ ), is about sensuality, relationships, and conflict resolution. As a support class in the gaming community, she is an advocator of providing a safe space for intimacy and emotional vulnerability. \nJeeyon Shim ($40,000 UNLOCKED) (she/her) is a roleplaying game designer from both coasts of the continental United States. She\u2019s lived in Oakland, California for about a decade and the greater Bay area for even longer, where she teaches wilderness survival skills and land connection through larping. Her work focuses on bridging the alienation modern urban people often feel from the land and their roots, examining the overlap of race dynamics in land access and larp access, and immersion in the sacred aspects of (re)connecting with the land.\nKira Magrann ($45,000 UNLOCKED) is a tabletop roleplaying game designer, queer nonbinary cyborg, and snake friend living in Columbus, Ohio. She is known best for her most recent games A Cozy Den (about lesbisnakes in winter time) and Something Is Wrong Here (an uncanny emotional love letter to David Lynch's work). Kira has a Patreon where she designs experimental games. She is also the creator of #Aprilttrpgmaker, and the newsletter featuring marginalized creators More Seats at the Table. Follow her current projects at @Kiranansi on twitter. \nJames Mendez Hodes ($50,000 UNLOCKED) (he/him) is a writer, cultural consultant, religion scholar, classicist, and martial artist whom you might know from 7th Sea, Thousand Arrows, some essays complaining about orcs and racism, or his rap translation of Homer\u2019s Iliad. His favorite Greek mythological figures are Atalanta and Asclepius. He lives in the greater New York metropolitan area on traditional Lenape land.\nStras Acimovic ($55,000 UNLOCKED) (he/him) is a game-designing cryptid found when rolling a 6 on a random encounter chart in Central Colorado. He has 2 levels of Programmer, 4 of Game Designer, and a d6 hit die. Stras was first encountered circa 2009 in indie gaming circles, but there are records of him found as early as the 90s. Stras' favorite foods are PbtA and FitD games\u2014particularly Scum and Villainy and Band of Blades.\nMisha B ($60,000 UNLOCKED) is a longtime gamer and GM and fledgling designer working on raising the next generation of geeklings. She's written for Chill: SAVE, Lovecraftesque, Misspent Youth, Dead Scare, Fate of Cthulhu, and served as an editor for #Feminism. You can find more about her at https://blackgirlgameworks.com/ \nAn Age of Myth and Legend, here and now!\nWe've put $10,000 of our own money into getting Agon to this point. With your help we'll cross the remaining distance and get this off to press as soon as possible.\nWe already have the preliminary layout done ([[backers can take a look at that]] right now\u2014check out the linked graphic right underneath the video, up top), which includes some of the art. We'll need a few months to finish up the rest of the art, the islands, and making any adjustments based on feedback as folks start playing the prototype edition. All of this will start once the campaign concludes in October, if not sooner. \nThen it's off to the presses for manufacture. One advantage of Kickstarting is that it allows us to size that print run like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge\u2014just right. Our printer usually takes 2-3 months to turn around a book, although that timeline\u2019s dependent on their availability. We\u2019ve added some cushion to our delivery estimates, and we\u2019re confident that we will ship this on time. We hope to beat that estimate, of course, but when it comes to book production it's best to put a buffer into your schedule.\nYou can be confident that we'll ship on or before our estimated delivery date, because that's been our consistent track record across a dozen other campaigns in the last seven years. Just ask our backers; we keep our promises. Our two most recent campaigns, Uprising: The Dystopian RPG and Tachyon Squadron, shipped within four months of conclusion. We've got a bit more to do here on the artwork front, but we're still very far along in the process, and we're confident we have all the remaining time-factors well in hand. For Evil Hat, it's not so much Kickstarter, as Kickfinisher.\nStretch goals from contributing authors have a separate production timeline. We consider them truly extra content, and that means we don't start production on the stretch goals until after they fund. We may adjust the planned goal order behind the scenes as we learn what the backers are most interested in.\nWe're excited to see what you unlock! Once the campaign concludes we'll put together a plan for getting the funded goals done. There are a lot of moving parts to coordinate (writing, system development, editing, layout, art direction, and artwork), but since these are digital-only they're not vulnerable to any manufacturing hiccups.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up their rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. \nBased on our average shipping cost scenario in the USA, we've set up shipping costs like so:\nFor book-only shipments we're charging a flat $7 shipping fee (media mail + handling costs) for USA addresses.\nHere\u2019s the sad part: we\u2019re only able to offer shipping to the USA. Our shipping options outside of the country would cost more than the actual book in most cases (and would badly distort the funding model we're using for this campaign). However, every reward offered in this Kickstarter will be available to our international fans.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options:\nBack the KS at $15 to get the stretch goals plus a special code to purchase the print-on-demand softcover version of the game at-cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once available (see Your Rewards, above, for more details).\nBack the KS at $10 to get access to the prototype version of the game. Later, buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution (we sell to a variety of international distributors in Canada, the UK, Europe, and Australia). Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately.\nWait and buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution. Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. Without this kind of communication, the chances that a store will order enough quantities for you to be able to get a copy from them go down significantly.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, use a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address and then get packages delivered to it, to you. Those costs will still likely be below what we could offer!\n Game Design, Writing, Graphic Design, Layout, and Illustration: John Harper\n Game Design, Writing, Developmental Editing, Project Management: Sean Nittner\n Consulting Designer: Jason Morningstar\n Editing: Karen Twelves\n Indexing: TBD \n Marketing Manager: Tom Lommel\n Operations and Production, Kickstarter Manager: Fred Hicks\n Kickstarter Video Animation: Ryan Dunleavy\n Kickstarter Video Music: Allison Arth\n Sensitivity Reader: TBD \n Primary Playtesters and Consultants: Allison Arth, Andi Carrison, John LeBoeuf-Little, Karen Twelves, Nadja Otikor, and Stras Acimovic.\n Additional Playtesters: Alice Grizzle, Amber Dean, Andy Munich, Arturo Rubio , Aryana Wills, Ash McAllan, Banana Chan, Ben Scerri, Blake Hutchins, Brit Weisman, Caroline Hobbs, Christian Griffen, Clayton Grey, Colin Jessup, Daniel Wood, David Gallo, DC, Doug Bartlett, Dylan Green, ET, Gabriel Ricardo Freeman, Isaac Thummell, James Mendez Hodes, James Ritter , Jeeyon Shim, Jenn Martin, Jerry Ozbun, Josh Neel, Kaitlyn Fox, Ken Davidson, Kimberley Lam, Laura Fredriksen, Luke Jordan, Matthew Gagan, Misha Bushyager, Morgan Ellis, Noella Handley, Patrick Brannick, Paul Riddle, Philip LaRose, Ross Cowman, Sam Ashwell, Sam Day, Sandy Jacobs-Tolle, Skylar Wall, Sophie Lagac\u00e9, Tara Hynson, Tomer Gurantz, Tony Dowler, Tracy O\u2019Brien, Van Magnan, Venn White, Yoshi Creelman, and many unsung heroes from Conlorado, KublaCon, Gen Con, Origins, Go Play Nortwest, The Game Academy, Secret Orbit Game Nights, and private gatherings.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a great team on this project. Evil Hat is an experienced RPG publisher. We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years. John Harper (OneSeven) is a veteran game designer, writer, layout artist, and illustrator. He has made over a dozen games including Blades in the Dark and Agon (first edition). \n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nKickstarter Itself: Kickstarter management has recently come under fire for undermining efforts by their employees to unionize. Evil Hat unequivocally stands with the employees of Kickstarter United (the intended union) on this matter. At this time the union has not called for boycotts, and has encouraged creators to go ahead continue to run projects. If the union organizers call for a boycott prior to the conclusion of this campaign on October 25th, we will respect the boycott and immediately cancel the project. If they say now is the time for action, we will take action - even if it means leaving pledges on the table. This also applies if a majority of KS employees vote to organize and KS management refuses to recognize the union.\n\nAfter October 25th, if the fundraising concludes successfully, we will honor our commitment to produce and ship the game. You can read more about our position at https://www.evilhat.com/home/a-further-word-about-kickstarter/ \n\nThe Text: While Agon is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket. \n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2019 and 2020. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Agon to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run two or more Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 12+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Numbering now in the trillions, they are a polyglot, cosmopolitan people, organized under a central hegemon: Union. The galaxy is vast before them, and humanity is its mirror. For some, it is a golden age of post-scarcity utopia. For the rest, that golden age remains a dream to be attained. \nInto this roiling galaxy you take your role as a mech pilot \u2014  from cold-blooded mercenaries to honor-bound Baronic cuirassiers, hardscrabble Union regulars to professional Constellar Midnights, Far Field teams at the uncanny edge of known space to the ever-wandering Albatross. Operating with a wealth of licenses from one of the galaxy\u2019s Big Five fabricators, you and your friends play a tight-knit squad of pilots on campaign \u2014 comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Will you fight for Union, working to rectify the crimes of previous administrations? Will you run contracts for a corpro-state, working to advance private interests while lining your pockets? Will you fight to liberate your people from all masters, human or otherwise? Or will you fight only for yourself? \nLancer features a mix of military science fiction and mythic science fantasy. In the setting, conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces, mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpostate agents, and relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking entities. \nIn Lancer, there is promise in the potential, but the hard-won gains of humanity are under serious threat. From the internal: ruthless corpro-states, bitter anthrochauvinist reactionaries, and ponderous oligarchs, to the external: MONIST 1, or RA, an anoriginary being with unfathomable power and unknowable goals; the Aunic Ascendancy, the unbroken heirs of Old Humanity; and more. \nHaving only begun the project of recovering from its own internal political revolutions, Union now scrambles to reassert its control over a galaxy that would fall to chaos otherwise.\nWho will you fight for, pilot? \nLancers relaxing between deployment\nWhat is Lancer?\nLancer is a tabletop roleplaying game that prioritizes four pillars of play: \nRules-light, fluid, narrative play while outside of the mech.  \nTactical mech combat that promotes creative tactics, teamwork and explosive moments of action.\nModular, progression-based mech customization where narrative, setting, and character is imbued in the gear, systems, and equipment your character chooses. \nA play loop that encourages narrative advancement. \nLancer offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player backgrounds to prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room for any narrative you and your group want to tell. It\u2019s best with a group of 3-5 players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign. \nLancer draws thematic inspiration from various media: The lived-in, cosmopolitan, working class CRT retrofuture of Aliens, Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Akira, and Cowboy Bebop; the science fantasy of Dan Simmons\u2019 Hyperion Cantos, Bungie\u2019s Destiny, Ursula LeGuin\u2019s The Left Hand of Darkness, Moebius\u2019s The World of Edena and Arzach, and Anne Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy; the soldiers-on-campaign tension of The Thin Red Line, Band of Brothers, and Platoon; and the subjectivity-fraying uncanny of Tarkovsky's Stalker, Cronenberg\u2019s Videodrome, and Evangelion\u2019s Angels. \nMechanically, aspects of Lancer\u2019s play owe particular thanks to existing media for inspiration: Schwalb Entertainment\u2019s Shadow of The Demon Lord for its Accuracy/Difficulty system; the Armored Core series for its modular mech customization; and to John Harper\u2019s Blades In The Dark for its downtime systems.  \nWhile we have a significant number of finished art and lore in the book already, we imagine the final product to be part setting book, part ruleset, and part art book \u2014 a rich resource for not only roleplaying tools, but narrative-inspiring art and worldbuilding. \nBruja introducing her Gorgon\nWhat Does Lancer Do Differently?\nThere are clear, differentiated rules for narrative play and tactical combat.\nNarrative play and tactical combat demand different rule sets and scales of play. Whether you want the game to move at a fluid, narrative pace in order to zoom in or expand your story, or jump right into tactical mech combat, Lancer establishes clear guidelines for when and how to implement differing styles. \nLancer offers systemized downtime and brings narrative-enhancing structure to the play session.\nLancer has a clear play structure making it easy for game masters of any experience to run a dynamic campaign. Players can take downtime actions with defined outcomes to progress story beats, work on projects, or get access to resources. What they do during downtime impacts how their missions begin, progress, and end. This structure prompts clear goals, stakes, and personal involvement from the characters that will help your table to bring storytelling, role-playing, and consequence to every game.\nLancer\u2019s character system is classless, modular, and encourages deep customization.\nWhen you progress in Lancer, your pilot permanently gains licenses that grant them access to parts and gear from a mech of their choice. Unlike other games, however, you are not locked in to a set character path - instead you will create your own personalized mech. Your pilot can mix and match any parts you like, creating a system where players define their own roles by the choices they make. Build broad or deep \u2014 your pilot is your pilot, and your mech is your mech. \nFlavor, characterization, and setting drive every aspect of Lancer \nNearly every gear option has lore attached to it, further defining the history and tone of the setting as well as acting as hooks for deeper player characterization. When you take licenses from the IPS-Northstar Raleigh, the gunslinging mech with the MJOLNIR chest cannon, you know exactly what you're getting.\nOda and his IP-N Raleigh, deep desert\nYou can already play the pre-release version of LANCER here (the link or clicking on the title above will take you to our itch.io page where you can download the game) and download a fully working version of our companion app, COMP/CON, here. This is the full game, totally free and currently being played by dozens of groups, but without a lot of the art, layout, and editing that's the goal of this kickstarter. Even after release, we will always have a free version of LANCER available on all platforms.\nAfter nearly two years of development, play testing, and community building, we wanted to take the next step and finish Lancer\u2019s first edition core book in proper form: hardback, with full color, professional editing and layout, and packed with art by some of the best illustrators working in comics and concept design today. \nClick through for a larger size\nLancer is a large project. Roughly 560 pages of finished text \u2014 rules, setting information, lore, generators, NPCs, and many more tools for Game Masters \u2014 almost 20 artists, and millions of possible gear combinations. We\u2019re asking for a fair amount to fund this project, but we think it\u2019s just that \u2014  a fair ask. \nClick through for a closer look at the MkII Sherman\nOne of the things we want to make clear is that we don\u2019t want to keep anyone from playing Lancer. Despite the campaign to raise funds necessary to create a final product, we mean to keep a version of Lancer free \u2014 always. We've gone almost two years in public development of this game and intend to keep the game available for the community to play and enjoy.\nLancer is the second TTRPG from Tom Parkinson Morgan, creator of Kill Six Billion Demons and Broken Worlds, and Miguel Lopez, a fiction writer based out of Portland, Oregon.\nMassif Press is a new publisher made up of Tom Parkinson Morgan and Miguel Lopez.

These are four (five???) mechs not included in the core book. This supplement will be available for wide release some time after our campaign concludes, but we are including it early and for free with all pledges.\nThe Long Rim Mechs\nEveryone who backs this campaign \u2014 at any level \u2014 will have access to any additional social stretch goals we unlock, as soon as we can deliver them.  \nWhat are social stretch goals? Pretty much what they sound like: they're unlocks tied to social engagement, not money raised. \nWe're going to include some additional simple social stretch goals attached to how many backers we have.

Expect a Twine game to be delivered no later than the physical copy's launch date. \nClick through for the social stretch goals\nAs we gain in backers, we will release the art and details for the four Long Rim mechs above, so stay posted!\nWe amazingly blew through our first stretch goals in the first 6 hours of this campaign. This means all backers at the PDF tier and up will receive digital copies of No Room for a Wallflower, Lancer's first official campaign module, and three Field Guides, setting and lore guides for the various areas of the Lancer canon. Delivery for these digital-only rewards will be some time in 2020.\nSince we're predicting our physical book will be ready to ship no later than March 2020, and shipping quotes are only good for a brief window (comparatively speaking) we're going to hold off on charging shipping fees right away; we don't want to under charge now and then have to charge you again when it comes time to fulfill your pledges!\nAs soon as we're ready to ship, we'll send out a notice via BackerKit \u2014 that way we can ensure you'll have the best possible price on shipping. So, for right now, you don't have to add anything to your pledge beyond the stated pledge level! \nIn the meantime, here's an idea of what we're projecting for shipping costs (subject to change, of course, all prices in USD):\nDomestic shipping (US) will run a flat $12.00.\nCanada, UK, EU, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and Japan is a flat $25.00 USD.\nShipping to New Zealand is $27.00 USD\nShipping to Switzerland and Norway is $45.00 USD. \nAnd shipping to the rest of the world is $51.00 USD.\nNote that these are all subject to change. If you're snagging a physical book, be on the lookout for further communications via BackerKit.

While this is Massif Press' first campaign, we are confident in our timeline and our product. \n\nHere's why:\n\nThe text for the Core Book is done save for a final copyedit and layout, has been available in progressive editions for free since July 2017, and has a robust play and homebrew community. If you're new to Lancer or on the fence about backing, you can check out the full game for free, request a PDF of an older edition, or come chat with the dev team and homebrew/fan community on the Discord. We're passionate about this project, and intend to use the funds raised by this campaign to pay our layout artist, editor, and general artists to polish this book with the finish we feel it -- and its fans -- deserve. \n\nSo, to that end, here are the risks we face: \n\nDeadlines. As soon as the campaign wraps and we can pay our team, they'll get working on art, editing, and layout. As long as they stick on deadline, we'll meet our final PDF fulfillment date. We don't anticipate any delays as long as we are able to get deliveries from our art team on time.\n\nPrinting. Once our final PDF is sorted out, we'll be working with our printer to get the first run of books on time. As soon as the final product is proofed and the first run is printed, we'll get physical copies sent to the backers that pledged for them. Time and shipping are the risks here -- we'll be communicative and up front with all backers who come in at this level, and expect physical fulfillment no later than March 2020. In the meantime, you'll always have access to the free PDF, and the Premium PDF as soon as it's finished.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Ominet Access", "descp": ">//ACCESS is TRUE and PERSISTENT\nWant to follow along with development?

But its low screen positioning and fixed keyboard forces users into awkward postures, causing neck-and-shoulder pain and diminished comfort.\nProblem is, the traditional laptop stand is too bulky to carry around and often takes a lot of time to set up - turning it into a productivity-killer. \nWe set out to make sure every road warrior can work absolutely anywhere with ease and comfort. That's where MOFT comes in. It\u2019s lightweight, portable, convenient, patented and feels \"invisible\" \u2014\u2014that it is MOFT invisible stand.\nWe truly believe\u201cGood design is invisible\" and put this philosophy into creating MOFT: unseen when attached, unfelt when worked on, unnoticed when carried. \nYou will never be troubled by forgetting to take a laptop stand when going out, because MOFT acts as a natural, seamless appendage of your computer.\nNothing extra, only simplicity and reliability. Everything is \"feeling right\"  and you don\u2019t even notice it.\nEnjoy ergonomic comfort anywhere and anytime\n #Update 5: Stretch goal unlocked: A fancy diamond color is now available on MOFT! \nWant to know how to pledge it? Check it here!\nPLAY\n\n We're super excited to get an honest review from Unbox Therapy, Thank you!\n\nIt's very easy for you to use MOFT stand and only takes One Second to open and close it. so you won't have a frustration of spending much time on packing and unpacking the device.\n Plus, MOFT is always with the Laptop, so you have the same mobility you are used to.\nWeighing a mere 3 oz. and only 1/9\u201d thick, you just might forget you\u2019re carrying MOFT around with you. And for the benefits MOFT stand provides as a mobile workstation, its small measurements are that much more impressive! \n\nMOFT stand is constructed with unique PU and fiber glass material, meaning it\u2019s as strong and stable as other bulkier stands at a fraction of the size! It can hold up to 18 lbs.\nIt's compatible with a wide range of Laptops - Fits up to 15.6\" Laptops\nWith built-in magnets, you can unfold MOFT stand quickly and it securely attaches to the flat surface.\nBuilt-in Magnets\nMOFT stand is equipped with two elevation adjustments, making it easy to find the ideal height and comfort.   \nThe high-lifting mode significantly optimizes on your sitting posture, applying a 3 inches elevation to your computer screen. \nThe low-lifting mode takes a 2 inches elevation and can be perfectly adoptive to standing desks.\n  MOFT stand\u2019s removable glue lets it conveniently attach and detach from your laptop without leaving a single mark or scratch, re-attaching with the same strong effectiveness.\nHow to clean the dirt off the glue pad?\nMOFT stands for \u201cMobile Office for Travelers\u201d. A collective focused on creating innovations that boost productivity from a variety of angles.  \nAs a multinational team with people aged from 23 to 33, we are on our computers at least eight hours a day, often on our laptops in a mobile state - from airplanes to rail, from cafes to parks, anywhere and everywhere.\nAnd that has caused several of us to suffer from serious physical problems, specifically cervical spondylosis. We have tried many laptop stands on the market, but we are not satisfied with them.  They are often a burden to carry around and a chore to set up, and sometimes,  you may always forget to bring it. \nSo, we decided to develop an easy-to-carry, lightweight laptop stand that was sturdy, ergonomically superior and aesthetically seamless.\nOver the following three years, we spent time, effort and expense researching and then creating several prototypes, until we produced a laptop stand we wanted ourselves. And not only that, friends of ours wanted it! We were on to something.\nFrom there, we made a number of crucial improvements to the angle, material and craftsmanship in an effort to reach laptop stand perfection.\nIn that process of creation and refinement, we also became determined to make the eventual retail price as low as possible.\nWith this entire package of quality, innovation and affordability finally coming together, we decided to bring MOFT to Kickstarter, and to the people. \nWe are excited and proud to present MOFT laptop stand to you. We hope that all our research, work and creativity has produced a product that will change your mobile life for the better.

Each player chooses one fighter from among a vast, diverse cast, and does battle against an opponent's fighter. \nEach fighter has their own selection of cards which are unique to them, as well as a pool of cards which are shared among all fighters. By linking their unique styles to the standardized bases, fighters can form original moves with many different interactions. \nFighters also possess Unique Abilities (or UAs) which are new sub-systems that interact with their abilities. One fighter uses elemental stances, while another can charge powerful spells over time. One fighter sets up environment effects on the board, while another might control drones which attack at range.\nThere are nearly 100 fighters available in BattleCON, and no two have the same Unique Ability. \nCheck out a quick video of how to play BattleCON! \n                                      Beyond being the most critically-lauded fighting card game on the market, BattleCON is also a central part of a continuing series of games: the World of Indines series.\nThe persistent story and world brings characters to life among our many other games. The development of the world, characters, and story over time are just another part of the game's broad appeal. \nWhile you don't need to play any other game in the World of Indines series to enjoy BattleCON, you may recognize your favorite fighters and their mechanics in games such as Argent: the Consortium, Pixel Tactics, Disc Duelers, Seven Card Slugfest, Sellswords, Millennium Blades, and Empyreal: Spells & Steam! \nWe have one of the best competitive gaming communities on the internet. Join our Discord server to meet fellow fans and dueling enthusiasts, and participate in Organized Play to earn awesome rewards for you and your friends!\nOver the past 7 years, BattleCON has racked up tons of critical acclaim by top reviewers. But you don't have to take our word for it\u2014check out the reviews! \n                          BattleCON: Unleashed is the storage box you've been waiting for. At 17x13x8.5\" (approx. 43x33x21cm) this box is being built to hold up to 110 fighter tuckboxes, a game board, and rulebook.\n3d mockup - box design not final\nIn addition to a big storage box for your fighters, Unleashed comes with tuckboxes and base sets to bring BattleCON: War and BattleCON: Fate up to the high component standard set in Trials. In total, it includes:\n30 tuckboxes (for all fighters from Fate and War, plus Borneo and Juto)\n30 extra Base sets (for all fighters from Fate and War, plus Borneo and Juto\u2014Force Special Actions are included)\n~95 cards to Update Fate, War, and Trials\nAll stretch and social goal content unlocked during the campaign, including:\nBattleCON: Unleashed and The Grand Chronicle are being printed to order, which means only a few leftover copies will available in our online store after the project ends. We do not plan to reprint Unleashed or The Grand Chronicle\u2014once they're gone, they're gone!\nBattleCON: Devastation is the biggest and most fully-featured box in BattleCON's long history. Containing 30 fighters, 5 different play modes, 6 solo/co-op dungeons, and 4 massive boss battles, Devastation is one of the most full-featured tabletop games ever realized. \nWe've remastered Devastation, bringing it up to date with:\nBalance changes and templating updates (Yes, this means Voco is playable and Arec is no longer god-tier)\nForce and Life Counters\nFighter tuckboxes\nRetuned and clarified play modes\nTwo completely new fighters\u2014Gar and Neuromille Kei\nCurrent rules and other trappings associated with current BattleCON games\nAlready own Devastation? The Upgrade kit (included with any CONTINUE tier or as an add-on) patches the original Dev and gets you the two new fighters included in the full Dev: Remastered.\nThe upgrade kit does not include a new box, board, BattleQUEST book, arenas, or any components for the original 30 Dev fighters. BattleQUEST does not have any mechanical changes with this update.\nWanderers contains ten brand-new fighters created by veterans of the series, tuned and balanced meticulously by our design team!\nWanderers is a complete, standalone game, just like other entries in the BattleCON series. Any fighter in Wanderers can compete with any fighter in any other BattleCON game, and the complete contents of Wanderers will fit cleanly into the BattleCON: Unleashed big storage box! \nDesign not final\nThe Grand Chronicle is the culmination of years of lore-writing, character design, and artwork. It covers the whole of the World of Indines, including side titles like Pixel Tactics, Disc Duelers, Empyreal: Spells & Steam, and Argent: the Consortium, plus concepts from a few upcoming projects we're working on!\nDivided into sections by game according to the world's timeline, the book contains the complete saga of Indines lore as presented in current games, along with extended art galleries and lore. It's the ultimate companion for any World of Indines Fan! \nThough Unleashed is the last BattleCON Kickstarter project we plan to do, we intend to continue maintaining the game through tournaments, balance patches, and periodic character/box releases. Our most important legacy of BattleCON is in BattleCON Online. \nBattleCON Online is currently in Early Access on Steam, and our plan is to continuously develop it with new characters, new modes, and new balance patches. It's the best way to play with friends and rivals from across the world and hone your skills! \nTo give you a head-start on BattleCON Online, we're giving away some special early-access BCO content! Every backer at the $5 tier or above will receive:\n                                                                                                                                                              After the campaign ends, you'll be able to use the Pledge Manager to choose any add-ons you'd like. Please note that add-ons may increase your shipping costs beyond the estimates listed on this page.\nOur add-ons in this project are a little bit different than other Kickstarter Projects. Because some of these games exist already and have limited quantities, we ask that you do not pledge for add-ons at this time. The chart of available add-ons is only included for informational purposes.\nPlease wait for our Pledge Manager to back for add-ons, to prevent us from overselling any game and having to issue refunds.\nWe have a ton of stretch goals planned for the project. If you're getting BattleCON Unleashed, you're getting ALL stretch goals we hit!\nOur goals fall into a few broad categories: \nNew Costumes: These alternate costumes come with a new costume card and a punch standee featuring that fighter. They won't feature alternate abilities, but they will still be a nice touch for showing off your favorite fighters! (Included in every copy of Unleashed)\nBase Sets: These sets of 6 standard bases will feature alternate art. You can sleeve them together with your favorite fighter to give their kit a unique look! (Included in every copy of Unleashed)\nOnline Rewards: Bonus costumes and early access fighters can be redeemed directly inside BattleCON Online! (Not available via Pledge Manager)\nNew Fighters: New Fighters will have complete, tournament-legal kits, as well as tuckboxes, standees, and everything else you'd expect in a new fighter! (Included in every copy of Unleashed)\nRather than do the usual \"post on Facebook/Twitter/BGG X Times\" goals, we've decided to do something fun and really get the creative community involved in this project!\nWe've created 6 categories for fan-created content. Submit content in one of these categories and we'll add it to our total. After 20 submissions in any category, we unlock an updated, re-balanced reprint of a classic promo fighter. After 40 submissions, we unlock a secondary costume for that fighter, included in their kit.\nShare your creations with us via Kickstarter direct message or through our submission form. They may even show up in The Grand Chronicle!\nEach backer may make one submission in each of the six categories below:\nFanfic - Post an original fan-fiction on fanfiction.net or the blog of your choice featuring at least one World of Indines character!\nFan Art - Post an original sketch or full illustration of any World of Indines character on a blog, art site, or social media.\nCosplay - Post a picture of an original World of Indines character cosplay on a blog, art site, or social media.\nFighter Custom - Post your own unique fighter kit on boardgamegeek.com, /r/BattleCON, or another fan community of your choice!\nEvent - Host an Organized Play Event for BattleCON at your local game store or other public venue. Take some pictures of your event and share them on social media! Streaming BattleCON Online or Tabletop Simulator Games also counts as an event!\nGuide - Write a fighter guide on boardgamegeek.com, /r/BattleCON, the steam discussion forums or a favorite site of your own!\nShipping will be billed in Pledge Manager after the project ends. A copy of Unleashed with all stretch goals unlocked will be fairly heavy, weighing in at about 9 lbs (4 kgs). Here are estimates of what shipping will look like for various areas around the world.\n* All non-UK countries in European Union\n** China, Hong Kong, Macao\n*** Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam\n**** The Perfect and Core Collection will ship as two separate packages.\n+ Launch Party and Fighter's Circle Pledges will be roughly 5 times the shipping cost of the New Game Plus Tier (with an additional 1x for each set added).\nOur shipping is EU, Canada, USA, Australia, and China-friendly! Backers in these countries/regions will not have to pay extra VAT/Customs charges.\nIf your area isn\u2019t listed, it is because we do not have a fulfillment center in that area. Please check USPS Priority mail rate to your area for shipping costs in these cases.

Scott Taylor Retro-Fantasy Book Launch"}}, {"backer": "Don Schlaich", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What's Going On Here?\nI've been self-publishing my comedy-fantasy-adventure webcomic The Order of the Stick in paper format since 2005, but one of the hardest parts about doing it all on my own is keeping the older books available. This project is designed to get at least one of those books back into print. The Order of the Stick: War and XPs was the third compilation of the color webcomic, covering a bunch of cool battle scenes like this and this and even this. Look, here's the cover now:\nProblem is, we ran out of copies sometime in 2010. That means that many readers (especially those who only discovered the comic in the last two years) have had no opportunity to get it. Because it's such a long book (288 full color pages, the longest OOTS book yet), the cost of a second print run has been too high for me to raise on my own. Readers ask me every week when it will be available again, and thanks to Kickstarter, I now have an answer: Now (or never).\nThe goal, listed over in the top right corner, represents the amount of money we need to raise to print the minimum number of copies of War and XPs to place it back in stock on our website and in local gaming shops around the world (plus enough extra to cover domestic shipping for the pledge rewards and such). If we reach that goal, then I\u2019ll call the printer up at the end of this pledge drive and begin printing almost immediately. If we don\u2019t reach that goal within 30 days, though, no one will be charged anything; you only pay if the project is successful. (Obviously, if the drive is not successful, the book will also stay out of print for the foreseeable future.)\nWhat's In It For Me?\nGood question. Well, take a look to the right and see the different rewards that are available for different pledge amounts. You'll notice that most of them include a newly-printed copy of War and XPs, which will ship once they've been reprinted. But that's only part of the story.\nIf the drive is successful, everyone who pledges $10 or more will get a special never-before-seen The Order of the Stick story in PDF format. Titled \"How the Paladin Got His Scar,\" this tale tells the story of how Azurite soldier O-Chul first joined the Sapphire Guard and includes appearances by many of the other Azurite characters from the online comic. I worked out the basics of this story for last year's Snips, Snails, and Dragon Tales book, but it ended up being too long to include. If the drive is successful, I'll go back, finish it, and release it to everyone who makes the minimum pledge as a digital file.\nFurthermore, with most pledges, we'll also be sending out a brand new Roy Greenhilt fridge magnet, matching the ones we've made in previous years featuring OOTS characters Belkar, Elan, and Vaarsuvius. This magnet is exclusive to the pledge drive, so this is pretty much your only chance to get it.\nFinally, we have a handful of premium rewards available for backers who really want to show their support (or who just happen to already own War and XPs), including crayon drawings of your favorite OOTS character by creator Rich Burlew (that's me again); a chance to commission an additional OOTS story featuring your favorite character; and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get a walk-on cameo for your favorite D&D character in the actual The Order of the Stick webcomic! Seriously, they'll be part of the story forever. It doesn't get much more exclusive than that.\nWhat If You Beat Your Goal?\nThe best part is what happens if we go over that goal, though. The more that is pledged, the more copies can be printed, ensuring that the book stays available for new readers in the coming years. But if we get enough money, we can also reprint our original prequel book, The Order of the Stick: On the Origin of PCs, which has been out-of-print for almost as long. Since this is a portion of the story that has only ever been available in print, that'll let more people discover the otherwise-hidden origins of Roy, Haley, and the rest of the Order of the Stick.\nIf we get close to that goal, we'll let everyone know (and add the ability to get copies of the book to the reward options). And if we get that far and still have time left, all additional funds pledged will be saved toward reprinting the next book that needs it, No Cure for the Paladin Blues.\nWhatever happens, thanks to all the fans who have been waiting patiently for me to come up with a plan to get this book into your hands. With luck (and enough support), we'll get the whole The Order of the Stick story back in print in time for the next new chapter to be published.\nWhat If I Have No Idea How Kickstarter Works?\nIf you're not familiar with Kickstarter or how it will work, here's a brief overview (or you can read the official one, here). For the next 30 days, you'll be able to make pledges to help support this project, ranging from $1 to whatever you can afford without your spouse/parent/financial advisor slapping you. For your pledge, you can select one of the reward packages\u2014listed to the right\u2014of equal or lesser value to your pledge. You can always pledge more than the minimum to get a reward if you want (and for some packages, you'll need to do so if it must be shipped internationally). Your credit card or other account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge, and you can change your mind right up to the final deadline.\nIf the final deadline comes and we've reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged at once and we get to work printing and mailing books and magnets and whatnot. But if for some reason we don't meet our goal, then the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone just keeps their money. So there's no risk of putting up money and then the reprint project never getting off the ground. Of course, if we fail to meet the goal, then no one gets any rewards, either, and some of those rewards are pretty cool, in my highly biased opinion.\nWhat If I've Never Heard of The Order of the Stick?\nWhy, then you're missing out on the finest tale of comedy, action, and adventure ever to be serialized on the internet using brightly-colored stick figures. The Order of the Stick is a webcomic by Rich Burlew (me), started in 2003 and continuing ever since. It tells the tale of the eponymous band of heroes living in a fantasy roleplaying game world as they struggle to overcome their enemies, their environment, the rules of the game, and their own crippling incompetence (not necessarily in that order of importance). Much of the story is available for free on my website, Giant in the Playground, too. \nThe story starts here, though be warned that the art is pretty crappy at that early stage, and the roleplaying game references are numerous and dated. But it gets better after that, such that I would rate the current art as \"less crappy\" and the gaming references as \"virtually unnoticeable.\" It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy a fantasy epic that doesn't take itself too seriously while still delivering a good story, you might like it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #83", "update_userinfo": "Update for End of 2020", "update_content": "Hey gang, here's a quick update to basically just let you know I'm still here.

This Kickstarter has been an amazing ride of thrills and gratitude. I'm pretty sure I burnt out my quota of exclamation points for the entire year. For more information about The Monster Alphabet, be sure to check out TheMonsterAlphabet.com\n---\nThe Monster Alphabet is a 26-page board book based off of legendary monsters and the alphabet. It's written by Darren J. Gendron, and illustrated by Obsidian Abnormal, the creative team behind http://www.HelloWithCheese.com\nWhen I found out I was going to become a father, I wrote The Monster Alphabet. I wanted a book to read to my son that was filled with nerdy delight, and came up with an alphabet based off the monsters of legend.\nInitially, I wasn't sure what to do with it. I asked my art partner, Obsidian, if he'd be interested in drawing it, but time was a serious issue for us (we create Hello With Cheese and he also creates Commissioned). So I asked our audience if it would be OK if we weren't funny for one day of the week. And Monster Mondays was born.\nThe monsters sweep across as many cultures as I could fit. It has some surprise selections, leading to some monsters that even most parents will not have heard of.\nEach monster has a verse in iambic heptameter, a revival of a 17th century poetry technique. This is crucial for bedtime stories, as the gentle rhythm will help lull young-ones to sleep.\nFor the book, we're adding a couple things. First, a pronunciation guide. This will help you tell your little ones about the Xiuhcoatl or the J\u00f6rmungandr. Each monster will have its origin listed, and we add in some fun facts about the respective legends.\nThe most difficult thing about creating the Monster Alphabet was finding a publisher that can do really good board books. This 28-page book is a bit of a monster in itself, as it's rare to get a board book with this many pages. But we've lined up a quality printer and will have this on the printers on Jan. 30.\nA note on the Book Tour Appearances - For most cities, we're only able to show up on the specific date listed. Backers do not need to pay for travel or lodging costs. If you own a bookstore or comic shop that is outside the listed city limits, please contact me before bidding. If you are buying a backer reward on behalf of a library, please first make sure the library will be able to host a reading, and please also understand that the 20 books must be donated to the library. The library may do whatever it wants with the books, including adding them to its collection or donating them to attendees of the reading and signing.\n---\nThe 500% bonus backer bonus has been reached! Now every backer pledge of $12 or more will include a free Hello With Cheese Postcard.\nThe $5,000 bonus backer bonus has been reached! Now every backer pledge of $12 or more will include a free custom Monster Alphabet bookmark.\n\nThe $7,500 bonus backer bonus has been reached!

We\u2019ve got our noses to the grindstone and we\u2019re working hard to make this a success.\nYou've made THE KEYS OF HELL AND DEATH possible, and now we've got a new goal to push for: if we hit $6,000, we\u2019ll be able to offer custom THEY BECAME FLESH dice to our backers!

If we reach our goal, the dice should be available around Valentine\u2019s Day.\nUPDATE! Funding goal achieved! Next: THE KEYS OF HELL AND DEATH\nSo here's the deal, guys: if we hit $3,000, the game will include a special supplement called THE KEYS OF HELL AND DEATH. It will take the mechanics from the main game and twist them, so your characters from THEY BECAME FLESH can soldier up for the final war in Heaven. Will you fight for God or for Lucifer\u2014 or will you risk almost certain death to fight for the cause no one expected, Humanity?\nTHE KEYS OF HELL AND DEATH will be available to everyone pledging $5 or above.\nWhat's all this, then?\nTHEY BECAME FLESH is a tabletop role-playing game about fallen angels, right after the Fall. It is a game with two Game Masters, who control God and Humanity while players take on the roles of the Fallen\u2014 angels who loved humankind best and were punished by God for defending Adam and Eve. The Fallen are pushed and manipulated by God and Humanity, and every action leads them to one of three options: forsaking humanity and the Fallen to become Angels, forsaking God to become human, or forsaking both in the name of brotherhood.\nIt was a runner-up in the 2010 Ronnies\u2014 a 24-hour game design competition\u2014 and has been in development since. Here are some nice things people said about it during the competition:\n\"The virtues of the design are pure and forceful, and so coherent in terms of Creative Agenda, with a deft touch.\"\n\"My first thought when reading your design doc was: \"This is the game that I wanted Demon: The Fallen to be.\" Every bit of fantasy in this game underscores real personal and social concerns about religion and responsibility without ever offering easy escape routes.\"\nThe funding raised by this Kickstarter will go towards the initial print run, as well as editing and art costs (so it's not all public domain woodcarvings).\nBackers don't just get the final PDF of the game\u2014 if you donate $5 or more, you'll get access to the most recent version of the PDF throughout the publication process, so you can give us feedback, get a jump-start on playing the game and make sure your name is spelled correctly in the credits.\nFor the T-shirt and hoodie, you'll be able to choose between one of two graphics\u2014 and show your allegiance to either Heaven or your Fallen brothers.

Also, look for updates here, I post new information about every week.****\nHi, welcome to this page. Let's give birth to this crazy awesome game together.\n*You can see the first final die master proposals in updates #8 and #16*\n\"Dice Age\" is a game of unbalanced, figurative, toyish, good to look at and to touch dice. It's a game of strategy and risk-taking with wacky rules between \"Uno\" and \"Magic the Gathering\" - except it's played with dice! Crazy dice... In a good way.\nFrom Proxy to Alpha edition: The dice shown here are the draft proxy version. I made them myself in my garage. The Alpha edition you are pledging for are the same in shape and color, but professionally produced and sculpted. Some details will be enhanced in the Alpha version for some sides to be more clear, and the sizes will be uniformed.\nI can tell you right away this is a powerful artifact. It was initially a piece of art, and then I developed it into a game. When I first brought them to the university cafeteria, everybody was amazed, wanted one, and couldn't guess how to play. In fact, the rules are pretty simple, but the Dice Age effect is there: You never saw this before.\nThe Crown of Gods game:\nOnce upon a long time ago...\nYou belong to the Gods that rule on top of the cosmos. You hold in your hands the ultimate might to create new planets, new dimensions, in their every detail from the infinitely small to the infinitely vast: Your power is only limited by your imagination. You practiced combining energies; the positive, negative and multicolored. And at last, you have been chosen for the highest challenge: the Crown of Gods, the divine joust to the mastering of entropy and chaos. The competition will be tough, and you will have to summon up your most advanced creation skills. But you have a secret weapon: you control hazard!\nComponents: 10 dice (of one cubic inch volume each), 1 Rulebook (20 pages), 1 awesome dice pouch with the Dice Age logo on the back.\n2 players from 10 years old and over. 3 minutes to learn, 1 game to get the hang of it.10 minutes game.\nThe theme is an epic competition for the Crown of gods at the top of our cosmos. Be ready to feel like in a deathtrap dungeon. The full rules of the Crown of Gods game are available as update #4 and the Dice age Compendium as update #5.\nParticularity: dice game using attractive unconventional dice, that can have any conceivable shape.\nOverview: On his turn, a player rolls one of his dice. One rule; never overshoot the last number rolled, or you lose all the dice you rolled in the round. The last player in the game is the winner.\nNota bene : Other games can be played with the dice. Four have been discovered so far: \"Bonide\", \"Totem\", \"the Snooker\", \"The Pitched Battle\"\nThe rules of the Totem game are available as update #17.\nThe project consists of:\nA first release of the game on the market by\nRedesigning the 23 first dice in high resolution using toy technologies.\nCasting and painting 7000 of them industrially.\nThis first release of 23 different dice (over a hundred invented today) will be made by pre-selling the sets, thus raising enough money to produce the dice in the plastic injection process and paint them in a series.\nThis first Alpha edition will be something! This kickstarter project is also a small market test and if it works, if you really want to help it, I will be able to release the next dice, the next colors, and develop the game as it should be: hundreds of different effects and thousands of different dice.\nOur parody commercial for the Adopt-a-die operation!\nUno, Hotwheels, Magic the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons are trademarks of respectively, Mattel, Inc. and Wizards of the coast, llc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Final Update", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nIt has been a long journey since the conception of these unique custom dice in my kitchen and since we launched this Kickstarter campaign through which, together, we tried to get these dice manufactured on a broader scale.\nThanks to you, we were able to redesign the game in 3D printing; develop it in China; simplify the dice and the rules to make a better product; reproduce the prototypes; propose the game to several game publishers of the world's most famous toys; and showcase the game at the most prestigious game fairs in the U.S., all in a continuous effort to launch the project in defiance of all the bumps on the road."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "Dice Age is working", "update_content": "Hi All,\nKublacon 2013 was a success for Dice Age.
